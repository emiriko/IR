Many exactly solvable models are based on Lie algebras. The pairing
interaction is important in nuclear physics and its exact solution for
identical particles in non-degenerate single-particle levels was first given by
Richardson in 1963. His solution and its generalization to Richardson-Gaudin
quasi-exactly solvable models have attracted the attention of many contemporary
researchers and resulted in the exact solution of the isovector pn-pairing
within the so(5) RG-model and the equal strength spin-isospin pn-pairing within
the so(8) RG-model. Basic properties of the RG-models are summarized and
possible applications to nuclear physics are emphasized. MSC2010
