For the next generation of radio interferometric telescopes it is of
paramount importance to incorporate wide field-of-view (WFOV) considerations in
interferometric imaging, otherwise the fidelity of reconstructed images will
suffer greatly. We extend compressed sensing techniques for interferometric
imaging to a WFOV and recover images in the spherical coordinate space in which
they naturally live, eliminating any distorting projection. The effectiveness
of the spread spectrum phenomenon, highlighted recently by one of the authors,
is enhanced when going to a WFOV, while sparsity is promoted by recovering
images directly on the sphere. Both of these properties act to improve the
quality of reconstructed interferometric images. We quantify the performance of
compressed sensing reconstruction techniques through simulations, highlighting
the superior reconstruction quality achieved by recovering interferometric
images directly on the sphere rather than the plane.
