We study a general class of PageRank optimization problems which consist in
finding an optimal outlink strategy for a web site subject to design
constraints. We consider both a continuous problem, in which one can choose the
intensity of a link, and a discrete one, in which in each page, there are
obligatory links, facultative links and forbidden links. We show that the
continuous problem, as well as its discrete variant when there are no
constraints coupling different pages, can both be modeled by constrained Markov
decision processes with ergodic reward, in which the webmaster determines the
transition probabilities of websurfers. Although the number of actions turns
out to be exponential, we show that an associated polytope of transition
measures has a concise representation, from which we deduce that the continuous
problem is solvable in polynomial time, and that the same is true for the
discrete problem when there are no coupling constraints. We also provide
efficient algorithms, adapted to very large networks. Then, we investigate the
qualitative features of optimal outlink strategies, and identify in particular
assumptions under which there exists a "master" page to which all controlled
pages should point. We report numerical results on fragments of the real web
graph.
