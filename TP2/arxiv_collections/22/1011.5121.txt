Effects of dynamical quarks on the microscopic spectrum of the Wilson Dirac
operator are analyzed by means of effective field theory. We consider the
distributions of the real modes of the Wilson Dirac operator as well as the
spectrum of the Hermitian Wilson Dirac operator, and work out the case of one
flavor in all detail. In contrast to the quenched case, the theory has a mild
sign problem that manifests itself by giving a spectral density that is not
positive definite as the spectral gap closes.
