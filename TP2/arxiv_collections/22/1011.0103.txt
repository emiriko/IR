Simulations of antiparallel reconnection have shown collimated electron jets
outflowing from the x-point, and associated highly elongated "outer electron
diffusion regions." New PIC simulations with ion/electron mass ratios as large
as 1836 show that jets are deflected towards the magnetic separatrix by
out-of-plane guide fields, Bg, as small as 0.05 times the asymptotic
reconnecting field, B0. The outer electron diffusion region is distorted and
broken up, but the diffusion rate is unchanged. These results are interpreted
in terms of electron dynamics and are compared to recent measurements of
reconnection jets in the magnetosheath.
