We propose a finite volume method on general meshes for the discretization of
a degenerate parabolic convection-reaction-diffusion equation. Equations of
this type arise in many contexts, such as the modeling of contaminant transport
in porous media. We discretize the diffusion term, which can be anisotropic and
heterogeneous, via a hybrid finite volume scheme. We construct a partially
upwind scheme for the convection term. We consider a wide range of unstructured
possibly non-matching polygonal meshes in arbitrary space dimension. The only
assumption on the mesh is that the volume elements must be star-shaped. The
scheme is fully implicit in time, it is locally conservative and robust with
respect to the P\'eclet number. We obtain a convergence result based upon a
priori estimates and the Fr\'echet--Kolmogorov compactness theorem.
