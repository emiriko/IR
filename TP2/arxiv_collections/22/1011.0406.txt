We study the stable hyperelliptic locus, i.e. the closure, in the Deligne-
Mumford moduli space of stable curves, of the locus of smooth hyperelliptic
curves. Working on a suitable blowup of the relative Hilbert scheme (of degree
2) associated to a family of stable curves, we construct a bundle map
('degree-2 Brill-Noether') from a modification of the Hodge bundle to a
tautological bundle, whose degeneracy locus is the natural lift of the stable
hyperelliptic locus plus a simple residual scheme. Using intersection theory on
Hilbert schemes and Fulton-Macpherson residual intersection theory, the class
of the structure sheaf and various other sheaves supported on the stable
hyperelliptic locus can be computed by Porteous' formula.
