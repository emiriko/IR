We present results of high resolution (~ 55000) spectral observations of 830
photometrically pre-selected candidate red giants in the magnitude range of V =
9-12. We develop a pipeline for automated determination of the stellar
atmospheric parameters from these spectra and estimate T_eff, logg, [Fe/H],
microturbulence velocity, and projected rotational velocities, vsini, for the
stars. The analysis confirms that the candidate selection procedure yielded red
giants with very high success rate. We show that most of these stars are G and
K giants with slightly subsolar metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -0.3 dex) An analysis of
Mg abundances in the sample results in consistency of the [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H]
trend with published results.
