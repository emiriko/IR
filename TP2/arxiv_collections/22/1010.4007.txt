Information security has become a cause of concern because of the electronic
eavesdropping. Capacity, robustness and invisibility are important parameters
in information hiding and are quite difficult to achieve in a single algorithm.
This paper proposes a novel steganography technique for digital color image
which achieves the purported targets. The professed methodology employs a
complete random scheme for pixel selection and embedding of data. Of the three
colour channels (Red, Green, Blue) in a given colour image, the least two
significant bits of any one of the channels of the color image is used to
channelize the embedding capacity of the remaining two channels. We have
devised three approaches to achieve various levels of our desired targets. In
the first approach, Red is the default guide but it results in localization of
MSE in the remaining two channels, which makes it slightly vulnerable. In the
second approach, user gets the liberty to select the guiding channel (Red,
Green or Blue) to guide the remaining two channels. It will increase the
robustness and imperceptibility of the embedded image however the MSE factor
will still remain as a drawback. The third approach improves the performance
factor as a cyclic methodology is employed and the guiding channel is selected
in a cyclic fashion. This ensures the uniform distribution of MSE, which gives
better robustness and imperceptibility along with enhanced embedding capacity.
The imperceptibility has been enhanced by suitably adapting optimal pixel
adjustment process (OPAP) on the stego covers.
