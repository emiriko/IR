Inference and learning of graphical models are both well-studied problems in
statistics and machine learning that have found many applications in science
and engineering. However, exact inference is intractable in general graphical
models, which suggests the problem of seeking the best approximation to a
collection of random variables within some tractable family of graphical
models. In this paper, we focus our attention on the class of planar Ising
models, for which inference is tractable using techniques of statistical
physics [Kac and Ward; Kasteleyn]. Based on these techniques and recent methods
for planarity testing and planar embedding [Chrobak and Payne], we propose a
simple greedy algorithm for learning the best planar Ising model to approximate
an arbitrary collection of binary random variables (possibly from sample data).
Given the set of all pairwise correlations among variables, we select a planar
graph and optimal planar Ising model defined on this graph to best approximate
that set of correlations. We demonstrate our method in some simulations and for
the application of modeling senate voting records.
