Amplification of magnetic field due to kinematic turbulent dynamo action is
studied in the regime of small magnetic Prandtl numbers. Such a regime is
relevant for planets and stars interiors, as well as for liquid metal
laboratory experiments. A comprehensive analysis based on the
Kazantsev-Kraichnan model is reported, which establishes the dynamo threshold
and the dynamo growth rates for varying kinetic helicity of turbulent
fluctuations. It is proposed that in contrast with the case of large magnetic
Prandtl numbers, the kinematic dynamo action at small magnetic Prandtl numbers
is significantly affected by kinetic helicity, and it can be made quite
efficient with an appropriate choice of the helicity spectrum.
