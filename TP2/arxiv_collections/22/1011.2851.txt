We use a discrete-time proportional hazards model of time to involuntary
employment termination. This model enables us to examine both the continuous
effect of the age of an employee and whether that effect has varied over time,
generalizing earlier work [Kadane and Woodworth J. Bus. Econom. Statist. 22
(2004) 182--193]. We model the log hazard surface (over age and time) as a
thin-plate spline, a Bayesian smoothness-prior implementation of penalized
likelihood methods of surface-fitting [Wahba (1990) Spline Models for
Observational Data. SIAM]. The nonlinear component of the surface has only two
parameters, smoothness and anisotropy. The first, a scale parameter, governs
the overall smoothness of the surface, and the second, anisotropy, controls the
relative smoothness over time and over age. For any fixed value of the
anisotropy parameter, the prior is equivalent to a Gaussian process with linear
drift over the time--age plane with easily computed eigenvectors and
eigenvalues that depend only on the configuration of data in the time--age
plane and the anisotropy parameter. This model has application to legal cases
in which a company is charged with disproportionately disadvantaging older
workers when deciding whom to terminate. We illustrate the application of the
modeling approach using data from an actual discrimination case.
