The interaction between the electric field, E, and spins in multi-orbital
Mott insulators is studied theoretically. We find a generic dynamical coupling
mechanism, which works for all crystal lattices and which does not involve
relativistic effects. The general form of the coupling is -T_ab E_a e_b, where
e is the `internal' electric field originating from the dynamical Berry phase
of electrons and T_ab is a tensor determined by lattice symmetry. We discuss
several effects of this interaction: (i) an unusual electron spin resonance
induced by an oscillating electric field, (ii) the displacement of spin
textures in an applied electric field, and (iii) the resonant absorption of
circularly polarized light by Skyrmions, magnetic bubbles, and magnetic
vortices.
