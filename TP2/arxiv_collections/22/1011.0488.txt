We give a stochastic extension of the Brane Calculus, along the lines of
recent work by Cardelli and Mardare. In this presentation, the semantics of a
Brane process is a measure of the stochastic distribution of possible
derivations. To this end, we first introduce a labelled transition system for
Brane Calculus, proving its adequacy w.r.t. the usual reduction semantics.
Then, brane systems are presented as Markov processes over the measurable space
generated by terms up-to syntactic congruence, and where the measures are
indexed by the actions of this new LTS. Finally, we provide a SOS presentation
of this stochastic semantics, which is compositional and syntax-driven.
