Injection of material from a core-collapse supernova into the solar system's
already-formed disk is one proposed mechanism for producing the short-lived
radionuclides, such as 26Al and 41Ca, inferred from isotopic studies of
meteorites to have existed in the solar nebula. This hypothesis has recently
been challenged on the basis that the injection of enough supernova material to
match the meteoritic abundances of 26Al and 41Ca would produce large,
measureable, and unobserved collateral effects on oxygen isotopes. Here we
calculate again the shifts in oxygen isotopes due to injection of supernova
material in the solar nebula, using a variety of nucleosynthetic conditions of
our own progenitor explosions. Unlike previous studies of this type, we also
consider the effect of non-homogeneity in abundance distribution of the
nucleosynthesis products after the explosion. We calculate the shifts in oxygen
isotopes due to injection of sufficient supernova material to produce the
meteoritic abundances of 26Al and 41Ca, and analyze the predicted shifts in
detail for compatibility with meteoritic data. We find that the range in
possible isotopic shifts is considerable and sensitive to parameters such as
progenitor mass and anisotropy of the explosion; however, a small number of
compatible scenarios do exist. Because of the wide range of outcomes and the
sensitivity of isotopic yields to assumed conditions, it is difficult to
constrain the supernova that may have led to injection of 26Al in the solar
nebula. Conversely, we argue that the existence of viable counterexamples
demonstrates that it is premature to use oxygen isotopes to rule out injection
of 26Al and 41Ca into the solar nebula protoplanetary disk by a nearby
supernova.
