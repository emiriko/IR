The interactions between the f_0(980) and a_0(980) scalar resonances and the
lightest pseudoscalar mesons are studied. We first obtain the interacting
kernels, without including any ad hoc free parameter, because the lightest
scalar resonances are dynamically generated. These kernels are unitarized,
giving the final amplitudes, which generate pseudoscalar resonances, associated
with the K(1460), \pi(1300), \pi(1800), \eta(1475) and X(1835). We also
consider the exotic channels with I=3/2 and I^G=1^+ quantum numbers. The former
could be also resonant in agreement with a previous prediction.
