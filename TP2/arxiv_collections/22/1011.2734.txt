We consider a process where a spin hops across a discrete network and at
certain sites couples to static spins. While this setting is implementable in
various scenarios (e.g quantum dots or coupled cavities) the physics of such
processes is still basically unknown. Here, we take a first step along this
line by scrutinizing a two-site and a three-site lattices, each with two static
spins. Despite a generally complex dynamics occurs, we show a regime such that
the spin dynamics is described by an effective three-spin chain. Tasks such as
entanglement generation and quantum state transfer can be achieved accordingly.
