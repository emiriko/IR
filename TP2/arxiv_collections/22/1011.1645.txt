We exhibit a remarkable connection between sixth equation of Painleve list
and infinite families of explicitly uniformizable algebraic curves. Fuchsian
equations, congruences for group transformations, differential calculus of
functions and differentials on corresponding Riemann surfaces, Abelian
integrals, analytic connections (generalizations of Chazy's equations), and
other attributes of uniformization can be obtained for these curves. As
byproducts of the theory, we establish relations between Picard-Hitchin's
curves, hyperelliptic curves, punctured tori, Heun's equations, and the famous
differential equation which Apery used to prove the irrationality of Riemann's
zeta(3).
