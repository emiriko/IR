We prove irreducibility for the space of cyclic covers of fixed numerical
type between smooth projective curves, and also for the space of cyclic covers
of prime order and of fixed numerical-combinatorial type between moduli-stable
projective curves. As an application we describe the irreducible components of
the singular locus of the compactified moduli space of curves $\bar{\mahfrak
M_g}$, extending the work of Cornalba, who described the irreducible components
of the singular locus of the moduli space of curves $\mahfrak M_g}$.
