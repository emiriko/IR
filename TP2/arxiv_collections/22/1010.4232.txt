We provide a theory of the deflection of polar and non-polar rotating
molecules by inhomogeneous static electric field. Rainbow-like features in the
angular distribution of the scattered molecules are analyzed in detail.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that one may efficiently control the deflection
process with the help of short and strong femtosecond laser pulses. In
particular the deflection process may by turned-off by a proper excitation, and
the angular dispersion of the deflected molecules can be substantially reduced.
We study the problem both classically and quantum mechanically, taking into
account the effects of strong deflecting field on the molecular rotations. In
both treatments we arrive at the same conclusions. The suggested control scheme
paves the way for many applications involving molecular focusing, guiding, and
trapping by inhomogeneous fields.
