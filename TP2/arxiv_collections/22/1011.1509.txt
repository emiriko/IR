The energies of the excited states of the Nucleon, Delta and Omega are
computed in lattice QCD, using two light quarks and one strange quark on
anisotropic lattices. The calculations are performed at three values of the
pion mass: 392(4), 438(3) and 521(3) MeV. We employ the variational method with
a basis of about ten interpolating operators enabling six energies to be
distinguished clearly in each irreducible representation of the octahedral
group. We compare our calculations of nucleon excited states with the low-lying
experimental spectrum. There is reasonable agreement for the pattern of states.
