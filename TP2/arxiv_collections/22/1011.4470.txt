We extend designs of perfect lenses to the focussing of surface plasmon
polaritons (SPPs) propagating at the interface between two anisotropic media of
opposite permittivity sign. We identify the role played by the components of
anisotropic and heterogeneous tensors of permittivity and permeability, deduced
from a coordinate transformation, in the dispersion relation governing
propagation of SPPs. We illustrate our theory with three-dimensional finite
element computations for focussing of SPPs by perfect flat and cylindrical
lenses.
