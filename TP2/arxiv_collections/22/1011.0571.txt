We investigate potentials between pairs of static-light mesons in Nf=2
Lattice QCD, in different spin channels. The question of attraction and
repulsion is particularly interesting with respect to the X(3872) charmonium
state and charged candidates such as the Z+(4430). We employ the
nonperturbatively improved Sheikholeslami-Wohlert fermion and the Wilson gauge
actions at a lattice spacing a approx. 0.084 fm and a pseudoscalar mass mPS
approx. 760 MeV. We use stochastic all-to-all propagator techniques, improved
by a hopping parameter expansion. The analysis is based on the variational
method, utilizing various source and sink interpolators.
