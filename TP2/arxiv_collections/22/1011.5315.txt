A phenomenological model for the 'hidden order' transition in the heavy
Fermion material URu$_2$Si$_2$ is introduced. The 'hidden order' is identified
as an incommensurate, momentum-carrying hybridization between the light hole
band and the heavy electron band. This modulated hybridization appears after a
Fano hybridization at higher temperatures takes place. We focus on the
hybridization wave as the order parameter in URu$_2$Si$_2$ and possibly other
materials with similar band structures. The model is qualitatively consistent
with numerous experimental results obtained from e.g. neutron scattering and
scanning tunneling microscopy. Specifically, we find a gap-like feature in the
density of states and the appearance of features at an incommensurate vector
$Q^*\sim 0.6 \pi/a_0$. Finally, the model allows us to make various predictions
which are amenable to current experiments.
