It is shown that Born-Infeld gravity --a high energy deformation of Einstein
gravity-- removes the singularities of a cosmic string. The respective vacuum
solution results to be free of conical singularity and closed timelike curves.
The space ends at a minimal circle where the curvature invariants vanish; but
this circle cannot be reached in a finite proper time.
