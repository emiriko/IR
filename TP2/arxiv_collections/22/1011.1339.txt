We derive Fourier's law for a completely coherent quasi one--dimensional
chaotic quantum system coupled locally to two heat baths at different
temperatures. We solve the master equation to first order in the temperature
difference. We show that the heat conductance can be expressed as a
thermodynamic equilibrium coefficient taken at some intermediate temperature.
We use that expression to show that for temperatures large compared to the mean
level spacing of the system, the heat conductance is inversely proportional to
the level density and, thus, inversely proportional to the length of the
system.
