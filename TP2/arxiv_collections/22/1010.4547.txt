The low-temperature kinetics of the strongly correlated electron liquid
inhabiting a solid is analyzed. It is demonstrated that a softly damped branch
of transverse zero sound emerges when several bands cross the Fermi surface
simultaneously near a quantum critical point at which the density of states
diverges. Suppression of the damping of this branch occurs due to a mechanism
analogous to that affecting the phonon mode in solids at room temperature,
giving rise to a classical regime of transport at extremely low temperatures in
the strongly correlated Fermi system.
