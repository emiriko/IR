We propose an experimental technique to generate large amplitude coherent
phonons with irradiation of THz-rate pump pulses and to study the dynamics of
phase transition in GeTe ferroelectrics. When a single pump pulse irradiates
the sample at various pump power densities, the frequency of the soft phonon
decreases sub-linearly and saturates at higher pump powers. By contrast, when
THz-rate pump pulse sequence irradiates the sample at matched time intervals to
forcibly drive the oscillation, a large red-shift of the phonon frequency is
observed without saturation effects. After excitation with a four pump pulse
sequence, the coherent soft phonon becomes strongly damped leading to a near
critical damping condition. This condition indicates that the lattice is driven
to a precursor state of the phase transition.
