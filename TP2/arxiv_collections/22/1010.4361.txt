The diffuse high-latitude H-alpha background is widely believed to be
predominantly the result of in-situ recombination of ionized hydrogen in the
warm interstellar medium of the Galaxy. Instead, we show that both a
substantial fraction of the diffuse high-latitude H-alpha intensity in regions
dominated by Galactic cirrus dust and much of the variance in the high-latitude
H-alpha background are the result of scattering by interstellar dust of H-alpha
photons originating elsewhere in the Galaxy. We provide an empirical relation,
which relates the expected scattered H-alpha intensity to the IRAS 100um
diffuse background intensity, applicable to about 81% of the entire sky. The
assumption commonly made in reductions of CMB observations, namely that the
observed all-sky map of diffuse H-alpha light is a suitable template for
Galactic free-free foreground emission, is found to be in need of
reexamination.
