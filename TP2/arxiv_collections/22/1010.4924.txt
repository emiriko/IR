We re-examined the angular dependence of the radiation from the intrinsic
Josephson junctions in rectangular mesas of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$,
in order to determine if the cavity mode part of the radiation arises from
waves across the width $w$ or along the length $\ell$ of the mesas, associated
with ``hot spots'' [Wang {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 105}, 057002
(2010)]. We derived analytic forms for the angular dependence expected in both
cases for a general cavity mode in which the width of the mesa corresponds to
an integer multiple of one-half the wavelength of the radiation. Assuming the
coherent radiation from the $ac$ Josephson current source and the cavity
magnetic surface current density source combine incoherently, fits to the data
of Kadowaki {\it et al.} [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 79}, 023703 (2010)] on a mesa
with mean $\ell/w=5.17$ for both wave directions using two models for the
incoherent combination were made, which correspond to standing and traveling
waves, respectively. The results suggest that the combined output from the
uniform $ac$ Josephson current source plus a cavity wave forming along the
rectangle length is equally probable as that of the combined output from the
uniform $ac$ Josephson current plus a cavity wave across the width. However,
for mesas in which $n\ell/2w$ is integral, where $n$ is the index of the
rectangular TM$^z_{n,0}$ mode, it is shown that standing cavity mode waves
along the length of the mesa do not radiate in the $xz$ plane perpendicular to
the length of the mesa, suggesting experiments on such mesas could help to
resolve the question.
