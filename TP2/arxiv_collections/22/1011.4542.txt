We consider a vectorial, asymptotically free gauge theory and analyze the
effect of higher-loop corrections to the beta function on the evolution of the
theory from the ultraviolet to the infrared. We study the case in which the
theory contains $N_f$ copies of a fermion transforming according to the
fundamental representation and several higher-dimensional representations of
the gauge group. We also calculate higher-loop values of the anomalous
dimension of the mass, $\gamma_m$ of $\bar\psi\psi$ at the infrared zero of the
beta function. We find that for a given theory, the values of $\gamma_m$
calculated to three- and four-loop order, and evaluated at the infrared zero
computed to the same order, tend to be somewhat smaller than the value
calculated to two-loop order. The results are compared with recent lattice
simulations.
