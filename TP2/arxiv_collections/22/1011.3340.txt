Hard X-ray detectors in space are prone to background signals due to the
ubiquitous cosmic rays and cosmic diffuse background radiation that
continuously bombards the satellites which carry the detectors. In general, the
background intensity depends on the space environment as well as the material
surrounding the detectors. Understanding the behavior of the background noise
in the detector is very important to extract the precise source information
from the detector data. In this paper, we carry out Monte Carlo simulations
using the GEANT-4 toolkit to estimate the prompt background noise measured with
the detectors of the RT-2 Experiment onboard the CORONAS-PHOTON satellite.
