The channeling of the ion recoiling after a collision with a WIMP changes the
ionization signal in direct detection experiments, producing a larger
scintillation or ionization signal than otherwise expected. We give estimates
of the fraction of channeled recoiling ions in solid Xe, Ar and Ne crystals
using analytic models produced since the 1960's and 70's to describe channeling
and blocking effects.
