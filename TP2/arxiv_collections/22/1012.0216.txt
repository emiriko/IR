Negatively charged Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV$^-$) centers in diamond produced by
ion implantation often show properties different from NVs created during the
crystal growth. We observe that NVs created from nitrogen ions with four
different energies (30-300 keV) show much shorter electron spin coherence time
$T_2$ compared to the "natural" NVs and we could find any dependence of $T_2$
on the implantation energy. Moreover, we also find out that about 10% of them
show switching from NV$^-$to NV$^0$. We develop a method to increase $T_2$ of
single NV$^-$ centers by annealing the sample at $t=1200 {\circ}$C whereas at
the same time the fraction of the NVs showing discharging is greatly reduced.
