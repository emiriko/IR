We consider the discrete-time threshold-$\theta \ge 2$ contact process on a
random r-regular graph on n vertices. In this process, a vertex with at least
\theta occupied neighbors at time t will be occupied at time t+1 with
probability p, and vacant otherwise. We show that if $\theta \ge 2$ and $r \ge
\theta+2$, $\epsilon_1$ is small and p is at least $p_1(\epsilon_1)$, then
starting from all vertices occupied the fraction of occupied vertices stays
above $1-2\epsilon_1$ up to time $\exp(\gamma_1(r)n)$ with probability at least
$1 - \exp(-\gamma_1(r)n)$. In the other direction, we show that for $p_2 < 1$
there is an $\epsilon_2(p_2)>0$ so that if $p \le p_2$ and the number of
occupied vertices in the initial configuration is at most $\epsilon_2(p_2)n$,
then with high probability all vertices are vacant at time $C_2(p_2) \log(n)$.
These two conclusions imply that on the random r-regular graph there cannot be
a quasi-stationary distribution with density of occupied vertices between 0 and
$\epsilon_2(p_1)$, and allow us to conclude that the process on the r-tree has
a first order phase transition.
