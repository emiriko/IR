Exactly solvable models of ultracold Fermi gases are reviewed via their
thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz solution. Analytical and numerical results are
obtained for the thermodynamics and ground state properties of two- and
three-component one-dimensional attractive fermions with population imbalance.
New results for the universal finite temperature corrections are given for the
two-component model. For the three-component model, numerical solution of the
dressed energy equations confirm that the analytical expressions for the
critical fields and the resulting phase diagrams at zero temperature are highly
accurate in the strong coupling regime. The results provide a precise
description of the quantum phases and universal thermodynamics which are
applicable to experiments with cold fermionic atoms confined to one-dimensional
tubes.
