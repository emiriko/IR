We study ways to enhance the sensitivity and dynamic tuning range of the
fundamental inductor-capacitor (LC) resonance in split ring resonators (SRRs)
by controlling the aspect ratio of the SRRs and their substrate thickness. We
conclude that both factors can significantly affect the LC resonance. We show
that metafilms consisting of low height SRRs on a thin substrate are most
sensitive to changes in their dielectric environment and thus show excellent
potential for sensing applications.
