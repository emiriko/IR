We demonstrate a controllable electromagnetic wave reflector/absorber for
different polarizations with metamaterial involving electromagnetic resonant
structures coupled with diodes. Through biasing at different voltages to turn
ON and OFF the diodes, we are able to switch the structure between nearly total
reflection and total absorption of a particularly polarized incident wave. By
arranging orthogonally orientated resonant cells, the metamaterial can react to
different polarized waves by selectively biasing the corresponding diodes. Both
numerical simulations and microwave measurements have verified the performance.
