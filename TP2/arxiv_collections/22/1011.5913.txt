Neutrino-induced pion and photon production from nucleons and nuclei are
important for the interpretation of neutrino-oscillation experiments, and these
processes are potential backgrounds in the MiniBooNE experiment [A. A.
Aquilar-Arevalo \textit{et al.} (MiniBooNE Collaboration), Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\
{\bf 100}, 032301 (2008)]. Pion and photon production are investigated at
intermediate energies, where the $\Delta$ resonance becomes important. The
Lorentz-covariant effective field theory contains nucleons, pions, Deltas,
isoscalar scalar ($\sigma$) and vector ($\omega$) fields, and isovector vector
($\rho$) fields. The lagrangian exhibits a nonlinear realization of
(approximate) $SU(2)_L \otimes SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and incorporates vector
meson dominance. Power counting for vertices and Feynman diagrams involving the
$\Delta$ is explained. Because of the built-in symmetries, the vector currents
are automatically conserved, and the axial-vector currents satisfy PCAC. The
irrelevance of so-called off-shell $\Delta$ couplings and the structure of the
dressed $\Delta$ propagator, which has a pole only in the spin-3/2 channel, are
discussed. To calibrate the axial-vector transition current $(N\!
\leftrightarrow \Delta)$, pion production from the nucleon is used as a
benchmark and compared to bubble-chamber data from Argonne and Brookhaven
National Laboratories. At low energies, the convergence of our power-counting
scheme is investigated, and next-to-leading-order tree-level corrections are
found to be very small.
