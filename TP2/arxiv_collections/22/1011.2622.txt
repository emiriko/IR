We describe a new class of exact square integrable solutions of the Pauli and
Dirac equation in rotating electromagnetic fields. Solutions obtained by
putting equations in the stationary form with help of a coordinate
transformation corresponding to the transition into a rotating frame. The
transformation is assumed to be Galilean one however a non-Galilean
transformation is of particular interest for such solutions. Obtained
solutions, especially of Dirac's equation, are valid for arbitrary values of
parameters and may be tested experimentally.
