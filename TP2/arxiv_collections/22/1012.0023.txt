Pumping lemmas are created to prove that given languages are not belong to
certain language classes. There are several known pumping lemmas for the whole
class and some special classes of the context-free languages. In this paper we
prove new, interesting pumping lemmas for special linear and context-free
language classes. Some of them can be used to pump regular languages in two
place simultaneously. Other lemma can be used to pump context-free languages in
arbitrary many places.
