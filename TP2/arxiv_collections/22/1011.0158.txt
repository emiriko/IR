Measurements of W and Z cross-sections in pp collisions at ECM = 7 TeV at the
Large Hadron Collider are reported from the ATLAS experiment. From an
observation of 118 leptonic W candidates, the inclusive W cross-section times
leptonic branching fraction is measured as [9.3 \pm 0.9(stat) \pm 0.6(syst) \pm
1.0(lumi)] nb. The result for the Z boson is [0.83 \pm 0.07(stat) \pm
0.06(syst) \pm 0.09(lumi)] nb. These results agree with theoretical
expectations from NNLO QCD.
