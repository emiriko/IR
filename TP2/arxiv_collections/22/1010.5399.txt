In this review, I discuss briefly stringent tests of Lorentz-violating
quantum space-time foam models inspired from String/Brane theories, provided by
studies of high energy Photons from intense celestial sources, such as Active
Galactic Nuclei or Gamma Ray Bursts. The theoretical models predict
modifications to the radiation dispersion relations, which are quadratically
suppressed by the string mass scale, and time delays in the arrival times of
photons (assumed to be emitted more or less simultaneously from the source),
which are proportional to the photon energy, so that the more energetic photons
arrive later. Although the astrophysics at the source of these energetic
photons is still not understood, and such non simultaneous arrivals, that have
been observed recently, might well be due to non simultaneous emission as a
result of conventional physics effects, nevertheless, rather surprisingly, the
observed time delays can also fit excellently the stringy space-time foam
scenarios, provided the space-time defect foam is inhomogeneous. The key
features of the model, that allow it to evade a plethora of astrophysical
constraints on Lorentz violation, in sharp contrast to other field-theoretic
Lorentz-violating models of quantum gravity, are: (i) transparency of the foam
to electrons and in general charged matter, (ii) absence of birefringence
effects and (iii) a breakdown of the local effective lagrangian formalism.
