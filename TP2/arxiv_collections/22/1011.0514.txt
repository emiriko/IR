A theory of charge transport in semiconductors in the presence of basal
stacking faults is developed. It is shown that the presence of basal stacking
faults leads to anisotropy in carrier transport. The theory is applied to
carrier transport in non-polar GaN films consisting of a large number BSFs, and
the result is compared with experimental data.
