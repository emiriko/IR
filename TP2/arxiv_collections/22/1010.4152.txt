Molecular dynamics simulation is applied to Poiseuille flow of liquid methane
in planar graphite channels, covering channel diameters between 3 and 135 nm.
On this length scale, a transition is found between the regime where local
ordering induced by the wall dominates the entire system and larger channel
diameters where the influence of boundary slip is still present, but of a more
limited extent. The validity of Darcy's law for pressure-driven flow through
porous media is not affected by the transition between these regimes.
