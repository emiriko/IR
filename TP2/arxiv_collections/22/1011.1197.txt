The recent Fermi observation of GRB 080916C shows that the bright photosphere
emission associated with a putative fireball is missing, which suggests a
Poynting-flux-dominated outflow. We propose a model of gamma-ray burst (GRB)
prompt emission in the Poynting-flux-dominated regime, namely, the
Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model.
It is envisaged that the GRB central engine launches an intermittent,
magnetically-dominated wind, and that in the GRB emission region, the ejecta is
still moderately magnetized. Similar to the internal shock (IS) model, the
mini-shells interact internally at the traditional internal shock radius. Most
of these early collision have little energy dissipation, but serve to distort
the ordered magnetic field lines. At a certain point, the distortion of
magnetic field configuration reaches the critical condition to allow fast
reconnection seeds to occur, which induce relativistic MHD turbulence in the
interaction regions. The turbulence further distorts field lines easing
additional magnetic reconnections, resulting in a runway release of the stored
magnetic field energy (an ICMART event). Particles accelerated in the ICMART
region radiate synchrotron photons that power the observed gamma-rays. Each
ICMART event corresponds to a broad pulse in the GRB lightcurve, and a GRB is
composed of multiple ICMART events. This model retains the merits of the IS and
other models, but may overcome several difficulties/issues faced by the IS
model (e.g. low efficiency, fast cooling, electron number excess,
Amati/Yonetoku relation inconsistency, and missing bright photosphere). It
predicts two-component variability time scales, and a decreasing Ep and
polarization degree during each ICMART event. The model may be applied to most
Fermi LAT GRBs that have time-resolved, featureless Band-function spectra
(abridged).
