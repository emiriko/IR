We consider current observational constraints on the electromagnetic charge
of dark matter. The velocity dependence of the scattering cross-section through
the photon gives rise to qualitatively different constraints than standard dark
matter scattering through massive force carriers. In particular, recombination
epoch observations of dark matter density perturbations require that
$\epsilon$, the ratio of the dark matter to electronic charge, is less than
$10^{-6}$ for $m_X = 1 GeV$, rising to $\epsilon < 10^{-4}$ for $m_X = 10 TeV$.
Though naively one would expect that dark matter carrying a charge well below
this constraint could still give rise to large scattering in current direct
detection experiments, we show that charged dark matter particles that could be
detected with upcoming experiments are expected to be evacuated from the
Galactic disk by the Galactic magnetic fields and supernova shock waves, and
hence will not give rise to a signal. Thus dark matter with a small charge is
likely not a source of a signal in current or upcoming dark matter direct
detection experiments.
