We study some features of the confining string connecting a quark-anti-quark
pair in Yang-Mills theory. Monte Carlo investigations of the flux tube between
two static quarks in the fundamental representation show that its thickness
increases with the separation of the sources. The collected numerical data in
(2+1)-d SU(2) Yang-Mills theory are in very good quantitative agreement with
the next-to-leading order formula derived from the systematic low-energy
effective theory of the confining string. At zero temperature, we observe the
predicted logarithmic broadening. At finite and low temperature, the flux tube
thickness is expected to broaden linearly. We also verify that prediction,
finding an excellent agreement with the analytic expression. No adjustable
parameter has been used to fit the numerical data. Then we investigate the
confining strings connecting color sources in larger representations of the
gauge group. Concerning stable strings -- the k-strings -- we study the Luscher
term of the fundamental string and of the 2-string in (2+1)-d SU(4) Yang-Mills
theory. We find that, at large separation between the two static sources, the
coefficient of the Luscher term of the 2-string appraoches the value -pi/24.
However, at intermediate distances, there are relevant deviations. This result
may suggest that, for SU(N) at large N, a different intermediate string regime
could set in. For unstable strings, in (2+1)-d SU(2) Yang-Mills theory we
investigate the decay between two different string states and the multiple
decays of the confining string connecting color sources in large
representations. The multiple decays result from the progressive partial
screening of the color sources.
