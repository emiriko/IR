I show that the spectrum and morphology of a recent Fermi-LAT observation of
the Galaxy center are consistent with a millisecond pulsar population in the
nuclear Central stellar cluster of the Milky Way. The Galaxy Center gamma-ray
spectrum is consistent with the spectrum of four of eight globular clusters
that have been detected in the gamma-ray. A dark matter annihilation
interpretation cannot be ruled out, though no unique features exist that would
require this conclusion.
