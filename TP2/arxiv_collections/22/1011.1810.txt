The nonperturbative role of multiple forward scattering for Coulomb focusing
in mid-infrared laser fields and its dependence on a laser intensity and
wavelength are investigated for low-energy photoelectrons at above-threshold
ionization. We show that high-order rescattering events can have comparable
contributions to the Coulomb focusing and the effective number of rescattering
depends weakly on laser parameters in the classical regime. However, the
relative contribution of the forward scattering to the Coulomb focusing and the
Coulomb focusing in total decrease with the rise of the laser intensity and
wavelength.
