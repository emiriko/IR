To generate the lepton and quark masses in the left-right symmetric models,
we can consider a universal seesaw scenario by integrating out heavy fermion
singlets which have the Yukawa couplings with the fermion and Higgs doublets.
The universal seesaw scenario can also accommodate the leptogenesis with
Majorana or Dirac neutrinos. We show the fermion singlets can obtain their
heavy masses from certain global symmetry breaking, which is driven by one
complex scalar singlet or two. The global symmetry can be identified to the
Peccei-Quinn symmetry since it is mediated to the standard model quarks at tree
and/or loop level.
