We study the limiting thermodynamic behavior of the normalized sums of spins
in multi-species Curie-Weiss models. We find sufficient conditions for the
limiting random vector to be Gaussian (or to have an exponential distribution
of higher order) and compute the covariance matrix in terms of model
parameters.
