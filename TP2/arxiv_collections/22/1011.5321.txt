We report unfiltered CCD photometry of the first confirmed superoutburst of
the recently discovered dwarf nova, SDSS J083931.35+282824.0 in April 2010.
From a quiescence magnitude of ~19.8 it rose to 14.0, an outburst amplitude of
at least 5.8 magnitudes. Only the plateau phase of the outburst was observed
during which superhumps with peak-to-peak amplitude of up to 0.28 magnitudes
were present, confirming this to be an SU UMa type dwarf nova. The mean
superhump period was Psh = 0.07836(2) during the first 3 days and this
subsequently decreased to 0.07800(3) d. Analysis of the data revealed tentative
evidence for an orbital period Porb = 0.07531(25) d. The fractional superhump
period excess was epsilon = 0.039(6), which is consistent with other dwarf
novae of similar orbital period.
