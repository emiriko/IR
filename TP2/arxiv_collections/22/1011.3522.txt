The Large Hadron Collider has a potential to probe the scale of left-right
symmetry restoration and the associated lepton number violation. Moreover, it
offers hope of measuring the right-handed leptonic mixing matrix. We show how
this, together with constraints from lepton flavor violating processes, can be
used to make predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay. We illustrate this
deep connection in the case of the type-II seesaw.
