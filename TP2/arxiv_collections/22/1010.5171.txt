A new notion of stochastic ordering is introduced to compare multivariate
stochastic risk models with respect to extreme portfolio losses. In the
framework of multivariate regular variation comparison criteria are derived in
terms of ordering conditions on the spectral measures, which allows for
analytical or numerical verification in practical applications. Additional
comparison criteria in terms of further stochastic orderings are derived. The
application examples include worst case and best case scenarios, elliptically
contoured distributions, and multivariate regularly varying models with Gumbel,
Archimedean, and Galambos copulas.
