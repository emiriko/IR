Extensions of the Standard Model often predict new chiral interactions for
top quark, which will contribute to top quark spin correlation and polarization
in $t\bar{t}$ production at the LHC. In this work, under the constraints from
the current Tevatron measurements, a comparative study of the spin correlation
and polarization is performed in three new physics models: the minimal
supersymmetric model without R-parity (RPV-MSSM), the third-generation enhanced
left-right model and the axigluon model. We find that the polarization
asymmetry may be enhanced to the accessible level in all these models while the
correction to the spin correlation may be detectable in the axigluon model and
the RPV-MSSM with $\lambda"$ couplings.
