We study the phenomenology of the type-II seesaw model at a linear e^-e^-
collider. We show that the process e^-e^- \rightarrow alpha^-beta^- (alpha,
beta = e, mu, tau being charged leptons) mediated by a doubly charged scalar is
very sensitive to the neutrino parameters, in particular the absolute neutrino
mass scale and the Majorana CP-violating phases. We identify the regions in
parameter space in which appreciable collider signatures in the channel with
two like-sign muons in the final state are possible. This includes Higgs
triplet masses beyond the reach of the LHC.
