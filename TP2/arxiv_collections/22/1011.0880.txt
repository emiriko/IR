Photoproduction of \eta mesons off light nuclei (d, 3He, 7Li) has been
measured at the tagged photon beam of the Mainz MAMI accelerator with the
combined Crystal Ball/TAPS detection system. Special attention was given to the
threshold behavior of the reactions in view of possible indications for the
formation of (quasi-) bound \eta -nucleus states, so-called \eta -mesic nuclei.
A very strong threshold enhancement of coherent \eta photoproduction off 3He
was found and coherent \eta photoproduction off 7Li was observed for the first
time. Preliminary results will be discussed.
