PbS quantum dots are promising active emitters for use with high-quality Si
nanophotonic devices in the telecommunications-band. Measurements of low
quantum dot densities are limited both because of low fluorescence levels and
the challenges of single photon detection at these wavelengths. Here, we report
on methods using a fiber taper waveguide to efficiently extract PbS quantum dot
photoluminescence. Temperature dependent ensemble measurements reveal an
increase in emitted photons concomitant with an increase in excited-state
lifetime from 58.9 ns at 293 K to 657 ns at 40 K. Measurements are also
performed on quantum dots on high-$Q$ ($>10^5$) microdisks using
cavity-resonant, pulsed excitation.
