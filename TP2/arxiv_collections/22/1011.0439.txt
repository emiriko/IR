Transiting planet discoveries have largely been restricted to the
short-period or low-periastron distance regimes due to the bias inherent in the
geometric transit probability. Through the refinement of planetary orbital
parameters, and hence reducing the size of transit windows, long-period planets
become feasible targets for photometric follow-up. Here we describe the TERMS
project that is monitoring these host stars at predicted transit times.
