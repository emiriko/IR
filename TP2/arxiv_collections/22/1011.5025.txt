We investigate the lowest weight representations of the super Schrodinger
algebras introduced by Duval and Horvathy. This is done by the same procedure
as the semisimple Lie algebras. Namely, all singular vectors within the Verma
modules are constructed explicitly then irreducibility of the associated
quotient modules is studied again by the use of singular vectors. We present
the classification of irreducible Verma modules for the super Schrodinger
algebras in (1+1) and (2+1) dimensional spacetime with N = 1, 2 extensions.
