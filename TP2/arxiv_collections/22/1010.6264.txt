Recent experimental investigations have revealed a non-Maxwellian absorption
pattern in the rheological spectra of actin gels, which was interpreted in
terms of transient bonds. Here we examine the consequences of reversible
crosslinking on the apparent linear spectra of biopolymer solutions
theoretically. For a schematic model consisting of a reversibly crosslinked
power-law fluid we obtain a simple analytical prediction for the position of
the absorption peak, which is backed up by a numerical evaluation of the
inelastic glassy wormlike chain model. This establishes bond breaking as a
nonlinear non-equilibrium effect that can already be significant for very small
driving amplitudes. Our results may be useful for inferring binding affinities
and reaction rates of biochemical crosslinkers from rheological measurements of
{\it in-vitro} reconstituted cytoskeletal gels.
