We propose a strategy to demonstrate the transition from the quantum Zeno
effect (QZE) to the anti-Zeno effect (AZE) by modulating the central frequency
of the cavity mode. Our results are obtained without using the rotating wave
approximation (RWA), and the initial state (a dressed state) is easy to
prepare. When the central frequency of the cavity mode is resonant with the
qubit energy level spacing, the normalized decay rate of the qubit is lower
than 1, which manifests the QZE. However, when the cavity frequency is detuned
from resonance, the normalized decay rate becomes larger than 1, which
corresponds to the AZE. The change from the QZE to the AZE, by just varying the
central frequency of the cavity mode, should allow to distinguish these two
different effects. Moreover, we find that in the presence of both qubit's
intrinsic bath and the cavity bath, the emergence of the QZE and the AZE
behaviors relies not only on the match between the qubit energy level spacing
and the central frequency of the cavity mode, but also on the coupling strength
between the qubit and the cavity mode.
