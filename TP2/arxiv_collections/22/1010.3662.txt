We present a detailed theoretical and experimental study of Feshbach
resonances in the 6Li-40K mixture. Particular attention is given to the
inelastic scattering properties, which have not been considered before. As an
important example, we thoroughly investigate both elastic and inelastic
scattering properties of a resonance that occurs near 155 G. Our theoretical
predictions based on a coupled channels calculation are found in excellent
agreement with the experimental results. We also present theoretical results on
the molecular state that underlies the 155G resonance, in particular concerning
its lifetime against spontaneous dissociation. We then present a survey of
resonances in the system, fully characterizing the corresponding elastic and
inelastic scattering properties. This provides the essential information to
identify optimum resonances for applications relying on interaction control in
this Fermi-Fermi mixture.
