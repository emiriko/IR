Ghirardi, Grassi, Butterfield, and Fleming have previously argued that two
distinct formulations of dynamical reduction (GRW) theories have distinct
non-local properties: one (the "non-linear" formulation) violates Parameter
Independence while the other (the "linear + cooking" formulation) violates
Outcome Independence. The claim is then that, since theories violating Outcome
Independence are compatible with relativity in a way that theories violating
Parameter Independence are not, the "linear + cooking" dynamical reduction
theories hold the key to reconciling quantum non-locality with relativity. I
review and assess this claim, arguing that, while ultimately misleading, there
is an interesting and important lesson to be extracted.
