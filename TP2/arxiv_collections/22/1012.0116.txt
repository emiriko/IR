We develop a holographic (bottom-up) gravity model for QCD to understand the
connection between the peak in the trace anomaly and the magnitude of heavy
quark energy loss in a strongly-coupled plasma. The potential of the scalar
field on the gravity side is constructed to reproduce some properties of QCD at
finite temperature and its parameters are constrained by fitting lattice gauge
theory results. The energy loss of heavy quarks (as predicted by the
holographic model) is found to be strongly sensitive to the medium properties.
