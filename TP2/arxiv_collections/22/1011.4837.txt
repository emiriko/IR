We have found evidence for interaction between a standing and a traveling
shock in the jet of the blazar CTA 102. Our result is based in the study of the
spectral evolution of the turnover frequency-turnover flux density plane. The
radio/mm light curves were taken during a major radio outburst in April 2006.
