We study an accurate method for the lattice calculation of the B*Bpi Coupling
in the static limit, paying particular attention to excited state
contamination. As this coupling is a parameter of the heavy meson chiral
Lagrangian, it is useful for constraining the chiral behaviour of various
observables in B-physics. We present a precise study of the continuum limit in
the quenched approximation and preliminary results with 2 flavours of improved
Wilson quarks (using CLS lattices) for pion masses down to around 250 MeV. With
dynamical quarks both the lattice spacing and the light quark mass dependences
are found to be very weak. We can quote g = 0.51(2) for the continuum value in
the chiral limit, where the error will be reduced when a more complete analysis
has been performed.
