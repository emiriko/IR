The relation between standard Loop Quantum Cosmology and full Loop Quantum
Gravity fails already at the first nontrivial step: The configuration space of
Loop Quantum Cosmology can not be embedded into the configuration space of full
Loop Quantum Gravity due to a topological obstruction. We investigate this
obstruction in detail, because many topological obstructions are the source of
physical effects. For this we derive the topology of a large class of subspaces
of the Loop Quantum Gravity configuration space. This allows us to find the
extension of the standard Loop Quantum Cosmology configuration space that
admits an embedding in agreement with Fleischhack:2010. We then construct the
embedding for flat FRW Loop Quantum Cosmology and find that it coincides
asymptotically with standard LQC.
