Digital planetariums can provide a broader range of educational experiences
than the more classical planetariums that use star-balls. This is because of
their ability to project images, content from current research and the 3D
distribution of the stars and galaxies. While there are hundreds of
planetariums in the country the reason that few of these are full digital is
the cost. In collaboration with Microsoft Research (MSR) we have developed a
way to digitize existing planetariums for approximately \$40,000 using software
freely available. We describe here how off the shelf equipment, together with
MSR's WorldWide Telescope client can provide a rich and truly interactive
experience. This will enable students and the public to pan though
multi-wavelength full-sky scientific data sets, explore 3d visualizations of
our Solar System (including trajectories of millions of minor planets), near-by
stars, and the SDSS galaxy catalog.
