Abundance anomalies have been determined at the surface of many field and
open cluster A and F dwarfs. These abundance anomalies are most likely caused
by microscopic diffusion at work within the stable envelopes of A stars.
However diffusion can be counteracted by several other mixing processes such as
convection, rotational mixing and mass loss. We present a short review of the
surface abundance patterns of A/F stars in the Pleiades (100 Myr), Coma
Berenices (450 Myr) and Hyades (650 Myr) open clusters. Real star-to-star
variations of the abundances were found for several chemical elements in the A
dwarfs in these clusters. The derived abundances are then compared to
evolutionary models from the Montreal group. These comparisons strongly suggest
the occurence of hydrodynamical processes at play within the radiative zones of
these stars and hindering the effects of microscopic diffusion (mixing
processes/mass loss). In the frame of Gaia mission, simulations are presented
that predict the number of A stars and open clusters that Gaia will observe in
the Galaxy.
