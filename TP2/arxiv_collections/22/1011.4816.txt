IRAS 20126+4104 is one of the best candidates for a high-mass (proto)star
surrounded by an accretion disk. Such a fact may be used to set constraints on
theories of high-mass star formation, but requires confirmation that the mass
and luminosity of IRAS 20126+4104 are indeed typical of a B0.5 star, which in
turn requires an accurate estimate of the distance. We used the Very Long
Baseline Array and the European VLBI Network to observe the 22.2 GHz water and
6.7 GHz methanol masers in IRAS 20126+4104 at a number of epochs suitably
distributed in time. The absolute positions of the maser features were
established with respect to reference quasars, which allowed us to derive
absolute proper motions. From the parallax of the water masers we obtain a
distance of 1.64 \pm 0.05 kpc, which is very similar to the value adopted so
far in the literature (1.7 kpc) and confirms that IRAS 20126+4104 is a
high-mass (proto)star. From the methanol masers we derive the component in the
plane of the sky of the systemic velocity of the disk+star system (-16 km/s in
right-ascension and +7.6 km/s in declination). Accurate knowledge of the
distance and systemic velocity allows us to improve on the model fit to the
water maser jet presented in a previous study. Finally, we identify two groups
of methanol maser features, one undergoing rotation in the disk and possibly
distributed along a narrow ring centered on the star, the other characterised
by relative proper motions indicating that the features are moving away from
the disk, perpendicular to it. We speculate that the latter group might be
tracing the disk material marginally entrained by the jet.
