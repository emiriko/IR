Given a graded sequence of ideals (a_m) on a smooth variety $X$ having finite
log canonical threshold, suppose that for every m we have a divisor E_m over X
that computes the log canonical threshold of a_m, and such that the log
discrepancies of the divisors E_m are bounded. We show that in this case the
set of divisors E_m is finite.
