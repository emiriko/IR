This investigation uses the excellent HARPS radial velocity measurements of
CoRoT-7 to re-determine the planet masses and to explore techniques able to
determine mass and elements of planets discovered around active stars when the
relative variation of the radial velocity due to the star activity cannot be
considered as just noise and can exceed the variation due to the planets. The
main technique used here is a self-consistent version of the high-pass filter
used by Queloz et al. (2009) in the first mass determination of CoRoT-7b and
CoRoT-7c. The results are compared to those given by two alternative
techniques: (1) The approach proposed by Hatzes et al. (2010) using only those
nights in which 2 or 3 observations were done; (2) A pure Fourier analysis. In
all cases, the eccentricities are taken equal to zero as indicated by the study
of the tidal evolution of the system; the periods are also kept fixed at the
values given by Queloz et al. Only the observations done in the time interval
BJD 2,454,847 - 873 are used because they include many nights with multiple
observations; otherwise it is not possible to separate the effects of the
rotation fourth harmonic (5.91d = Prot/4) from the alias of the orbital period
of CoRoT-7b (0.853585 d). The results of the various approaches are combined to
give for the planet masses the values 8.0 \pm 1.2 MEarth for CoRoT-7b and 13.6
\pm 1.4 MEarth for CoRoT 7c. An estimation of the variation of the radial
velocity of the star due to its activity is also given.The results obtained
with 3 different approaches agree to give masses larger than those in previous
determinations. From the existing internal structure models they indicate that
CoRoT-7b is a much denser super-Earth. The bulk density is 11 \pm 3.5 g.cm-3 .
CoRoT-7b may be rocky with a large iron core.
