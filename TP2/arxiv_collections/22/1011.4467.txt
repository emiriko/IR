I review what is known and surmised about magnetic fields in space, from our
Milky Way environment to the distant Universe beyond the GZK horizon. This
includes our gradually improving specification of the CR propagation
environment within the Milky Way, the nearby universe within ~ 10 Mpc, and out
to the GZK "horizon" near 100Mpc. Within these modest intergalactic distances
we hope for some pointing capability for CR energies above ~ 1019eV, and for
different species, as the observed event numbers accumulate in this range over
the near future. The wider intergalactic propagation environment beyond the GZK
horizon is also discussed. It sets a useful context for understanding other
types of anisotropies, including sources of HE photons, neutrinos, leptons,
etc. and for understanding relative time of arrival differences, such as those
produced by lepton-photon cascades in the intergalactic medium. The global
layout of potential UHECR sources is likely connected with the large scale
structure (LSS) of cosmic filaments and voids, at least within ~ 100 Mpc.
Possible source candidates for UHECR production are discussed, at various
redshift ranges up to z ~ 2. Candidates discussed are AGN-jet sources,
Centaurus A and more distant giant radio galaxies, and the possible indirect
role of galaxies having a strong magnetized CR gas outflow that is driven by
"starbursts" involving multiple supernovae and other energetic stellar events.
Various analysis methods are described. I also discuss the current state of the
results and near-future prospects for improving them.
