Understanding the detailed production and hadronization mechanisms for heavy
quarkonia and their modification in a nuclear environment presents one of the
major challenges in QCD. Calculations including nuclear-modified parton
distribution functions (nPDFs) and fitting of break-up cross sections
(sigma_breakup) as parameters have been successful at describing many features
of J/psi modification in proton(deuteron)-nucleus collisions. In this paper, we
extend these calculations to explore different geometric dependencies of the
modification and confront them with new experimental results from the PHENIX
experiment. We find that no combination of nPDFs and sigma_breakup, regardless
of the nPDF parameter set and the assumed geometric dependence, can
simultaneously describe the entire rapidity and centrality dependence of J/psi
modifications in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. We also compare the
data with coherence calculations and find them unable to describe the full
rapidity and centrality dependence as well. We discuss how these calculations
might be extended and further tested, in addition to discussing other physics
mechanisms including initial-state parton energy loss.
