Previous formulations of transformation optics have generally been restricted
to transformations from relatively simple initial media, such as the vacuum,
because of limitations due to their non-covariance. I show that a completely
covariant approach enables arbitrary transformations from arbitrarily complex
initial linear dielectrics.
