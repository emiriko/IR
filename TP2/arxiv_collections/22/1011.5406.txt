We extend a general-relativistic ideal magneto-hydrodynamical code to include
the effects of elasticity. Using this numerical tool we analyse the
magneto-elastic oscillations of highly magnetised neutron stars (magnetars). In
simulations without magnetic field we are able to recover the purely crustal
shear oscillations within an accuracy of about a few per cent. For dipole
magnetic fields between 5 x 10^13 and 10^15 G the Alfv\'en oscillations become
modified substantially by the presence of the crust. Those quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) split into three families: Lower QPOs near the equator,
Edge QPOs related to the last open field line and Upper QPOs at larger distance
from the equator. Edge QPOs are called so because they are related to an edge
in the corresponding Alfv\'en continuum. The Upper QPOs are of the same kind,
while the Lower QPOs are turning-point QPOs, related to a turning point in the
continuous spectrum.
