How often can we expect a Major League Baseball team to score at least 20
runs in a single game? Considered a rare event in baseball, the outcome of
scoring at least 20 runs in a game has occurred 224 times during regular season
games since 1901 in the American and National Leagues. Each outcome is modeled
as a Poisson process; the time of occurrence of one of these events does not
affect the next future occurrence. Using various distributions, probabilities
of events are generated, goodness-of-fit tests are conducted, and predictions
of future events are offered. The statistical package R is employed for
analysis.
