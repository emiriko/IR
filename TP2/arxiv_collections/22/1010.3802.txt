The question of what physical mechanisms shape planetary nebulae into their
observed morphologies remains open. However, intensified efforts since the last

yielded some excellent results. In this review we concentrate on those
developments that have taken place in the last three years, with emphasis on
results obtained since the review by De Marco (2009).
