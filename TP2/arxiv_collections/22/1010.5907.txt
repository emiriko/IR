We investigate the use of the Multiple Optimised Parameter Estimation and
Data compression algorithm (MOPED) for data compression and faster evaluation
of likelihood functions. Since MOPED only guarantees maintaining the Fisher
matrix of the likelihood at a chosen point, multimodal and some degenerate
distributions will present a problem. We present examples of scenarios in which
MOPED does faithfully represent the true likelihood but also cases in which it
does not. Through these examples, we aim to define a set of criteria for which
MOPED will accurately represent the likelihood and hence may be used to obtain
a significant reduction in the time needed to calculate it. These criteria may
involve the evaluation of the full likelihood function for comparison.
