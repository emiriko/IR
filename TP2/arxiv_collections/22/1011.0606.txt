An important parameter to characterize the scattering matrix S for
quantum-chaotic scattering is the width Gamma_{corr} of the S-matrix
autocorrelation function. We show that the "Weisskopf estimate" d/(2pi) sum_c
T_c (where d is the mean resonance spacing, T_c with 0 <= T_c <= 1 the
"transmission coefficient" in channel c and where the sum runs over all
channels) provides a very good approximation to Gamma_{corr} even when the
number of channels is small. That same conclusion applies also to the
cross-section correlation function.
