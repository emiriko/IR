We analyze the dynamics of a class of cosmological solutions of the
Einstein-Vlasov equations. These equations describe an ensemble of
collisionless particles (which represent galaxies or clusters of galaxies) that
interact gravitatively through Einstein's equations of general relativity. The
cosmological models we consider are spatially homogeneous, of Bianchi type IX,
and locally rotationally symmetric (LRS). We prove that generic solutions
exhibit an oscillatory approach toward the singularities (the "big bang" in the
past and the "big crunch" in the future); this is in contrast to the behavior
of Einstein-vacuum or Einstein-Euler solutions. To establish this result we
make use of dynamical systems theory; we introduce dimensionless dynamical
variables that are defined on a compact state space; in this formulation the
oscillatory behavior of generic solutions is represented by an approach to
heteroclinic cycles.
