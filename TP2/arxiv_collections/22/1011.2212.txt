We sharpen constraints related to hypercharge flux in F-theory GUTs that
possess U(1) symmetries and argue that they arise as a consequence of
4-dimensional anomaly cancellation. This gives a physical explanation for all
restrictions that were observed in spectral cover models while demonstrating
that the phenomenological implications for a well-motivated set of models are
not tied to any particular formalism.
