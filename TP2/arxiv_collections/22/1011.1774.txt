We consider a model for the evolution of the surnames distribution under a
gender-equality measurement presently discussed in the Spanish parliament (the
children take the surname of the father or the mother according to alphabetical
order). We quantify how this would bias the alphabetical distribution of
surnames, and analyze its effect on the present distribution of the surnames in
Spain.
