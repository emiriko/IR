We study asymptotic jumping numbers for graded sequences of ideals, and show
that every such invariant is computed by a suitable real valuation of the
function field. We conjecture that every valuation that computes an asymptotic
jumping number is necessarily quasi-monomial. This conjecture holds in
dimension two. In general, we reduce it to the case of affine space and to
graded sequences of valuation ideals. Along the way, we study the structure of
a suitable valuation space.
