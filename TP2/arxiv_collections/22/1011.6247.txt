This article gives results on several jet algorithms in electron-positron
annihilation: Considered are the exclusive sequential recombination algorithms
Durham, Geneva, Jade-E0 and Cambridge, which are typically used in
electron-positron annihilation. In addition also inclusive jet algorithms are
studied. Results are provided for the inclusive sequential recombination
algorithms Durham, Aachen and anti-kt, as well as the infrared-safe cone
algorithm SISCone. The results are obtained in perturbative QCD and are NNNLO
for the two-jet rates, NNLO for the three-jet rates, NLO for the four-jet rates
and LO for the five-jet rates.
