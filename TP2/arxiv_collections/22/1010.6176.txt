I propose a new mechanism of intense high-frequency electromagnetic wave
generation by spatially uniform stacked Josephson junctions at zero magnetic
field. The ac-Josephson effect converts the dc-bias voltage into
ac-supercurrent, however, in the absence of spatial variation of Josephson
phase difference, does not provide dc-to-ac power conversion, needed for
emission of electromagnetic waves. Here I demonstrate that at geometrical
resonance conditions, the spatial homogeneity of phase can be spontaneously
broken by appearance of breathers (bound fluxon-antifluxon pairs), facilitating
effective dc-to-ac power conversion. The proposed mechanism explains all major
features of recently observed THz radiation from large area
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ mesa structures.
