In a previous Note we established a necessary and sufficient condition for a
multivariate Weyl--Heisenberg system G({\phi},{\Lambda}) to be a frame when the
window is a generalized Gaussian (squeezed coherent state) and {\Lambda} a
rectangular lattice. In this Note we extend this result to lattices of the type
${\Lambda}=MZ^{2n}$ where M is a positive definite symmetric matrix.
