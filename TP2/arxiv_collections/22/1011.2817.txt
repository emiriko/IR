The paper studies a particular class of analytic solutions for the
Generalized Ohm's Law, approached by means of the so called formal powers of
the Pseudoanalytic Function Theory. The reader will find a description of the
electrical current distributions inside bounded domains, within inhomogeneous
media, and their corresponding electric potentials near the boundary. Finally,
it is described a technique for approaching separable-variables conductivity
functions, a requisite when applying the constructive methods posed in this
work.
