Spectroscopic measurements are presented using the PID350 pixelated gamma
radiation detectors. A high-speed data acquisition system has been developed in
order to reduce the data loss during the data reading in case of a high flux of
photons. A data analysis framework has been developed in order to improve the
resolution of the acquired energy spectra, using specific calibration
parameters for each PID350's pixel. Three PID350 detectors have been used to
construct a stacked prototype system and spectroscopic measurements have been
performed in order to test the ability of the prototype to localize radioactive
sources.
