We have performed the submillimeter and millimeter observations in CO lines
toward supernova remnant (SNR) IC443. CO molecular shell is well coincident
with the partial shell of the SNR detected in radio continuum observations. The
broad emission lines and three 1720-MHz OH masers were detected in CO molecular
shell. The present observations have provided further evidence in support of
the interaction between the SNR and the adjoining molecular clouds (MCs). The
total mass of the MCs is 9.26*10^{3} sun masses. The integrated CO line
intensity ratio I(CO(3-2))/I(CO(2-1)) for the whole molecular cloud is between
0.79 and 3.40. The average value is 1.58, which is much higher than previous
measurements of individual Galactic MCs. Higher line ratios imply that shocks
have driven into the MCs. We conclude that high I(CO(3-2))/I(CO(2-1)) is
identified as one good signature of SNR-MCs interacting system. Based on $IRAS$
Point Source Catalog and 2MASS near-infrared database, 12 protostellar objects
and 1666 young stellar objects (YSOs) candidates (including 154 CTTSs and 419
HAeBe stars) are selected. In the interacting regions, the significant
enhancement of the number of protostellar objects and YSOs indicates the
presence of some recently formed stars. After comparing the characteristic
timescales of star formation with the age of IC443, we conclude that the
protostellar objects and YSOs candidates are not triggered by IC443. For the
age of stellar winds shell, we have performed calculation on the basis of
stellar winds shell expansion model. The results and analysis suggest that the
formation of these stars may be triggered by the stellar winds of IC443
progenitor.
