We report the status of nucleon structure calculations on the (2+1)-flavor
dynamical domain-wall fermions ensembles with pion masses as low as 180 and 250
MeV on a lattice with about 4.6 fm spatial extent. A combination of the
Iwasaki+dislocation- suppressing-determinant-ratio (I+DSDR) gauge action and
DWF fermion action allows us to generate these ensembles at cutoff of about 1.4
GeV while keeping the residual mass small. Nucleon source Gaussian smearing has
been optimized. Preliminary nucleon mass estimates are 0.98 and 1.05 GeV.
