We study the evolution of the size - stellar mass relation for a large
spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the GOODs North field up to $z \sim 3.5$.
The sizes of the galaxies are measured from $\textit{K}_{s}$-band images
(corresponding to rest-frame optical/NIR) from the Subaru 8m telescope. We
reproduce earlier results based on photometric redshifts that the sizes of
galaxies at a given mass evolve with redshift. Specifically, we compare sizes
of UV-bright galaxies at a range of redshifts: Lyman break galaxies (LBGs)
selected through the U-drop technique ($z \sim 2.5-3.5$), BM/BX galaxies at $z
\sim 1.5-2.5$, and GALEX LBGs at low redshift ($z \sim 0.6-1.5$). The median
sizes of these UV-bright galaxies evolve as $(1+z)^{-1.11\pm0.13}$ between $z
\sim 0.5-3.5$. The UV-bright galaxies are significantly larger than quiescent
galaxies at the same mass and redshift by $0.45\pm0.09$ dex. We also verify the
correlation between color and stellar mass density of galaxies to high
redshifts. The sizes of sub-mm galaxies in the same field are measured and
compared with BM/BX galaxies. We find that median half-light radii of SMGs is
$2.90 \pm 0.45$ kpc and there is little difference in their size distribution
to the UV-bright star forming galaxies.
