This paper discusses the observed at rotation curves of galaxies in the
context of noncommutative geometry. The energy density of such a geometry is
diffused throughout a region due to the uncertainty encoded in the coordinate
commutator. This intrinsic property appears to be sufficient for producing
stable circular orbits, as well as attractive gravity, without the need for
dark matter.
