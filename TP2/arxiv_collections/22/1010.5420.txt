We propose that concurrently magnetic and ferroelectric, i.e. multiferroic,
compounds endowed with electrically-active magnetic excitations
(electromagnons) provide a key to produce large directional dichroism for long
wavelengths of light. By exploiting the control of ferroelectric polarization
and magnetization in a multiferroic oxide Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$, we demonstrate
the realization of such a directional light-switch function at terahertz
frequecies in resonance with the electromagnon absorption. Our results imply
that this hidden potential is present in a broad variety of multiferroics.
