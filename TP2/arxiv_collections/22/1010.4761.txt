In this work we study a realization of moduli spaces of framed quiver
representations as Grassmannians of submodules devised by Marcus Reineke.
Obtained is a generalization of this construction for finite dimensional
associative algebras and for quivers with oriented cycles. As an application we
get an explicit realization of fibers for the moduli space bundle over the
categorical quotient for the quiver $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$.
