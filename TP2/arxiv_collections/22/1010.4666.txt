We introduce a quantum version of the Game of Life and we use it to study the
emergence of complexity in a quantum world. We show that the quantum evolution
displays signatures of complex behaviour similar to the classical one, however
a regime exists, where the quantum Game of Life creates more complexity, in
terms of diversity, with respect to the corresponding classical reversible one.
