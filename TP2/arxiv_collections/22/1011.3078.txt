It is argued that the Heisenberg picture of standard quantum mechanics does
not save Einstein locality as claimed in Deutsch and Hayden (2000). In
particular, the EPR-type correlations that DH obtain by comparing two qubits in
a local manner are shown to exist before that comparison. In view of this
result, the local comparison argument would appear to ineffective in supporting
their locality claim.
