The Barkhausen jumps or avalanches in magnetic domain-walls motion between
succesive pinned configurations, due the competition among magnetic external
driving force and substrum quenched disorder, appear in bulk materials and thin
films. We introduce a model based in rules for the domain wall evolution of
ferromagnetic media with exchange or short-range interactions, that include
disorder and driving force effects. We simulate in 2-dimensions with Monte
Carlo dynamics, calculate numerically distributions of sizes and durations of
the jumps and find power-law critical behavior. The avalanche-size exponent is
in excellent agreement with experimental results for thin films and is close to
predictions of the other models, such as like random-field and random-bond
disorder, or functional renormalization group. The model allows us to review
current issues in the study of avalanches motion of the magnetic domain walls
in thin films with ferromagnetic interactions and opens a new approach to
describe these materials with dipolar or long-range interactions.
