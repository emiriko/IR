In this paper, a novel far-field plasmonic resonance enhanced
nanoparticle-seeded Particle Image Velocimetry (nPIV) has been demonstrated to
measure the velocity profile in a micro channel. Chemically synthesized silver
nanoparticles have been used to seed the flow in the micro channel. By using
Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA), plasmonic resonance enhanced light
scattering has been calculated for spherical silver nanoparticles with
diameters ranging from 15nm to 200nm. Optimum scattering wavelength is
specified for the nanoparticles in two media: water and air. The
diffraction-limited plasmonic resonance enhanced images of silver nanoparticles
at different diameters have been recorded and analyzed. By using standard PIV
techniques, the velocity profile within the micro channel has been determined
from the images.
