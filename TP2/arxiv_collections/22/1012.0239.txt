Predictions from Hartree-Fock (HF), Popov (P), Yukalov-Yukalova (YY) and
$t$-matrix approximations regarding the thermodynamics from the normal to the
BEC phase in weakly interacting Bose gases are considered. By analyzing the
dependence of the chemical potential $\mu$ on temperature $T$ and particle
density $\rho$ we show that none of them predicts a second-order phase
transition as required by symmetry-breaking general considerations. In this
work we find that the isothermal compressibility $\kappa_{T}$ predicted by
these theories does not diverge at criticality as expected in a true
second-order phase transition. Moreover the isotherms $\mu=\mu(\rho,T)$
typically exhibit a non-singled valued behavior in the vicinity of the BEC
transition, a feature forbidden by general thermodynamic principles. This
behavior can be avoided if a first order phase transition is appealed. The
facts described above show that although these mean field approximations give
correct results near zero temperature they are endowed with thermodynamic
anomalies in the vicinity of the BEC transition. We address the implications of
these results in the interpretation of current experiments with ultracold
trapped alkali gases.
