We investigate the effect of knot type on the properties of a ring polymer
confined to a slit. For relatively wide slits, the more complex the knot, the
more the force exerted by the polymer on the walls is decreased compared to an
unknotted polymer of the same length. For more narrow slits the opposite is
true. The crossover between these two regimes is, to first order, at smaller
slit width for more complex knots. However, knot topology can affect these
trends in subtle ways. Besides the force exerted by the polymers, we also study
other quantities such as the monomer-density distribution across the slit and
the anisotropic radius of gyration.
