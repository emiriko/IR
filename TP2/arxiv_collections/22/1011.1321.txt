Propositional Projection Temporal Logic (PPTL) is a useful formalism for
reasoning about period of time in hardware and software systems and can handle
both sequential and parallel compositions. In this paper, based on discrete
time Markov chains, we investigate the probabilistic model checking approach
for PPTL towards verifying arbitrary linear-time properties. We first define a
normal form graph, denoted by NFG_inf, to capture the infinite paths of PPTL
formulas. Then we present an algorithm to generate the NFG_inf. Since
discrete-time Markov chains are the deterministic probabilistic models, we
further give an algorithm to determinize and minimize the nondeterministic
NFG_inf following the Safra's construction.
