Using first-principles calculations, we explore the possibility of
functionalized graphene as high performance two-dimensional spintronics device.
Graphene functionalized with O on one side and H on the other side in the chair
conformation is found to be a ferromagnetic metal with a spin-filter efficiency
up to 85% at finite bias. The ground state of graphene semi-functionalized with
F in the chair conformation is an antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and we
construct a magnetoresistive device from it by introducing a magnetic field to
stabilize its ferromagnetic metallic state. The resulting room-temperature
magnetoresistance is up to 5400%, which is one order of magnitude larger than
the available experimental values.
