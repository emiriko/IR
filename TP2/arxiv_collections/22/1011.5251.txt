We find that the amplitude of the $R_{xx}$ radiation-induced
magnetoresistance oscillations in GaAs/AlGaAs system grows nonlinearly as $A
\propto P^{\alpha}$ where $A$ is the amplitude and the exponent $\alpha < 1$.
%, with $\alpha \rightarrow 1/2$ in %the low temperature limit. This striking
result can be explained with the radiation-driven electron orbits model, which
suggests that the amplitude of resistance oscillations depends linearly on the
radiation electric field, and therefore on the square root of the power, $P$.
We also study how this sub-linear power law varies with lattice temperature and
radiation frequency.
