This expository paper is a tribute to Ekkehart Kr\"oner's results on the
intrinsic non-Riemannian geometrical nature of a single crystal filled with
point and/or line defects. A new perspective on this old theory is proposed,
intended to contribute to the debate around the still open Kr\"oner's question:
"what are the dynamical variables of our theory?"
