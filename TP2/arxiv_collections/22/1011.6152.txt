By using the zero-phonon line emission of an individual organic molecule, we
realized a source of indistinguishable single photons in the near infrared. A
Hong-Ou-Mandel interference experiment is performed and a two-photon
coalescence probability of higher than 50% at 2 K is obtained. The contribution
of the temperature-dependent dephasing processes to the two-photon interference
contrast is studied. We show that the molecule delivers nearly ideal
indistinguishable single photons at the lowest temperatures when the dephasing
is nearly lifetime limited. This source is used to generate post-selected
polarization-entangled photon pairs, as a test-bench for applications in
quantum information.
