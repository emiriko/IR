Previous ground based observations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 78 revealed a
double set of emission lines, similar to those seen in several AGN from recent
surveys. Are the double lines due to two AGN with different radial velocities
in the same galaxy, or are they due to mass outflows from a single AGN?We
present a study of the outflowing ionized gas in the resolved narrow-line
region (NLR) of Mrk 78 using observations from Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS) and Faint Object Camera (FOC) aboard the Hubble Space
Telescope(HST) as part of an ongoing project to determine the kinematics and
geometries of active galactic nuclei (AGN) outflows. From the spectroscopic
information, we deter- mined the fundamental geometry of the outflow via our
kinematics modeling program by recreating radial velocities to fit those seen
in four different STIS slit positions. We determined that the double emission
lines seen in ground-based spectra are due to an asymmetric distribution of
outflowing gas in the NLR. By successfully fitting a model for a single AGN to
Mrk 78, we show that it is possible to explain double emission lines with
radial velocity offsets seen in AGN similar to Mrk 78 without requiring dual
supermassive black holes.
