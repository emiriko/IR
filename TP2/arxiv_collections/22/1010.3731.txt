Chemical reaction rates often depend strongly on stereodynamics, namely the
orientation and movement of molecules in three-dimensional space. An ultracold
molecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime
for chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external
electric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is
strictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a
trapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules. In an external electric field, these
exothermic and barrierless bimolecular reactions, KRb+KRb -> K2+Rb2, occur at a
rate that rises steeply with increasing dipole moment. Here we show that the
quantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress
the bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We
use an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a
quasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along
the tight confinement direction. With the combination of sufficiently tight
confinement and Fermi statistics of the molecules, two polar molecules can
approach each other only in a "side-by-side" collision, where the chemical
reaction rate is suppressed by the repulsive dipole-dipole interaction. We show
that the suppression of the bimolecular reaction rate requires quantum-state
control of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the molecules.
The suppression of chemical reactions for polar molecules in a
quasi-two-dimensional trap opens the way for investigation of a dipolar
molecular quantum gas. Because of the strong, long-range character of the
dipole-dipole interactions, such a gas brings fundamentally new abilities to
quantum-gas-based studies of strongly correlated many-body physics, where
quantum phase transitions and new states of matter can emerge.
