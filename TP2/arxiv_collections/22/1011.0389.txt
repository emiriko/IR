We have characterized a new Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) probe based on an
iron filled carbon nanotube (FeCNT) using MFM imaging on permalloy (Py) disks
saturated in a high magnetic field perpendicular to the disk plane. The
experimental data are accurately modeled by describing the FeCNT probe as
having a single magnetic monopole at its tip whose effective magnetic charge is
determined by the diameter of the iron wire enclosed in the carbon nanotube and
its saturation magnetization 4 \pi M_s ~ 2.2 x 10^4 G. A magnetic monopole
probe enables quantitative measurements of the magnetic field gradient close to
the sample surface. The lateral resolution is defined by the diameter of the
iron wire ~15 nm and the probe-sample separation. As a demonstration, the
magnetic field gradients close to the surface of a Py dot in domain and vortex
states were imaged.
