We study theoretically dynamical phases of vortices in superconducting films
with arrays of obstacles. By performing a series of molecular dynamics
simulations and analytical calculations, we demonstrate the existence of a
phase of soliton-like vortex-density waves appearing in a wide range of
parameters. These waves are formed by a self-assembled phase separation process
induced by strongly nonlinear density fluctuations of the moving vortex matter
above a certain critical driving current. At high vortex concentrations, the
waves move at an approximately current-independent speed resulting in a wide
plateau in the voltage-current characteristics. At stronger drives, the vortex
system enters into a fully jammed (zero-voltage) phase. By combining ac and dc
drives, the interplay between the vortex-density-wave and jammed phases leads
to the observation of negative absolute mobility of vortices, which induces the
superconducting film into a negative resistance state.
