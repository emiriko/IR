We perform a Dalitz plot analysis of about 100,000 Ds+ decays to K+ K- pi+
and measure the complex amplitudes of the intermediate resonances which
contribute to this decay mode. We also measure the relative branching fractions
of Ds+ --> K+ K+ pi- and Ds+ --> K+ K+ K-. For this analysis we use a 384 fb-1
data sample, recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy
e+e- collider running at center-of-mass energies near 10.58 GeV.
