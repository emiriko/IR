A quartic, self-interacting potential in the induced gravity framework is
known to have a pure de Sitter attractor for the homogeneous mode. In order to
obtain non-zero slow roll parameters we therefore study the quantum
back-reaction of the scalar and the tensor perturbations on such a homogeneous
dynamics. The results are then compared with inflationary observables in order
to constrain the parameters of the model.
