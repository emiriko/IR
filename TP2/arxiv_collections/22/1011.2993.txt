We consider new signatures of WIMPless dark matter, particularly those which
can be used to test models with low dark matter mass. We focus on detection
prospects at hadron colliders through the production of new heavy QCD-coupled
particles, which decay to WIMPless dark matter plus jets. We find that the
Tevatron can probe a significant fraction of the low mass parameter space with
data already taken, and the LHC will have even better detection prospects with
its first physics run.
