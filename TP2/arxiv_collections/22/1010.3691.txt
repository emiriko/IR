A hard-sphere (HS) Bose gas in a trap is investigated at finite temperatures
in the weakly-interacting regime and its thermodynamic properties are evaluated
using the static fluctuation approximation (SFA). The energies are calculated
with a second-quantized many-body Hamiltonian and a harmonic oscillator wave
function. The specific heat capacity, internal energy, pressure, entropy and
the Bose-Einstein (BE) occupation number of the system are determined as
functions of temperature and for various values of interaction strength and
number of particles. It is found that the number of particles plays a more
profound role in the determination of the thermodynamic properties of the
system than the HS diameter characterizing the interaction, that the critical
temperature drops with the increase of the repulsion between the bosons, and
that the fluctuations in the energy are much smaller than the energy itself in
the weakly-interacting regime.
