Trigger efficiencies at BES III were determined for both the J/psi and psi'
data taking of 2009. Both dedicated runs and physics datasets are used;
efficiencies are presented for Bhabha-scattering events, generic hadronic decay
events involving charged tracks, dimuon events and psi' -> pi+pi-J/psi, J/psi
-> l+l- events (l an electron or muon). The efficiencies are found to lie well
above 99% for all relevant physics cases, thus fulfilling the BES III design
specifications.
