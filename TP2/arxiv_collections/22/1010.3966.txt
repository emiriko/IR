The paper presents our opinion on the investigations and results of various
kind of vibrational spectra of crystal violet (CV). After our analysis of the
published spectra we came to conclusion, that the assignment of vibrations in
this molecule remains questionable. Some experimental and calculations data
permit us to conclude, that the vibrational bands in the SEHR spectra of CV
contain the bands, caused by vibrations with and irreducible representations,
that strongly confirm our idea about the main reason of surface enhanced
optical processes and SEHRS in particular-the strong dipole and quadrupole
light-molecule interactions.
