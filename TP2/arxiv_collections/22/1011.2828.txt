The Higgs boson of the Standard model is described by a set of off-diagonal
components of the multidimensional metric tensor, as well as the gauge fields.
In the low-energy limit, the basic properties of the Higgs boson are
reproduced, including the shape of the potential and interactions with the
gauge fields of the electroweak part of the Standard model.
