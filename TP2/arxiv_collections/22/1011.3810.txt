For any $S\subset [n]$, we compute the probability that the subgraph of
$\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$ induced by $S$ is a given graph $H$ on the vertex set $S$.
The result holds for any $d=o(n^{1/3})$ and is further extended to
$\mathcal{G}_{{\bf d}}$, the probability space of random graphs with a given
degree sequence $\bf d$.
