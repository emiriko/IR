Bright single and binary stars were observed at the 4.1-m telescope with a
fast electron-multiplication camera in the regime of partial turbulence
correction by the visible-light adaptive optics system. We compare the angular
resolution achieved by simple averaging of AO-corrected images (long-exposure),
selection and re-centering (shift-and-add or "lucky" imaging) and speckle
interferometry. The effect of partial AO correction, vibrations, and image
post-processing on the attained resolution is shown. Potential usefulness of
these techniques is evaluated for reaching the diffraction limit in
ground-based optical imaging. Measurements of 75 binary stars obtained during
these tests are given and objects of special interest are discussed. We report
tentative resolution of the astrometric companion to Zeta Aqr B. A concept of
advanced high-resolution camera is outlined.
