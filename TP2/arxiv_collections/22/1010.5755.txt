Future proposed satellite missions as Euclid can offer the opportunity to
test general relativity on cosmic scales through mapping of the galaxy weak
lensing signal. In this paper we forecast the ability of these experiments to
constrain modified gravity scenarios as those predicted by scalar-tensor and
$f(R)$ theories. We found that Euclid will improve constraints expected from
the PLANCK satellite on these modified gravity models by two orders of
magnitude. We discuss parameter degeneracies and the possible biases introduced
by modified gravity.
