Maximally entangled states (MES) represent a valuable resource in quantum
information processing. In $N$-qubit systems the MES are $N$-GHZ states, i.e.
the collection of $\ket{GHZ_N}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00...0}+\ket{11...1})$
and its local unitary (LU) equivalences. While it is well-known that such
states are uniquely stabilized by $N$ commuting observables, in this Letter we
consider the minimum number of non-commuting observables needed to characterize
an $N$-qubit MES as the unique common eigenstate. Here, we prove that in this
general case, any $N$-GHZ state can be uniquely stabilized by only two
observables. Thus, for the task of MES certification, only two correlated
measurements are required with each party observing the spin of his/her system
along one of two directions.
