Central exclusive production (CEP) processes in high-energy hadron collisions
offer a very promising framework for studying both novel aspects of QCD and new
physics signals. We report on the results of a theoretical study of the CEP of
heavy quarkonia (chi and eta) at the Tevatron, RHIC and LHC. These processes
provide important information on the physics of bound states and can probe the
current ideas and methods of QCD, such as effective field theories and lattice
QCD.
