The paper deals with a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic universe filled
with perfect fluid and dark energy components. The two sources are assumed to
interact minimally together with a special law of variation for the average
Hubble's parameter in order to solve the Einstein's field equations. The law
yields two explicit forms of the scale factor governing the Bianchi-V
space-time and constant values of deceleration parameter. The role of dark
energy with variable equation of state parameter has been studied in detail in
the evolution of Bianchi-V universe. It has been found that dark energy
dominates the Universe at the present epoch, which is consistent with the
observations. The Universe achieves flatness after the dominance of dark
energy. The physical behavior of the Universe has been discussed in detail.
