Studies of element abundances in stars are of fundamental interest for their
impact in a wide astrophysical context, from our understanding of galactic
chemistry and its evolution, to their effect on models of stellar interiors, to
the influence of the composition of material in young stellar environments on
the planet formation process. We review recent results of studies of abundance
properties of X-ray emitting plasmas in stars, ranging from the corona of the
Sun and other solar-like stars, to pre-main sequence low-mass stars, and to
early-type stars. We discuss the status of our understanding of abundance
patterns in stellar X-ray plasmas, and recent advances made possible by
accurate diagnostics now accessible thanks to the high resolution X-ray
spectroscopy with Chandra and XMM-Newton.
