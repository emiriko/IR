Context. Mass loss of ~0.1-0.3 M$_{\odot}$ from Population II red giant stars
(RGB) is a requirement of stellar evolution theory in order to account for
several observational evidences in globular clusters. Aims. The aim of this
study is to detect the presence of outward velocity fields, which are
indicative of mass outflow, in six luminous red giant stars of the stellar
cluster {\omega} Cen. Methods. We compare synthetic line profiles computed
using relevant model chromospheres to observed profiles of the H{\alpha} and Ca
II K lines. The spectra were taken with UVES (R=45,000) and the stars were
selected so that three of them belong to the metal-rich population and three to
the metal-poor population, and sample as far down as 1 to 2.5 magnitudes
fainter than the respective RGB tips. Results. We do indeed reveal the presence
of low-velocity outward motions in four of our six targets, without any
apparent correlation with astrophysical parameters. Conclusions. This provides
direct evidence that outward velocity fields and mass motions exist in RGB
stars as much as 2.5 mag fainter than the tip. On the assumption that the mass
outflow may eventually lead to mass loss from the star, we estimate mass-loss
rates of some 10^{-9}-10^{-10} M$_{\odot}$ yr^{-1} that are compatible with the
stellar evolution requirements. These rates seem to be correlated with
luminosity rather than metallicity.
