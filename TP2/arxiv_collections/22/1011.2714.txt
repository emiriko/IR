We report on first principles calculations of the anisotropy of the intrinsic
spin Hall conductivity (SHC) in nonmagnetic hcp metals and in antiferromagnetic
Cr. For most of the metals of this study we find large anisotropies. We derive
the general relation between the SHC vector and the direction of spin
polarization and discuss its consequences for hcp metals. Especially, it is
predicted that for systems where the SHC changes sign due to the anisotropy the
spin Hall effect may be tuned such that the spin polarization is parallel
either to the electric field or to the spin current.
