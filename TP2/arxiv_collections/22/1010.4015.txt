The Fermi liquid theory formulated by Landau is a basic paradigm of the
behavior of an interacting many-body system. We present a new application of
this theory to calculate "Landau force" on a macroscopic object. We show that
immersing a pendulum in Fermi liquid can increase its oscillation frequency,
and evidence of this has been observed in mixtures of 3He and 4He.
