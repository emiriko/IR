Lie group method provides an efficient tool to solve nonlinear partial
differential equations. This paper suggests a fractional Lie group method for
fractional partial differential equations. A time-fractional Burgers equation
is used as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the Lie group method
and some classes of exact solutions are obtained.
