Limit order books (LOBs) match buyers and sellers in more than half of the
world's financial markets. This survey highlights the insights that have
emerged from the wealth of empirical and theoretical studies of LOBs. We
examine the findings reported by statistical analyses of historical LOB data
and discuss how several LOB models provide insight into certain aspects of the
mechanism. We also illustrate that many such models poorly resemble real LOBs
and that several well-established empirical facts have yet to be reproduced
satisfactorily. Finally, we identify several key unresolved questions about
LOBs.
