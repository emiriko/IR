A temporal analysis of emoticon use in Swedish, Italian, German and English
asynchronous electronic communication is reported. Emoticons are classified as
positive, negative and neutral. Postings to newsgroups over a 66 week period
are considered. The aggregate analysis of emoticon use in newsgroups for
science and politics tend on the whole to be consistent over the entire time
period. Where possible, events that coincide with divergences from trends in
language-subject pairs are noted. Political discourse in Italian over the
period shows marked use of negative emoticons, and in Swedish, positive
emoticons.
