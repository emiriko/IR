The superfluid $^3$He B phase, one of the oldest unconventional fermionic
condensates experimentally realized, is recently predicted to support Majorana
fermion surface states. Majorana fermion, which is characterized by the
equivalence of particle and antiparticle, has a linear dispersion relation
referred to as the Majorana cone. We measured the transverse acoustic impedance
$Z$ of the superfluid$^3$He B phase changing its boundary condition and found a
growth of peak in $Z$ on a higher specularity wall. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the variation of $Z$ is induced by the formation of the
cone-like dispersion relation and thus confirms the important feature of the
Majorana fermion in the specular limit.
