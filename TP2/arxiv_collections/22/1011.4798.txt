A general method for treating non-Gaussian wave functionals in quantum field
theory is presented and applied to the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills
theory in Coulomb gauge in order to include a three-gluon kernel in the
exponential of the vacuum wave functional. The three-gluon vertex is calculated
using the propagators found in the variational approach with a Gaussian trial
wave functional as input.
