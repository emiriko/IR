Based on a Boltzmann-like traffic equation for aggressive drivers we
construct in this paper a second-order continuum traffic model which is similar
to the Navier-Stokes equations for viscous fluids by applying two well-known
methods of gas-kinetic theory, namely: the Chapman-Enskog method and the method
of moments of Grad. The viscosity coefficient appearing in our macroscopic
traffic model is not introduced in an ad hoc way - as in other second-order
traffic flow models - but comes into play through the derivation of a
first-order constitutive relation for the traffic pressure. Numerical
simulations show that our Navier-Stokes-like traffic model satisfies the
anisotropy condition and produces numerical results which are consistent with
our daily experiences in real traffic.
