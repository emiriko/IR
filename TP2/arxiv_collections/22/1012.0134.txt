The role of data libraries as a collaborative tool across Monte Carlo codes
is discussed. Some new contributions in this domain are presented; they concern
a data library of proton and alpha ionization cross sections, the development
in progress of a data library of electron ionization cross sections and
proposed improvements to the EADL (Evaluated Atomic Data Library), the latter
resulting from an extensive data validation process.
