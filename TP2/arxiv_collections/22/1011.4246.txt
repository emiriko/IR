We present specific heat, c_P, and ARPES data on single crystals of the
stoichiometric superconductor LiFeAs. A pronounced anomaly is found in c_P at
the superconducting transition. The electronic contribution can be described by
two s-type energy gaps with magnitudes of approximately Delta1 = 1.2 meV and
Delta2 = 2.6 meV and a normal-state gamma coefficient of 10 mJ/mol K^2. All
these values are in remarkable agreement with ARPES results.
