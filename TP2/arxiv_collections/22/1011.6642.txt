We propose a physical picture of superinsulator observed recently in
experiments with superconducting films in a magnetic field. On the basis of
previous numerical studies we argue that a moderate attraction creates
bi-particle localized states at intermediate disorder strength when
noninteracting electron states are delocalized and metallic. Our present
numerical study show that such localized pairs are broken by a static electric
field which strength is above a certain threshold. We argue that such a
breaking of localized pairs by a static field is at the origin of
superinsulator breaking with a current jump observed experimentally above a
certain critical voltage.
