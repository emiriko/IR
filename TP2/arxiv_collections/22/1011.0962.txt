We report the experimental demonstration of linear kinetic-inductive
photoresponse of thin-film YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} (YBCO) meander-line structures,
where the photoresponse amplitude, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM), and
rise-time are bilinear in the incident optical power and bias current. This
bilinear behavior reveals a trade off between obtaining high responsivity and
high speed photodetection. We also report a rise-time as short as 29ps in our
photoimpedance measurements.
