Using a unified method, we determine the structure of automorphisms and
representations of arbitrary polyadic groups. More precisely, for a polyadic
group $(G, f)=der_{\theta, b}(G, \cdot)$, we obtain a complete description of
automorphisms and representations of $(G,f)$ in terms of automorphisms and
representations of the binary group $(G, \cdot)$.
