We explore the possibility of detecting primordial non-Gaussianity of the
local type using weak lensing peak counts. We measure the peak abundance in
sets of simulated weak lensing maps corresponding to three models f_NL={0,
+100, -100}. Using survey specifications similar to those of Euclid and without
assuming any knowledge of the lens and source redshifts, we find the peak
functions of the non-Gaussian models with f_NL=+-100 to differ by up to 15%
from the Gaussian peak function at the high-mass end. For the assumed survey
parameters, the probability of fitting an f_NL=0 peak function to the
f_NL=+-100 peak functions is less than 0.1%. Assuming the other cosmological
parameters known, f_NL can be measured with an error \Delta f_NL ~ 13. It is
therefore possible that future weak lensing surveys like Euclid and LSST may
detect primordial non-Gaussianity from the abundance of peak counts, and
provide complementary information to that obtained from the cosmic microwave
background.
