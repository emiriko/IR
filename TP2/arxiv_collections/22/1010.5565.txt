In component-based development, approaches for property verification exist
that avoid building the global system behavior of the component model.
Typically, these approaches rely on the analysis of the local behavior of fixed
sized subsystems of components. In our approach, we want to avoid not only the
analysis of the global behavior but also of the local behaviors of the
components. Instead, we consider very small parts of the local behaviors called
port protocols that suffice to verify properties.
