A number of data acquisition systems depend on human interface to access
computer for measuring, processing and analyzing data and to prepare it for
presentation and storage. Data acquisition software is installed on the
computer and all intended operations are performed manually. The data
acquisition software requires user intervention for operations like selection
of measurement setup, acquisition and storage of data to computer. The duty of
users becomes laborious if the data acquisition process lasts for a long
duration and requires continuous repetition of steps. An appropriate solution
to overcome such problem is to replace the physical operator with a virtual
user. This software generated simulated user sits at the data acquisition
process through out and automate all the intended steps of data acquisition.
This paper presents a new approach for data acquisition by using keyboard
emulation technique. A keyboard emulation software is developed which runs
beside the main data acquisition software and acts as a virtual user. All the
operations which require user interface are performed through fully automated
computer program. The developed software/system is executed in a real time
environment and the functionality of the software is verified. In the end,
potential application areas of the designed keyboard emulation software are
explored.
