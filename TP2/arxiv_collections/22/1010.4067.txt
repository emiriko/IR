Titan is one of the more distinctive bodies in our solar system. In addition
to being the largest of Saturn's moons, its thick atmosphere gene-rates
interest because of its similarities and differences with Earth [1, 2]. Like
Earth, Titan's lower atmosphere contains clouds which precipitate as rain [2].
This rain forms lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane which erode and
shape the surface, much like water does on Earth, before evaporating into the
atmosphere [2]. In Titan's atmospheric system, a single dominating factor
controls the weather, the concentration of the organic molecule tholin.
