In this paper we survey the primary research, both theoretical and applied,
in the area of Robust Optimization (RO). Our focus is on the computational
attractiveness of RO approaches, as well as the modeling power and broad
applicability of the methodology. In addition to surveying prominent
theoretical results of RO, we also present some recent results linking RO to
adaptable models for multi-stage decision-making problems. Finally, we
highlight applications of RO across a wide spectrum of domains, including
finance, statistics, learning, and various areas of engineering.
