Substantial anisotropies should occur in the hot expanding QCD plasma
produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions due to non-vanishing shear
viscosity. We discuss the form of the real-time, hard thermal loop resummed
propagator for static gluons in the presence of such anisotropies and the
consequences for quarkonium binding. It has been predicted that the propagator
develops an imaginary part due to Landau damping at high temperature. This
generates a much larger width of quarkonium states than the Appelquist-Politzer
vacuum estimate corresponding to decay into three gluons. We argue that this
might be observable in heavy-ion collisions as a suppression of the Upsilon(1S)
--> e+ e- process. Lastly, we consider the heavy quark (singlet) free energy
just above the deconfinement temperature. In the "semi-QGP", F(R) at distances
beyond 1/T is expected to be suppressed by 1/N as compared to an ideal plasma.
