We investigated the effect of dissolved hydrogen on the microstructure
evolution of nanocrystalline silicon. Through molecular dynamics simulations we
characterize the local and overall structural features of several hydrogenated
samples by the quantitative calculation of their crystallinity. We prove that
hydrogen incorporation is detrimental for the recrystallization and accumulates
at grain boundaries, thus increasing their effective area. We further observe
the formation of silicon hydrogen complexes at very high hydrogen
concentration.
