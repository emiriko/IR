We study Maker/Breaker games on the edges of sparse graphs. Maker and Breaker
take turns in claiming previously unclaimed edges of a given graph H. Maker
aims to occupy a given target graph G and Breaker tries to prevent Maker from
achieving his goal. We define a function f and show that for every d-regular
graph G on n vertices there is a graph H with at most f(d)n edges such that
Maker can occupy a copy of G in the game on H.
