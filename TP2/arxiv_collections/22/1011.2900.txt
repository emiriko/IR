We present a computer library for the numerical evaluation of colour-ordered
n-gluon amplitudes at one-loop order in pure Yang-Mills theory. The library
uses the recently developed technique of generalised unitarity. Running in
double precision the library yields reliable results for up to 14 gluons with
only a small fraction of events requiring a re-evaluation using extended
floating point arithmetic. We believe that the library presented here provides
an important contribution to future LHC phenomenology. The program may also
prove useful in cross checking results obtained by other methods. In addition,
the code provides a sample implementation which may serve as a starting point
for further developments.
