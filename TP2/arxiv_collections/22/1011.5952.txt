The thick center vortex model is applied to G(2) gauge group to obtain the
potentials between static sources of the fundamental and adjoint
representations. The group G(2) has only one trivial center element and
therefore it does not have any vortices which are defined based on non trivial
center elements. To obtain the potential from the thick center vortex model,
the idea of the vacuum domain structure is used. The intermediate string
tensions from this model are in rough agreement with the G(2) lattice results
and the Casimir ratio. We argue that the SU(3) subgroup of G(2) may be
responsible for the linear potential at the intermediate distances.
