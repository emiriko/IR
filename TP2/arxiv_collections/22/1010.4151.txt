The conformal Willmore functional (which is conformal invariant in general
Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$) is studied with a perturbative method: the
Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction. Existence of critical points is shown in ambient
manifolds $(\mathbb{R}^3, g_\epsilon)$ -where $g_\epsilon$ is a metric close
and asymptotic to the euclidean one. With the same technique a non existence
result is proved in general Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ of dimension three.
