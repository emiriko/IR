This is the 3rd version with major updates and revisions to the 2nd version
of the same title. In this article we have collected and corrected some common
mistakes made by Chinese students in writing astronomy and physics literature
in English. Brief explanations of these mistakes are given in Chinese. We plan
to continue to update this collection periodically. Comments, suggestions and
criticisms are welcome.
