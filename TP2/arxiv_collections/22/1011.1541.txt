We give equivalent forms of the Askey-Wilson polynomials expressing them with
the help of the Al-Salam-Chihara polynomials. After restricting parameters of
the Askey-Wilson polynomials to complex conjugate pairs we expand the
Askey-Wilson weight function in the series similar to the Poisson-Mehler
expansion formula and give its probabilistic interpretation. In particular this
result can be used to calculate explicit forms of 'q-Hermite' moments of the
Askey-Wilson density, hence enabling calculation of all moments of the
Askey-Wilson density. On the way (by setting certain parameter q to 0) we get
some formulae useful in the rapidly developing so called 'free probability'.
