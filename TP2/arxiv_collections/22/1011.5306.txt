We study the renormalization group running of the tri-bimaximal mixing
predicted by the two typical $S_4$ flavor models at leading order. Although the
textures of the mass matrices are completely different, the evolution of
neutrino mass and mixing parameters is found to display approximately the same
pattern. For both normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy spectrum, the quantum
corrections to both atmospheric and reactor neutrino mixing angles are so small
that they can be neglected. The evolution of the solar mixing angle
$\theta_{12}$ depends on $\tan\beta$ and neutrino mass spectrum, the deviation
from its tri-bimaximal value could be large. Taking into account the
renormalization group running effect, the neutrino spectrum is constrained by
experimental data on $\theta_{12}$ in addition to the self-consistency
conditions of the models, and the inverted hierarchy spectrum is disfavored for
large $\tan\beta$. The evolution of light-neutrino masses is approximately
described by a common scaling factor.
