The non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation theory of
colloid dynamics is used to describe the non-stationary aging processes
occurring in a suddenly quenched model colloidal liquid with hard-sphere plus
short-ranged attractive interactions, whose static structure factor and van
Hove function evolve irreversibly from the initial conditions before the quench
to a final, dynamically arrested state. The comparison of our numerical results
with available simulation data are highly encouraging.
