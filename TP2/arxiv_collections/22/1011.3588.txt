In this paper, we consider a Gaussian multiple access channel with multiple
independent additive white Gaussian interferences. Each interference is known
to exactly one transmitter non-causally. The capacity region is characterized
to within a constant gap regardless of channel parameters. These results are
based on a layered modulo-lattice scheme which realizes distributed
interference cancellation.
