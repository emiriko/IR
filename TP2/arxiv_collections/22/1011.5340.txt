Let $M$ be a symplectic symmetric space, and let $\imath : M \to V$ be an
extrinsic symplectic symmetric immersion, i.e., $(V, \Omega)$ is a symplectic
vector space and $\imath$ is an injective symplectic immersion such that for
each point $p \in M$, the geodesic symmetry in $p$ is compatible with the
reflection in the affine normal space at $\imath(p)$. We show that the
existence of such an immersion implies that the transvection group of $M$ is
solvable.
