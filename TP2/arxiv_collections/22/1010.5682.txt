Artificial molecules containing just one or two electrons provide a powerful
platform for studies of orbital and spin quantum dynamics in nanoscale devices.
A well-known example of these dynamics is tunneling of electrons between two
coupled quantum dots triggered by microwave irradiation. So far, these
tunneling processes have been treated as electric dipole-allowed
spin-conserving events. Here we report that microwaves can also excite
tunneling transitions between states with different spin. In this work, the
dominant mechanism responsible for violation of spin conservation is the
spin-orbit interaction. These transitions make it possible to perform detailed
microwave spectroscopy of the molecular spin states of an artificial hydrogen
molecule and open up the possibility of realizing full quantum control of a two
spin system via microwave excitation.
