The Arabia Shield has a volcanic nature inside. A region of the Western Saudi
Arabia is in fact covered with vast fields of lava known as harraat. These
lands are spotted by many stone circles and other quite interesting
archaeological remains of the Neolithic period, such as the "desert kites", the
hunters used to guide the game across the harrah in some corrals. With Google
Maps, we can observe both sceneries, the volcanic nature of the land and a
portrait of Arabia during the Neolithic times.
