We discuss the analytical solution through the cavity method of a mean field
model that displays at the same time an ideal glass transition and a set of
jamming points. We establish the equations describing this system, and we
discuss some approximate analytical solutions and a numerical strategy to solve
them exactly. We compare these methods and we get insight into the reliability
of the theory for the description of finite dimensional hard spheres.
