Here, we show that the conductivity of conductor-insulator composites in
which electrons can tunnel from each conducting particle to all others may
display both percolation and tunneling (i.e. hopping) regimes depending on few
characteristics of the composite. Specifically, we find that the relevant
parameters that give rise to one regime or the other are $D/\xi$ (where $D$ is
the size of the conducting particles and $\xi$ is the tunneling length) and the
specific composite microstructure. For large values of $D/\xi$, percolation
arises when the composite microstructure can be modeled as a regular lattice
that is fractionally occupied by conducting particle, while the tunneling
regime is always obtained for equilibrium distributions of conducting particles
in a continuum insulating matrix. As $D/\xi$ decreases the percolating behavior
of the conductivity of lattice-like composites gradually crosses over to the
tunneling-like regime characterizing particle dispersions in the continuum. For
$D/\xi$ values lower than $D/\xi\simeq 5$ the conductivity has tunneling-like
behavior independent of the specific microstructure of the composite.
