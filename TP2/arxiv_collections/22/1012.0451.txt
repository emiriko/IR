We investigate the effect of a distorted neutron star dipole magnetic field
on pulsar pair cascade multiplicity and pair death lines. Using a simple model
for a distorted dipole field that produces an offset polar cap, we derive the
accelerating electric field above the polar cap in space charge limited flow.
We find that even a modest azimuthally asymmetric distortion can significantly
increase the accelerating electric field on one side of the polar cap and,
combined with a smaller field line radius of curvature, leads to larger pair
multiplicity. The death line for producing pairs by curvature radiation moves
downward in the P-Pdot diagram, allowing high pair multiplicities in a larger
percentage of the radio pulsar population. These results could have important
implications for the radio pulsar population, high energy pulsed emission and
the pulsar contribution to cosmic ray positrons.
