We present the results of the comparative study of the influence of disorder
on transport properties in continuous and nanoperforated TiN films. We show
that nanopatterning turns a thin TiN film into an array of superconducting weak
links and stimulates both, the disorder- and magnetic field-driven
superconductor-to-insulator transitions, pushing them to lower degree of
disorder. We find that nanopatterning enhances the role of the two-dimensional
Coulomb interaction in the system transforming the originally insulating film
into a more pronounced insulator. We observe magnetoresistance oscillations
reflecting collective behaviour of the multiconnected nanopatterned
superconducting film in the wide range of temperatures and uncover the physical
mechanism of these oscillations as phase slips in superconducting weak link
network.
