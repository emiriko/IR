We investigate the neutrino helicity-flip process under supernova core
conditions, where the left-handed neutrinos being produced can be converted
into right-handed neutrinos sterile with respect to the weak interaction due to
the interaction of magnetic moments with plasma electrons and protons. Instead
of the uniform ball model for the SN core used in previous analyses, realistic
models for radial distributions and time evolution of physical parameters in
the supernova core are considered. We have obtained new upper limits on the
Dirac neutrino magnetic moment averaged over flavours and time from the
condition that the influence of the right-handed neutrino emission on the total
cooling time scale should be limited.
