The 15N(p,g)16O reaction represents a break out reaction linking the first
and second cycle of the CNO cycles redistributing the carbon and nitrogen
abundances into the oxygen range. The reaction is dominated by two broad
resonances at Ep = 338 keV and 1028 keV and a Direct Capture contribution to
the ground state of 16O. Interference effects between these contributions in
both the low energy region (Ep < 338 keV) and in between the two resonances
(338 <Ep < 1028 keV) can dramatically effect the extrapolation to energies of
astrophysical interest. To facilitate a reliable extrapolation the 15N(p,g)16O
reaction has been remeasured covering the energy range from Ep=1800 keV down to
130 keV. The results have been analyzed in the framework of a multi-level
R-matrix theory and a S(0) value of 39.6 keV b has been found.
