We present the first detailed spectral and timing analysis of the High Mass
X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 1909+07 with INTEGRAL and RXTE. 4U 1909+07 is detected
in the ISGRI 20-40 keV energy band with an average countrate of 2.6 cps. The
pulse period of ~604 sec is not stable, but changing erratically on timescales
of years. The pulse profile is strongly energy dependent: it shows a double
peaked structure at low energies, the secondary pulse decreases rapidly with
increasing energy and above 20 keV only the primary pulse is visible. This
evolution is consistent between PCA, HEXTE, and ISGRI. The phase averaged
spectrum can be well described by the sum of a photoabsorbed power law with a
cutoff at high energies and a blackbody component. To investigate the pulse
profile, we performed phase resolved spectral analysis. We find that the
changing spectrum can be best described with a variation of the folding energy.
We rule out a correlation between the black body component and the continuum
variation and discuss possible accretion geometries.
