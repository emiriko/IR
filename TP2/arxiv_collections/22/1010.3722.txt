Motivated by the properties of early universe scenarios that produce
observationally large local non-Gaussianity, we perform N-body simulations with
non-Gaussian initial conditions from a generalized local ansatz. The bispectra
are schematically of the local shape, but with scale-dependent amplitude. We
find that in such cases the size of the non-Gaussian correction to the bias of
small and large mass objects depends on the amplitude of non-Gaussianity
roughly on the scale of the object. In addition, some forms of the generalized
bispectrum alter the scale dependence of the non-Gaussian term in the bias by a
fractional power of k. These features may allow significant observational
constraints on the particle physics origin of any observed local
non-Gaussianity, distinguishing between scenarios where a single field or
multiple fields contribute to the curvature fluctuations. While analytic
predictions for the non-Gaussian bias agree qualitatively with the simulations,
we find numerically a stronger observational signal than expected. This
suggests that a more precise understanding of halo formation is needed to fully
explain the consequences of primordial non-Gaussianity
