We have used an original analysis of reflection interference contrast
microscopy (RICM) to detect an ultra-weak specific interaction between a
glycolipid vesicle and a lectin-coated substrate. The membrane height
fluctuations in the contact zone are observed with a high illumination
aperture; the membrane profile and the membrane-substrate distance are
quantitatively determined using the new analysis, which accounts for multiple
interfaces and multiple incidence rays. We showed that this refined version of
RICM theory is necessary, specifically in the case of intermediate
membranesubstrate distance (30 nm) and helped to discriminate between the
ultra-weak interaction and pure gravitational sedimentation
