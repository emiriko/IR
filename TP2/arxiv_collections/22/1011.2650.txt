We use a Monte Carlo approach to simulate the influence of the dipolar
interaction on assemblies of monodisperse superparamagnetic
${\gamma}-Fe_{2}O_{3}$ nanoparticles. We have identified a critical
concentration c*, that marks the transition between two different regimes in
the evolution of the blocking temperature ($T_{B}$) with interparticle
interactions. At low concentrations (c < c*) magnetic particles behave as an
ideal non-interacting system with a constant $T_{B}$. At concentrations c > c*
the dipolar energy enhances the anisotropic energy barrier and $T_{B}$
increases with increasing c, so that a larger temperature is required to reach
the superparamagnetic state. The fitting of our results with classical particle
models and experiments supports the existence of two differentiated regimes.
Our data could help to understand apparently contradictory results from the
literature.
