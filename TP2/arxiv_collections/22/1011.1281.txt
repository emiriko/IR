We present a new nonperturbative method to deal with the time-dependent
quantum many-body problem, which is an extension of Wegner's flow equations to
time-dependent Hamiltonians. The formalism provides a scaling procedure for the
set of time-dependent interaction constants. We apply these ideas to a Kondo
model with a ferromagnetic exchange coupling switched on over a time scale
$\tau$. We show that the asymptotic expectation value of the impurity spin
interpolates continuously between its quenched and adiabatic value.
