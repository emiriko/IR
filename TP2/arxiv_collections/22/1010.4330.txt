We study resonant response of an underdamped nanomechanical resonator with
fluctuating frequency. The fluctuations are due to diffusion of molecules or
microparticles along the resonator. They lead to broadening and change of shape
of the oscillator spectrum. The spectrum is found for the diffusion confined to
a small part of the resonator and where it occurs along the whole nanobeam. The
analysis is based on extending to the continuous limit, and appropriately
modifying, the method of interfering partial spectra. We establish the
conditions of applicability of the fluctuation-dissipation relations between
the susceptibility and the power spectrum. We also find where the effect of
frequency fluctuations can be described by a convolution of the spectra without
these fluctuations and with them as the only source of the spectral broadening.
