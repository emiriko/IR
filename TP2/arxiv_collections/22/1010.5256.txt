We report on magnetization data obtained as a function of temperature and
magnetic field in Li2 (Pd0.8Pt0.2)3B and Li2Pd3B non-centro-symmetric
superconductors. Reversible magnetization curves were plotted as M1/2 vs. T.
This allows study of the asymptotic behavior of the averaged order parameter
amplitude (gap) near the superconducting transition. Results of the analysis
show, as expected, a mean field superconducting transition for Li2Pd3B. On
contrary, a large deviation from the mean field behavior is revealed for
Li2(Pd0.8Pt0.2)3B. This is interpreted as due to the strength of the non s-wave
spin-triplet pairing in this Pt-containing compound which produces nodes in the
order parameter and consequently, phase fluctuations. The diamagnetic signal
above Tc(H) in Li2Pd3B is well explained by superconducting Gaussian
fluctuations, which agrees with the observed mean field transition. For
Li2(Pd0.8Pt0.2)3B the diamagnetic signal above Tc(H) is much higher than the
expected Gaussian values and appears to be well explained by three dimensional
critical fluctuations of the lowest-Landau-level type, which somehow agrees
with the scenario of a phase mediated transition.
