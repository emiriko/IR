HD 46375 is known to host a Saturn-like exoplanet orbiting at 0.04 AU from
its host star. Stellar light reflected by the planet was tentatively identified
in the 34-day CoRoT run acquired in October-November 2008. We constrain the
properties of the magnetic field of HD 46375 based on spectropolarimetric
observations with the NARVAL spectrograph at the Pic du Midi observatory. In
addition, we use a high-resolution NARVAL flux spectrum to contrain the
atmospheric parameters. With these constraints, we perform an asteroseismic
analysis and modelling of HD 46375 using the frequencies extracted from the
CoRoT light curve. We used Zeeman Doppler imaging to reconstruct the magnetic
map of the stellar surface. In the spectroscopic analysis we fitted isolated
lines using 1D LTE atmosphere models. This analysis was used to constrain the
effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition of the star.
To extract information about the p-mode oscillations, we used a technique based
on the envelope autocorrelation function (EACF). From the Zeeman Doppler
imaging observations, we observe a magnetic field of ~5 gauss. From the
spectral analysis, HD 46375 is inferred to be an unevolved K0 type star with
high metallicity [Fe/H]=+0.39. Owing to the relative faintness of the star
(m_hip=8.05), the signal-to-noise ratio is too low to identify individual
modes. However, we measure the p-mode excess power and large separation Delta
nu_0=153.0 +/- 0.7 muHz. We are able do constrain the fundamental parameters of
the star thanks to spectrometric and seismic analyses. We conclude that HD
46375 is similar to a young version of Alpha-CenB. This work is of special
interest because of its combination of exoplanetary science and
asteroseismology, which are the subjects of the current Kepler mission and the
proposed PLATO mission.
