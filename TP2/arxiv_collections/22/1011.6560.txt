We study the effects of CP violation in charged Higgs boson production $pp\to
t H^\pm + X$ at the LHC, as well as in the charged Higgs boson decays $H^\pm
\to t b$ and $H^\pm \to W^\pm H_i^0$, $i=1,2,3$. The study is done in the
framework of the type II complex Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with softly
broken $Z_2$ symmetry. In this model violation of CP invariance is induced by
the complex parameter $m^2_{12}$ of the tree-level Higgs potential. We
calculate the CP violating rate asymmetries for $H^+$ and $H^-$ production and
decays as well as for the combined processes at one-loop level and perform a
detailed numerical analysis. All calculations are done with the automatic
amplitude generator FeynArts and the calculational tool FormCalc, for which we
have written a complete complex 2HDM model file and relevant fortran drivers.
The implementation of the complex 2HDM in FeynArts and FormCalc is described.
In comparison with the analogous results in the MSSM, all considered CP
violating asymmetries are smaller by an order of magnitude and do not exceed 2
to 3%.
