By introducing a set of new triplet leptons (with nonzero hypercharge) that
can Yukawa couple to their Standard Model counterparts, new sources of
tree-level flavor changing currents are induced via mixing. In this work, we
study some of the consequences of such new contributions on processes such as
the leptonic decays of gauge bosons, $\ell \rightarrow 3\ell'$ and $\ell
\rightarrow \ell' \gamma$ which violate lepton flavor, and mu-e conversion in
atomic nuclei. Constraints are then placed on the parameters associated with
the exotic triplets by invoking the current low-energy experimental data.
Moreover, the new physics contribution to the lepton anomalous magnetic moments
is calculated.
