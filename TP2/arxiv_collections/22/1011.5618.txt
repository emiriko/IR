We construct analytic extensions across the Killing horizons of non-extremal
and extremal dipole black rings in Einstein-Maxwell's theory using different
methods. We show that these extensions are non-globally hyperbolic, have
multiple asymptotically flat regions and in the non-extremal case, are also
maximal and timelike complete. Moreover, we find that in both cases the causal
structure of the maximally extended space-time resembles that of the
4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Furthermore, motivated by the
physical interpretation of one of these extensions, we find a separable
solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation corresponding to zero energy null
geodesics and relate it to the existence of a conformal Killing tensor and a
conformal Killing-Yano tensor in a specific dimensionally reduced space-time.
