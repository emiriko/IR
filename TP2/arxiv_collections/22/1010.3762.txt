We derive a set of Bell-type inequalities for arbitrarily high-dimensional
systems, based on the assumption of partial separability in the hybrid
local-nonlocal hidden variable model. Partially entangled states would not
violate the inequalities, and thus upon violation, these Bell-type inequalities
are sufficient conditions to detect the full $N$-particle entanglement and
validity of the hybrid local-nonlocal hidden variable description.
