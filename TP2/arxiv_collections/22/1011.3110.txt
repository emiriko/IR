We study mass-transport models with multiple-chipping processes. The rates of
these processes are dependent on the chip size and mass of the fragmenting
site. In this context, we consider k-chip moves (where k = 1, 2, 3, ....); and
combinations of 1-chip, 2-chip and 3-chip moves. The corresponding mean-field
(MF) equations are solved to obtain the steady-state probability distributions,
P (m) vs. m. We also undertake Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of these models.
The MC results are in excellent agreement with the corresponding MF results,
demonstrating that MF theory is exact for these models.
