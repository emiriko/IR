We study the quasiparticle energy relaxation processes in superconducting Nb
films of different thicknesses corresponding to different electron mean free
paths in a state far from equilibrium, that is the highly dissipative flux-flow
state driven up to the instability point. From the measured current-voltage
curves we derive the vortex critical velocity $v^{*}$ for several temperatures.
From the $v^{*}(T)$ values, the quasiparticle energy relaxation time
$\tau_{\epsilon}$ is evaluated within the Larkin-Ovchinnikov model and
numerical calculations of the quasiparticle energy relaxation rates are carried
out to support the experimental findings. Besides the expected constant
behavior of $\tau_{\epsilon}(T)$ for the dirty samples, we observe a strong
temperature dependence of the quasiparticle energy relaxation time in the clean
samples. This feature is associated with the increasing contribution from the
electron-phonon scattering process as the dirty limit is approached from the
clean regime.
