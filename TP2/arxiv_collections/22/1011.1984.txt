Radiative transfer equation in plane parallel geometry and Kompaneets
equation is solved simultaneously to obtain theoretical spectrum of 1-125 KeV
photon energy range. Diffuse radiation field is calculated using
time-independent radiative transfer equation in plane parallel geometry, which
is developed using discrete space theory (DST) of radiative transfer in a
homogeneous medium for different optical depths. We assumed free-free emission
and absorption and emission due to electron gas to be operating in the medium.
The three terms $n, n^2$ and $\displaystyle \bigg({\frac {\partial n}{\partial
x_k}}\bigg)$ where $n$ is photon phase density and $\displaystyle x_k=
\bigg({\frac {h \nu} {k T_e}} \bigg) $, in Kompaneets equation and those due to
free-free emission are utilized to calculate the change in the photon phase
density in a hot electron gas. Two types of incident radiation are considered:
(1) isotropic radiation with the modified black body radiation $I^{MB}$ [1] and
(2) anisotropic radiation which is angle dependent. The emergent radiation at
$\tau=0$ and reflected radiation $\tau=\tau_{max}$ are calculated by using the
diffuse radiation from the medium. The emergent and reflected radiation contain
the free-free emission and emission from the hot electron gas. Kompaneets
equation gives the changes in photon phase densities in different types of
media. Although the initial spectrum is angle dependent, the Kompaneets
equation gives a spectrum which is angle independent after several Compton
scattering times.
