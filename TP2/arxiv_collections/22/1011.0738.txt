Systems with long-range interactions, while relaxing towards equilibrium,
sometimes get trapped in long-lived non-Boltzmann quasistationary states (QSS)
which have lifetimes that grow algebraically with the system size. Such states
have been observed in models of globally coupled particles that move under
Hamiltonian dynamics either on a unit circle or on a unit spherical surface.
Here, we address the ubiquity of QSS in long-range systems by considering a
different dynamical setting. Thus, we consider an anisotropic Heisenberg model
consisting of classical Heisenberg spins with mean-field interactions and
evolving under classical spin dynamics. Our analysis of the corresponding
Vlasov equation for time evolution of the phase space distribution shows that
in a certain energy interval, relaxation of a class of initial states occurs
over a timescale which grows algebraically with the system size. We support
these findings by extensive numerical simulations. This work further supports
the generality of occurrence of QSS in long-range systems evolving under
Hamiltonian dynamics.
