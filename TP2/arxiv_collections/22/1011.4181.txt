The shear ($\eta$) and bulk ($\zeta$) viscous coefficients have been
evaluated for a gluonic fluid. The elastic, $gg \rightarrow gg$ and the
inelastic, number non-conserving, $gg\rightarrow ggg$ processes have been
considered as the dominant perturbative processes in evaluating the viscous
co-efficients to entropy density ($s$) ratios. Recently the processes: $gg
\rightarrow ggg$ has been revisited and a correction to the widely used
Gunion-Bertsch (GB) formula has been obtained. The $\eta$ and $\zeta$ have been
evaluated for gluonic fluid with the formula derived recently. The sensitivity
of the quantity, $\eta/s$ on the running coupling constant is also discussed.
At $\alpha_s=0.3$ we get $\eta/s=0.24$ which is close to the value obtained
from the analysis of the elliptic flow at RHIC experiments.
