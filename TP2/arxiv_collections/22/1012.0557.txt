Lov\'asz Local Lemma (LLL) is a probabilistic tool that allows us to prove
the existence of combinatorial objects in the cases when standard probabilistic
argument does not work (there are many partly independent conditions).
  LLL can be also used to prove the consistency of an infinite set of
conditions, using standard compactness argument (if an infinite set of
conditions is inconsistent, then some finite part of it is inconsistent, too,
which contradicts LLL). In this way we show that objects satisfying all the
conditions do exist (though the probability of this event equals~$0$). However,
if we are interested in finding a computable solution that satisfies all the
constraints, compactness arguments do not work anymore.
  Moser and Tardos recently gave a nice constructive proof of LLL. Lance
Fortnow asked whether one can apply Moser--Tardos technique to prove the
existence of a computable solution. We show that this is indeed possible (under
almost the same conditions as used in the non-constructive version).
