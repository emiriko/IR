A novel tracking paradigm for flying geometric trajectories using tethered
kites is presented. It is shown how the differential-geometric notion of
turning angle can be used as a one-dimensional representation of the kite
trajectory, and how this leads to a single-input single-output (SISO) tracking
problem. Based on this principle a Lyapunov-based nonlinear adaptive controller
is developed that only needs control derivatives of the kite aerodynamic model.
The resulting controller is validated using simulations with a point-mass kite
model.
