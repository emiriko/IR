The geometry of fundamental domains of lattices was used by Han and Wang to
construct multivariate Gabor frames for separable lattices. We build upon their
results to obtain Gabor frames with smooth and compactly supported window
functions. For this purpose we study pairs of lattices which have equal density
and allow for a common compact and star-shaped fundamental domain. The results
are then extended to a larger class of lattices via symplectic equivalence.
