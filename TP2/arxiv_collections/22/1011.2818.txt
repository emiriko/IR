The mass of $P$-wave $cs$-scalar-diquark $\bar{c}\bar{s}$-scalar-antidiquark
state is computed in the framework of QCD sum rules. The result
$4.69\pm0.36{GeV}$ is in good agreement with the experimental value of Y(4660)
but higher than Y(4260)'s, which supports the $P$-wave $[cs][\bar{c}\bar{s}]$
configuration for Y(4660) while disfavors the interpretation of Y(4260) as the
$P$-wave $[cs][\bar{c}\bar{s}]$ state. In the same picture, the mass of
$P$-wave $[bs][\bar{b}\bar{s}]$ is predicted to be $11.19\pm0.49 {GeV}$.
