We demonstrate that the Lyman alpha emission in the absorption troughs of a
large sample of stacked damped Lyman alpha absorption systems (DLAS) presented
by Rahmani et al (2010) is consistent with the spectral profiles and
luminosities of a recently detected population of faint Lyman alpha emitters at
z ~ 3. This result supports the suggestion that the faint emitters are to be
identified with the host galaxies of DLAS at these redshifts.
