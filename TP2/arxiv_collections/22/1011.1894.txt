Static magnetic order of quasi two-dimensional FeAs compounds
Sr4A2O6-xFe2As2, with A = Sc and V, has been detected by 57Fe Moessbauer and
muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) spectroscopies. The non-superconducting
stoichiometric (x = 0) A = Sc system exhibits a static internal/hyperfine
magnetic field both at the 57Fe and {\mu}+ sites, indicating antiferromagnetic
order of Fe moments below TN = 35 K with ~ 0.1 Bohr magneton per Fe at T = 2 K.
The superconducting and oxygen deficient (x = 0.4) A = V system exhibits a
static internal field only at the {\mu}+ site below TN ~ 40 K, indicating
static magnetic order of V moments co-existing with superconductivity without
freezing of Fe moments. These results suggest that the 42622 FeAs systems
belong to the same paradigm with the 1111 and 122 FeAs systems with respect to
magnetic behavior of Fe moments.
