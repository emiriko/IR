We study the pullback maps on cohomology groups for equivariant rational maps
(i.e., monomial maps) on toric varieties. Our method is based on the
intersection theory on toric varieties. We use the method to determine the
dynamical degrees of monomial maps and compute the degrees of the Cremona
involution.
