The world is witnessing the birth of a revolutionary computing paradigm that
promises to have a profound effect on the way we interact with computers,
devices, physical spaces, and other people. This new technology, called
ubiquitous computing, envisions a world where embedded processors, computers,
sensors, and digital communications are inexpensive commodities that are
available everywhere. This paper presents a comprehensive discussion on the
central trends in ubiquitous computing considering them form technical, social
and economic perspectives. It clearly identifies different application areas
and sectors that will benefit from the potentials of ubiquitous computing. It
also brings forth the challenges of ubiquitous computing that require active
solutions and management.
