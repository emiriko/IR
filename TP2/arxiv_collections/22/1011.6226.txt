The main goal of our project is to investigate the spatial distribution of
different stellar populations in the Magellanic Clouds. The results from
modelling the Magellanic Clouds can be useful, among others, for simulations
during the Gaia mission preparation. Isodensity contour maps have been used in
order to trace the morphology of the different stellar populations and estimate
the size of these structures. Moreover, star density maps are constructed
through star counts and projected radial density profiles are obtained. Fitting
exponential disk and King law curves to the spatial distribution allows us to
derive the structural parameters that describe these profiles. The
morphological structure and spatial distributions of various stellar components
in the Magellanic Clouds (young and intermediate age stars, carbon stars) along
with the overall spatial distribution in both Clouds are provided.
