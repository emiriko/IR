We map the ultrasonic (8 MHz) speed and attenuation of edible-grade gelatin
in water, exploring the key dependencies on temperature, concentration and
time. The ultrasonic signatures of the sol-gel transition, confirmed by
rheological measurements, and incomplete gel formation at low concentrations,
enable a phase diagram of the system to be constructed. Sensitivity is also
demonstrated to the kinetics of gel formation and melting, and associated
hysteresis effects upon cyclic temperature sweeps. Furthermore, simple acoustic
models of the sol and gel state enable estimation of the speed of sound and
compressibility of gelatin. Our results demonstrate the potential of ultrasonic
measurements to characterise the structure and visco-elasticity of gelatin
hydrogels.
