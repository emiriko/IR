We perform numerical simulations to determine the shear stress and pressure
of steady-state shear flow in a soft-disk model in two dimensions at zero
temperature in the vicinity of the jamming transition \phi_J. We use critical
point scaling analyses to determine the critical behavior at jamming, and we
find that it is crucial to include corrections to scaling for a reliable
analysis. We find that the relative size of these corrections are much smaller
for pressure than for shear stress. We furthermore find a superlinear behavior
for pressure and shear stress above \phi_J, both from the scaling analysis and
from a direct analysis of pressure data extrapolated to the limit of vanishing
shear rate.
