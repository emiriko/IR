In a recent paper, Kiessling and Tahvildar-Zadeh proved that any classical
solution of the relativistic Vlasov-Poisson equation with attractive coupling
launched by spherically symmetric initial data with zero total energy and
virial less than or equal to -1/2 will blow up in finite time. They left open
whether such data exist. Subsequently, the question was raised whether any such
data exist at all. In fact, the simplest conceivable ansatz, a nearly uniform
ball of material centered at the origin with momenta directed inward, must have
virial strictly larger than -1/2! In this brief note, we settle this issue by
constructing two classes of such initial data.
