We explore experimentally quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements of atomic
spin in a hot potassium vapor in the presence of spin-exchange relaxation. We
demonstrate a new technique for back-action evasion by stroboscopic modulation
of the probe light. With this technique we study spin noise as a function of
polarization for atoms with spin greater than 1/2 and obtain good agreement
with a simple theoretical model. We point that in a system with fast
spin-exchange, where the spin relaxation rate is changing with time, it is
possible to improve the long-term sensitivity of atomic magnetometry by using
QND measurements.
