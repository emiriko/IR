The study of rare B-decays at SuperB provides unique opportunities to
understand the Standard Model and constrain new physics. It is discussed the
new physics potential of the B -> K nu nu_bar and B -> K^{\ast} nu nu_bar
system from the proposed SuperB experiment with 75ab-1 of data (5 nominal years
of data taking).
