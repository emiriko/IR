We have studied power density spectra (PDS) of 206 long Gamma-Ray Bursts
(GRBs). We fitted the PDS with a simple power-law and extracted the exponent of
the power-law (alpha) and the noise-crossing threshold frequency (f_th). We
find that the distribution of the extracted alpha peaks around -1.4 and that of
f_th around 1 Hz. In addition, based on a sub-set of 58 bursts with known
redshifts, we show that the redshift-corrected threshold frequency is
positively correlated with the isotropic peak luminosity. The correlation
coefficient is 0.57 +/- 0.03.
