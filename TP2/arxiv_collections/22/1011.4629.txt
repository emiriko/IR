We indicated in our previous work that for QED the contributions of the
scalar potential which appears at the loop level is much smaller than that of
the vector potential and in fact negligible. But the situation may be different
for QCD, one reason is that the loop effects are more significant because
$\alpha_s$ is much larger than $\alpha$, and secondly the non-perturbative QCD
effects may induce the scalar potential. In this work, we phenomenologically
study the contribution of the scalar potential to the spectra of charmonia.
Taking into account both vector and scalar potentials, by fitting the well
measured charmonia spectra, we re-fix the relevant parameters and test them by
calculating other states of the charmonia family. We also consider the role of
the Lamb shift and present the numerical results with and without involving the
Lamb shift.
