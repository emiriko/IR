We analyze the practical consequences of the bilateral counterparty risk
adjustment. We point out that past literature assumes that, at the moment of
the first default, a risk-free closeout amount will be used. We argue that the
legal (ISDA) documentation suggests in many points that a substitution closeout
should be used. This would take into account the risk of default of the
survived party. We show how the bilateral counterparty risk adjustment changes
strongly when a substitution closeout amount is considered. We model the two
extreme cases of default independence and co-monotonicity, which highlight pros
and cons of both risk free and substitution closeout formulations, and allow us
to interpret the outcomes as dramatic consequences on default contagion.
Finally, we analyze the situation when collateral is present.
