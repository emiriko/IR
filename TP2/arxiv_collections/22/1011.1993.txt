A smooth spatial disturbance of the Fermi surface in a Fermi gas inevitably
becomes sharp. This phenomenon, called {\it the gradient catastrophe}, causes
the breakdown of a Fermi sea to disconnected parts with multiple Fermi points.
We study how the gradient catastrophe effects probing the Fermi system via a
Fermi edge singularity measurement. We show that the gradient catastrophe
transforms the single-peaked Fermi-edge singularity of the tunneling (or
absorption) spectrum to a set of multiple asymmetric singular resonances. Also
we gave a mathematical formulation of FES as a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem.
