We study the production of charmed mesons (D) and baryons (Lambda_c) in
antiproton-proton (app) annihilation close to their respective production
thresholds. The elementary charm production process is described by either
baryon/meson exchange or by quark/gluon dynamics. Effects of the interactions
in the initial and final states are taken into account rigorously. The
calculations are performed in close analogy to our earlier study on app ->
antiLambda-Lambda and app -> antiK-K by connecting the processes via SU(4)
flavor symmetry. Our predictions for the antiLambda_c-Lambda_c production cross
section are in the order of 1 to 7 mb, i.e. a factor of around 10-70 smaller
than the corresponding cross sections for antiLambda-Lambda However, they are
100 to 1000 times larger than predictions of other model calculations in the
literature. On the other hand, the resulting cross sections for antiD-D
production are found to be in the order of 10^{-2} -- 10^{-1} microbarn and
they turned out to be comparable to those obtained in other studies.
