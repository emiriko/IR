A symmetry group method is used to obtain exact solutions for a semilinear
radial heat equation in $n>1$ dimensions with a general power nonlinearity. The
method involves an ansatz technique to solve an equivalent first-order PDE
system of similarity variables given by group foliations of this heat equation,
using its admitted group of scaling symmetries. This technique yields explicit
similarity solutions as well as other explicit solutions of a more general
(non-similarity) form having interesting analytical behavior connected with
blow up and dispersion. In contrast, standard similarity reduction of this heat
equation gives a semilinear ODE that cannot be explicitly solved by familiar
integration techniques such as point symmetry reduction or integrating factors.
