We consider a class of nonlinear Boltzmann equations describing return to
thermal equilibrium in a gas of colliding particles suspended in a thermal
medium. We study solutions in the space $L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{3}\times
\mathbb{T}^3).$ Special solutions of these equations, called "Maxwellians," are
spatially homogenous static Maxwell velocity distributions at the temperature
of the medium. We prove that, for dilute gases, the solutions corresponding to
smooth initial conditions in a weighted $L^{1}$-space converge to a Maxwellian
in $L^{1},$ exponentially fast in time.
