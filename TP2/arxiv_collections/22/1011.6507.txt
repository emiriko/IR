We investigate the chiral phase transition in the quark-meson effective model
using optimised perturbation theory to one loop. Certain terms in the free
energy are frequently omitted in calculations, on the assumption that their
contribution is negligible. We show that this is not necessarily the case, and
that the order of the phase transition, as well as the critical temperature,
depends heavily on which contributions are included.
