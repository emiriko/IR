Quasi-transverse-electric and -transverse-magnetic fundamental whispering
gallery modes in a polymer-coated silica microtoroid are theoretically
investigated and demonstrated to possess very high-quality factors. The
existence of a nanometer-thickness layer not only evidently reduces the cavity
mode volume but also draws the maximal electric field's position of the mode to
the outside of the silica toroid, where single quantum dots or nanocrystals are
located. Both effects result in a strongly enhanced coherent interaction
between a single dipole (for example, a single defect center in a diamond
crystal) and the quantized cavity mode. Since the coated microtoroid is highly
feasible and robust in experiments, it may offer an excellent platform to study
strong-coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum information, and
quantum computation.
