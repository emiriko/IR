We determine the age and mass of the three best solar twin candidates in open
cluster M67 through lithium evolutionary models. We computed a grid of
evolutionary models with non-standard mixing at metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.01 with
the Toulouse-Geneva evolution code for a range of stellar masses. We estimated
the mass and age of 10 solar analogs belonging to the open cluster M67. We made
a detailed study of the three solar twins of the sample, YPB637, YPB1194, and
YPB1787. We obtained a very accurate estimation of the mass of our solar
analogs in M67 by interpolating in the grid of evolutionary models. The three
solar twins allowed us to estimate the age of the open cluster, which is
3.87+0.55-0.66 Gyr, which is better constrained than former estimates. Our
results show that the 3 solar twin candidates have one solar mass within the
errors and that M67 has a solar age within the errors, validating its use as a
solar proxy. M67 is an important cluster when searching for solar twins.
