We study photoinduced ultrafast coherent oscillations originating from
orbital degrees of freedom in the one-dimensional two-orbital Hubbard model. By
solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for the numerically exact
many-electron wave function, we obtain time-dependent optical response
functions. The calculated spectra show characteristic coherent oscillations
that vary with the frequency of probe light. A simple analysis for the dominant
oscillating components clarifies that these photoinduced oscillations are
caused by the quantum interference between photogenerated states. The
oscillation attributed to the Raman-active orbital excitations (orbitons)
clearly appears around the charge-transfer peak.
