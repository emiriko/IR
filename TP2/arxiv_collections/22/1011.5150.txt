Electronic many-body effects alone can be the driving force for an ultrafast
migration of a positive charge created upon ionization of molecular systems.
Here we show that this purely electronic phenomenon generates a characteristic
IR radiation. The situation when the initial ionic wave packet is produced by a
sudden removal of an electron is also studied. It is shown that in this case a
much stronger UV emission is generated. This emission appears as an ultrafast
response of the remaining electrons to the perturbation caused by the sudden
ionization and as such is a universal phenomenon to be expected in every
multielectron system.
