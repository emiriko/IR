We review basic ideas and recent developments on the determination of the
parton substructure of the nucleon, in view of applications to precision hadron
collider physics. We review the way information on parton distributions (PDFs)
is extracted from the data exploiting QCD factorization, and discuss the
current main two approaches to parton determination (Hessian and Monte Carlo)
and their use in conjunction with different kinds of parton parametrization. We
summarize the way different physical processes can be used to constrain
different aspects of PDFs. We discuss the meaning, determination and use of
parton uncertainties. We briefly summarize the current state of the art on PDFs
for LHC physics.
