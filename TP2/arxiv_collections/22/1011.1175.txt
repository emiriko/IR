Path integral techniques for the pricing of financial options are mostly
based on models that can be recast in terms of a Fokker-Planck differential
equation and that, consequently, neglect jumps and only describe drift and
diffusion. We present a method to adapt formulas for both the path-integral
propagators and the option prices themselves, so that jump processes are taken
into account in conjunction with the usual drift and diffusion terms. In
particular, we focus on stochastic volatility models, such as the exponential
Vasicek model, and extend the pricing formulas and propagator of this model to
incorporate jump diffusion with a given jump size distribution. This model is
of importance to include non-Gaussian fluctuations beyond the Black-Scholes
model, and moreover yields a lognormal distribution of the volatilities, in
agreement with results from superstatistical analysis. The results obtained in
the present formalism are checked with Monte Carlo simulations.
