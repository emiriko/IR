A theoretical scheme is presented for generating Gazeau-Klauder coherent
states(GKCSs) via the generalization of degenerate Raman interaction with
coupling constant to intensity-dependent coupling. Firstly, we prove that in
the intensity-dependent degenerate Raman interaction, under particular
conditions, the modified efective Hamiltonian can be used instead of
Hamiltonian in the interaction picture, for describing the atom-field
interaction. We suppose that the cavity field is initially prepared in a
nonlinear CS, which is not temporally stable. As we will observe, after the
occurrence of the interaction between atom and field, the generated state
involves a superposition of GKCSs which are temporally stable and initial
nonlinear CS. Under specific conditions which may be prepared, the generated
state just includes GKCS. So, in this way we produced the GKCS, successfully.
