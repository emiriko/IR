We predict the elliptic flow parameter v_2 in U+U collisions at
sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV and in Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV using a
hybrid model in which the evolution of the quark gluon plasma is described by
ideal hydrodynamics with a state-of-the-art lattice QCD equation of state, and
the subsequent hadronic stage by a hadron cascade model.
