The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides a common data model for the
integration of "real-time" social and sensor data streams with the Web and with
each other. While there exist numerous protocols and data formats for
exchanging dynamic RDF data, or RDF updates, these options should be examined
carefully in order to enable a Semantic Web equivalent of the high-throughput,
low-latency streams of typical Web 2.0, multimedia, and gaming applications.
This paper contains a brief survey of RDF update formats and a high-level
discussion of both TCP and UDP-based transport protocols for updates. Its main
contribution is the experimental evaluation of a UDP-based architecture which
serves as a real-world example of a high-performance RDF streaming application
in an Internet-scale distributed environment.
