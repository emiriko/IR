This work proposes and analyses a novel approach for the generation of
separable (quantum uncorrelated) photon pairs based on spontaneous parametric
down-conversion in Bragg reflection waveguides composed of semiconductor AlGaN
layers. This platform allows the removal of any spectral correlation between
paired photons that propagate in different spatial modes. The photons can be
designed to show equal or different spectra by tuning the structural parameters
and hence the dispersion of the waveguide.
