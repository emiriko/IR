A class of differentiable solutions is proved for the isentropic Euler
equations in two and three space dimensions. The solutions are explicitly given
in terms of solutions to inviscid Burgers equations, and several directions of
propagation. The relative orientation of the directions is critical. Within the
directional constraints, the Burgers solutions are arbitrary. The several
velocities add, and the pressures combine nonlinearly. These solutions cannot
exist beyond the time when shocks develop in any of the Burgers solutions.
