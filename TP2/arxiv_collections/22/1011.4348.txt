By using a new approach, we demonstrate analytic expressions for slowly
rotating Gauss-Bonnet charged black holes with negative cosmological constant.
Up to the linear order of the rotating parameter a, the mass, Hawking
temperature and entropy of the charged black holes get no corrections from
rotation.
