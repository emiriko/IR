A new approach for the analysis of Langevin-type stochastic processes in the
presence of strong measurement noise is presented. For the case of Gaussian
distributed, exponentially correlated, measurement noise it is possible to
extract the strength and the correlation time of the noise as well as
polynomial approximations of the drift and diffusion functions from the
underlying Langevin equation.
