This paper presents the Pi-graphs, a visual paradigm for the modelling and
verification of mobile systems. The language is a graphical variant of the
Pi-calculus with iterators to express non-terminating behaviors. The
operational semantics of Pi-graphs use ground notions of labelled transition
and bisimulation, which means standard verification techniques can be applied.
We show that bisimilarity is decidable for the proposed semantics, a result
obtained thanks to an original notion of causal clock as well as the automatic
garbage collection of unused names.
