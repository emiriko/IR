We have compared the experimental data on charged particle elliptic flow
parameter (v2) in Au+Au collisions at midrapidity for \surd sNN = 9.2, 19.6,
62.4 and 200 GeV with results from various models in heavy-ion collisions like
UrQMD, AMPT, and HIJING. We observe that the average <v2> from the transport
model UrQMD agrees well with the measurements at \surd sNN = 9.2 GeV but
increasingly falls short of the experimental <v2> values as the beam energy
increases. The difference in <v2> being of the order of 60% at \surd sNN = 200
GeV. The <v2> results from HIJING is consistent with zero, while those from
AMPT with default settings, a model based on HIJING with additional initial and
final state rescattering effects included, gives a <v2> value of about 4% for
all the beam energies studied. This is in contrast to increase in <v2> with
beam energy for the experimental data. A different version of the AMPT model,
which includes partonic effects and quark coalescence as a mechanism of
hadronization, gives higher values of <v2> among the models studied and is in
agreement with the measured <v2> values at \surd sNN = 200 GeV. These studies
show that the experimental < v2 > has substantial contribution from partonic
interactions at \surd sNN = 200 GeV whose magnitude reduces with decrease in
beam energy. We also compare the available data on the transverse momentum and
pseudorapidity dependence of v2 to those from the above models.
