In this paper, we analyze the scalar mesons $f_0(980)$ and $f_0(1500)$ from
the decays $\bar B^0_s \to f_0(980)\pi^0, f_0(1500)\pi^0$ within Perturbative
QCD approach. From the leading order calculations, we find that (a) in the
allowed mixing angle ranges, the branching ratio of $\bar B^0_s\to
f_0(980)\pi^0$ is about $(1.0\sim1.6)\times 10^{-7}$, which is smaller than
that of $\bar B^0_s\to f_0(980)K^0$ (the difference is a few times even one
order); (b) the decay $\bar B^0_s \to f_0(1500)\pi^0$ is better to distinguish
between the lowest lying state or the first excited state for $f_0(1500)$,
because the branching ratios for two scenarios have about one-order difference
in most of the mixing angle ranges; and (c) the direct CP asymmetries of $\bar
B^0_s \to f_0(1500)\pi^0$ for two scenarios also exists great difference. In
scenario II, the variation range of the value ${\cal A} ^{dir}_{CP}(\bar B^0_s
\to f_0(1500)\pi^0)$ according to the mixing angle is very small, except for
the values corresponding to the mixing angles being near $90^\circ$ or
$270^\circ$, while the variation range of ${\cal A} ^{dir}_{CP}(\bar B^0_s \to
f_0(1500)\pi^0)$ in scenario I is very large. Compared with the future data for
the decay $\bar B^0_s \to f_0(1500)\pi^0$, it is ease to determine the nature
of the scalar meson $f_0(1500)$.
