Very metal-poor stars are of obvious importance for many problems in chemical
evolution, star formation, and galaxy evolution. Finding complete samples of
such stars which are also bright enough to allow high-precision individual
analyses is of considerable interest. We demonstrate here that stars with iron
abundances [Fe/H] < -2 dex, and down to below -4 dex, can be efficiently
identified within the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey of bright stars,
without requiring additional confirmatory observations. We determine a
calibration of the equivalent width of the Calcium triplet lines measured from
the RAVE spectra onto true [Fe/H], using high spectral resolution data for a
subset of the stars. These RAVE iron abundances are accurate enough to obviate
the need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. Our initial study has
identified 631 stars with [Fe/H] <= -2, from a RAVE database containing
approximately 200,000 stars. This RAVE-based sample is complete for stars with
[Fe/H] < -2.5, allowing statistical sample analysis. We identify three stars
with [Fe/H] <= -4. Of these, one was already known to be `ultra metal-poor',
one is a known carbon-enhanced metal-poor star, but we obtain [Fe/H]= -4.0,
rather than the published [Fe/H]=-3.3, and derive [C/Fe] = +0.9, and [N/Fe] =
+3.2, and the third is at the limit of our S/N. RAVE observations are on-going
and should prove to be a rich source of bright, easily studied, very metal-poor
stars.
