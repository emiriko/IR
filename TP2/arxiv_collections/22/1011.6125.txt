We have analysed very high-quality HARPS and UVES spectra of 95 solar
analogs, 24 hosting planets and 71 without detected planets, to search for any
possible signature of terrestial planets in the chemical abundances of volatile
and refractory elements with respect to the solar abundances. We demonstrate
that stars with and without planets in this sample show similar mean abundance
ratios, in particular, a sub-sample of 14 planet-host and 14 "single" solar
analogs in the metallicity range 0.14<[Fe/H]<0.36. In addition, two of the
planetary systems in this sub-sample, containing each of them a
super-Earth-like planet with masses in the range ~ 7-11 Earth masses, have
different volatile-to-refratory abundance ratios to what would be expected from
the presence of a terrestial planets. Finally, we check that after removing the
Galactic chemical evolution effects any possible difference in mean abundances,
with respect to solar values, of refratory and volatile elements practically
dissappears.
