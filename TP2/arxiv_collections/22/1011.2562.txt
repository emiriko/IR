With a specific choice of laser parameters resulting into a so-called
exceptional point in the wavelength-intensity plane, it is possible to produce
the coalescence of two Floquet resonances describing the photodissociation of
the molecule Na$_2$, which is one of the candidates for molecular cooling.
Appropriately tuning laser parameters, following a contour around the
exceptional point, the resonances exchange their labels. This represents a
laser control of the vibrational transfer from one field-free state to another,
through an adiabatic transport involving these resonances. The proportion of
undissociated molecules at the end of the pulse is checked through Floquet
adiabatic theory. A vibrational cooling scenario can be proposed based on a
complete vibrational transfer which is predicted, with only 20 percent of
molecules undergoing dissociation.
