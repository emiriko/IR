We study the holomorphic unitary representations of the Jacobi group based on
Siegel-Jacobi domains. Explicit polynomial orthonormal bases of the Fock spaces
based on the Siegel-Jacobi disk are obtained. The scalar holomorphic discrete
series of the Jacobi group for the Siegel-Jacobi disk is constructed and
polynomial orthonormal bases of the representation spaces are given.
