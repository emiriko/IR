This report outlines the use of a relational representation in a Multi-Agent
domain to model the behaviour of the whole system. A desired property in this
systems is the ability of the team members to work together to achieve a common
goal in a cooperative manner. The aim is to define a systematic method to
verify the effective collaboration among the members of a team and comparing
the different multi-agent behaviours. Using external observations of a
Multi-Agent System to analyse, model, recognize agent behaviour could be very
useful to direct team actions. In particular, this report focuses on the
challenge of autonomous unsupervised sequential learning of the team's
behaviour from observations. Our approach allows to learn a symbolic sequence
(a relational representation) to translate raw multi-agent, multi-variate
observations of a dynamic, complex environment, into a set of sequential
behaviours that are characteristic of the team in question, represented by a
set of sequences expressed in first-order logic atoms. We propose to use a
relational learning algorithm to mine meaningful frequent patterns among the
relational sequences to characterise team behaviours. We compared the
performance of two teams in the RoboCup four-legged league environment, that
have a very different approach to the game. One uses a Case Based Reasoning
approach, the other uses a pure reactive behaviour.
