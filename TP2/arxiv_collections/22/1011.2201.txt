At wide separations, planetary-mass and brown dwarf companions to solar type
stars occupy a curious region of parameters space not obviously linked to
binary star formation or solar-system scale planet formation. These companions
provide insight into the extreme case of companion formation (either binary or
planetary), and due to their relative ease of observation when compared to
close companions, they offer a useful template for our expectations of more
typical planets. We present the results from an adaptive optics imaging survey
for wide (50-500 AU) companions to solar type stars in Upper Scorpius. We
report one new discovery of a ~14 M_J companion around GSC 06214-00210, and
confirm that the candidate planetary mass companion 1RXS J160929.1-210524
detected by Lafreniere et al (2008) is in fact co-moving with its primary star.
In our survey, these two detections correspond to ~4% of solar type stars
having companions in the 6-20 M_J mass and 200-500 AU separation range. This
figure is higher than would be expected if brown dwarfs and planetary mass
companions were drawn from an extrapolation of the binary mass function.
Finally, we discuss implications for the formation of these objects.
