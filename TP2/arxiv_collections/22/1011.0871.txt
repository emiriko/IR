We calculate the magnetization torque due to the spin polarization of the
itinerant electrons by deriving the kinetic spin Bloch equations based on the
$s$-$d$ model. We find that the first-order gradient of the magnetization
inhomogeneity gives rise to the current-induced torques, which are consistent
to the previous works. At the second-order gradient, we find an effective
magnetic field perpendicular to the spin stiffness filed. This field is
proportional to the nonadiabatic parameter $\beta$. We show that this vertical
spin stiffness term can significantly modify the domain-wall structure in
ferromagnetic semiconductors and hence should be included in the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in studying the magnetization dynamics.
