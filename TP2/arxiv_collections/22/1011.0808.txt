We discuss a collective effect, which can be possible in hadron--hadron
collisions at superhigh energies, that is, a quasi-diffraction production of
several white clusters of quarks and gluons. Being transformed into hadrons,
such clusters are sources of the fastest particles, which move forward nearly
parallel to each other.
