In this paper we introduce a ten-parameter family of L\'{e}vy processes for
which we obtain Wiener-Hopf factors and distribution of the supremum process in
semi-explicit form. This family allows an arbitrary behavior of small jumps and
includes processes similar to the generalized tempered stable, KoBoL and CGMY
processes. Analytically it is characterized by the property that the
characteristic exponent is a meromorphic function, expressed in terms of beta
and digamma functions. We prove that the Wiener-Hopf factors can be expressed
as infinite products over roots of a certain transcendental equation, and the
density of the supremum process can be computed as an exponentially converging
infinite series. In several special cases when the roots can be found
analytically, we are able to identify the Wiener-Hopf factors and distribution
of the supremum in closed form. In the general case we prove that all the roots
are real and simple, and we provide localization results and asymptotic
formulas which allow an efficient numerical evaluation. We also derive a
convergence acceleration algorithm for infinite products and a simple and
efficient procedure to compute the Wiener-Hopf factors for complex values of
parameters. As a numerical example we discuss computation of the density of the
supremum process.
