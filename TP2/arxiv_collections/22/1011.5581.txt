For the 451 stars of the HARPS high precision program, we study correlations
between the radial-velocity (RV) variation and other parameters of the Cross
Correlated Function (CCF). After a careful target selection, we found a very
good correlation between the slope of the RV-activity index (log(R'HK)
correlation and the Teff for dwarf stars. This correlation allow us to correct
RV from magnetic cycles given the activity index and the Teff.
