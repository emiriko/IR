To harmonize the individual architectures of the different commands,
services, and agencies dealing with the development and procurement of Command,
Control, Communications, Computing, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and
Intelligence (C4ISR) systems, the C4ISR Architecture Framework was developed
based on existing and matured modeling techniques and methods. Within a short
period, NATO adapted this method family as the NATO Consultation, Command, and
Control (C3) System Architecture Framework to harmonize the efforts of the
different nations. Based on these products, for every system to be fielded to
be used in the US Armed Forces, a C4I Support Plan (C4ISP) has to be developed
enabling the integration of the special system into the integrated C4I
Architecture. The tool set proposed by these architecture frameworks connects
operational views of the military user, system views of the developers, and the
technical views for standards and integration methods needed to make the
network centric system of systems work. The tools are therefore logically a
valuable backbone for Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A). Their
application is not limited to C4ISR systems; they can be used to define
requirements and connected solutions and algorithms of Modeling and Simulation
(M&S) systems as well. Especially for M&S systems to be used in connection with
C4ISR system, the use of the C4ISR Architecture Framework would not only be a
help, but can nearly be seen to be necessary to avoid double work and foster
reuse and interoperability from the first stages of a project on. To enable the
reader to build his own picture, the respective tools used and their
application in the context of VV&A will be explained in form of an overview.
