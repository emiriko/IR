Optical lattices play a versatile role in advancing our understanding of
correlated quantum matter. The recent implementation of orbital degrees of
freedom in chequerboard and hexagonal optical lattices opens up a new thrust
towards discovering novel quantum states of matter, which have no prior analogs
in solid state electronic materials. Here, we demonstrate that an exotic
topological semimetal emerges as a parity-protected gapless state in the
orbital bands of a two-dimensional fermionic optical lattice. The new quantum
state is characterized by a parabolic band-degeneracy point with Berry flux
$2\pi$, in sharp contrast to the $\pi$ flux of Dirac points as in graphene. We
prove that the appearance of this topological liquid is universal for all
lattices with D$_4$ point group symmetry as long as orbitals with opposite
parities hybridize strongly with each other and the band degeneracy is
protected by odd parity. Turning on inter-particle repulsive interactions, the
system undergoes a phase transition to a topological insulator whose
experimental signature includes chiral gapless domain-wall modes, reminiscent
of quantum Hall edge states.
