Generalizing the cyclically competing three-species model (often referred to
as the rock-paper-scissors game), we consider a simple system of population
dynamics without spatial structures that involves four species. Unlike the
previous model, the four form alliance pairs which resemble partnership in the
game of Bridge. In a finite system with discrete stochastic dynamics, all but 4
of the absorbing states consist of coexistence of a partner-pair. From a master
equation, we derive a set of mean field equations of evolution. This approach
predicts complex time dependence of the system and that the surviving
partner-pair is the one with the larger product of their strengths (rates of
consumption). Simulations typically confirm these scenarios. Beyond that, much
richer behavior is revealed, including complicated extinction probabilities and
non-trivial distributions of the population ratio in the surviving pair. These
discoveries naturally raise a number of intriguing questions, which in turn
suggests a variety of future avenues of research, especially for more realistic
models of multispecies competition in nature.
