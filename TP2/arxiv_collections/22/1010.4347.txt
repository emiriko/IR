We report on the status of the Salt Sensor Array (SalSA), a proposed
experiment for detecting ultra-high energy neutrinos through the radio
\v{C}erenkov technique with an array of radio-microwave antennas embedded in a
large, naturally occurring salt formation. We review the measurements to date
aimed at assessing SalSA's feasibility, including a return visit of the Hockley
Salt Mine in Hockley, Texas, and discuss the current status of the project.
