It is known that the maximum classical mutual information that can be
achieved between measurements on a pair of quantum systems can drastically
underestimate the quantum mutual information between those systems. In this
article, we quantify this distinction between classical and quantum information
by demonstrating that after removing a logarithmic-sized quantum system from
one half of a pair of perfectly correlated bitstrings, even the most sensitive
pair of measurements might only yield outcomes essentially independent of each
other. This effect is a form of information locking but the definition we use
is strictly stronger than those used previously. Moreover, we find that this
property is generic, in the sense that it occurs when removing a random
subsystem. As such, the effect might be relevant to statistical mechanics or
black hole physics. Previous work on information locking had always assumed a
uniform message. In this article, we assume only a min-entropy bound on the
message and also explore the effect of entanglement. We find that classical
information is strongly locked almost until it can be completely decoded. As a
cryptographic application of these results, we exhibit a quantum key
distribution protocol that is "secure" if the eavesdropper's information about
the secret key is measured using the accessible information but in which
leakage of even a logarithmic number of key bits compromises the secrecy of all
the others.
