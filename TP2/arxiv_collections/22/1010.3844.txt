We present the complete next-to-next-to-leading-order calculation of the
correlation function of two Polyakov loops for temperatures smaller than the
inverse distance between the loops and larger than the Coulomb potential. We
discuss the relationship of this correlator with the singlet and octet
potentials which we obtain in an Effective Field Theory framework based on
finite-temperature potential Non-Relativistic QCD, showing that the Polyakov
loop correlator can be re-expressed, at the leading order in a multipole
expansion, as a sum of singlet and octet contributions. We also revisit the
calculation of the expectation value of the Polyakov loop at
next-to-next-to-leading order.
