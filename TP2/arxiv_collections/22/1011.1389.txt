We settle a long standing issue concerning the traditional derivation of
non-compact non-linear sigma models in the theory of disordered electron
systems: the hyperbolic Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation of
Pruisken-Schaefer type. Only recently the validity of such transformations was
proved in the case of U(p,q) (non-compact unitary) and O(p,q) (non-compact
orthogonal) symmetry. In this article we give a proof for general non-compact
symmetry groups. Moreover we show that the Pruisken-Schaefer type
transformations are related to other variants of the HS transformation by
deformation of the domain of integration. In particular we clarify the origin
of surprising sign factors which were recently discovered in the case of
orthogonal symmetry.
