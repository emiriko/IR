We know that dark matter constitutes 85% of all the matter in the Universe,
but we do not know of what it is made. Amongst the many Dark Matter candidates
proposed, WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) occupy a special place,
as they arise naturally from well motivated extensions of the standard model of
particle physics. With the advent of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and a
new generation of astroparticle experiments, the moment of truth has come for
WIMPs: either we will discover them in the next five to ten years, or we will
witness the inevitable decline of WIMP paradigm.
