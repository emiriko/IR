Since weak measurements are known to produce measurement values that can be
much larger than the maximal eigenvalues of the measured observable, it is an
interesting question how this enhancement of the measurement signal relates to
the sensitivity of quantum measurements as investigated in the field of quantum
metrology. In this presentation, it is pointed out that the estimation of a
small interaction parameter using weak measurements actually corresponds to
standard quantum metrology, where the logarithmic derivatives of the final
measurement probabilities are proportional to the corresponding weak values.
The analysis of the general weak measurement formalism then shows that extreme
weak values do not improve the sensitivity. Instead, all final measurements
with real weak values have the same sensitivity as a final measurement of the
eigenvalues. This result supports the view that real weak values can be
interpreted as precise, zero uncertainty estimates of a quantum observable,
despite their deviation from the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator.
