Almost 40 years ago, Gribov and colleagues at the Leningrad Nuclear Physics
Institute developed the ideas that led to the
Dokhsitzer-Gribov-Altarelli-Parisi the Baltisky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov equations.
These equations describe the evolution of the distributions for quarks and
gluon inside a hadron to increased resolution scale of a probe or to smaller
values of the fractional momentum of a hadronic constituent. I motivate and
discuss the generalization required of these equations needed for high energy
processes when the density of constituents is large. This leads to a theory of
saturation realized by the Color Glass Condensate
