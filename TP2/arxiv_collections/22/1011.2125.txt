We study the changes in the spatial distribution of vortices in a rotating
Bose-Einstein condensate due to an increasing anisotropy of the trapping
potential. Once the rotational symmetry is broken, we find that the vortex
system undergoes a rich variety of structural changes, including the formation
of zig-zag and linear configurations. These spatial re-arrangements are well
signaled by the change in the behavior of the vortex-pattern eigenmodes against
the anisotropy parameter. The existence of such structural changes opens up
possibilities for the coherent exploitation of effective many-body systems
based on vortex patterns.
