In this article we study the space of left- and bi-invariant orderings on a
torsion-free nilpotent group $G$. We will show that generally the set of such
orderings is equipped with a faithful action of the automorphism group of $G$.
We prove a result which allows us to establish the same conclusion when $G$ is
assumed to be merely residually torsion-free nilpotent. In particular, we
obtain faithful actions of mapping class groups of surfaces. We will draw
connections between the structure of orderings on residually torsion-free
nilpotent, hyperbolic groups and their Gromov boundaries, and we show that in
those cases a faithful $\Aut(G)$-action on the boundary is equivalent to a
faithful $\Aut(G)$ action on the space of left--invariant orderings.
