The formulation of quantum mechanics within the framework of entropic
dynamics includes several new elements. In this paper we concentrate on one of
them: the implications for the theory of time. Entropic time is introduced as a
book-keeping device to keep track of the accumulation of changes. One new
feature is that, unlike other concepts of time appearing in the so-called
fundamental laws of physics, entropic time incorporates a natural distinction
between past and future.
