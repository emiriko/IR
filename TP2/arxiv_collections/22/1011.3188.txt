Spin-valve is a microelectronic device in which high and low resistance
states are realized by utilizing both charge and spin of carriers. Spin-valve
structures used in modern hard drive read-heads and magnetic random access
memories comprise two ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes whose relative
magnetization orientations can be switched between parallel and antiparallel
configurations, yielding the desired giant or tunneling magnetoresistance
effect. In this paper we demonstrate >100$% spin-valve-like signal in a
NiFe/IrMn/MgO/Pt stack with an antiferromagnet (AFM) on one side and a
non-magnetic metal on the other side of the tunnel barrier. FM moments in NiFe
are reversed by external fields <50mT and the exchange-spring effect of NiFe on
IrMn induces rotation of AFM moments in IrMn which is detected by the measured
tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR). Our work demonstrates a
spintronic element whose transport characteristics are governed by an AFM. It
demonstrates that sensitivity to low magnetic fields can be combined with
large, spin-orbit coupling induced magneto-transport anisotropy using a single
magnetic electrode. The AFM-TAMR provides means to study magnetic
characteristics of AFM films by an electronic transport measurement.
