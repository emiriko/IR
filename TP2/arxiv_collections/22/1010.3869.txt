The magnetocaloric effect in alternating magnetic fields has been
investigated in Pr1-xAgxMnO3 manganites with x=0.05-0.25. The stepwise reversal
of the sign of the magnetocaloric effect has been revealed in a weakly doped
sample (x=0.05) at low temperatures (~80 K). This reversal is attributed to the
coexistence of the ferromagnetic and canted antiferromagnetic phases with
different critical temperatures.
