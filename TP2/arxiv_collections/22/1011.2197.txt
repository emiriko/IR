We use two fundamental theoretical frameworks to study the finite-size
(shell) properties of the unitary gas in a periodic box: 1) an ab initio
Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculation for boxes containing 4 to 130 particles
provides a precise and complete characterization of the finite-size behavior,
and 2) a new Density Functional Theory (DFT) fully encapsulates these effects.
The DFT predicts vanishing shell structure for systems comprising more than 50
particles, and allows us to extrapolate the QMC results to the thermodynamic
limit, providing the tightest bound to date on the ground-state energy of the
unitary gas: \xi_S <= 0.383(1). We also apply the new functional to
few-particle harmonically trapped systems, comparing with previous
calculations.
