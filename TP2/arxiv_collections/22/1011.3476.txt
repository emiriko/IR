The circumnuclear starburst of M83 (NGC 5236), the nearest such example (4.6
Mpc), constitutes an ideal site for studying the massive star IMF at high
metallicity (12+log[O/H]=9.1$\pm$0.2, Bresolin & Kennicutt 2002). We analyzed
archival HST/STIS FUV imaging and spectroscopy of 13 circumnuclear star
clusters in M83. We compared the observed spectra with two types of single
stellar population (SSP) models, semi-empirical models, which are based on an
empirical library of Galactic O and B stars observed with IUE (Robert et al.
1993), and theoretical models, which are based on a new theoretical UV library
of hot massive stars described in Leitherer et al. (2010) and computed with
WM-Basic (Pauldrach et al. 2001). The models were generated with Starburst99
(Leitherer & Chen 2009). We derived the reddenings, the ages, and the masses of
the clusters from model fits to the FUV spectroscopy, as well as from optical
HST/WFC3 photometry.
