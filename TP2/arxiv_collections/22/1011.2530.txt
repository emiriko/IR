Context: The baryonic dark matter dominating the structures of galaxies is
widely considered as mysterious, but hints for it have been in fact detected in
several astronomical observations at optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths.
We call attention to the nature of galaxy merging, the observed rapid
microlensing of a quasar, the detection of "cometary knots" in planetary
nebulae, and the Lyman-alpha clouds as optical phenomena revealing the compact
objects. Radio observations of "extreme scattering events" and "parabolic arcs"
and microwave observations of "cold dust cirrus" clouds are observed at 15 - 20
K temperatures are till now not considered in a unifying picture. Aims: The
theory of gravitational hydrodynamics predicts galactic dark matter arises from
Jeans clusters that are made up of almost a trillion micro brown dwarfs (mBDs)
of earth weight. It is intended to explain the aforementioned anomalous
observations and to make predictions within this framework. Methods: We employ
analytical isothermal modeling to estimate various effects. Results: Estimates
of their total number show that they comprise enough mass to constitute the
missing baryonic matter. Mysterious radio events are explained by mBD pair
merging in the Galaxy. The "dust" temperature of cold galaxy halos arises from
a thermostat setting due to a slow release of latent heat at the 14 K gas to
solid transition at the mBD surface. The proportionality of the central black
hole mass of a galaxy and its number of globular clusters is explained. The
visibility of an early galaxy at redshift 8.6 is obvious with most hydrogen
locked up in mBDs. Conclusions: Numerical simulations of various steps would
further test the approach. It looks promising to redo MACHO searches against
the Magellanic clouds.
