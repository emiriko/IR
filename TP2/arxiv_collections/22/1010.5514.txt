Causal set theory provides a model of discrete spacetime in which spacetime
events are represented by elements of a causal set---a locally finite,
partially ordered set in which the partial order represents the causal
relationships between events. The work presented here describes a model for
matter on a causal set, specifically a theory of quantum scalar fields on a
causal set spacetime background.
  The work starts with a discrete path integral model for particles on a causal
set. Here quantum mechanical amplitudes are assigned to trajectories within the
causal set. By summing these over all trajectories between two spacetime events
we obtain a causal set particle propagator. With a suitable choice of
amplitudes this is shown to agree (in an appropriate sense) with the retarded
propagator for the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski spacetime.
  This causal set propagator is then used to define a causal set analogue of
the Pauli-Jordan function that appears in continuum quantum field theories. A
quantum scalar field is then modelled by an algebra of operators which satisfy
three simple conditions (including a bosonic commutation rule). Defining
time-ordering through a linear extension of the causal set these field
operators are used to define a causal set Feynman propagator. Evidence is
presented which shows agreement (in a suitable sense) between the causal set
Feynman propagator and the continuum Feynman propagator for the Klein-Gordon
equation in Minkowski spacetime. The Feynman propagator is obtained using the
eigendecomposition of the Pauli-Jordan function, a method which can also be
applied in continuum-based theories.
  The free field theory is extended to include interacting scalar fields. This
leads to a suggestion for a non-perturbative S-matrix on a causal set. Models
for continuum-based phenomenology and spin-half particles on a causal set are
also presented.
