The CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider collected in the first months
of operation a luminosity of about 300/nb. The first results in the context of
the B physics obtained with these data are presented. The di-muon resonances
from J/psi and Y decays are presented and their total and differential
cross-sections measured. The inclusive B production have also being
investigated and two independent measurements are reported. Muons in jets are
used as a way to identify events with B content, the kinematic properties
(ptRel) of the muons are used to separate the B production from other processes
producing muons in jets. The second measurement of inclusive B production is
done using b-tagging techniques and higher energy jets. The two measurements
cover different phase spaces, comparison with LO and NLO prediction are also
presented.
