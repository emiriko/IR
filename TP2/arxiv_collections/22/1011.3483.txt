Meteoritic data, especially regarding chondrules and calcium-rich,
aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), and isotopic evidence for short-lived
radionuclides (SLRs) in the solar nebula, potentially can constrain how
planetary systems form. Intepretation of these data demands an astrophysical
model, and the "X-wind" model of Shu et al. (1996) and collaborators has been
advanced to explain the origin of chondrules, CAIs and SLRs. It posits that
chondrules and CAIs were thermally processed < 0.1 AU from the protostar, then
flung by a magnetocentrifugal outflow to the 2-3 AU region to be incorporated
into chondrites. Here we critically examine key assumptions and predictions of
the X-wind model. We find a number of internal inconsistencies: theory and
observation show no solid material exists at 0.1 AU; particles at 0.1 AU cannot
escape being accreted into the star; particles at 0.1 AU will collide at speeds
high enough to destroy them; thermal sputtering will prevent growth of
particles; and launching of particles in magnetocentrifugal outflows is not
modeled, and may not be possible. We also identify a number of incorrect
predictions of the X-wind model: the oxygen fugacity where CAIs form is orders
of magnitude too oxidizing; chondrule cooling rates are orders of magnitude
lower than those experienced by barred olivine chondrules; chondrule-matrix
complementarity is not predicted; and the SLRs are not produced in their
observed proportions. We conclude that the X-wind model is not relevant to
chondrule and CAI formation and SLR production. We discuss more plausible
models for chondrule and CAI formation and SLR production.
