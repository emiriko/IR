We determine all Hermitian $\mathcal{O}_{\Q(\sqrt{d})}$-matrices for which
every eigenvalue is in the interval [-2,2], for each d in {-2,-7,-11,-15\}. To
do so, we generalise charged signed graphs to $\mathcal{L}$-graphs for
appropriate finite sets $\mathcal{L}$, and classify all $\mathcal{L}$-graphs
satisfying the same eigenvalue constraints. We find that, as in the integer
case, any such matrix / graph is contained in a maximal example with all
eigenvalues $\pm2$.
