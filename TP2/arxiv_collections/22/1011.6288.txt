Diagnostic techniques for stellar magnetic fields based upon
spectropolarimetry. We propose and explore a new technique based upon the
linear polarization emitted in Hanle-sensitive lines in disk-integrated stars
where a dipolar magnetic field breaks the rotational symmetry of the resonance
scattering polarization. A star with a simple dipolar field and a 1-0 spectral
line are used to compute polarization amplitudes and angles.Predicted
amplitudes are low but within reach of present instruments. A new application
of the Hanle effect is proposed and analyzed, a tool that allows measuring of
some of the weakest stellar magnetic fields.
