The momentum spectra of particles in different high energy processes, such as
e^+e^- annihilation, pp and nuclear collisions in the limit p,p_T -> 0 exhibit
similar properties because of the dominant role of coherent soft gluon
bremsstrahlung. We observe the following general features: the inclusive
particle density approaches a limiting behaviour and becomes independent of
primary collision energy; furthermore, it becomes proportional to the QCD
colour factors C_A,C_F which appear in the Born term for the respective minimal
partonic processes. In this limit, nuclear collisions reach with good accuracy
participant (``wounded nucleon'') scaling. Particle ratios in the low momentum
region display a universal behaviour. Future measurements at the LHC will
provide crucial tests for the contributions from additional incoherent
multi-component processes.
