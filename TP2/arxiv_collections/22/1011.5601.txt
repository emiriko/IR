We investigate the phase diagram of the so-called
Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at finite temperature and nonzero chemical
potential with three quark flavours. Chiral and deconfinement phase transitions
are discussed, and the relevant order-like parameters are analyzed. The results
are compared with simple thermodynamic expectations and lattice data. A special
attention is payed to the critical end point: as the strength of the
flavour-mixing interaction becomes weaker, the critical end point moves to low
temperatures and can even disappear.
