We present a new method for determining K --> pi pi matrix elements from
lattice simulations that is less costly than direct simulations of K --> pi pi
at physical kinematics. It improves, however, upon the traditional "indirect''
approach of constructing the K --> pi pi matrix elements using NLO SU(3) ChPT,
which can lead to large higher-order chiral corrections. Using the explicit
example of the Delta I =3/2 (27,1) operator to illustrate the method, we obtain
a value for Re(A_2) that agrees with experiment and has a total uncertainty of
~20%. Although our simulations use domain-wall valence quarks on the MILC
asqtad-improved gauge configurations, this method is more general and can be
applied to calculations with any fermion formulation.
