We study the quench dynamics of the topological quantum phase transition in
the two-dimensional transverse Wen-plaquette model, which has a phase
transition from a Z2 topologically ordered to a spin-polarized state. By
mapping the Wen-plaquette model onto a one-dimensional quantum Ising model, we
calculate the expectation value of the plaquette operator Fi during a slowly
quenching process from a topologically ordered state. A logarithmic scaling law
of quench dynamics near the quantum phase transition is found, which is
analogous to the well-known static critical behavior of the specific heat in
the one-dimensional quantum Ising model.
