At the precision reached in current lattice QCD calculations, electromagnetic
effects are becoming numerically relevant. We will present preliminary results
for electromagnetic corrections to light hadron masses, based on simulations in
which a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ degree of freedom is superimposed on $N_f=2+1$ QCD
configurations from the BMW collaboration.
