In terms of operator, the two complementary quantities, the predictability
and visibility, are reinvestigated in a two-way interferometer. One Hermitian
operator and one non-Hermitian operator (composed of two Hermitian operators)
are introduced for the predictability and visibility, respectively. The
predictability and visibility can not be measured exactly simultaneously, due
to the non-commutation between the two operators. The sum of the variances of
the predictability and visibility (the total variance), is used to measure the
uncertainty, which is linked to the complementarity relation through the
equation, $(\delta_P)^2+(\delta_Vf)^2+P^2+V^2=2$ . This new description for the
predictability and visibility connects the complementarity and the uncertainty
relations, although neither of them can be derived directly from the other.
