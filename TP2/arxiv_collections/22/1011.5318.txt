We investigate in which cases the boundary of a multiply connected wandering
domain of an entire function is uniformly perfect. We give a general criterion
implying that it is not uniformly perfect. This criterion applies in particular
to examples of multiply connected wandering domains given by Baker. We also
provide examples of infinitely connected wandering domains whose boundary is
uniformly perfect.
