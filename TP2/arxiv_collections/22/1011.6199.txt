We present the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the associated
production of the vector gauge boson ($Z/W^\pm$) and the graviton in the large
extra dimension model at the LHC. We estimate the impact of the QCD corrections
on the total cross sections as well as the differential distributions of the
gauge bosons and find that they are significant. We also study the dependence
of the cross sections on the arbitrary factorization scale and show the
reduction in the scale uncertainties at NLO level. Further, we discuss the
ultraviolet sensitivity of the theoretical predictions.
