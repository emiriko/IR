Pair creation of scalar particles in a boost-invariant electric field which
is confined in the forward light cone is studied. We present the proper-time
evolution of momentum distributions of created particles, which preserve the
boost invariance of the background field. The two-particle correlation of the
created particles is also calculated. We find that long-range rapidity
correlations may arise from the Schwinger mechanism in the boost-invariant
electric field.
