The X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard the Hinode satellite is an X-ray imager
that observes the solar corona with unprecedentedly high angular resolution
(consistent with its 1" pixel size). XRT has nine X-ray analysis filters with
different temperature responses. One of the most significant scientific
features of this telescope is its capability of diagnosing coronal temperatures
from less than 1 MK to more than 10 MK, which has never been accomplished
before. To make full use of this capability, accurate calibration of the
coronal temperature response of XRT is indispensable and is presented in this
article. The effect of on-orbit contamination is also taken into account in the
calibration. On the basis of our calibration results, we review the
coronal-temperature-diagnostic capability of XRT.
