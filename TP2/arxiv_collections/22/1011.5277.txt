The pion-pion scattering phase shift is computed using LapH propagators. The
LapH method for computing quark propagators is used to form two-particle
correlation functions with a number of different operators. Excited state
energies of two-particle states on 2+1 dynamical, anisotropic lattices (Mpi=390
MeV) are computed to determine the phase shift in the isospin-2 channel. The
signal for t-to-t diagrams for the isospin-0 channel are also presented to
demonstrate the efficacy of the stochastic LapH method which combines LapH with
diluted Z4 noise sources.
