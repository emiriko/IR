The results of the first search for long-lived gluinos produced in 7 TeV pp
collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider are presented. The search looks
for evidence of long-lived particles that stop in the CMS detector and decay in
the quiescent periods between beam crossings. In a dataset with a peak
instantaneous luminosity of 10^{32} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, an integrated luminosity of
10 inverse picobarns, and a search interval corresponding to 62 hours of LHC
operation, no significant excess above background was observed. Limits at the
95% confidence level on gluino pair production over 13 orders of magnitude of
gluino lifetime are set. For a mass difference between the gluino and the
neutralino greater than 100 GeV/c^2, and assuming a branching ratio for gluino
to gluon+neutralino of 100%, gluinos of mass less than 370 GeV/c^2 are excluded
for lifetimes from 10 microseconds to 1000 s.
