The implications of chiral symmetry breaking and SU(3) symmetry breaking have
been studied in the chiral constituent quark model ($\chi$CQM). The role of
hidden strangeness component has been investigated for the scalar matrix
elements of the nucleon with an emphasis on the meson-nucleon sigma terms. The
$\chi$CQM is able to give a qualitative and quantitative description of the
"quark sea" generation through chiral symmetry breaking. The significant
contribution of the strangeness is consistent with the recent available
experimental observations.
