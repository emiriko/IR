We use a combination of deep optical and near-infrared light profiles for a
morphologically diverse sample of Virgo cluster galaxies to study the
radially-resolved stellar populations of cluster galaxies over a wide range of
galaxy structure. We find that, in the median, the age gradients of Virgo
galaxies are either flat (lenticulars and Sa-Sb spirals) or positive
(ellipticals, Sbc+Sc spirals, gas-rich dwarfs, and irregulars), while all
galaxy types have a negative median metallicity gradient. Comparison of the
galaxy stellar population diagnostics (age, metallicity, and gradients thereof)
against structural and environmental parameters also reveals that the ages of
gas-rich systems depend mainly on their atomic gas deficiencies. Conversely,
the metallicities of Virgo gas-poor galaxies depend on their concentrations,
luminosities, and surface brightnesses. The stellar population gradients of all
Virgo galaxies exhibit no dependence on either their structure or environment.
We interpret these stellar population data for Virgo galaxies in the context of
popular formation and evolution scenarios, and suggest that gas-poor giants
grew hierarchically (through dissipative starbursts), gas-poor dwarfs have
descended from at least two different production channels (e.g., environmental
transformation and merging), while spirals formed inside-out, but with star
formation in the outskirts of a significant fraction of the population having
been quenched due to ram pressure stripping. (Abridged)
