We shall use symmetry breaking as a tool to attack the problem of identifying
the topology of chaotic scatteruing with more then two degrees of freedom.
specifically we discuss the structure of the homoclinic/heteroclinic tangle and
the connection between the chaotic invariant set, the scattering functions and
the singularities in the cross section for a class of scattering systems with
one open and two closed degrees of freedom.
