In this paper the conditions, under which non-topological solitons are absent
in the Yang-Mills theory coupled to a non-linear scalar field in Minkowski
space, are obtained in a very simple way. It is also shown that non-topological
solitons are absent in the theory describing the massive complex vector field
coupled to the electromagnetic field in Minkowski space.
