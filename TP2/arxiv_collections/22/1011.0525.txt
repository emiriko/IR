We show that the compositions of positive integers may be interpreted in
terms of powers of some power series, over arbitrary commutative ring. As
consequences, several closed formulas for the compositions as well as for the
generalized compositions with a fixed number of parts are derived. Some results
on compositions obtained in some recent papers are consequences of these
formulas.
