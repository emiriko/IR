We study the photon counting noise in optical interferometers used for
gravitational wave detection. In order to reduce quantum noise a squeezed
vacuum state is injected into the usually unused input port. Here, we
specifically investigate the so called `dark port case', when the beam splitter
is oriented close to 90{\deg} to the incoming laser beam, such that nearly all
photons go to one output port of the interferometer, and only a small fraction
of photons is seen in the other port (`dark port'). For this case it had been
suggested that signal amplification is possible without concurrent noise
amplification [R.Barak and Y.Ben-Aryeh, J.Opt.Soc.Am.B25(361)2008]. We show
that by injection of a squeezed vacuum state into the second input port,
counting noise is reduced for large values of the squeezing factor, however the
signal is not amplified. Signal strength only depends on the intensity of the
laser beam.
