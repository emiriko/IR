I present results for the resummation of soft-gluon contributions to QCD
hard-scattering cross sections at next-to-next-to-leading logarithm accuracy. A
key ingredient is the calculation of two-loop soft anomalous dimensions for the
partonic processes. Explicit expressions and applications are provided for
processes that involve massless partons and/or massive quarks.
