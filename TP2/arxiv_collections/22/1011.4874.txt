For paving the way to novel applications in quantum simulation, computation,
and technology, increasingly large quantum systems have to be steered with high
precision. It is a typical task amenable to numerical optimal control to turn
the time course of pulses, i.e. piecewise constant control amplitudes,
iteratively into an optimised shape. Here, we present the first comparative
study of optimal control algorithms for a wide range of finite-dimensional
applications. We focus on the most commonly used algorithms: GRAPE methods
which update all controls concurrently, and KROTOV-type methods which do so
sequentially. Guidelines for their use are given and open research questions
are pointed out. --- Moreover we introduce a novel unifying algorithmic
framework, DYNAMO (dynamic optimisation platform) designed to provide the
quantum-technology community with a convenient MATLAB-based toolset for optimal
control. In addition, it gives researchers in optimal-control techniques a
framework for benchmarking and comparing new proposed algorithms to the
state-of-the-art. It allows for a mix-and-match approach with various types of
gradients, update and step-size methods as well as subspace choices.
