We present theoretical analysis of the normal state resistivity in multiband
superconductors in the framework of Eliashberg theory. The results are compared
with measurements of the temperature dependence of normal state resistivity of
high-purity Ba$_{0.68}$K$_{0.32}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ single crystals with the
highest reported transition temperature $T_c$ = 38.5 K. The experimental data
demonstrate strong deviations from the Bloch-Gr\"{u}neisen behavior, namely the
tendency to saturation of the resistivity at high temperatures. The observed
behavior of the resistivity is explained within the two band scenario when the
first band is strongly coupled and relatively clean, while the second band is
weakly coupled and is characterized by much stronger impurity scattering.
