There are many examples of optimization problems whose associated polyhedra
can be described much nicer, and with way less inequalities, by projections of
higher dimensional polyhedra than this would be possible in the original space.
However, currently not many general tools to construct such extended
formulations are available. In this paper, we develop a framework of polyhedral
relations that generalizes inductive constructions of extended formulations via
projections, and we particularly elaborate on the special case of reflection
relations. The latter ones provide polynomial size extended formulations for
several polytopes that can be constructed as convex hulls of the unions of
(exponentially) many copies of an input polytope obtained via sequences of
reflections at hyperplanes. We demonstrate the use of the framework by deriving
small extended formulations for the G-permutahedra of all finite reflection
groups G (generalizing both Goeman's extended formulation of the permutahedron
of size O(n log n) and Ben-Tal and Nemirovski's extended formulation with O(k)
inequalities for the regular 2^k-gon) and for Huffman-polytopes (the convex
hulls of the weight-vectors of Huffman codes).
