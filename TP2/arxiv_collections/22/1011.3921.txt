Starting with the definition of quaternion gauge theory, we have undertaken
the study of SU(2)_{e}\times SU(2)_{m}\times U(1)_{e}\times U(1)_{m} in terms
of the simultaneous existence of electric and magnetic charges along with their
Yang - Mills counterparts. As such, we have developed the gauge theory in terms
of four coupling constants associated with four - gauge symmetry
SU(2)_{e}\times SU(2)_{m}\times U(1)_{e}\times U(1)_{m}. Accordingly, we have
made an attempt to obtain the abelian and non - Abelian gauge structures for
the particles carrying simultaneously the electric and magnetic charges (namely
dyons). Starting from the Lagrangian density of two SU(2)\times U(1) gauge
theories responsible for the existence of electric and magnetic charges, we
have discussed the consistent theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking and Higgs
mechanism in order to generate the masses. From the symmetry breaking, we have
generated the two electromagnetic fields, the two massive vector W^{\pm} and
Z^{0} bosons fields and the Higgs scalar fields.
