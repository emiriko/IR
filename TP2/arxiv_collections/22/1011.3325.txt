Cosmic Ray transport in curved background magnetic fields is investigated
using numerical Monte-Carlo simulation techniques. Special emphasis is laid on
the Solar system, where the curvature of the magnetic field can be described in
terms of the Parker spiral. Using such geometries, parallel and perpendicular
diffusion coefficients have to be re-defined using the arc length of the field
lines as the parallel displacement and the distance between field lines as the
perpendicular displacement. Furthermore, the turbulent magnetic field is
incorporated using a WKB approach for the field strength. Using a test-particle
simulation, the diffusion coefficients are then calculated by averaging over a
large number of particles starting at the same radial distance from the Sun and
over a large number of turbulence realizations, thus enabling one to infer the
effects due to the curvature of the magnetic fields and associated drift
motions.
