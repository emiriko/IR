We study the dynamics of ultracold attractive atoms in a weakly linked two
potential wells. We consider an unbalanced initial state and monitor dynamics
of the population difference between the two wells. The average imbalance
between wells undergoes damped oscillations, like in a classical counterpart,
but then it revives almost to the initial value. We explain in details the
whole behavior using three different models of the system. Furthermore we
investigate the sensitivity of the revivals on the decoherence caused by one-
and three-body losses. We include the dissipative processes using appropriate
master equations and solve them using the stochastic wave approximation method.
