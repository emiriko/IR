We study the thermodynamic properties of a small superconducting metallic
grain using a quantum Monte Carlo method. The grain is described by the
universal Hamiltonian, containing pairing and ferromagnetic exchange
correlations. In particular, we study how the thermodynamic signatures of
pairing correlations are affected by the spin exchange interaction. We find the
exchange interaction effects to be qualitatively different in the BCS and
fluctuation-dominated regimes of pairing correlations.
