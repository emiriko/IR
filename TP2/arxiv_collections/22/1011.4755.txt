We investigate the feasibility of implementing an elementary building block
for quantum information processing. The combination of a deterministic single
photon source based on vacuum stimulated adiabatic rapid passage, and a quantum
memory based on electromagnetically induced transparency in atomic vapour is
outlined. Both systems are able to produce and process temporally shaped
wavepackets which provides a way to maintain the indistinguishability of
retrieved and original photons. We also propose an efficient and robust
`repeat-until-success' quantum computation scheme based on this hybrid
architecture.
