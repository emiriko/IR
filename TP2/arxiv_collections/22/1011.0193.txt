We report the orbital parameters for ROXR1 14 and RX J1622.7-2325Nw, two
young, low-mass, and double-lined spectroscopic binaries recently discovered in
the Ophiuchus star forming region. Accurate orbital solutions were determined
from over a dozen high-resolution spectra taken with the Keck II and Gemini
South telescopes. These objects are T Tauri stars with mass ratios close to
unity and periods of ~5 and ~3 days, respectively. In particular, RX
J1622.7-2325Nw shows a non-circularized orbit with an eccentricity of 0.30,
higher than any other short-period pre-main sequence spectroscopic binary known
to date. We speculate that orbit of RX J1622.7-2325Nw has not yet circularized
because of the perturbing action of a ~1" companion, itself a close visual
pair. A comparison of known young spectroscopic binaries and main sequence (MS)
spectroscopic binaries in the eccentricity-period plane shows an
indistinguishable distribution of the two populations, implying that orbital
circularization occurs in the first 1 Myr of a star's lifetime. With the
results presented in this paper we are increasing by ~4% the small sample of
PMS spectroscopic binary stars with known orbital elements.
