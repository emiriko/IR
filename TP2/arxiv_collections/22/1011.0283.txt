The author studied the effects of the environment described by Tsallis
statistics in quantum mechanics, when the deviation from Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG)
statistics is small. The $x^{4}$ model was used and the squeeze angle caused by
the difference between Tsallis and BG statistics was calculated perturbatively
in the mean field approximation as a function of the dimensionless parameters:
the inverse temperature $\beta_p$ and the coupling strength $\lambda_p$. The
author found that the effect of the deviation from BG statistics is relatively
large at high temperature. The squeeze angle as a function of $\beta_p$ has a
dip structure, and the dip is deeper with the increase of $\lambda_p$. The
angle as a function of $\beta_p$ changes the sign. These facts indicate that
the frequency is modulated by the difference between these statistics.
