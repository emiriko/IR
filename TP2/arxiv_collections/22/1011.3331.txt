Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors are high sensitivity and high
resolution devices for hard X-ray imaging and spectroscopic studies. The new
series of CZT detector modules (OMS40G256) manufactured by Orbotech Medical
Solutions (OMS), Israel, are used in the RT-2/CZT payload onboard the
CORONAS-PHOTON satellite. The CZT detectors, sensitive in the energy range of
20 keV to 150 keV, are used to image solar flares in hard X-rays. Since these
modules are essentially manufactured for commercial applications, we have
carried out a series of comprehensive tests on these modules so that they can
be confidently used in space-borne systems. These tests lead us to select the
best three pieces of the 'Gold' modules for the RT-2/CZT payload. This paper
presents the characterization of CZT modules and the criteria followed for
selecting the ones for the RT-2/CZT payload. The RT-2/CZT payload carries,
along with three CZT modules, a high spatial resolution CMOS detector for high
resolution imaging of transient X-ray events. Therefore, we discuss the
characterization of the CMOS detector as well.
