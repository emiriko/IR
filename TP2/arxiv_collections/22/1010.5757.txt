Current cosmic microwave background (CMB) bounds on the sum of the neutrino
masses assume a sudden reionization scenario described by a single parameter
that determines the onset of reionization. We investigate the bounds on the
neutrino mass in a more general reionization scenario based on a principal
component approach. We found the constraint on the sum of the neutrino masses
from CMB data can be relaxed by a $\sim$40% in a generalized reionization
scenario. Moreover, the amplitude of the r.m.s. mass fluctuations $\sigma_8$ is
also considerably lower providing a better consistency with a low amplitude of
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal.
