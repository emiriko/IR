We formulate maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in five dimensions in
light-cone superspace. The light-cone Hamiltonian is of the quadratic form and
the theory can be understood as an oxidation of the N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory
in four dimensions. We specifically study three-point counterterms and show how
these counterterms vanish on-shell. This study is a preliminary to set up the
technique in order to study possible four-point counterterms.
