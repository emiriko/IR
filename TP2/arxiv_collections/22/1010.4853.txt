Silicon oxide (SiOx) has been widely used in many electronic systems as a
supportive and insulating medium. Here we demonstrate various electrical
phenomena such as negative differential resistance, resistive switching and
current hysteresis intrinsic to a thin layer of SiOx. These behaviors can
largely mimic numerous electrical phenomena observed in molecules and other
nanomaterials, suggesting that substantial caution should be paid when studying
conduction in electronic systems with SiOx as a component. The actual switching
can be the result of SiOx and not the presumed molecular or nanomaterial
component. These electrical properties and the underlying mechanisms are
discussed in detail.
