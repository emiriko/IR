Let $\{X(t) : t \in [0, \infty) \}$ be a centered stationary Gaussian
process. We study the exact asymptotics of $\pr (\sup_{s \in [0,T]} X(t) > u)$,
as $u \to \infty$, where $T$ is an independent of \{X(t)\} nonnegative random
variable. It appears that the heaviness of $T$ impacts the form of the
asymptotics, leading to three scenarios: the case of integrable $T$, the case
of $T$ having regularly varying tail distribution with parameter
$\lambda\in(0,1)$ and the case of $T$ having slowly varying tail distribution.
