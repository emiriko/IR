We present new results for a sample of 33 narrow-lined UV-selected active
galactic nuclei (AGNs), identified in the course of a spectroscopic survey for
star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-3. The rest-frame UV composite spectrum for our
AGN sample shows several emission lines characteristic of AGNs, as well as
interstellar absorption features seen in star-forming Lyman Break Galaxies
(LBGs). We report a detection of NIV]1486, which has been observed in
high-redshift radio galaxies, as well as in rare optically-selected quasars.
The UV continuum slope of the composite spectrum is significantly redder than
that of a sample of non-AGN UV-selected star forming galaxies. Blueshifted SiIV
absorption provides evidence for outflowing highly-ionized gas in these objects
at speeds of ~ 10^(3) km/s, quantitatively different from what is seen in the
outflows of non-AGN LBGs. Grouping the individual AGNs by parameters such as
Ly-alpha equivalent width, redshift, and UV continuum magnitude allows for an
analysis of the major spectroscopic trends within the sample. Stronger Ly-alpha
emission is coupled with weaker low-ionization absorption, which is similar to
what is seen in the non-AGN LBGs, and highlights the role that cool
interstellar gas plays in the escape of Ly-alpha photons. However, the AGN
composite does not show the same trends between Ly-alpha strength and
extinction seen in the non-AGN LBGs. These results represent the first such
comparison at high-redshift between star-forming galaxies and similar galaxies
that host AGN activity.
