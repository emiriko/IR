Fortran subroutines to calculate helicity amplitudes with massive spin-3/2
particles, such as massive gravitinos, which couple to the standard model and
supersymmetric particles via the supercurrent, are added to the HELAS (HELicity
Amplitude Subroutines) library. They are coded in such a way that arbitrary
amplitudes with external gravitinos can be generated automatically by MadGraph,
after slight modifications. All the codes have been tested carefully by making
use of the gauge invariance of the helicity amplitudes.
