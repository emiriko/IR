We have been developing a program package called GRACE/SUSY-loop which is for
the automatic calculations of the MSSM amplitudes in one-loop order. The
non-linear gauge (NLG) fixing conditions play the crucial role in the
calculations in one-loop order which contain a large number of Feynman
diagrams. We present the recent progress in GRACE/SUSY-loop which is obtained
by extending the non-linear gauge formalism to the slepton sector.
