We present first results from the ongoing radio monitoring of SN 2008iz in
M82. The VLBI images reveal a shell-like structure with circular symmetry,
which expands in a self-similar way. There is strong evidence of a compact
component with a steep spectrum at the center of the shell. The expansion curve
obtained from our VLBI observations is marginally decelerated (m = 0.89) and
can be modeled simultaneously with the available radio light curves. While the
results of this simultaneous fitting are not conclusive (i.e. different
combinations of values of the magnetic field, CSM density profile, and electron
energy distribution, provide fits to the available data with similar quality),
additional observations should allow a more robust and detailed modeling.
