Arguments for special emergent vacua which generate fermion and weak boson
masses are outlined. Limitations and consequences of the concept are discussed.
If confirmed the Australian dipole would give strong support to such a picture.
Preliminary support from recent DZero and CDF data is discussed and predictions
for LHC are presented.
