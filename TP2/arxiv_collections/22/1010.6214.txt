Designing an m-bar linkage with a maximal number of assembly modes is
important in robot kinematics, and has further applications in structural
biology and computational geometry. A related question concerns the number of
assembly modes of rigid mechanisms as a function of their nodes n, which is
uniquely defined given m. Rigid 11-bar linkages, where n=7, are the simplest
planar linkages for which these questions were still open. It will be proven
that the maximal number of assembly modes of such linkages is exactly 56. The
rigidity of a linkage is captured by a polynomial system derived from distance,
or Cayley-Menger, matrices. The upper bound on the number of assembly modes is
obtained as the mixed volume of a 5x5 system. An 11-bar linkage admitting 56
configurations is constructed using stochastic optimisation methods. This
yields a general lower bound of $\Omega(2.3^n)$ on the number of assembly
modes, slightly improving the current record of $\Omega(2.289^n)$, while the
best known upper bound is roughly $4^n$. Our methods are straightforward and
have been implemented in Maple. They are described in general terms
illustrating the fact that they can be readily extended to other planar or
spatial linkages. The main results have been reported in conference publication
[EM11]. This version (2017) typesets correctly the last Figure 5 so as to
include all 28 configurations modulo reflection.
