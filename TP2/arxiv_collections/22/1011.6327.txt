Turbulence and chaos play a fundamental role in stellar convective zones
through the transportof particles, energy and momentum, and in fast dynamos,
through the stretching, twisting and folding of magnetic flux tubes. A
particularly revealing way to describe turbulent motions is through the
analysis of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS), which are material lines or
surfaces that act as transport barriers in the fluid. We report the detection
of Lagrangian coherent structures in helical MHD dynamo simulations with scale
separation. In an ABC--flow, two dynamo regimes, a propagating coherent
mean--field regime and an intermittent regime, are identified as the magnetic
diffusivity is varied. The sharp contrast between the chaotic tangle of
attracting and repelling LCS in both regimes permits a unique analysis of the
impact of the magnetic field on the velocity field. In a second example, LCS
reveal the link between the level of chaotic mixing of the velocity field and
the saturation of a large--scale dynamo when the magnetic field exceeds the
equipartition value.
