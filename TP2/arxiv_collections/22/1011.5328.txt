We consider two recently proposed measures of non-Markovianity applied to a
particular quantum process describing the dynamics of a driven qubit in a
structured reservoir. The motivation of this study is twofold: on one hand, we
study the differences and analogies of the non-Markovianity measures and on the
other hand, we investigate the effect of the driving force on the dissipative
dynamics of the qubit. In particular we ask if the drive introduces new
channels for energy and/or information transfer between the system and the
environment, or amplifies existing ones. We show under which conditions the
presence of the drive slows down the inevitable loss of quantum properties of
the qubit.
