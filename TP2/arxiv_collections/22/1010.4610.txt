We present evidence that the Boorong Aboriginal people of northwestern
Victoria observed the Great Eruption of Eta ({\eta}) Carinae in the nineteenth
century and incorporated the event into their oral traditions. We identify this
star, as well as others not specifically identified by name, using descriptive
material presented in the 1858 paper by William Edward Stanbridge in
conjunction with early southern star catalogues. This identification of a
transient astronomical event supports the assertion that Aboriginal oral
traditions are dynamic and evolving, and not static. This is the only
definitive indigenous record of {\eta} Carinae's outburst identified in the
literature to date.
