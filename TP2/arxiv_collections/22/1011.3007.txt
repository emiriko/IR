Semiconductor superlattices (SL) may be described by a Boltzmann-Poisson
kinetic equation with a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision term which
preserves charge, but not momentum or energy. Under appropriate boundary and
voltage bias conditions, these equations exhibit time-periodic oscillations of
the current caused by repeated nucleation and motion of charge dipole waves.
Despite this clear nonequilibrium behavior, if we `close' the system by
attaching insulated contacts to the superlattice and keeping its voltage bias
to zero volts, we can prove the H theorem, namely that a free energy $\Phi(t)$
of the kinetic equations is a Lyapunov functional ($\Phi\geq 0$, $d\Phi/dt\leq
0$). Numerical simulations confirm that the free energy decays to its
equilibrium value for a closed SL, whereas for an `open' SL under appropriate
dc voltage bias and contact conductivity $\Phi(t)$ oscillates in time with the
same frequency as the current self-sustained oscillations.
