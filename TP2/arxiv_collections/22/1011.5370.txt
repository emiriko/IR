We report on the design and performance of a spark-resistant bulk-micromegas
chamber. The principle of this design lends itself to the construction of
large-area muon chambers for the upgrade of the detectors at the Large Hadron
Collider at CERN for luminosities in excess of 10**34/cm2/s or other high-rate
applications.
