Nanocrystalline bulk materials are desirable for many applications as they
combine mechanical strength and specific electronic transport properties. Our
bottom up approach starts with tailored nanoparticles. Compaction and thermal
treatment are crucial, but usually the final stage sintering is accompanied by
rapid grain growth which spoils nanocristallinity. For electrically conducting
nanoparticles, field activated sintering techniques overcome this problem.
Small grain sizes have been maintained in spite of consolidation. Nevertheless,
the underlying principles, which are of high practical impact, have not been
fully elucidated yet. In this combined experimental and theoretical work we
show, how the developing microstructure during sintering correlates to the
percolation paths of the current through the powder using highly doped silicon
nanoparticles as a model system. It is possible to achieve a nanocrystalline
bulk material and a homogeneous microstructure. For this, not only the
generation of current paths due compaction, but also the disintegration due to
joule heating is required. The observed density fluctuations on the micrometer
scale are attributed to the specific heat profile of the simulated powder
networks.
