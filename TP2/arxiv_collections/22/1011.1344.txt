A distribution of electromagnetic fields presents a statistical assembly of a
particular type, which is at scale h a quantum statistical assembly itself and
has also been instrumental to concretisation of the basic probability
assumption of quantum mechanics. Of specific concern in this discussion is an
extensive train of radiation fields, of a total wave function \psi, which are
continuously (re)emitted and (re)absorbed by an oscillatory (point) charge of a
zero rest mass and yet a finite dynamical mass, with the waves and charge
together making up an extensive undulatory IED particle. The IED particle will
as any real particle be subject to interactions with the environmental fields
and particles, hence to excitations, and therefore will explore all possible
states over time; at scale $h$ the states are discrete. On the basis of the
principles of statistics and statistical mechanics combined with first
principles solutions for the IED particle, we derive for the IED particle the
probability functions in position space, of a form |\psi|^2, and in
dynamical-variable space.
