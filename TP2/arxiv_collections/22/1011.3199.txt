We study the lepton sector of a four generations model based on the discrete
flavor group $A_5$ (the even permutation of five objects). The best features of
the three family $A_4$ model survive, including the tribimaximal pattern of
three generation neutrino mixings. At leading order the three light neutrino
mass relations of $m_{\nu_1} = m_{\nu_3}$ and $m_{\nu_2} = 0$ are predicted.
The splitting of the neutrino masses can be naturally obtained as a result of
the breaking of $A_{5}$ down to $A_4$ and a degenerate spectrum is preferred in
our model. In our $A_5$ model, the electron mass is zero at tree level, but
calculable through quantum corrections.
