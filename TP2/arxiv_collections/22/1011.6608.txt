We study the evolution of massive scalar field in the spacetime geometry of
Kehagias-Sfetsos(KS) black hole in deformed Horava-Lifshitz(HL) gravity by
numerical analysis. We find that the signature of HL theory is encoded in the
quasinormal mode(QNM) phase of the evolution of field. The QNM phase in the
evolution process lasts for a longer time in HL theory. QNMs involved in the
evolution of massive field are calculated and find that they have a higher
oscillation frequency and a lower damping rate than the Schwarzschild spacetime
case. We also study the relaxation of field in the intermediate and asymptotic
range and verified that behaviors of field in these phases are independent of
the HL parameter and is identical to the Schwarzschild case.
