We measure secondary eclipses of the hot giant exoplanets CoRoT-1 at 3.6 and
4.5 microns, and CoRoT-2 at 3.6 microns, both using Warm Spitzer. We find that
the Warm Spitzer mission is working very well for exoplanet science. For
consistency of our analysis we also re-analyze archival cryogenic Spitzer data
for secondary eclipses of CoRoT-2 at 4.5 and 8 microns. We compare the total
data for both planets, including optical eclipse measurements by the CoRoT
mission, and ground-based eclipse measurements at 2 microns, to existing
models. Both planets exhibit stronger eclipses at 4.5 than at 3.6 microns,
which is often indicative of an atmospheric temperature inversion. The spectrum
of CoRoT-1 is best reproduced by a 2460K blackbody, due either to a high
altitude layer that strongly absorbs stellar irradiance, or an isothermal
region in the planetary atmosphere. The spectrum of CoRoT-2 is unusual because
the 8 micron contrast is anomalously low. Non-inverted atmospheres could
potentially produce the CoRoT-2 spectrum if the planet exhibits line emission
from CO at 4.5 microns, caused by tidal-induced mass loss. However, the
viability of that hypothesis is questionable because the emitting region cannot
be more than about 30-percent larger than the planet's transit radius, based on
the ingress and egress times at eclipse. An alternative possibility to account
for the spectrum of CoRoT-2 is an additional opacity source that acts strongly
at wavelengths less than 5 microns, heating the upper atmosphere while allowing
the deeper atmosphere seen at 8 microns to remain cooler. We obtain a similar
result as Gillon et al. for the phase of the secondary eclipse of CoRoT-2,
implying an eccentric orbit with e*cos(omega)=-0.0030 +/- 0.0004.
