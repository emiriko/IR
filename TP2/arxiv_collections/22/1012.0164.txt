Filaments on the surface of a microorganism such as Paramecium or Ophalina
beat highly synchronized and form so-called metachronal waves that travel along
the surfaces. In order to study under what principal conditions these waves
form, we introduce a chain of beads, called rowers, each periodically driven by
an external force on a straight line segment. To implement hydrodynamic
interactions between the beads, they are considered point-like. Two beads
synchronize in antiphase or in phase depending on the positive or negative
curvature of their driving-force potential. Concentrating on in-phase
synchronizing rowers, we find that they display only transient synchronization
in a bulk fluid. On the other hand, metachronal waves with wavelengths of 7-10
rower distances emerge, when we restrict the range of hydrodynamic interactions
either artificially to nearest neighbors or by the presence of a bounding
surface as in any relevant biological system.
