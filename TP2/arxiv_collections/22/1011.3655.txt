Three ground based portable low power consumption microlidars (MULID) have
been built and deployed at three remote sites in Banizoumbou (Niger), Cinzana
(Mali) and M'Bour (Senegal) in the framework of the African Monsoon
Multidisciplinary Analyses (AMMA) project for the characterization of aerosols
optical properties. A description of the instrument and a discussion of the
data inversion method, including a careful analysis of measurement
uncertainties (systematic and statistical errors) are presented. Some case
studies of typical lidar profiles observed over the Banizoumbou site during
2006 are shown and discussed with respect to the AERONET 7-day
back-trajectories and the biomass burning emissions from the Combustion
Emission database for the AMMA campaign.
