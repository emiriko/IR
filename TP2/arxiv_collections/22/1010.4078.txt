The electric dipole form factor (EDFF) of the nucleon stemming from the QCD
theta term and from the quark color-electric dipole moments is calculated in
chiral perturbation theory to sub-leading order. This is the lowest order in
which the isoscalar EDFF receives a calculable, non-analytic contribution from
the pion cloud. In the case of the theta term, the expected lower bound on the
deuteron electric dipole moment is |d_d| > 1.4 10^(-4) \theta e fm. The
momentum dependence of the isovector EDFF is proportional to a non-derivative
time-reversal-violating pion-nucleon coupling, and the scale for momentum
variation ---appearing, in particular, in the radius of the form factor--- is
the pion mass.
