The patterns of motion of mobile agents has received recently wide attention
in the literature. There is a number of recent studies centered around the
motion behavior of many agents ranging from albatrosses to human beings.
Special attention has been given to the covered distances statistical
distributions. In some cases, due to the lack of accurate data about the motion
of the agents it has been necessary to plan very clever experiments to obtain
them. These experiments try to infer the statistical properties of the agents'
real motion from the observed positions in consecutive time intervals. The
length of the time intervals is a random variable taking values from a
previously known statistical distribution or from a distribution deduced from
empirical data. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that for a Gaussian
Random Walker it is, in general, impossible to recover the real motion patterns
distribution from the stroboscopic observation of the agents. Moreover, it is
also shown that the distances distribution strongly depends on the agents'
observation time intervals. These claims are sustained by numerical
experiments.
