A new set of nonlocal boundary conditions are proposed for the higher modes
of the 3D inviscid primitive equations. Numerical schemes using the
splitting-up method are proposed for these modes. Numerical simulations of the
full nonlinear primitive equations are performed on a nested set of domains,
and the results are discussed.
