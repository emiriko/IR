We formulate a notion of "geometric reductivity" in an abstract categorical
setting which we refer to as adequacy. The main theorem states that the
adequacy condition implies that the ring of invariants is finitely generated.
This result applies to the category of modules over a bialgebra, the category
of comodules over a bialgebra, and the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a
finite type algebraic stack over an affine base.
