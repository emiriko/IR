We prove that if a polynomial vector field on C2 has a proper and
non-algebraic trajectory analytically isomorphic to C* all its trajectories are
proper, and except at most one which is contained in an algebraic curve of type
C all of them are of type C*. As corollary we obtain an analytic version of
Lin-Zaidenberg Theorem for polynomial foliations.
