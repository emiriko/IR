Growth of GaAs and InGaAs nanowires by the group-III assisted Molecular Beam
Epitaxy growth method is studied in dependence of growth temperature, with the
objective of maximizing the indium incorporation. Nanowire growth was achieved
for growth temperatures as low as 550{\deg}C. The incorporation of indium was
studied by low temperature micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy, Raman
spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. The results show that the
incorporation of indium lowering the growth temperature does not have an effect
in increasing the indium concentration in the bulk of the nanowire, which is
limited to 3-5%. For growth temperatures below 575{\deg}C, indium rich regions
form at the surface of the nanowires as a consequence of the radial growth.
This results in the formation of quantum dots, which exhibit extremely sharp
luminescence.
