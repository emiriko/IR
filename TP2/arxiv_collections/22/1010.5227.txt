The central object of this paper is a holonomy formulation for spin foams.
Within this new represen- tation, we analyze three general requirements:
locality, composition law, cylindrical consistency. In particular, cylindrical
consistency is shown to fix the arbitrary normalization of the vertex amplitude
in the case of Euclidean signature.
