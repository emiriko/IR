The range of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) frequencies covers a domain
which at the low end abuts half the laser frequency, omega_0 / 2, according to
the simplest SRS theories, corresponding to scatter from electron densities
near 1/4 critical. Experiments, on the other hand, clearly point to a frequency
gap: SRS is not observed at frequencies close to and above omega_0 / 2,
indicating a drastic disruption of scatter from Langmuir waves as electron
densities approaches 1/4 critical from below. Several one-dimensional
mechanisms, linear and nonlinear, have been proposed to explain this "Raman
gap". In this paper we release the one-dimensional constraint by allowing
diffraction of the scattered light. In the linear convective regime we find
that diffractive effects on SRS from a wide speckled laser beam tend to
increase the SRS threshold with increase of density, so long as the interaction
length is comparable to or larger than a speckle length. This may lead to a
new, diffraction controlled, contribution to the Raman gap.
