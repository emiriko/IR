We present a detailed light curve analysis of publicly available V band
observations of 62 binary stars, mostly contact binaries, obtained by the All
Sky Automated Survey (ASAS)-3 project between 2000 and 2009. Eclipsing binaries
are important astronomical targets for determining the physical parameters of
component stars from the geometry. They provide an independent direct method of
measuring the radii of stars. We improved the ASAS determined periods,
ephemeris and obtained the Fourier parameters from the phased light curves of
these 62 stars. These Fourier parameters were used for preliminary
classification of the stars in our sample. The phased light curves were then
analysed with the aid of the Wilson-Devinney light curve modelling technique in
order to obtain various geometrical and physical parameters of these binaries.
The spectroscopic mass ratios as determined from the the radial velocity
measurements available in the literature were used as one of the inputs to the
light curve modelling. Thus reliable estimations of parameters of these
binaries were obtained with combined photometric and spectroscopic data and
error estimates were made using the heuristic scan method.
