We report on a new experimental platform for the measurement of absolute
scattering cross-sections. The target atoms are trapped in an optical dipole
trap and are exposed to an incident particle beam. The exponential decay of the
atom number directly yields the absolute total scattering cross-section. The
technique can be applied to any atomic or molecular species that can be
prepared in an optical dipole trap and provides a large variety of possible
scattering scenarios.
