Angle-resolved reflection and emission spectra of metal gratings consisting
of sub-wavelength grooves and immersed into rhodamine B and rhodamine 19
solutions are presented. The measured reflection and emission dispersion
diagrams reveal the surface plasmon polaritons positions and strong plasmon
mediated emission enhancement, respectively. The same grating could be easily
re-used for the characterization of different dye-molecules.
