We present a new method for solving the two-body Bethe-Salpeter equation in
Minkowski space. It is based on the Nakanishi integral representation of the
Bethe-Salpeter amplitude and on subsequent projection of the equation on the
light-front plane. The method is valid for any kernel given by the irreducible
Feynman graphs and for systems of spinless particles or fermions. The
Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes in Minkowski space are obtained. The electromagnetic
form factors are computed and compared to the Euclidean results.
