The transmission and reflection spectra from a right-handed chiral sculptured
zirconia thin film are calculated using the piecewise homogeneity approximation
method and the Bruggeman homogenization formalism by considering that the
propagation of both dispersive and non-dispersive dielectric function occurs
for axial and non-axial states. The comparison of spectral results shows that
the dispersion of the dielectric function has a considerable effect on the
results. In axial excitation of cross-polarized reflectances and co-polarized
transmittances the dispersion effect becomes more pronounced at wavelengths
further away from the homogenization wavelength. This is also true in case of
non-axial excitation of circular transmittances, while there are considerable
differences for cross-polarized reflectances where (wavelength) the first Bragg
peak occurs. At wavelengths in the vicinity of the homogenization wavelength
the dispersion effect of the dielectric function in becomes more significant.
