Parton distributions in impact parameter space, which are obtained by Fourier
transforming GPDs, are exhibit a significant deviation from axial symmetry when
the target and/or quark is transversely polarized. From this deformation, we
present an intuitive derivation of the Ji relation. In a scalar diquark model
and in QED, we compare the Ji and Jaffe-Manohar decompositions of the nucleon
spin. Using the MIT bag model, we estimate spectator effects through the
presence of the gluon vector potential in the definitions of the quark orbital
angular momentum.
