We analytically investigate transverse magnetic (TM) spatial bright solitons,
as exact solutions of Maxwell's equations, propagating through nonlinear
metamaterials whose linear dielectric permittivity is very close to zero and
whose effective nonlinear Kerr parameters can be tailored to achieve values not
available in standard materials. Exploiting the fact that, in the considered
medium, linear and nonlinear polarization can be comparable at feasible and
realistic optical intensities, we identify two novel self-trapping mechanisms
able to support two-peaked and flat-top solitons, respectively. Specifically,
these two novel mechanisms are based on the occurrence of critical points at
which the effective nonlinear permittivity vanishes, the two mechanisms
differing in the way the compensation between linear and nonlinear polarization
is achieved through the non-standard values of the nonlinear parameters.
