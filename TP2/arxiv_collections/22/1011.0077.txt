The prospects for detecting a candidate supersymmetric dark matter particle
at the LHC are reviewed, and compared with the prospects for direct and
indirect searches for astrophysical dark matter, on the basis of a frequentist
analysis of the preferred regions of the Minimal supersymmetric extension of
the Standard Model with universal soft supersymmetry breaking (the CMSSM) and a
model with equal but non-universal supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the
Higgs masses (the NUHM1). LHC searches may have good chances to observe
supersymmetry in the near future - and so may direct searches for astrophysical
dark matter particles.
