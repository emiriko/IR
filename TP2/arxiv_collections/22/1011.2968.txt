In this article the methods of canonical analysis and quantization that were
reviewed in the first part of the series are applied to the case of the Dirac
field in the presence of electromagnetic interaction. It is shown that the
quantization of electrodynamics, which begins with a given Lagrangian and ends
by perturbative calculation of scattering probability amplitudes, can be
performed in the way that does not employ Poincar\'e symmetry of space--time at
any stage. Also, the causal structure is not needed.
