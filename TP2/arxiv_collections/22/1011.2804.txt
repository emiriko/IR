We present a lattice study of up to N=20 unitary fermions confined to a
harmonic trap. Our preliminary results show better than 1% agreement with high
precision solutions to the many-body Schrodinger equation for up to N=6. We are
able to make predictions for larger N which were inaccessible by the
Hamiltonian approach due to computational limitations. Harmonic traps are used
experimentally to study cold atoms tuned to a Feshbach resonance. We show that
they also provide certain benefits to numerical studies of many-body
correlators on the lattice. In particular, we anticipate that the methods
described here could be used for studying nuclear physics.
