In this paper the problem of stabilizing large-scale systems by distributed
controllers, where the controllers exchange information via a shared limited
communication medium is addressed. Event-triggered sampling schemes are
proposed, where each system decides when to transmit new information across the
network based on the crossing of some error thresholds. Stability of the
interconnected large-scale system is inferred by applying a generalized
small-gain theorem. Two variations of the event-triggered controllers which
prevent the occurrence of the Zeno phenomenon are also discussed.
