We prove the classification of joinings for maximal horospherical subgroups
acting on homogeneous spaces without any restriction on the characteristic.
Using the linearization technique we deduce a special case of Raghunathan's
orbit closure conjecture. In the appendix quasi-isometries of higher rank
lattices in semisimple algebraic groups over fields of positive characteristic
are characterized.
