We study a rumour model from a percolation theory and branching process point
of view. The existence of a giant component is related to the event where the
rumour spreads out trough an infinite number of individuals. We present sharp
lower and upper bounds for the probability of that event, according to the
distribution of the random variables that defines the radius of influence of
each individual.
