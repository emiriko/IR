This study compares cross-sectional scanning tunnelling microscopy (XSTM) and
atom probe tomography (APT). We use epitaxially grown self-assembled InAs
quantum dots (QDs) in GaAs as an exemplary material with which to compare these
two nanostructural analysis techniques. We studied the composition of the
wetting layer and the QDs, and performed quantitative comparisons of the indium
concentration profiles measured by each method. We show that computational
models of the wetting layer and the QDs, based on experimental data, are
consistent with both analytical approaches. This establishes a link between the
two techniques and shows their complimentary behaviour, an advantage which we
exploit in order to highlight unique features of the examined QD material.
