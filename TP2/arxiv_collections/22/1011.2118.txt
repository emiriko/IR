We define and study a combinatorial Hopf algebra dRec with basis elements
indexed by diagonal rectangulations of a square. This Hopf algebra provides an
intrinsic combinatorial realization of the Hopf algebra tBax of twisted Baxter
permutations, which previously had only been described extrinsically as a sub
Hopf algebra of the Malvenuto-Reutenauer Hopf algebra of permutations. We
describe the natural lattice structure on diagonal rectangulations, analogous
to the Tamari lattice on triangulations, and observe that diagonal
rectangulations index the vertices of a polytope analogous to the
associahedron. We give an explicit bijection between twisted Baxter
permutations and the better-known Baxter permutations, and describe the
resulting Hopf algebra structure on Baxter permutations.
