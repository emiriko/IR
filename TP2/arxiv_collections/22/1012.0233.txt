We report results on J/psi-hadron azimuthal angular correlations in 200 GeV
p+p collision in the STAR experiment at RHIC. The extracted B-hadron feed-down
contribution to inclusive J/psi yield is found to be 10-25% in 4<p_T<12 GeV/c
and has no significant center-of-mass energy dependence from RHIC to LHC. The
p_T spectrum of charged hadron associated with high-p_T J/psi triggers on the
away side is found to be consistent with that from di-hadron correlations.
J/psi signal from partially produced Au+Au 39 GeV data will also be presented
to demonstrate STAR's J/psi capability at RHIC low energy run.
