We report the magnetic, dielectric and ferroelectric properties of
polycrystalline iron vanadate(FeVO4), which has been recently found to exhibit
multiferroicity in low temperature with noncollinear magnetic orderings. The
influence of external magnetic field up to 9T on these properties is
systematically investigated. Besides the suppressing effect on the original
ferroelectric transition, the strong magnetic field seems to induce a secondary
ferroelectric transition at a slight lower temperature. And the corresponding
magnetization measurement reveals a field-induced metamagnetic transition at
low temperatures. Our results will help to clarify the complex magnetic
structure and microscopic mechanism of multiferroicity in FeVO4.
