We review the Pinch Technique - Background Field Method (PT-BFM) framework
for formulating and solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations of Yang-Mills
theories. In particular, we show how within this framework it is possible to
write a new set of Schwinger-Dyson equations that (i) accommodate the dynamical
gluon mass generation through Schwinger's mechanism, and (ii) have much better
truncation properties than the the conventional equations. The resulting
solutions show (in the Landau gauge) an infra-red saturating gluon propagator
and ghost dressing function, in agreement with all lattice studies to date for
both SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups as well as 3 and 4 space-time dimensions. We
also briefly discuss how a massive gluon enables self-consistently confinement
through the condensation of thick vortices, and study other infra-red
characteristic quantities such as the Kugo-Ojima function and the effective
charge.
