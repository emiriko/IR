The Monte Carlo event generator GGRESRC is described. The generator is
developed for simulation of events of the two-photon process e^+e^- --> e^+e^-
R, where R is a pseudoscalar resonance, \pi^0, \eta, \eta', \eta_c, or \eta_b.
The program is optimized for generation of two-photon events in the single-tag
mode. For single-tag events, radiative correction simulation is implemented in
the generator including photon emission from the initial and final states.
