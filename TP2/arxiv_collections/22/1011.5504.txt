(Abridged) We present a spatially-resolved near-UV/optical study of NGC 4150,
using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board the Hubble Space Telescope.
Previous studies of this early-type galaxy (ETG) indicate that it has a large
reservoir of molecular gas, exhibits a kinematically decoupled core (likely
indication of recent merging) and strong, central H_B absorption (indicative of
young stars). The core of NGC 4150 shows ubiquitous near-UV emission and
remarkable dusty substructure. Our analysis shows this galaxy to lie in the
near-UV green valley, and its pixel-by-pixel photometry exhibits a narrow range
of near-UV/optical colours that are similar to those of nearby E+A
(post-starburst) galaxies. We parametrise the properties of the recent star
formation (age, mass fraction, metallicity and internal dust content) in the
NGC 4150 pixels by comparing the observed near-UV/optical photometry to stellar
models. The typical age of the recent star formation (RSF) is around 0.9 Gyrs,
consistent with the similarity of the near-UV colours to post-starburst
systems, while the morphological structure of the young component supports the
proposed merger scenario. The RSF metallicity, representative of the
metallicity of the gas fuelling star formation, is around 0.3 - 0.5 Zsun.
Assuming that this galaxy is a merger and that the gas is sourced mainly from
the infalling companion, these metallicities plausibly indicate the gas-phase
metallicity (GPM) of the accreted satellite. Comparison to the local mass-GPM
relation suggests (crudely) that the mass of the accreted system is around
3x10^8 Msun, making NGC 4150 a 1:20 minor merger. A summation of the pixel RSF
mass fractions indicates that the RSF contributes about 2-3 percent of the
stellar mass. This work reaffirms our hypothesis that minor mergers play a
significant role in the evolution of ETGs at late epochs.
