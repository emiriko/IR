We introduce a Bayesian extension of the latent block model for model-based
block clustering of data matrices. Our approach considers a block model where
block parameters may be integrated out. The result is a posterior defined over
the number of clusters in rows and columns and cluster memberships. The number
of row and column clusters need not be known in advance as these are sampled
along with cluster memberhips using Markov chain Monte Carlo. This differs from
existing work on latent block models, where the number of clusters is assumed
known or is chosen using some information criteria. We analyze both simulated
and real data to validate the technique.
