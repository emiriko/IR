In this paper we propose a model of production of ordinary and dark matter in
the decay of a hypothetical antigravitating medium in the form of a condensate
of (zero-momentum) spinless massive particles (denoted as $\phi$) which fills
the universe. The decays of $\phi$-particles into baryons, leptons, and dark
matter particles are caused by some (after-GUT) interaction with the mass scale
between the electroweak and grand unification. The observed dark energy is
identified with a portion of a condensate which has not decayed up to the
instant of measurement. The decay rate of $\phi$-particles $\Gamma_{\phi}$ is
expressed through the three parameters - the coupling constant $\alpha_{X}$,
the mass scale $M_{X}$ which defines the mass of $X$-particle as the mediator
of after-GUT interaction, and the energy imparted to the decay products. We
show that the masses of dark matter particle $m_{\chi}\approx 5$ GeV and
$\phi$-particle $m_{\phi}\approx 15$ GeV can be extracted from the 7-year WMAP
and other astrophysical data about the contributions of baryon, dark matter,
and dark energy densities to the total matter-energy density budget in our
universe. Such a mass of light WIMP dark matter agrees with the recent
observations of CoGeNT, DAMA, and CDMS. The obtained masses of $\phi$- and dark
matter particle are concordant with the coupling constant of after-GUT
interaction $\alpha_{X} \sim 1/70 at $M_{X} \sim 6 \times 10^{10}$ GeV, and the
decay rate $\Gamma_{\phi} \approx 2 \times 10^{-18}\, {s}^{-1}$. The
cross-sections of the reactions in which dark matter particles can be produced
are calculated
