The presence of interface states at the MOS interface is a well-known cause
of device degradation. This is particularly true for ultra-scaled FinFET
geometries where the presence of a few traps can strongly influence device
behavior. Typical methods for interface trap density (Dit) measurements are not
performed on ultimate devices, but on custom designed structures. We present
the first set of methods that allow direct estimation of Dit in
state-of-the-art FinFETs, addressing a critical industry need.
