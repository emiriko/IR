We present a very fast algorithm for general matrix factorization of a data
matrix for use in the statistical analysis of high-dimensional data via latent
factors. Such data are prevalent across many application areas and generate an
ever-increasing demand for methods of dimension reduction in order to undertake
the statistical analysis of interest. Our algorithm uses a gradient-based
approach which can be used with an arbitrary loss function provided the latter
is differentiable. The speed and effectiveness of our algorithm for dimension
reduction is demonstrated in the context of supervised classification of some
real high-dimensional data sets from the bioinformatics literature.
