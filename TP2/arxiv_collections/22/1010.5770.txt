This work is intended to provide an introduction to multiwavelength
observations of low-mass X-ray binaries and the techniques used to analyze and
interpret their data. The focus will primarily be on ultraviolet, optical, and
infrared observations and their connections to other wavelengths. The topics
covered include: outbursts of soft X-ray transients, accretion disk spectral
energy distributions, orbital lightcurves in luminous and quiescent states,
super-orbital and sub-orbital variability, line spectra, system parameter
determinations, and echo-mapping and other rapid correlated variability.
