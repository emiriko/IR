Mendes recently conjectured an identity simplifying the Poincar\'e series of
the space of equivariant polynomial maps from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to a
subrepresentation of $Sym^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. We show how to prove this
identity using a fairly simple integer partition bijection. First, we give a
bijective proof of a similar, well-known identity from representation theory.
We then show that this bijection can be generalized to prove other Poincar\'e
series identities, including a version of the identity conjectured by Mendes as
well as refinements of it.
