In this publication electroweak next-to-leading order corrections to
semileptonic B-meson decays into (pseudo)scalar final states are presented. To
this end, these corrections of O(alpha G_F) have been calculated in the
QED-enhanced phenomenological model, incorporating the bound-state mesons as
its degrees of freedom, and matched to a similar calculation on the level of
constituent partons in the full Standard Model. Consequently, the effects
arising due to corrections of the partial decay widths on the extraction of the
CKM matrix elements |V_cb| and |V_ub| are detailed. Further, the results of two
independent Monte-Carlo implementations are presented: One is the dedicated,
strict fixed-order generator BLOR, and the other is embedded into the generic
Yennie-Frautschi-Suura-type resummation of Photons++, which is part of the
multi-purpose event generator Sherpa. The resulting distributions are compared
against the standard tool used in many experimental analyses, PHOTOS, showing
improvements on the shapes of kinematic distributions of both the lepton and
the final state meson.
