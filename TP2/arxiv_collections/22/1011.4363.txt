Dead Reckoning mechanisms are usually used to estimate the position of
simulated entity in virtual environment. However, this technique often ignores
available contextual information that may be influential to the state of an
entity, sacrificing remote predictive accuracy in favor of low computational
complexity. A novel extension of Dead Reckoning is suggested in this paper to
increase the network availability and fulfill the required Quality of Service
in large scale distributed simulation application. The proposed algorithm is
referred to as ANFIS Dead Reckoning, which stands for Adaptive Neuro-based
Fuzzy Inference System Dead Reckoning is based on a fuzzy inference system
which is trained by the learning algorithm derived from the neuronal networks
and fuzzy inference theory. The proposed mechanism takes its based on the
optimization approach to calculate the error threshold violation in networking
games. Our model shows it primary benefits especially in the decision making of
the behavior of simulated entities and preserving the consistence of the
simulation.
