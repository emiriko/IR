We use the "modes of the universe" approach to study a cavity-mediated
two-photon logical gate recently proposed by Koshino, Ishizaka and Nakamura. We
clarify the relationship between the more commonly used input-output formalism,
and that of Koshino et al., and show that some elements of this gate had been
anticipated by other authors. We conclude that their proposed gate can work
both in the good and bad cavity limits, provided only that the pulses are long
enough. Our formalism allows us to estimate analytically the size of the
various error terms, and to follow the spectral evolution of the field + cavity
system in the course of the interaction.
