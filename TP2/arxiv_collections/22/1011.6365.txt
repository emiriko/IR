The method of direct neutrino mass determination based on the kinematics of
tritium beta decay, which is adopted by the KATRIN experiment, makes use of a
large, high-resolution electrostatic spectrometer with magnetic adiabatic
collimation. In order to target a sensitivity on the neutrino mass of 0.2
eV/c^2, a detailed understanding of the electromagnetic properties of the
electron spectrometer is essential, requiring comprehensive calibration
measurements with dedicated electron sources. In this paper we report on a
prototype of a photoelectron source providing a narrow energy spread and
angular selectivity. Both are key properties for the characterisation of the
spectrometer. The angular selectivity is achieved by applying non-parallel
strong electric and magnetic fields: Directly after being created,
photoelectrons are accelerated rapidly and non-adiabatically by a strong
electric field before adiabatic magnetic guiding takes over.
