Assuming the gluon field is well approximated by instanton configurations we
derive a partition function and calculate the specific correlators. Namely, the
heavy quark propagator and heavy quark-aniquark correlator with the account of
the light quark determinant and QCD instanton vacuum properties. With these
knowledge we calculate the light quark contribution to the interaction between
heavy quarks, which might be essential for the properties of a few heavy quarks
systems like oniums and double-heavy baryons.
