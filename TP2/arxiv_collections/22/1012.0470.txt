We investigate the dynamics of a single tracer exploring a course of fixed
obstacles in the vicinity of the percolation transition for particles confined
to the infinite cluster. The mean-square displacement displays anomalous
transport, which extends to infinite times precisely at the critical obstacle
density. The slowing down of the diffusion coefficient exhibits power-law
behavior for densities close to the critical point and we show that the
mean-square displacement fulfills a scaling hypothesis. Furthermore, we
calculate the dynamic conductivity as response to an alternating electric
field. Last, we discuss the non-gaussian parameter as an indicator for
heterogeneous dynamics.
