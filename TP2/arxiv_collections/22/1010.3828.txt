Fatigue failure can be thought by studying the collective motions of defects
inside materials instead of focusing on the growth of a pre-existing
micro-crack. An experimental study of the statistical distribution of acoustic
emissions avalanches along cycling is presented. The evolutions of critical
exponents through cyclic driving are estimated to track changes in the
dissipation modes and consequently identify fatigue failure precursors. We also
use critical rupture models developed for earthquakes and stock market crashes
predictions to forecast the time to failure with good reliability.
