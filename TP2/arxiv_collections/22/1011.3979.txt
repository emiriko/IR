We consider the entropy of the solution to the heat equation on a Riemannian
manifold. When the manifold is compact, we provide two estimates on the rate of
change of the entropy in terms of the lower bound on the Ricci curvature and
the spectral gap respectively. Our explicit computation for the three
dimensional hyperbolic space shows that the time derivative of the entropy is
asymptotically bounded by two positive constants.
