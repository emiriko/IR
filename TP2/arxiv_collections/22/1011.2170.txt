As was noted in [3], in order to verify the assumption that the behavior of
the polarization dependences of the terahertz emission by hot electrons from
$n$-Ge is determined by the type of carrier scattering, it is necessary to
perform temperature measurements of this dependence in the range between the
temperatures, where the scattering is determined by impurities and by acoustic
lattice vibrations, respectively. The given work presents the results of such
investigations.
