We present an analysis of BVRcIc observations of the field sized around 4' x
4' centered at the host galaxy of the gamma-ray burst GRB 021004 with the 6-m
BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy
of Sciences. We measured the magnitudes and constructed the color diagrams for
311 galaxies detected in the field (S/N > 3). The differential and integral
counts of galaxies up to the limit, corresponding to 28.5 (B), 28.0 (V), 27.0
(Rc), 26.5 (Ic) were computed. We compiled the galaxy catalog, consisting of
183 objects, for which the photometric redshifts up to the limiting magnitudes
26.0 (B), 25.5 (V), 25.0 (Rc), 24.5 (Ic) were determined using the HyperZ code.
We then examined the radial distribution of galaxies based on the z estimates.
We have built the curves expected in the case of a uniform distribution of
galaxies in space, and obtained the estimates for the size and contrast of the
possible super-large-scale structures, which are accessible with the
observations of this type.
