We investigate the spin-polarized transport of GaMnAs nanolayers in which a
ferromagnetic order exists below a certain transition temperature. Our
calculation for the self-averaged resistivity takes into account the existence
of an impurity band determining the extended ("metallic" transport) or
localized (hopping by thermal excitation) nature of the states at and near the
Fermi level. Magnetic order and resistivity are inter-related due to the
influence of the spin polarization of the impurity band and the effect of the
Zeeman splitting on the mobility edge. We obtain, for a given range of Mn
concentration and carrier density, a "metallic" behavior in which the transport
by extended carriers dominates at low temperature, and is dominated by the
thermally excited localized carriers near and above the transition temperature.
This gives rise to a conspicuous hump of the resistivity which has been
experimentally observed and brings light onto the relationship between
transport and magnetic properties of this material.
