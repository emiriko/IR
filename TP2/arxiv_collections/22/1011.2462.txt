Recently we propose a class of infinite-dimensional integral representations
of classical gl(n+1)-Whittaker functions and local Archimedean local L-factors
using two-dimensional topological field theory framework. The local Archimedean
Langlands duality was identified in this setting with the mirror symmetry of
the underlying topological field theories. In this note we introduce elementary
analogs of the Whittaker functions and the Archimedean L-factors given by
U(n+1)-equivariant symplectic volumes of appropriate Kahler U(n+1)-manifolds.
We demonstrate that the functions thus defined have a dual description as
matrix elements of representations of monoids GL(n+1,R), R being the tropical
semifield. We also show that the elementary Whittaker functions can be obtained
from the non-Archimedean Whittaker functions over Q_p by taking the formal
limit p->1. Hence the elementary special functions constructed in this way
might be considered as functions over the mysterious field Q_1. The existence
of two representations for the elementary Whittaker functions, one as an
equivariant volume and the other as a matrix element, should be considered as a
manifestation of a hypothetical elementary analog of the local Langlands
duality for number fields. We would like to note that the elementary local
L-factors coincide with L-factors introduced previously by Kurokawa.
