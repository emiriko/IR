In this paper, a new directionally adaptive, learning based, single image
super resolution method using multiple direction wavelet transform, called
Directionlets is presented. This method uses directionlets to effectively
capture directional features and to extract edge information along different
directions of a set of available high resolution images .This information is
used as the training set for super resolving a low resolution input image and
the Directionlet coefficients at finer scales of its high-resolution image are
learned locally from this training set and the inverse Directionlet transform
recovers the super-resolved high resolution image. The simulation results
showed that the proposed approach outperforms standard interpolation techniques
like Cubic spline interpolation as well as standard Wavelet-based learning,
both visually and in terms of the mean squared error (mse) values. This method
gives good result with aliased images also.
