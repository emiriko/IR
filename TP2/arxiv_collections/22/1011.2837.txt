Coupling high quality, suspended atomic membranes to specialized electrodes
enables investigation of many novel phenomena, such as spin or Cooper pair
transport in these two dimensional systems. However, many electrode materials
are not stable in acids that are used to dissolve underlying substrates. Here
we present a versatile and powerful multi-level lithographical technique to
suspend atomic membranes, which can be applied to the vast majority of
substrate, membrane and electrode materials. Using this technique, we
fabricated suspended graphene devices with Al electrodes and mobility of 5500
cm^2/Vs. We also demonstrate, for the first time, fabrication and measurement
of a free-standing thin Bi2Se3 membrane, which has low contact resistance to
electrodes and a mobility of >~500 cm^2/Vs.
