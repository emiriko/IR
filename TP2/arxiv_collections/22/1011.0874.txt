We compute the dynamical structure factor of the spin-1/2 triangular
Heisenberg model using the mean field Schwinger boson theory. We find that a
reconstructed dispersion, resulting from a non trivial redistribution of the
spectral weight, agrees quite well with the spin excitation spectrum recently
found with series expansions. In particular, we recover the strong
renormalization with respect to linear spin wave theory along with the
appearance of roton-like minima. Furthermore, near the roton-like minima the
contribution of the two spinon continuum to the static structure factor is
about 40 % of the total weight. By computing the density-density dynamical
structure factor, we identify an unphysical weak signal of the spin excitation
spectrum with the relaxation of the local constraint of the Schwinger bosons at
the mean field level. Based on the accurate description obtained for the static
and dynamic ground state properties, we argue that the bosonic spinon theory
should be considered seriously as a valid alternative to interpret the physics
of the triangular Heisenberg model.
