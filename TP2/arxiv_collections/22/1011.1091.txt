Smale's alpha-theory uses estimates related to the convergence of Newton's
method to give criteria implying that Newton iterations will converge
quadratically to solutions to a square polynomial system. The program
alphaCertified implements algorithms based on alpha-theory to certify solutions
to polynomial systems using both exact rational arithmetic and arbitrary
precision floating point arithmetic. It also implements an algorithm to certify
whether a given point corresponds to a real solution to a real polynomial
system, as well as algorithms to heuristically validate solutions to
overdetermined systems. Examples are presented to demonstrate the algorithms.
