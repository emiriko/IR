It was predicted by Wigner in 1934 that the electron gas will undergo a
transition to a crystallized state when its density is very low. Whereas
significant progress has been made towards the detection of electronic Wigner
states, their clear and direct experimental verification still remains a
challenge. Here we address signatures of Wigner molecule formation in the
transport properties of InSb nanowire quantum dot systems, where a few
electrons may form localized states depending on the size of the dot (i.e. the
electron density). By a configuration interaction approach combined with an
appropriate transport formalism, we are able to predict the transport
properties of these systems, in excellent agreement with experimental data. We
identify specific signatures of Wigner state formation, such as the strong
suppression of the antiferromagnetic coupling, and are able to detect the onset
of Wigner localization, both experimentally and theoretically, by studying
different dot sizes.
