With the increasing demands for new data and real-time services, wireless
networks should support calls with different traffic characteristics and
different Quality of Service (QoS)guarantees. In addition, various wireless
technologies and networks exist currently that can satisfy different needs and
requirements of mobile users. Since these different wireless networks act as
complementary to each other in terms of their capabilities and suitability for
different applications, integration of these networks will enable the mobile
users to be always connected to the best available access network depending on
their requirements. This integration of heterogeneous networks will, however,
lead to heterogeneities in access technologies and network protocols. To meet
the requirements of mobile users under this heterogeneous environment, a common
infrastructure to interconnect multiple access networks will be needed. In this
chapter, the design issues of a number of mobility management schemes have been
presented. Each of these schemes utilizes IP-based technologies to enable
efficient roaming in heterogeneous network. Efficient handoff mechanisms are
essential for ensuring seamless connectivity and uninterrupted service
delivery. A number of handoff schemes in a heterogeneous networking environment
are also presented in this chapter.
