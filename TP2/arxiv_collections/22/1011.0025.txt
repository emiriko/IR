A major challenge in the analysis of population genomics data consists of
isolating signatures of natural selection from background noise caused by
random drift and gene flow. Analyses of massive amounts of data from many
related populations require high-performance algorithms to determine the
likelihood of different demographic scenarios that could have shaped the
observed neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele frequency
spectrum. In many areas of applied mathematics, Fourier Transforms and Spectral
Methods are firmly established tools to analyze spectra of signals and model
their dynamics as solutions of certain Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
When spectral methods are applicable, they have excellent error properties and
are the fastest possible in high dimension. In this paper we present an
explicit numerical solution, using spectral methods, to the forward Kolmogorov
equations for a Wright-Fisher process with migration of K populations, influx
of mutations, and multiple population splitting events.
