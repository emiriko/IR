Massive and supermassive dust spheres (with a zero internal pressure)
collapse to full globes of finite volumes, whose surfaces have the properties
of the event horizon around a mass-point. This fact explains the observational
data concerning Sagittarius A* (SgrA*). By virtue of Hilbert's repulsive
effect, both the event horizon of a mass-point and the event horizon of a full
globe cannot swallow anything.
