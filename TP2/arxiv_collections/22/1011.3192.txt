The research herein studies the Langevin dynamics allowing for an exchange of
energy between liquid crystals and the thermal environment. This dynamics leads
to fluctuation and dissipation behaviors in the motions of liquid crystals, and
therefore drives the system toward non-equilibrium evolutional processes. In
particular, for the operations of liquid-crystal metastable systems, the
fluctuation could allow an excitation (non-equilibrium) transition against
energy barriers to the globally-stable state. Implemented with an actual case
of liquid crystal pi configuration, this work statistically studies the
non-equilibrium metastable transitions and shows the dependence of the
transition-time on the correlations (of fluctuations).
