We systematically study the phase diagram of S=2 spin chain, by means of
density-matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization methods and
confirm the presence of a dimer phase in the AKLT--SZH model. We find that the
whole phase boundary between the dimer and SZH phases, including the
multicritical point, is a critical line with the same central charge $c=5/2$.
Finally, we propose and confirm that this line can be described by the $\rm
SO(5)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory.
