We update our analysis of rho-omega mixing effects in the pion form factor to
incorporate the recently published BaBar e^+e^- --> pi^+\pi^- cross-sections.
The implications for tau-decay-based Standard Model estimates of the leading
order hadronic contribution [a_\mu]_{had}^{LO}, to the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon, and for the extraction of the off-diagonal vector meson
self-energy matrix element, Pi_{\rho\omega}(m_\rho^2), are discussed.
