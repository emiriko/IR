We study small random perturbations by additive white-noise of a spatial
discretization of a reaction-diffusion equation with a stable equilibrium and
solutions that blow up in finite time. We prove that the perturbed system blows
up with total probability and establish its order of magnitude and asymptotic
distribution. For initial data in the domain of explosion we prove that the
explosion time converges to the deterministic one while for initial data in the
domain of attraction of the stable equilibrium we show that the system exhibits
metastable behavior.
