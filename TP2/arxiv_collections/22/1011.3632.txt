Self-stabilizing systems have the ability to converge to a correct behavior
when started in any configuration. Most of the work done so far in the
self-stabilization area assumed either communication via shared memory or via
FIFO channels. This paper is the first to lay the bases for the design of
self-stabilizing message passing algorithms over unreliable non-FIFO channels.
We propose a fault-send-deliver optimal stabilizing data-link layer that
emulates a reliable FIFO communication channel over unreliable capacity bounded
non-FIFO channels.
