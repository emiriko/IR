In this paper I outline my propensiton version of quantum theory (PQT). PQT
is a fully micro-realistic version of quantum theory that provides us with a
very natural possible solution to the fundamental wave/particle problem, and is
free of the severe defects of orthodox quantum theory (OQT) as a result. PQT
makes sense of the quantum world. PQT recovers all the empirical success of OQT
and is, furthermore, empirically testable (although not as yet tested). I argue
that Einstein almost put forward this version of quantum theory in 1916/17 in
his papers on spontaneous and induced radiative transitions, but retreated from
doing so because he disliked the probabilistic character of the idea.
Subsequently, the idea was overlooked because debates about quantum theory
polarised into the Bohr/Heisenberg camp, which argued for the abandonment of
realism and determinism, and the Einstein/Schr\"odinger camp, which argued for
the retention of realism and determinism, no one, as a result, pursuing the
most obvious option of retaining realism but abandoning determinism. It is this
third, overlooked option that leads to PQT. PQT has implications for quantum
field theory, the standard model, string theory, and cosmology. The really
important point, however, is that it is experimentally testable. I indicate two
experiments in principle capable of deciding between PQT and OQT.
