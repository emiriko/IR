We give a new construction of a Hopf subalgebra of the Hopf algebra of Free
quasi-symmetric functions whose bases are indexed by objects belonging to the
Baxter combinatorial family (i.e. Baxter permutations, pairs of twin binary
trees, etc.). This construction relies on the definition of the Baxter monoid,
analog of the plactic monoid and the sylvester monoid, and on a
Robinson-Schensted-like insertion algorithm. The algebraic properties of this
Hopf algebra are studied. This Hopf algebra appeared for the first time in the
work of Reading [Lattice congruences, fans and Hopf algebras, Journal of
Combinatorial Theory Series A, 110:237--273, 2005].
