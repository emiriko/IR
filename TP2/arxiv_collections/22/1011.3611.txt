Selective enhancement of coherent optical phonons in Bi-Sb mixed crystals has
been performed using terahertz (THz) rate pulse trains generated by spatial
phase modulation of femtosecond pulse with a liquid-crystal spatial light
modulator. The profile of the shaped pulse train has a flat-toped shape. The
Bi-Bi, Bi-Sb, and Sb-Sb vibrations can be enhanced and canceled selectively for
pulse trains with a suitable repetition rate.
