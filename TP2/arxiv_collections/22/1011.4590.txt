We consider b-jet production in the quasi-multi-Regge-kinematics approach
based on the hypothesis of the gluon and quark Reggeization in the t-channel
exchanges at the high energy. The data on various spectra of b-jet production
measured by the CDF and D0 Collaborations at the Tevatron Collider are
described well and with no free parameters.
