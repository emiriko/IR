The status of the charged multi-strange baryon analysis (Xi-, anti-Xi+,
Omega-, anti-Omega+) at LHC energies is presented. This report is based on the
results obtained with ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), profiting from
the characteristic cascade-decay topology. A special attention is drawn to the
early pp data-taking period (2009-2010) and subsequently, on the uncorrected
pT-spectra extracted at mid-rapidity for centre of mass energies of 0.9 TeV and
7 TeV.
