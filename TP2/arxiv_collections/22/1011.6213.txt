The model assumptions of the recently formulated framework of
highly-anisotropic and strongly-dissipative hydrodynamics (ADHYDRO) are
analyzed. In particular, we study dependence of numerical results on different
forms of the entropy source and compare our approach with other frameworks
describing locally anisotropic fluids. We also discuss the effects of different
forms of the initial conditions on the process of isotropization.
