A $t-\a$ covering array is an $m\times n$ matrix, with entries from an
alphabet of size $\alpha$, such that for any choice of $t$ rows, and any
ordered string of $t$ letters of the alphabet, there exists a column such that
the "values" of the rows in that column match those of the string of letters.
We use the Lov\'asz Local Lemma in conjunction with a new tiling-based
probability model to improve the upper bound on the smallest number of columns
$N=N(m,t,\alpha)$ of a $t-\a$ covering array.
