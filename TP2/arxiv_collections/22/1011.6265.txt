The bosonized QCD2+QED2 system for quarks with two flavors contains QCD2 and
QED2 bound states, with an isoscalar photon at about 25 MeV and an isovector
(I=1,I_3=0) photon at about 44 MeV. Consequently, when a quark and an antiquark
at the two ends of a string pulls apart from each other at high energies,
hadrons and soft photons will be produced simultaneously in the fragmentation
of the string. The production of the QED2 soft photons in association with
hadrons may explain the anomalous soft photon data in hadron-hadron collisions
and e+e- annihilations at high energies.
