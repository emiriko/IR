We consider the dynamics of a one-dimensional system consisting of dissimilar
hardcore interacting (bouncy) random walkers. The walkers' (diffusing
particles') friction constants xi_n, where n labels different bouncy walkers,
are drawn from a distribution rho(xi_n). We provide an approximate analytic
solution to this recent single-file problem by combining harmonization and
effective medium techniques. Two classes of systems are identified: when
rho(xi_n) is heavy-tailed, rho(xi_n)=A xi_n^(-1-\alpha) (0<alpha<1) for large
xi_n, we identify a new universality class in which density relaxations,
characterized by the dynamic structure factor S(Q,t), follows a Mittag-Leffler
relaxation, and the the mean square displacement of a tracer particle (MSD)
grows as t^delta with time t, where delta=alpha/(1+\alpha). If instead rho is
light-tailedsuch that the mean friction constant exist, S(Q,t) decays
exponentially and the MSD scales as t^(1/2). We also derive tracer particle
force response relations. All results are corroborated by simulations and
explained in a simplified model.
