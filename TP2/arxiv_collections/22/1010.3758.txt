Potential scattering problems governed by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation are investigated numerically for various values of coupling constants.
The initial condition is assumed to have the Gaussian-type envelope, which
differs from the soliton solution. The potential is chosen to be a box or well
type. We estimate the dependences of reflectance and transmittance on the width
of the potential and compare these results with those given by the stationary
Schr\"odinger equation. We attribute the behaviors of these quantities to the
limitation on the width of the nonlinear wave packet. The coupling constant and
the width of the potential play an important role in the distribution of the
waves appearing in the final state of scattering.
