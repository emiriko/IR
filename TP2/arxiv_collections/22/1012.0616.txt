Additional charge carriers were introduced to the iron oxyarsenide
Sr4Sc2Fe2As2O6 under a high-pressure condition, followed by measurements of
electrical resistivity, Hall coefficient, and magnetic susceptibility. The host
compound Sr4Sc2Fe2As2O6 shows metallic conductivity down to ~200 K and turns to
show a semiconducting-like conductivity accompanied by a positive
magneto-resistance (22% at 70 kOe). Although the carrier density is comparable
at 300 K (5.9x1021 cm-3) with that of the other Fe-based superconductors, no
superconductivity appears down to 2 K. This is primarily because the net
carrier density decreases over 3 orders of magnitude on cooling and
additionally a possible magnetic order at ~120 K prevents carriers from
pairing. The properties were altered largely by introducing the additional
carriers.
