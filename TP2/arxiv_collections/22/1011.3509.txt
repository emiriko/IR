Neutron diffraction data obtained on single crystals of PbZr1-xTixO3 with x =
0.325 and x = 0.460, which lie on the pseudorhombohedral side of the
morphotropic phase boundary, suggest a coexistence of rhombohedral (R3m/R3c)
and monoclinic (Cm) domains and that monoclinic order is enhanced by Ti
substitution. A monoclinic phase with a doubled unit cell (Cc) is ruled out as
the ground state.
