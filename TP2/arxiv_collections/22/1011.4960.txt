We analyse same sign dilepton signatures in a non-universal flavor changing
Z' model. These arise due to tt (or t_bar t_bar) production processes due to
the semi-leptonic decays of (anti)tops. We also discuss top reconstruction and
spin measurement using the variable MT2 and MT2-Assisted On-Shell (MAOS)
Momentum} techniques and will also provide a comparison with the on-shell mass
relation method. Sensitivities to the flavor-changing top coupling has also
been estimated for different LHC energies and projected LHC luminosities
corresponding to them.
