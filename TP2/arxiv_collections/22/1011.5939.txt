We prove that if ${\mathcal E} \subset {\Bbb R}^{2d}$, $d \ge 2$, is an
Ahlfors-David regular product set of sufficiently large Hausdorff dimension,
denoted by $dim_{{\mathcal H}}({\mathcal E})$, and $\phi$ is a sufficiently
regular function, then the upper Minkowski dimension of the set $$ \{w \in
{\mathcal E}: \phi_l(w)=t_l; 1 \leq l \leq m \}$$ does not exceed
$dim_{{\mathcal H}}({\mathcal E})-m$, in line with the regular value theorem
from the elementary differential geometry. Our arguments are based on the
mapping properties of the underlying Fourier Integral Operators and are
intimately connected with the Falconer distance conjecture in geometric measure
theory. We shall see that our results are in general sharp in the sense that if
the Hausdorff dimension is smaller than a certain threshold, then the
dimensional inequality fails in a quantifiable way. The constructions used to
demonstrate this are based on the distribution of lattice points on convex
surfaces and have connections with combinatorial geometry.
