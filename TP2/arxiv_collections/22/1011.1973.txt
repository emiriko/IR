Nanophotonic technologies offer great promise for ultra-low power optical
signal processing, but relatively few nonlinear-optical phenomena have yet been
explored as bases for robust digital
modulation/switching~\cite{Yang07,Fara08,Liu10,Noza10}. Here we show that a
single two-level system (TLS) coupled strongly to an optical resonator can
impart binary phase modulation on a saturating probe beam. Our experiment
relies on spontaneous emission to induce occasional transitions between
positive and negative phase shifts---with each such edge corresponding to a
dissipated energy of just one photon ($\approx 0.23$ aJ)---but an optical
control beam could be used to trigger additional phase switching at signalling
rates above this background. Although our ability to demonstrate controlled
switching in our atom-based experiment is limited, we discuss prospects for
exploiting analogous physics in a nanophotonic device incorporating a quantum
dot as the TLS to realize deterministic binary phase modulation with control
power in the aJ/edge regime.
