We consider a formation of the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) phase
in a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) conductor in a magnetic field, parallel to its
conducting chains, where we take into account both the paramagnetic
spin-splitting and orbital destructive effects against superconductivity. We
show that, due to a relative weakness of the orbital effects in a Q1D case, the
LOFF phase appears in (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ superconductor for real values of its
Q1D band parameters. We compare our theoretical calculations with the recent
experimental data by Y. Maeno's group [S. Yonezawa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
\textbf{100}, 117002 (2008)] and show that there is a good qualitative and
quantitative agreement between the theory and experimental data.
