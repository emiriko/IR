We study possible links between quantum gravity phenomenology encoding
Lorentz violations as nonlinear dispersions, the Einstein-Finsler gravity
models, EFG, and nonholonomic (non-integrable) deformations to
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz, HL, and/or Einstein's general relativity, GR, theories.
EFG and its scaling anisotropic versions formulated as Ho\v{r}ava-Finsler
models, HF, are constructed as covariant metric compatible theories on (co)
tangent bundle to Lorentz manifolds and respective anisotropic deformations.
Such theories are integrable in general form and can be quantized following
standard methods of deformation quantization, A-brane formalism and/or
(perturbatively) as a nonholonomic gauge like model with bi-connection
structure. There are natural warping/trapping mechanisms, defined by the
maximal velocity of light and locally anisotropic gravitational interactions in
a (pseudo) Finsler bulk spacetime, to four dimensional (pseudo) Riemannian
spacetimes. In this approach, the HL theory and scenarios of recovering GR at
large distances are generated by imposing nonholonomic constraints on the
dynamics of HF, or EFG, fields.
