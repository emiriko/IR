We derive a first--principles method of determining the van der Waals or
Casimir pressure in a dissipative and dispersive planar multilayered system by
calculating the Maxwell stress tensor in a fictitious layer of vacuum, that is
eventually made to vanish, introduced in the structure. This is illustrated by
calculating the van der Waals pressure in a thin film with dissipative
properties embedded between two semi--infinite media.
