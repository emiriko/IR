We present a rigorous mathematical treatment of the zero-field orbital
magnetic susceptibility of a non-interacting Bloch electron gas, at fixed
temperature and density, for both metals and semiconductors/insulators. In
particular, we obtain the Landau-Peierls formula in the low temperature and
density limit as conjectured by T. Kjeldaas and W. Kohn in 1957.
