Using the available cross section and polarization data for elastic
electron-proton scattering, we provide an extraction of the two-photon exchange
amplitudes at a common value of four-momentum transfer, around Q^2 = 2.5 GeV^2.
This analysis also predicts the e^+ p / e^- p elastic scattering cross section
ratio, which will be measured by forthcoming experiments.
