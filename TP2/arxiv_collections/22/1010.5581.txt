In view of the assumption that any planetary system is likely to be composed
of more than one planet, and the multiple planet system with a large mass
planet has more chance of detailed follow-up observations, the multiple planet
system may be an efficient way to search for sub-Jovian planets. We compare the
magnification pattern of the triple lens system with that of a best-fitted
binary system composed of a star and a Jovian mass planet, and check the
probability in detecting the low-mass secondary planet whose signature will be
superposed on that of the primary Jovian mass planet. Detection probabilities
of the low-mass planet in the triple lens system are quite similar to the
probability in detecting such a low-mass planet in a binary system with a star
and only a low-mass planet, which shows that the signature of a low-mass planet
can be effectively detected even when it is concurrent with the signature of
the more massive planet, implying that the binary superposition approximation
works over a relatively broad range of planet mass ratio and separations, and
the inaccuracies thereof do not significantly affect the detection probability
of the lower mass secondary planet. Since the signature of the Jovian mass
planet will be larger and lasts longer, thereby warranting more intensive
follow-up observations, the actual detection rate of the low-mass planet in a
triple system with a Jovian mass can be significantly higher than that in a
binary system with a low-mass planet only. We conclude that it may be
worthwhile to develop an efficient algorithm to search for `super-Earth'
planets in the paradigm of the triple lens model for high-magnification
microlensing events.
