Rate adaptation plays a key role in determining the performance of wireless
LANs. In this paper, we introduce a semi-Markovian framework to analyze the
performance of two of the most popular rate adaptation algorithms used in
wireless LANs, namely Automatic Rate Fallback (ARF) and Adaptive Automatic Rate
Fallback (AARF). Given our modeling assumptions, the analysis is exact and
provides closed form expressions for the achievable throughput of ARF and AARF.
We illustrate the benefit of our analysis by numerically comparing the
throughput performance of ARF and AARF in two different channel regimes. The
results show that neither of these algorithms consistently outperforms the
other. We thus propose and analyze a new variant to AARF, called Persistent
AARF (or PAARF), and show that it achieves a good compromise between the two
algorithms, often performing close to the best algorithm in each of the studied
regimes. The numerical results also shed light into the impact of MAC overhead
on the performance of the three algorithms. In particular, they show that the
more conservative strategies AARF and PAARF scale better as the bit rate
increases.
