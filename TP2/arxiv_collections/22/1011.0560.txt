We discuss the gluon propagator in 3- and 4-dimensional Yang-Mills theories
in Coulomb gauge and compare it with the corresponding Landau gauge propagator,
showing that for both the relevant IR mass scale coincides. We also report
preliminary results on Coulomb gauge ghost form factor and quark propagators
and give a comment on the gluon propagator's strong coupling limit.
