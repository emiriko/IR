In considering the college admissions problem, almost fifty years ago, Gale
and Shapley came up with a simple abstraction based on preferences of students
and colleges. They introduced the concept of stability and optimality; and
proposed the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm that is proven to lead to a
stable and optimal solution. This algorithm is simple and computationally
efficient. Furthermore, in subsequent studies it is shown that the DA algorithm
is also strategy-proof, which means, when the algorithm is played out as a
mechanism for matching two sides (e.g. colleges and students), the parties
(colleges or students) have no incentives to act other than according to their
true preferences. Yet, in practical college admission systems, the DA algorithm
is often not adopted. Instead, an algorithm known as the Boston Mechanism (BM)
or its variants are widely adopted. In BM, colleges accept students without
deferral (considering other colleges' decisions), which is exactly the opposite
of Gale-Shapley's DA algorithm. To explain and rationalize this reality, we
introduce the notion of reciprocating preference to capture the influence of a
student's interest on a college's decision. This model is inspired by the
actual mechanism used to match students to universities in Hong Kong. The
notion of reciprocating preference defines a class of matching algorithms,
allowing different degrees of reciprocating preferences by the students and
colleges. DA and BM are but two extreme cases (with zero and a hundred percent
reciprocation) of this set. This model extends the notion of stability and
optimality as well. As in Gale-Shapley's original paper, we discuss how the
analogy can be carried over to the stable marriage problem, thus demonstrating
the model's general applicability.
