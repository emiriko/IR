We calculate the first-order perturbation correction to the ground state
energy and chemical potential of a harmonically trapped boson gas with contact
interactions about the infinite repulsion Tonks-Girardeau limit. With $c$
denoting the interaction strength, we find that for a large number of particles
$N$ the $1/c$ correction to the ground state energy increases as $N^{5/2}$, in
contrast to the unperturbed Tonks-Girardeau value that is proportional to
$N^2$. We describe a thermodynamic scaling limit for the trapping frequency
that yields an extensive ground state energy and reproduces the zero
temperature thermodynamics obtained by a local density approximation.
