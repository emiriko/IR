Multiple-input double-output (MIDO) codes are important in the near-future
wireless communications, where the portable end-user device is physically small
and will typically contain at most two receive antennas. Especially tempting is
the 4 x 2 channel due to its immediate applicability in the digital video
broadcasting (DVB). Such channels optimally employ rate-two space-time (ST)
codes consisting of (4 x 4) matrices. Unfortunately, such codes are in general
very complex to decode, hence setting forth a call for constructions with
reduced complexity.
  Recently, some reduced complexity constructions have been proposed, but they
have mainly been based on different ad hoc methods and have resulted in
isolated examples rather than in a more general class of codes. In this paper,
it will be shown that a family of division algebra based MIDO codes will always
result in at least 37.5% worst-case complexity reduction, while maintaining
full diversity and, for the first time, the non-vanishing determinant (NVD)
property. The reduction follows from the fact that, similarly to the Alamouti
code, the codes will be subsets of matrix rings of the Hamiltonian quaternions,
hence allowing simplified decoding. At the moment, such reductions are among
the best known for rate-two MIDO codes. Several explicit constructions are
presented and shown to have excellent performance through computer simulations.
