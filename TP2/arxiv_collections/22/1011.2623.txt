We propose a method to identify and classify evolution equations and systems
that can be multipotentialised in given target equations or target systems. We
refer to this as the {\it converse problem}. Although we mainly study a method
for $(1+1)$-dimensional equations/system, we do also propose an extension of
the methodology to higher-dimensional evolution equations. An important point
is that the proposed converse method allows one to identify certain types of
auto-B\"acklund transformations for the equations/systems. In this respect we
define the {\it triangular-auto-B\"acklund transformation} and derive its
connections to the converse problem. Several explicit examples are given. In
particular we investigate a class of linearisable third-order evolution
equations, a fifth-order symmetry-integrable evolution equation as well as
linearisable systems.
