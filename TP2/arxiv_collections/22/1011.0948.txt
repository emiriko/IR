The dust formed in extended circumstellar envelopes of long-period variables
and Miras has a strong influence on the envelope dynamics. A radiatively driven
instability caused by the formation of dust leads to the development of an
autonomous dynamics characterised by a set of distinct frequencies. We study
the interplay between the envelope's internal dynamics and an external
excitation by a pulsating star.
