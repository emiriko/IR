Ejections from the Sun can be observed with a higher resolution than in any
other astrophysical object: can we build up on solar results and apply them to
astrophysical objects? Aim of this work is to establish whether there is any
analogy between solar ejections and ejections in microquasars and AGNs. Briefly
reviewing jets properties from these objects and from the Sun, we point out
some characteristics they share and indicate research areas where
cross-breeeding between astrophysical and solar research is likely to be
productive. Preliminary results of this study suggest, for instance, that there
may be an analogy between blobs created by tearing instability in current
sheets (CSs) associated with solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and quasi
periodic ejections of plasma associated with large radio outbursts in
microquasars.
