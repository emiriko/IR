We show, by means of ab-initio calculations, that electron-electron
correlations play an important role in potassium-doped picene ($K_x$-picene),
recently characterized as a superconductor with $T_c = 18K$. The inclusion of
exchange interactions by means of hybrid functionals reproduces the correct gap
for the undoped compound and predicts an antiferromagnetic state for $x=3$,
where superconductivity has been observed. The latter finding is compatible
with a sizable value of the correlation strength, in agreement with simple
estimates. Our results highlight the similarity between potassium-doped picene
and alkali-doped fulleride superconductors.
