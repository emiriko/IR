Since the discovery of the first extra-solar planets, we are confronted with
the puzzling diversity of planetary systems. Processes like planet radial
migration in gas-disks and planetary orbital instabilities, often invoked to
explain the exotic orbits of the extra-solar planets, at first sight do not
seem to have played a role in our system. In reality, though, there are several
aspects in the structure of our Solar System that cannot be explained in the
classic scenario of in-situ formation and smooth evolution of the giant
planets. This paper describes a new view of the evolution of the outer Solar
System that emerges from the so-called 'Nice model' and its recent extensions.
The story provided by this model describes a very "dynamical" Solar System,
with giant planets affected by both radial migrations and a temporary orbital
instability. Thus, the diversity between our system and those found so far
around other stars does not seem to be due to different processes that operated
here and elsewhere, but rather stems from the strong sensitivity of chaotic
evolutions to small differences in the initial and environmental conditions.
