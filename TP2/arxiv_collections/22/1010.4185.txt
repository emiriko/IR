Using two different approaches, we perform updated and detailed calculations
of the complete one-loop (Next-to-Leading Order (NLO)) set of electroweak
radiative corrections to the parity violating e- e- -> e- e- (gamma) scattering
asymmetry. Our first approach, more classical, relies on calculations "by hand"
with reasonable approximations. Our second approach relies on program packages
FeynArts, FormCalc, LoopTools, and FORM. The detailed numerical analysis of the
various contributions is provided for a wide range of energies relevant for the
ultra-precise 11 GeV MOLLER experiment planned at the Jefferson Laboratory, as
well as future experiments at the International Linear Collider (ILC). The
numerical results obtained within the on-shell renormalization scheme using two
different sets of renormalization conditions are in excellent agreement. We
also calculate the total NLO correction in the Constrained Differential
Renormalization (CDR) scheme. Analysis of the results, along with the
increasing experimental precision, shows that it is feasible that the
corrections at the Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) level may be important
for the next generation of high-precision experiments.
