We describe some classes of PDE that display hidden symmetry, with reduced
equations having additional symmetry operators compared to the initial
equations. Relations between the concepts of hidden and conditional symmetry,
and between hidden symmetry and equivalence of classes of equations, is
discussed. In particular, we describe equations having hidden and conditional
symmetry under rotations and boosts in the Lorentz and Euclid groups.
