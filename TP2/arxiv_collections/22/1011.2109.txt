We study a four terminal parallel relay-eavesdropper channel which consists
of multiple independent relay-eavesdropper channels as subchannels. For the
discrete memoryless case, we establish inner and outer bounds on the
rate-equivocation region. For each subchannel, secure transmission is obtained
through one of the two coding schemes at the relay: decoding-and-forwarding the
source message or confusing the eavesdropper through noise injection. The inner
bound allows relay mode selection. For the Gaussian model we establish lower
and upper bounds on the perfect secrecy rate. We show that the bounds meet in
some special cases, including when the relay does not hear the source. We
illustrate the analytical results through some numerical examples.
