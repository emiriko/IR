A new hybrid inflationary scenario in the context of $f(R,{\Box}R)$-gravity
is proposed. Demanding the waterfall field to 'support the potential from
below' [unlike the original proposal by Stewart in Phys. Lett. B345, 414
(1995)], we demonstrate that the scalar potential is similar to that of the
large-field chaotic inflation model proposed by Linde in Phys. Lett. B129, 177
(1983). Inflationary observables are used to constrain the parameter space of
our model; in the process, an interesting limit on the number of e-folds N is
found.
