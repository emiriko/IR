The interplay of flavour and collider physics is entering a new era with the
start-up of the LHC. During the past few years rare B decays and in particular
b -> s gamma transitions have been extensively used and provided exciting
opportunities for mapping possible routes beyond the SM. Flavour constraints
play in this manner a complementary role to the direct searches. Here we
present an overview of the existing flavour constraints on various models and
show examples of comparison with the LHC discovery potentials. The SuperIso
program which is dedicated to flavour physics observable calculations is also
described briefly.
