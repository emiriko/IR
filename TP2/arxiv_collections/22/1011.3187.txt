In the Hilbert space of n qubits, we introduce the symplectic space (n odd)
and the orthogonal space (n even) via the spin-flip operator. Under this
mathematical structure we discuss some properties of n qubits, including
homomorphically mapping the local operations of n qubits into the symplectic
group or orthogonal group, and prove that the generalized ``magic basis'' is
just the bi-orthonormal basis (that is, the orthonormal basis of both Hilbert
space and the orthogonal space ). Finally, an example is given to discuss the
application in physics of this mathematical structure.
