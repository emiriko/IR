Observing the violation of Bell's inequality tells us something about all
possible future theories: they must all predict nonlocal correlations. Hence
Nature is nonlocal. After an elementary introduction to nonlocality and a brief
review of some recent experiments, I argue that Nature's nonlocality together
with the existence of free will is incompatible with the many-worlds view of
quantum physics.
