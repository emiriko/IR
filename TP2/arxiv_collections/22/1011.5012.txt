High-order entanglement embedded in multipartite multilevel quantum systems
(qudits) with many degrees of freedom (DOFs) plays an important role in quantum
foundation and quantum engineering. Verifying high-order entanglement without
the restriction of system complexity is a critical need in any experiments on
general entanglement. Here, we introduce a scheme to efficiently detect genuine
high-order entanglement, such as states close to genuine qudit Bell,
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger, and cluster states as well as multilevel multi-DOF
hyperentanglement. All of them can be identified with two local measurement
settings per DOF regardless of the qudit or DOF number. The proposed
verifications together with further utilities such as fidelity estimation could
pave the way for experiments by reducing dramatically the measurement overhead.
