The current report presents the work to investigate the recombination lines
of CII in the spectra of planetary nebulae. Two CIII targets were prepared and
used to generate theoretical data required in the investigation of
recombination lines that arise from collisions between electrons and ions in
thin plasma found in planetary nebulae and other astrophysical objects. One of
these targets contains 9 atomic terms while the other contains 26 terms. For
each one of these targets, theoretical data concerning bound and autoionizing
states were generated in the intermediate coupling approximation by R-matrix
and Autostructure codes and compared to experimental data. The comparison
revealed very good agreement. These theoretical data were then used to generate
emissivity data and compare it to the carbon recombination lines found in the
observational line list of Zhang et al [2005] on the planetary nebula NGC 7027.
The main tool used in this analysis is the `Emissivity' code which is a program
developed by the author [2010] in the course of this investigation to calculate
the emissivity of transition lines from resonances and subsequent cascade
decay. The results of the analysis from both targets using a least-squares
optimization technique indicate a temperature of 10200-10500K of the
line-emitting region.
