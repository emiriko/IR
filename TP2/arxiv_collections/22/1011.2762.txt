We propose and analyze a new approach for quantum state transfer between
remote spin qubits. Specifically, we demonstrate that coherent quantum coupling
between remote qubits can be achieved via certain classes of random,
unpolarized (infinite temperature) spin chains. Our method is robust to
coupling strength disorder and does not require manipulation or control over
individual spins. In principle, it can be used to attain perfect state transfer
over arbitrarily long range via purely Hamiltonian evolution and may be
particularly applicable in a solid-state quantum information processor. As an
example, we demonstrate that it can be used to attain strong coherent coupling
between Nitrogen-Vacancy centers separated by micrometer distances at room
temperature. Realistic imperfections and decoherence effects are analyzed.
