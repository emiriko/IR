We test the usefulness of a generalized inverse participation ratio (GIPR) as
a measure of Anderson localization. The GIPR differs from the usual inverse
participation ratio in that it depends on the local density of states rather
than on the single-electron wavefunctions. This makes it suitable for
application to many-body systems. We benchmark the GIPR by performing a
finite-size scaling analysis of a disordered, noninteracting, three-dimensional
tight-binding lattice. We find values for the critical disorder and critical
exponents that are in agreement with published values.
