We present B, V and I CCD light curves for 101 variable stars belonging to
the globular cluster NGC2419, 60 of which are new discoveries, based on
datasets obtained at the TNG, SUBARU and HST telescopes. The sample includes 75
RR Lyrae stars (of which 38 RRab, 36 RRc and one RRd), one Population II
Cepheid, 12 SX Phoenicis variables, 2 DeltaScuti stars, 3 binary systems, 5
long-period variables, and 3 variables of uncertain classification. The
pulsation properties of the RR Lyrae variables are close to those of Oosterhoff
type II clusters, consistent with the low metal abundance and the cluster
horizontal branch morphology,disfavoring (but not totally ruling out) an
extragalactic hypotesis for the origin of NGC2419. The observed properties of
RR Lyrae and SX Phoenicis stars are used to estimate the cluster reddening and
distance, using a number of different methods. Our final value is
mo(NGC2419)=19.71+/-0.08mag (D= 87.5+/-3.3kpc), with E(B-V)=0.08+/-0.01mag,
[Fe/H]=-2.1dex in the Zinn & West metallicity scale, and a value of Mv that
sets mo(LMC)=18.52mag. This value is in good agreement with most recent
literature estimates of the distance to NGC 2419.
