Supersymmetric monojets may be produced at the Large Hadron Collider by the
process qg -> squark neutralino_1 -> q neutralino_1 neutralino_1, leading to a
jet recoiling against missing transverse momentum. We discuss the feasibility
and utility of the supersymmetric monojet signal. In particular, we examine the
possible precision with which one can ascertain the neutralino_1-squark-quark
coupling via the rate for monojet events. Such a coupling contains information
on the composition of the neutralino_1 and helps bound dark matter direct
detection cross-sections and the dark matter relic density of the neutralino_1.
It also provides a check of the supersymmetric relation between gauge couplings
and gaugino-quark-squark couplings.
