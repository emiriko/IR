We test local and semi-local density functionals for the electronic exchange
for a variety of systems including atoms, molecules, and atomic chains. In
particular, we focus on a recent universal extension of the Becke-Johnson
exchange potential [E. R\"as\"anen, S. Pittalis, and C. R. Proetto, J. Chem.
Phys. 132, 044112 (2010)]. It is shown that when this potential is used
together with the Becke-Roussel approximation to the Slater potential [A. D.
Becke and M. R. Roussel, Phys. Rev. A 39, 3761 (1989)], a good overall
agreement is obtained with experimental and numerically exact results for
several systems, and with a moderate computational cost. Thus, this
approximation is a very promising candidate in the quest for a simple and
all-round semi-local potential.
