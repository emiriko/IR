Using 3D-MHD Eulerian-grid numerical simulations, we study the formation and
evolution of rising magnetic towers propagating into an ambient medium. The
towers are generated from a localized injection of pure magnetic energy. No
rotation is imposed on the plasma. We compare the evolution of a radiatively
cooling tower with an adiabatic one, and find that both bend due to pinch
instabilities. Collimation is stronger in the radiative cooling case; the
adiabatic tower tends to expand radially. Structural similarities are found
between these towers and the millimeter scale magnetic towers produced in
laboratory experiments.
