In this Chapter, we ask questions (1) What is the right way to measure the
quality of information processing in a biological system? and (2) What can
real-life organisms do in order to improve their performance in
information-processing tasks? We then review the body of work that investigates
these questions experimentally, computationally, and theoretically in
biological domains as diverse as cell biology, population biology, and
computational neuroscience
