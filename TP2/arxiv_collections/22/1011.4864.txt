We show that all the time-dependent statistical properties of the rightmost
points of a branching Brownian motion can be extracted from the traveling wave
solutions of the Fisher-KPP equation. We show that the distribution of all the
distances between the rightmost points has a long time limit which can be
understood as the delay of the Fisher-KPP traveling waves when the initial
condition is modified. The limiting measure exhibits the surprising property of
superposability: the statistical properties of the distances between the
rightmost points of the union of two realizations of the branching Brownian
motion shifted by arbitrary amounts are the same as those of a single
realization. We discuss the extension of our results to more general branching
random walks.
