For a class of partially hyperbolic $C^k$, $k>1$ diffeomorphisms with circle
center leaves we prove existence and finiteness of physical (or
Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen) measures, whose basins cover a full Lebesgue measure subset
of the ambient manifold. Our conditions contain an open and dense subset of all
$C^k$ partially hyperbolic skew-products on compact circle bundles.
  Our arguments blend ideas from the theory of Gibbs states for diffeomorphisms
with mostly contracting center direction together with recent progress in the
theory of cocycles over hyperbolic systems that call into play geometric
properties of invariant foliations such as absolute continuity. Recent results
show that absolute continuity of the center foliation is often a rigid property
among volume preserving systems. We prove that this is not at all the case in
the dissipative setting, where absolute continuity can even be robust.
