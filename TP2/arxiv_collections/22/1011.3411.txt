In this article we describe a method for carrying out Bayesian estimation for
the double Pareto lognormal (dPlN) distribution which has been proposed as a
model for heavy-tailed phenomena. We apply our approach to estimate the
$\mathit{dPlN}/M/1$ and $M/\mathit{dPlN}/1$ queueing systems. These systems
cannot be analyzed using standard techniques due to the fact that the dPlN
distribution does not possess a Laplace transform in closed form. This
difficulty is overcome using some recent approximations for the Laplace
transform of the interarrival distribution for the $\mathit{Pareto}/M/1$
system. Our procedure is illustrated with applications in internet traffic
analysis and risk theory.
