The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), presently under
construction, is a revolutionary astronomical interferometer, that will operate
at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. With unprecedented sensitivity, resolution, and
imaging capability, ALMA will explore the (sub-)mm Universe, one of astronomy's
last frontiers. ALMA is expected to provide insight in star- and galaxy
formation in the early Universe and to image local star- and planet formation
in great detail. The ALMA Commissioning and Science Verification phase is
currently in course, preparing the path for Early Science. The Call for ALMA
Early Science proposals is expected to be released before the end of 2010. In
this contribution we will describe the ALMA project, the array and its
receivers, its science goals, and its scientific and technological potential.
We will outline the organizational structure of the ALMA Regional Centres, that
will play an important role in providing support to the users, with particular
attention to the Italian ALMA Regional Centre in Bologna. Finally, we will
illustrate what ALMA can contribute to the specific science case of AGN
fueling.
