This paper presents the results of an U band survey with FORS1/VLT of a large
area in the sigma Orionis star-forming region. We combine the U-band photometry
with literature data to compute accretion luminosity and mass accretion rates
from the U-band excess emission for all objects (187) detected by Spitzer in
the FORS1 field and classified by Hernandez et al. (2007) as likely members of
the cluster. The sample stars range in mass from ~0.06 to ~1.2 Msun; 72 of them
show evidence of disks and we measure mass accretion rates Macc between
<10^{-11} and few 10^{-9} Msun/yr, using the colors of the diskless stars as
photospheric templates. Our results confirm the dependence of Macc on the mass
of the central object, which is stronger for low-mass stars and flattens out
for masses larger than ~0.3 Msun; the spread of Macc for any value of the
stellar mass is ~2 orders of magnitude. We discuss the implications of these
results in the context of disk evolution models. Finally, we analyze the
relation between Macc and the excess emission in the Spitzer bands, and find
that at Macc ~10^{-10} Msun/yr the inner disks change from optically thin to
optically thick.
