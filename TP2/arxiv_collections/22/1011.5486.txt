We study the distribution of closed geodesics for the modular surface. We
improve the error term in the prime geodesic theorem, and obtain results on
prime geodesics in very short intervals conditionally on the generalized
Riemann Hypothesis for Dirichlet L-functions. We emphasize a connection between
the closed geodesics and certain Dirichlet L-functions.
