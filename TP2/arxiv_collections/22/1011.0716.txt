BellQMA protocols are a subclass of multi-prover quantum Merlin-Arthur
protocols in which the verifier is restricted to perform
nonadaptive,unentangled measurements on the quantum states received from each
Merlin. In this paper, we prove that m-clause 3-SAT instances have BellQMA
proofs of satisfiability with constant soundness gap, in which
O(sqrt(m)polylog(m)) Merlins each send O(log m) qubits to Arthur. Our result
answers a question of Aaronson et al., who gave a protocol with similar
parameters that used entangled measurements; the analysis of our protocol is
significantly simpler than that of Aaronson et al. Our result also complements
recent work of Brandao, Christandl, and Yard, who showed upper bounds on the
power of multiprover quantum proofs with unentangled but adaptive (LOCC)
measurements.
