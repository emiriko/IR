We have studied a model of a random walk in a quenched random environment. In
addition to featuring anomalous diffusion and localization, for special regimes
of disorder parameters the particle density decomposes into multi-Gaussian
structure while its cumulative distribution is normal. We explain the observed
fine structure of the density and point out its significance to experiments.
