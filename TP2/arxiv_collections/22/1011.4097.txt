Here we show how an anisotropic fluid in the diffusion limit can be
equivalent to an isotropic fluid in the streaming out limit, in spherical
symmetry. For a particular equation of state this equivalence is total, from
one fluid we can obtain the other and vice versa. A numerical master model is
presented, based on a generic equation of state, in which only quantitative
differences are displayed between both nonadiabatic fluids. From a deeper view,
other difference between fluids is shown as an asymmetry that can be overcome
if we consider the appropriate initial-boundary conditions. Equivalence in this
context can be considered as a first order method of approximation to study
dissipative fluids.
