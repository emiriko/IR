We examine the effect of cluster size on the interaction of
Ar$_{55}$-Ar$_{2057}$ with intense extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses, using a
model we developed earlier that includes ionization via collisional excitation
as an intermediate step. We find that the dynamics of these irradiated clusters
is dominated by collisions. Larger clusters are more highly collisional,
produce higher charge states, and do so more rapidly than smaller clusters.
Higher charge states produced via collisions are found to reduce the overall
photon absorption, since charge states of Ar$^{2+}$ and higher are no longer
photo-accessible. We call this mechanism \textit{collisionally reduced
photoabsorption}, and it decreases the effective cluster photoabsorption
cross-section by more than 30% for Ar$_{55}$ and 45% Ar$_{2057}$. compared to
gas targets with the same number of atoms. An investigation of the shell
structure soon after the laser interaction shows an almost uniformly charged
core with a modestly charged outer shell which evolves to a highly charged
outer shell through collisions. This leads to the explosion of the outer
positive shell and a slow expansion of the core, as was observed in mixed
clusters at shorter wavelength [1]. The time evolution of the electron kinetic
energy distribution begins as a (mostly) Maxwellian distribution. Larger
clusters initially have higher temperature, but are overtaken by smaller
temperature after the laser pulse. The electron velocity distribution of large
clusters quickly become isotropic while smaller clusters retain the inherent
anisotropy created by photoionization.Lastly, the total electron kinetic energy
distribution is integrated over the spacial profile of the laser and the
log-normal distribution of cluster size for comparison with a recent experiment
[2], and good agreement is found.
