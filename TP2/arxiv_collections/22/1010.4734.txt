We conducted a near-infrared imaging survey of 11 young dwarfs in the
Pleiades cluster using the Subaru Telescope and the near-infrared coronagraph
imager. We found 10 faint point sources, with magnitudes as faint as 20 mag in
the K-band, around 7 dwarfs. Comparison with Spitzer archive images revealed
that a pair of the faint sources around V 1171 Tau are very red in the infrared
wavelengths, indicative of very low-mass young stellar objects. However, the
results of our follow-up proper motion measurements implied that the central
star and the faint sources do not share common proper motions, suggesting that
they are not physically associated.
