We follow a model based on the SU(8) symmetry for the interaction of mesons
with baryons. The model treats on an equal footing the pseudo-scalars and the
vector mesons, as required by heavy quark symmetry. The T-matrix calculated
within an unitary scheme in coupled channels has poles which are interpreted as
baryonic resonances.
