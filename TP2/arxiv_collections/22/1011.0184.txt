We construct the transfer matrix for the ghost sector of partially quenched
QCD. This transfer matrix is not hermitian, but we show that it is still
bounded. We thus expect that all euclidean correlation functions will decay
exponentially with distance (up to possible powers), and demonstrate that this
is indeed the case for free ghost quarks.
