We give a homological interpretation of the coefficients of the Hilbert
series for an algebra associated with a directed graph and its dual algebra.
This allows us to obtain necessary conditions for Koszulity of such algebras in
terms of homological properties of the graphs. We use our results to construct
algebras with a prescribed Hilbert series.
