Extensive Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to investigate the nature
of the ordering transition of a model of adsorbed self-assembled rigid rods on
the bonds of a square lattice [Tavares et. al., Phys. Rev E 79, 021505 (2009)].
The polydisperse rods undergo a continuous ordering transition that is found to
be in the two-dimensional Ising universality class, as in models where the rods
are monodisperse. This finding is in sharp contrast with the recent claim that
equilibrium polydispersity changes the nature of the phase transition in this
class of models [L`opez et. al., Phys. Rev E 80, 040105(R)(2009)].
