We consider the heat equation in a multidimensional domain with nonlocal
hysteresis feedback control in a boundary condition. Thermostat is our
prototype model. We construct all periodic solutions with exactly two switching
on the period and study their stability. Coexistence of several periodic
solutions with different stability properties is proved to be possible. A
mechanism of appearance and disappearance of periodic solutions is
investigated.
