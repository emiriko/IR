In this paper we attempt to give a new understanding of quantum double-slit
interference of fermions in the framework of General Nonlocality (GN) [J. Math.
Phys. 49, 033513 (2008)] by studying the self-(inter)action of matter wave.
From the metric of the GN, we derive a special formalism to interpret the
interference contrast when the self-action is perturbative. According to the
formalism, the characteristic of interference pattern is in agreement with
experiment qualitatively. As examples, we apply the formalism to the cases
governed by Schr\"odinger current and Dirac current respectively, both of which
are relevant to topology. The gap between these two cases corresponds to the
fermion magnetic moment, which is possible to test in the near future. In
addition, a general interference formalism for both perturbative and
non-perturbative self-actions is presented. By analyzing the general formalism
we predict that in the nonperturbative limit there is no interference at all.
And by comparison with the special formalism of Schr\"odinger current, the
coupling strength of self-action in the limit is found to be $\infty$. In the
perturbative case, the interference from self-action turns out to be the same
as that from standard approach of quantum theory. Then comparing the
corresponding coefficients quantitatively we conclude that the coupling
strength of self-action in this case falls in the interval $[0,1]$.
