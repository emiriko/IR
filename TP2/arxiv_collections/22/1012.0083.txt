This paper clarifies the microscopic nature of the staggered scalar order,
which is specific to even number of f electrons per site. In such systems,
crystalline electric field (CEF) can make a singlet ground state. As exchange
interaction with conduction electrons increases, the CEF singlet at each site
gives way to Kondo singlets. The collective Kondo singlets are identified with
itinerant states that form energy bands. Near the boundary of itinerant and
localized states, a new type of electronic order appears with staggered Kondo
and CEF singlets. We present a phenomenological three-state model that
qualitatively reproduces the characteristic phase diagram, which have been
obtained numerically with use of the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo
combined with the dynamical mean-field theory. The scalar order observed in
PrFe_4P_{12} is ascribed to this staggered order accompanying charge density
wave (CDW) of conduction electrons. Accurate photoemission and tunneling
spectroscopy should be able to probe sharp peaks below and above the Fermi
level in the ordered phase.
