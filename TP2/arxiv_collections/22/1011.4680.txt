Nobel Prize in Physics 2010 was given for "groundbreaking experiments
regarding the two-dimensional material graphene." In fact, before graphene has
been extracted from graphite and measured, some of its fundamental physical
properties have already been experimentally uncovered in bulk graphite. In this
Letter to the Nobel Committee we propose to include those findings in the
Scientific Background
