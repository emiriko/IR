Multifunctional oxides are promising materials because of their fundamental
physical properties as well as their potential in applications1. Among these
materials, multiferroics exhibiting ferroelectricity and magnetism are good
candidates for spin electronic applications using the magnetoelectric effect,
which couples magnetism and ferroelecticity. Furthermore, because
ferroelectrics are insulators with a reasonable bandgap, photons can
efficiently interact with electrons leading to photoconduction or photovoltaic
effects. However, until now, coupling of light with mechanical degrees of
freedom has been elusive, although ferroelasticity is a well-known property of
these materials. Here, we report on the observation, for the first time, of a
substantial visiblelight- induced change in the dimensions of BiFeO3 crystals
at room temperature. The relative light-induced photostrictive effect is of the
order of 10e-5 with response times below 0.1s. It depends on the polarization
of incident light as well as applied magnetic fields. This opens the
perspective of combining mechanical, magnetic, electric and optical
functionalities in future generations of remote switchable devices.
