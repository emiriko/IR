We reexamine quantum correlation from the fundamental perspective of its
consanguineous quantum property, the coherence. We emphasize the importance of
specifying the tensor product structure of the total state space before
discussing quantum correlation. A measure of quantum correlation for arbitrary
dimension bipartite states using nonlocal coherence is proposed, and it can be
easily generalized to the multipartite case. The quantification of
non-entangled component within quantum correlation is investigated for certain
states.
