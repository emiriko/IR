A systematic study based on the self-consistent dynamical simulations is
presented for the spontaneous evolution of an isolated thin solid droplet on a
rigid substrate, which is driven by the surface drift diffusion induced by the
anisotropic capillary forces (surface stiffness) and mismatch stresses. In this
work, we studied the affect of surface free energy anisotropies on the
development kinetics of the 'Stranski-Krastanow' island type morphology. The
anisotropic surface free energy and the surface stiffness were treated with
well accepted trigonometric functions. Although, various tilt angles and
anisotropy constants were considered during simulations, the main emphasis was
given on the effect of rotational symmetries associated with the surface
Helmholtz free energy topography in 2D space. Our computer simulations revealed
the formation of an extremely thin wetting layer during the development of the
bell-shaped Stranski-Krastanow island through the mass accumulation at the
central region of the droplet via surface drift-diffusion. In the strong
(anomalous) anisotropy constant domain, we demonstrated the existence of two
distinct morphological modes: i) the complete stability of the initial
Cosine-shaped droplet just above a certain anisotropy constant threshold level
by spontaneous slight readjustments of the base and the height of the cluster;
ii) the Frank-van der Merwe mode of thin film formation for very large values
of the anisotropy constant by the spreading and coalescence of the droplets
over the substrate surface. During the course of the simulations, we have
continuously tracked both the morphology (i.e., the peak height, the extension
of the wetting layer beyond the domain boundaries, and the triple junction
contact angle) and energetic (the global Helmholtz free energy changes
associated with the total strain and surface energy variations) of the system.
