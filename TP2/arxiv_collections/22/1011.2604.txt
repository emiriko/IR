We present extensive simulation studies on the performance of algorithms for
the Compton sequence reconstruction used for the development of a portable
spectroscopic instrument (COCAE), with the capability to localize and identify
radioactive sources, by exploiting the Compton scattering imaging. Various
Compton Sequence reconstruction algorithms have been compared using a large
number of simulated events. These algorithms are based on Compton kinematics,
as well as on statistical test criteria that exploit the redundant information
of events having two or more photon interactions in the active detector's
volume. The efficiency of the best performing technique is estimated for a wide
range of incident gamma-ray photons emitted from point-like gamma sources.
