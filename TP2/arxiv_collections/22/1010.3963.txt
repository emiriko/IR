Observations of cosmic rays have been improving at all energies, with higher
statistics and reduced systematics. Fundamental questions remain regarding the
origins of cosmic rays both within the Galaxy and in extragalactic sources, and
new puzzles have arisen at ultra-high energies. A key issue is determining the
elemental composition based on air shower measurements. Accelerator experiments
at the LHC, with comprehensive measurements in the forward direction and high
interaction energies, will greatly reduce the uncertainty in air shower
simulations. Ultra-high energy air showers may reveal properties of particle
interactions at energies far beyond the reach of the LHC.
