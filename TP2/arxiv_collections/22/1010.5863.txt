We have measured the quantum-interference magnetoresistances in two single
indium tin oxide (ITO) nanowires between 0.25 and 40 K, by using the four-probe
configuration method. The magnetoresistances are compared with the
one-dimensional weak-(anti)localization theory to extract the electron
dephasing length $L_\phi$. We found, in a 60-nm diameter nanowire with a low
resistivity of $\rho$(10 K) = 185 $\mu \Omega$ cm, that $L_\phi$ is long,
increasing from 150 nm at 40 K to 520 nm at 0.25 K. Therefore, the nanowire
reveals strict one-dimensional weak-localization effect up to several tens of
degrees of Kelvin. In a second 72-nm diameter nanowire with a high resistivity
of $\rho$(10 K) = 1030 $\mu \Omega$ cm, the dephasing length is suppressed to
$L_\phi$(0.26 K) = 200 nm, and thus a crossover of the effective device
dimensionality from one to three occurs at about 12 K. In particular,
disorder-induced spin-orbit coupling is evident in the latter sample,
manifesting weak-antilocalization effect at temperatures below $\sim$ 4 K.
These observations demonstrate that versatile quantum-interference effects can
be realized in ITO nanowires by controlling differing levels of atomic defects
and impurities.
