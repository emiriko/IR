In this talk we present techniques for calculating one-loop amplitudes for
multi-leg processes using Feynman diagrammatic methods in a semi-algebraic
context. Our approach combines the advantages of the different methods allowing
for a fast evaluation of the amplitude while monitoring the numerical stability
of the calculation. In phase space regions close to singular kinematics we use
a method avoiding spurious Gram determinants in the calculation. As an
application of our approach we report on the status of the calculation of the
amplitude for the process $pp\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}+X$.
