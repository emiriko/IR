The Kondo effect is theoretically studied in a quantum dot embedded in a
mesoscopic ring. The ring is connected to two external leads, which enables the
transport measurement. Using the "poor man's" scaling method, we obtain
analytical expressions of the Kondo temperature T_K as a function of the
Aharonov-Bohm phase \phi by the magnetic flux penetrating the ring. In this
Kondo problem, there are two characteristic lengths. One is the screening
length of the charge fluctuation, L_c=\hbar v_F/ |\epsilon_0|, where v_F is the
Fermi velocity and \epsilon_0 is the energy level in the quantum dot. The other
is the screening length of spin fluctuation, i.e., size of Kondo screening
cloud, L_K=\hbar v_F/ T_K. We obtain different expressions of T_K(\phi) for (i)
L_c \ll L_K \ll L, (ii) L_c \ll L \ll L_K, and (iii) L \ll L_c \ll L_K, where L
is the size of the ring. T_K is markedly modulated by \phi in cases (ii) and
(iii), whereas it hardly depends on \phi in case (i). We also derive
logarithmic corrections to the conductance at temperature T\gg T_K and an
analytical expression of the conductance at T\ll T_K, on the basis of the
scaling analysis.
