The dynamic structures of the cubic and tetragonal phase in BaTiO3 and its
dielectric response above the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition temperature
(Tp) are studied by first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It's
shown that the phase transition is due to the condensation of one of the
transverse correlations. Calculation of the phonon properties for both the
cubic and tetragonal phase shows a saturation of the soft mode frequency near
60 cm-1 near Tp and advocates its order-disorder nature. Our first-principles
calculation leads directly to a two modes feature of the dielectric function
above Tp [Phys. Rev. B 28, 6097 (1983)], which well explains the long time
controversies between experiments and theories.
