We used first-principles methods to perform a systematic search for
potentially-stable phases of multiferroic BiFeO3. We considered a simulation
cell compatible with the atomic distortions that are most common among
perovskite oxides, and found a large number of local minima of the energy
within 100 meV/f.u. of the ferroelectric ground state. We discuss the variety
of low-symmetry structures discovered, as well as the implications of these
findings as regards current experimental (e.g., on thin films displaying {\em
super-tetragonal} phases) and theoretical (on models for BiFeO3's structural
phase transitions) work on this compound.
