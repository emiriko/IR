Many secure communication libraries used by distributed systems, such as SSL,
TLS, and Kerberos, fail to make a clear distinction between the authentication,
session, and communication layers. In this paper we introduce CEDAR, the secure
communication library used by the Condor High Throughput Computing software,
and present the advantages to a distributed computing system resulting from
CEDAR's separation of these layers. Regardless of the authentication method
used, CEDAR establishes a secure session key, which has the flexibility to be
used for multiple capabilities. We demonstrate how a layered approach to
security sessions can avoid round-trips and latency inherent in network
authentication. The creation of a distinct session management layer allows for
optimizations to improve scalability by way of delegating sessions to other
components in the system. This session delegation creates a chain of trust that
reduces the overhead of establishing secure connections and enables centralized
enforcement of system-wide security policies. Additionally, secure channels
based upon UDP datagrams are often overlooked by existing libraries; we show
how CEDAR's structure accommodates this as well. As an example of the utility
of this work, we show how the use of delegated security sessions and other
techniques inherent in CEDAR's architecture enables US CMS to meet their
scalability requirements in deploying Condor over large-scale, wide-area grid
systems.
