White dwarfs are almost completely degenerate objects that cannot obtain
energy from the thermonuclear sources and their evolution is just a
gravothermal process of cooling. The simplicity of these objects, the fact that
the physical inputs necessary to understand them are well identified, although
not always well understood, and the impressive observational background about
white dwarfs make them the most well studied Galactic population. These
characteristics allow to use them as laboratories to test new ideas of physics.
In this contribution we discuss the robustness of the method and its
application to the axion case.
