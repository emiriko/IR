We report a new reversal mechanism of magnetic vortex cores in nanodot
elements driven by out-of-plane currents, occurring through two coupled
edge-solitons via dynamic transformations between magnetic solitons of
different topological charges. This mechanism differs completely from the well
known switching process mediated by the creation and annihilation of
vortex-antivortex pairs in terms of the associated topological solitons,
energies, and spin-wave emissions. Strongly localized out-of-plane gyrotropic
fields induced by the fast motion of the two coupled edge-solitons enable a
magnetization dip that plays a crucial role in the formation of the reversed
core magnetization. This work provides a new physical insight into the dynamic
transformations of magnetic solitons in nanoelements.
