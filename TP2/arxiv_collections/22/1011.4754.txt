We demonstrate that the Dubna-Mainz-Taipei (DMT) meson-exchange dynamical
model, which starts from an effective chiral Lagrangian, for pion
photoproduction provides an excellent and economic framework to describe both
the pi^0 threshold production and the Delta deformation, two features dictated
by chiral dynamics.
