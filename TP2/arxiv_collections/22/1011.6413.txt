We present and analyse near-infrared spectroscopy for a sample of 28
gravitationally- lensed star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 1.5 < z <
5, observed mostly with the Keck II telescope. With typical magnifications of
~1.5-4 magnitudes, our survey provides a valuable census of star formation
rates, gas-phase metallicities and dynamical masses for a representative sample
of low luminosity galaxies seen at a formative period in cosmic history. We
find less evolution in the mass-metallicity relation compared to earlier work
that focused on more luminous systems with z - 2-3, especially in the low mass
(- 10^9 Msol) where our sample is - 0.25 dex more metal-rich. We interpret this
offset as a result of the lower star formation rates (typically a factor of -10
lower) for a given stellar mass in our sub-luminous systems. Taking this effect
into account, we conclude our objects are consistent with a fundamental
metallicity relation recently proposed from unlensed observations.
