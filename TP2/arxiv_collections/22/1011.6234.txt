Surfaces sputtered by ion beam bombardment have been known to exhibit
patterns whose behavior is modeled with stochastic partial differential
equations. A widely accepted model is the Cuerno-Barabasi model which is robust
in its predictions of sputtered surface morphologies. An understanding of the
factors responsible for such surface topographies can be achieved by using
scaling arguments on the stochastic model. For such explanations, knowledge of
the coefficients is crucial. The more so since these vary with different
materials, the sputtering process itself generates non-equilibrium surfaces
within some finite timescale, and the implication of recent results of surface
topographies unexplained by the continuum theory. We calculate and study these
coefficients as functions of the sputtering parameters for yet unreported cases
of anisotropic ion energy distribution within the sputtered material.
Consequently, we present phase diagrams for the significant case of anisotropic
ion straggle. We observe shifts in the phase boundaries when the collision
cascade geometry rotates, and we also found saturation behavior in the
diagrams; in which case the boundaries become independent of the penetration
depths. Our results indicate a possible origin of yet unexplained nanodot
topographies arising from oblique incidence ion etching of amorphized surfaces.
