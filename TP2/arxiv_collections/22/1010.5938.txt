Takens' Embedding Theorem remarkably established that concatenating M
previous outputs of a dynamical system into a vector (called a delay coordinate
map) can be a one-to-one mapping of a low-dimensional attractor from the system
state space. However, Takens' theorem is fragile in the sense that even small
imperfections can induce arbitrarily large errors in this attractor
representation. We extend Takens' result to establish deterministic, explicit
and non-asymptotic sufficient conditions for a delay coordinate map to form a
stable embedding in the restricted case of linear dynamical systems and
observation functions. Our work is inspired by the field of Compressive Sensing
(CS), where results guarantee that low-dimensional signal families can be
robustly reconstructed if they are stably embedded by a measurement operator.
However, in contrast to typical CS results, i) our sufficient conditions are
independent of the size of the ambient state space, and ii) some system and
measurement pairs have fundamental limits on the conditioning of the embedding
(i.e., how close it is to an isometry), meaning that further measurements
beyond some point add no further significant value. We use several simple
simulations to explore the conditions of the main results, including the
tightness of the bounds and the convergence speed of the stable embedding. We
also present an example task of estimating the attractor dimension from
time-series data to highlight the value of stable embeddings over traditional
Takens' embeddings.
