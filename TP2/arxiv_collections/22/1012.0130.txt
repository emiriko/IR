The development of a package for the management of physics data is described:
its design, implementation and computational benchmarks. This package improves
the data management tools originally developed for Geant4 physics models based
on the EADL, EEDL and EPDL97 data libraries. The implementation exploits recent
evolutions of the C++ libraries appearing in the C++0x draft, which are
intended for inclusion in the next C++ ISO Standard. The new tools improve the
computational performance of physics data management.
