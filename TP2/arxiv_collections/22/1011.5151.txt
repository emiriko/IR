Simulations of QCD suffer from severe critical slowing down towards the
continuum limit. This problem is known to be prominent in the topological
charge, however, all observables are affected to various degree by these slow
modes in the Monte Carlo evolution. We investigate the slowing down in high
statistics simulations and propose a new error analysis method, which gives a
realistic estimate of the contribution of the slow modes to the errors.
