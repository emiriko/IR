We perform particle-number projected mean-field study using the recently
developed symmetry-projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations. Realistic
calculations have been performed in sd- and fp-shell nuclei using the shell
model empirical intearctions, USD and GXPFIA. It is demonstrated that the
mean-field results for energy surfaces, obtained with these shell model
interactions, are quite similar to those obtained using the density functional
approaches. Further, it is shown that particle-number projected results, for
neutron rich isotopes, can lead to different ground-state shapes in comparison
to the bare HFB calculations.
