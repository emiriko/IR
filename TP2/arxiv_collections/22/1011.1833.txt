The space-time foam formulas, quoted below in Eqs (1) and (3), express the
minimal amount of quantum uncertainty to be introduced into the structure of
the Einsteinian space-time in order to make that structure compatible with
quantum mechanics. In addition to their theoretical significance, the formulas
lead to far reaching observable consequences shortly recalled below in the last
section. The main purpose of the present note is the examination of the
reliability and the comparison of various derivations of the said formulas.
