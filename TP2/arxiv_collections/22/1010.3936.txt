We first define a quantity exhibiting the usefulness of bipartite quantum
states for teleportation, called the quantum teleportation capability, and then
investigate its restricted shareability in multi-party quantum systems. In this
work, we verify that the quantum teleportation capability has a monogamous
property in its shareability for arbitrary three-qutrit pure states by
employing the monogamy inequality in terms of the negativity.
