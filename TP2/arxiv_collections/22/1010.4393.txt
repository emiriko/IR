We calculate quantum transport for metal-graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions
within the atomistic self-consistent Schr\"odinger/Poisson scheme. Attention is
paid on both the chemical aspects of the interface bonding as well the
one-dimensional electrostatics along the ribbon length. Band-bending and doping
effects strongly influence the transport properties, giving rise to conductance
asymmetries and a selective suppression of the subband formation. Junction
electrostatics and p-type characteristics drive the conduction mechanism in the
case of high work function Au, Pd and Pt electrodes, while contact resistance
becomes dominant in the case of Al.
