Potentials of quark--anti-quark pairs are studied from the anti-q--q
Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions in quenched lattice QCD. With the use
of a method which has been recently developed in the derivation of nuclear
forces from QCD, we derive the anti-q--q potentials with finite quark masses
from the NBS wave functions. We calculate the anti-q--q NBS wave functions in
pseudo-scalar and vector channels for several quark masses. The derived
potentials in both channels reveal linear confinement plus Coulomb potentials.
We also discuss the quark-mass and channel dependence of the anti-q--q
potentials.
