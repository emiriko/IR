We reevaluate the hadronic contributions to the muon magnetic anomaly, and to
the running of the electromagnetic coupling constant at the Z-boson mass. We
include new pi+pi- cross-section data from KLOE, all available multi-hadron
data from BABAR, a reestimation of missing low-energy contributions using
results on cross sections and process dynamics from BABAR, a reevaluation of
all experimental contributions using the software package HVPTools, together
with a reanalysis of inter-experiment and inter-channel correlations, and a
reevaluation of the continuum contributions from perturbative QCD at four
loops. These improvements lead to a decrease in the hadronic contributions with
respect to earlier evaluations. For the muon g-2 we find lowest-order hadronic
contributions of (692.3 +- 4.2) 10^-10 and (701.5 +- 4.7) 10^-10 for the e+e-
based and tau-based analyses, respectively, and full Standard Model predictions
that differ by 3.6 sigma and 2.4 sigma from the experimental value. For the
e+e- based five-quark hadronic contribution to alpha(MZ) we find
Delta_alpha_had[5](MZ)=(275.7 +- 1.0) 10^-4. The reduced electromagnetic
coupling strength at MZ leads to an increase by 7 GeV in the most probable
Higgs boson mass obtained by the standard Gfitter fit to electroweak precision
data.
