We develop a theoretical description of intravalley scattering of
quasiparticles in graphene from multiple short-range scatterers of size much
greater than the carbon-carbon bond length. Our theory provides a method to
rapidly calculate the Green's function in graphene for arbitrary configurations
of scatterers. We demonstrate that non-collinear multiple scattering
trajectories generate pseudospin rotations that alter quasiparticle
interference, resulting in significant modifications to the shape, intensity,
and pattern of the interference fringes in the local density of states (LDOS).
We illustrate these effects via theoretical calculations of the LDOS for a
variety of scattering configurations in single layer graphene. A clear
understanding of impurity scattering in graphene is a step towards exploiting
graphene's unique properties to build future devices.
