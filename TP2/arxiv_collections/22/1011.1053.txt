The BL Lacertae object 3C 66A was detected in a flaring state by the Fermi
Large Area Telescope (LAT) and VERITAS in 2008 October. In addition to these
gamma-ray observations, F-GAMMA, GASP-WEBT, PAIRITEL, MDM, ATOM, Swift, and
Chandra provided radio to X-ray coverage. The available light curves show
variability and, in particular, correlated flares are observed in the optical
and Fermi-LAT gamma-ray band. The resulting spectral energy distribution can be
well fit using standard leptonic models with and without an external radiation
field for inverse-Compton scattering. It is found, however, that only the model
with an external radiation field can accommodate the intra-night variability
observed at optical wavelengths.
