Line-formation calculations in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the spectral energy
distribution are complicated by an amplification of non-LTE effects. For hot
stars this can make quantitative modelling of spectral lines in the near-IR
challenging. An introduction to the modelling problems is given and several
examples in the context of near-IR line formation for hydrogen and helium are
discussed.
