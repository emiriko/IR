A relativistic particle in an attractive Coulomb field as well as a static
and spherically symmetric gravitational field is studied. The gravitational
field is treated perturbatively and the energy levels are obtained for both
spin 0 (Klein-Gordon) and spin 1/2 (Dirac) particles. The results are shown to
coincide with each other as well as the result of the nonrelativistic
(Schrodinger) equation in the nonrelativistic limit.
