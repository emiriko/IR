It is demonstrated that upon pulsed microwave excitation, the temporal
behavior of a spin-wave induced inverse spin Hall voltage in a magnetic
insulator-nonmagnetic metal structure is distinctly different from the temporal
evolution of the directly excited spin-wave mode from which it originates. The
difference in temporal behavior is attributed to the excitation of long-lived
secondary spin-wave modes localized at the insulator-metal interface.
