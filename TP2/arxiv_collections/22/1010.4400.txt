A theory of thermoelectric phenomena in superfluid $^4He$ is developed. It is
found an estimation of the dipole moment of helium atom arising due to electron
shell deformation caused by pushing forces from the side of its surrounding
atoms. The corresponding electric signal generated in a liquid consisting of
electrically neutral atoms by the ordinary sound waves is found extremely
small. The second sound waves in superfluid $^4He$ generate the polarization of
liquid induced by the relative accelerated motion of the superfluid and the
normal component. The derived ratio of the amplitudes of temperature and
electric polarization potential was proved to be practically temperature
independent. Its magnitude is in reasonable correspondence with the
experimental observations. The polarity of electric signal is determined by the
sign of temperature gradient in accordance with the measurements. The problem
of the roton excitations dipole moment is also discussed.
