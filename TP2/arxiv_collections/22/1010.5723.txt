We study families of time-independent maximal and 1+log foliations of the
Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetime, the spherically-symmetric vacuum black
hole solution in D spacetime dimensions, for D >= 4. We identify special
members of these families for which the spatial slices display a trumpet
geometry. Using a generalization of the 1+log slicing condition that is
parametrized by a constant n we recover the results of Nakao, Abe, Yoshino and
Shibata in the limit of maximal slicing. We also construct a numerical code
that evolves the BSSN equations for D=5 in spherical symmetry using
moving-puncture coordinates, and demonstrate that these simulations settle down
to the trumpet solutions.
