A method is developed for dealing with ultraviolet divergences in
calculations of cosmological correlations, which does not depend on dimensional
regularization. An extended version of the WKB approximation is used to analyze
the divergences in these calculations, and these divergences are controlled by
the introduction of Pauli--Villars regulator fields. This approach is
illustrated in the theory of a scalar field with arbitrary self-interactions in
a fixed flat-space Robertson--Walker metric with arbitrary scale factor $a(t)$.
Explicit formulas are given for the counterterms needed to cancel all
dependence on the regulator properties, and an explicit prescription is given
for calculating finite regulator-independent correlation functions. The
possibility of infrared divergences in this theory is briefly considered.
