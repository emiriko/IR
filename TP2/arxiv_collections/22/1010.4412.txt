The locality problem of quantum measurements is considered in the framework
of the algebraic approach. It is shown that contrary to the currently
widespread opinion one can reconcile the mathematical formalism of the quantum
theory with the assumption of the existence of a local physical reality
determining the results of local measurements. The key quantum experiments:
double-slit experiment on electron scattering, Wheeler's delayed-choice
experiment, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, and quantum teleportation are
discussed from the locality-problem point of view. A clear physical
interpretation for these experiments, which does not contradict the classical
ideas, is given.
