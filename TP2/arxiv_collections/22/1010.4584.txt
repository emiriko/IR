Gamma-ray and electron-positron pair production will figure prominently in
laser-plasma experiments with next generation lasers. Using a Monte Carlo
approach we show that straggling effects arising from the finite recoil an
electron experiences when it emits a high energy photon, increase the number of
pairs produced on further interaction with the laser fields.
