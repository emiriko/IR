We investigate both theoretically and experimentally a gigantic enhancement
of the spin Seebeck effect in a prototypical magnet LaY$_2$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ at
low temperatures. Our theoretical analysis sheds light on the important role of
phonons; the spin Seebeck effect is enormously enhanced by nonequilibrium
phonons that drag the low-lying spin excitations. We further argue that this
scenario gives a clue to understand the observation of the spin Seebeck effect
that is unaccompanied by a global spin current, and predict that the substrate
condition affects the observed signal.
