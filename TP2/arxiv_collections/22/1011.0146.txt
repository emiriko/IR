The transmission and reflection spectra from a right-handed chiral sculptured
zirconia thin film are calculated using the piecewise homogeneity approximation
method and the Bruggeman homogenization formalism and considering that the
dispersion of dielectric function happens in non-axial propagation state. First
and second Bragg peaks were observed in cross-poloraized reflectances and it
became clear that increasing the azimutal angle affects the spectra of linearly
polarized state significantly. This is opposite to circularly polarized state.
