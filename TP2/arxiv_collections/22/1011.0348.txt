We study the phenomenology of a supersymmetric left-right model, assuming
minimal supergravity boundary conditions. Both left-right and (B-L) symmetries
are broken at an energy scale close to, but significantly below the GUT scale.
Neutrino data is explained via a seesaw mechanism. We calculate the RGEs for
superpotential and soft parameters complete at 2-loop order. At low energies
lepton flavour violation (LFV) and small, but potentially measurable mass
splittings in the charged scalar lepton sector appear, due to the RGE running.
Different from the supersymmetric 'pure seesaw' models, both, LFV and slepton
mass splittings, occur not only in the left- but also in the right slepton
sector. Especially, ratios of LFV slepton decays, such as Br(${\tilde\tau}_R
\to \mu \chi^0_1$)/Br(${\tilde\tau}_L \to \mu \chi^0_1$) are sensitive to the
ratio of (B-L) and left-right symmetry breaking scales. Also the model predicts
a polarization asymmetry of the outgoing positrons in the decay $\mu^+ \to e^+
\gamma$, A ~ [0,1], which differs from the pure seesaw 'prediction' A=1$.
Observation of any of these signals allows to distinguish this model from any
of the three standard, pure (mSugra) seesaw setups.
