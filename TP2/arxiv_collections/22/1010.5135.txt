We present a finite-temperature theory of the anisotropic spin-spin
correlations in magnetic metallic monolayers, deposited on a suitable
substrate. The `spins' are the local moments set up by the itinerant electrons,
and the key concept is the relativistic disordered local moment state, which
represents the paramagnetic state of a set of local moments. The spin-spin
correlations between these local moments are then extracted using the linear
response formalism. The anisotropy is included in a fully relativistic
treatment, based on the Dirac equation, and has a qualitative impact on
noncollinear magnetic states, by lifting their chiral degeneracy. The theory is
applied to Mn monolayers on the hexagonal (111) surfaces of Pd, Pt, Ag and Au.
The presence of competing exchange interactions is highlighted by choosing
different substrates, which favour either the row-wise antiferromagnetic state
or the chiral triangular N\'eel state. We correlate the electronic structure
with the magnetic properties, by comparing filled with partially filled
substrate d--bands, and low vs high atomic number. The disagreement between
theory and experiment for Mn$_1$/Ag(111) is addressed, and the nature of the
magnetic domains found experimentally is suggested to be chiral.
