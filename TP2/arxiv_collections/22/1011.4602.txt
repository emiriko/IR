This paper considers a system where one transmitter broadcasts a single
common message to two receivers linked by a bidirectional cooperation channel,
which is assumed to be orthogonal to the downlink channel. Assuming a
simplified setup where, in particular, scalar relaying protocols are used and
channel coding is not exploited, we want to provide elements of response to
several questions of practical interest. Here are the main underlying issues:
1. The way of recombining the signals at the receivers; 2. The optimal number
of cooperation rounds; 3. The way of cooperating (symmetrically or
asymmetrically; which receiver should start cooperating in the latter case); 4.
The influence of spectral resources. These issues are considered by studying
the performance of the assumed system through analytical results when they are
derivable and through simulation results. For the particular choices we made,
the results sometimes do not coincide with those available for the discrete
counterpart of the studied channel.
