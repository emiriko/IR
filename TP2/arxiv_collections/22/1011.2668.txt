Using a large sample of pure, slow, short lived K0 mesons collected with KLOE
detector at DaFne, we have measured the KS lifetime. From a fit to the proper
time distribution we find tau = (89.562 +- 0.029_stat +- 0.043_syst) ps. This
is the most precise measurement today in good agreement with the world average
derived from previous measurements. We observe no dependence of the lifetime on
the direction of the Ks.
