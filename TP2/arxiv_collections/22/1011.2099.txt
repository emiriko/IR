Previous surveys of outflows in low-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN)
have relied on the analysis of sources selected primarily for their
optical/X-ray brightness, and are therefore biased. Towards determining the
outflow properties of local AGN, we detect warm absorption signatures of O VII
and O VIII absorption edges in the available Suzaku/XMM-Newton CCD spectra of
an unbiased sample of 44 Seyfert 1-1.5 sources selected in the very hard X-rays
(14-195 keV) with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. From our analysis, we find
that O VII and O VIII absorption edges are present in 41% of the sample. This
fraction is dependent on luminosity, with outflow detections in 60% of low
luminosity and 30% of high luminosity sources. However, grating spectroscopy of
the highest luminosity sources reveals that ~ 80% of these sources have ionized
absorbers, but that the ionization states are higher/lower than produces the O
VII and O VIII edges. This suggests that ionized absorption may be present in
all local Seyfert 1s.
