The CALICE collaboration is developing calorimeters for a future linear
collider, and has collected a large amount of physics data during test beam
efforts. For the analysis of these data, standard software available for linear
collider detector studies is applied. This software provides reconstruction of
raw data, simulation, digitization and data management, which is based on grid
tools. The data format for analysis is compatible with the general linear
collider software. Moreover, existing frameworks such as Marlin are employed
for the CALICE software needs. The structure and features of the software
framework are reported here as well as results from the application of this
software to test beam data.
