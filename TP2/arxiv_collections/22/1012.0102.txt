We perform a model independent analysis on $q \bar{q} \rightarrow t \bar{t}$
using an effective lagrangian with dim-6 four-quark operators, and derive
necessary conditions on new physics that are consistent with the $t\bar{t}$
production cross section %($\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$) and and the forward-backward
(FB) asymmetry ($A_{\rm FB}$) measured at the Tevatron. We also propose a new
FB spin-spin correlation that is strongly correlated with the $A_{\rm FB}$, and
discuss possible new physics scenarios that could generate such dim-6
operators.
