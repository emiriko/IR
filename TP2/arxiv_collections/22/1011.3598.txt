A system initially far from equilibrium is expected to take more time to
reach equilibrium than a system that was initially closer to equilibrium. The
old puzzling observation (also called Mpemba effect) that when a sample of hot
water and another sample of cold water are put in a freezer to equilibrate, the
hot water sometimes overtakes as they cool, has been highlighted recently. In
the extensively studied colossal magnetoresistance manganites, cooling in a
magnetic field (H) often results in an inhomogeneous mixture of transformed
equilibrium phase and a kinetically arrested non-equilibrium phase which
relaxes slowly towards equilibrium at fixed H and temperature (T). Here we show
that the magnetization decay rate at the same H and T is larger for the state
that was initially farther from equilibrium, and it continues to relax faster
even after these have become equal. Our result should help propose an
explanation, for Mpemba effect, that does not attribute it to any artifact.
