We discuss the mass transport of a degenerate Fermi liquid $^3$He film over a
rough surface, and the film momentum relaxation time, in the framework of
theoretical predictions. In the mesoscopic r\'egime, the anomalous temperature
dependence of the relaxation time is explained in terms of the interference
between elastic boundary scattering and inelastic quasiparticle-quasiparticle
scattering within the film. We exploit a quasiclassical treatment of quantum
size effects in the film in which the surface roughness, whose power spectrum
is experimentally determined, is mapped into an effective disorder potential
within a film of uniform thickness. Confirmation is provided by the
introduction of elastic scattering centres within the film. We model further
studies on $^3$He confined in nanofluidic sample chambers with lithographically
defined surface roughness. The improved understanding of surface roughness
scattering may impact on enhancing the conductivity in thin metallic films.
