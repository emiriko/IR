We show that the techniques for resource control that have been developed in
the so-called "light logics" can be fruitfully applied also to process
algebras. In particular, we present a restriction of Higher-Order pi-calculus
inspired by Soft Linear Logic. We prove that any soft process terminates in
polynomial time. We argue that the class of soft processes may be naturally
enlarged so that interesting processes are expressible, still maintaining the
polynomial bound on executions.
