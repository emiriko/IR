In this paper we discuss the results of a programme of spectral synthesis
modelling of a sample of starburst radio galaxies in the context of scenarios
for the triggering of the activity and the evolution of the host galaxies. The
starburst radio galaxies -- comprising ~15 - 25% of all powerful extragalactic
radio sources -- frequently show disturbed morphologies at optical wavelengths,
and unusual radio structures, although their stellar masses are typical of
radio galaxies as a class. In terms of the characteristic ages of their young
stellar populations (YSP), the objects can be divided into two groups: those
with YSP ages t_ysp < 0.1 Gyr, in which the radio source has been triggered
quasi-simultaneously with the main starburst episode, and those with older YSP
in which the radio source has been triggered or re-triggered a significant
period after the starburst episode. Combining the information on the YSP with
that on the optical morphologies of the host galaxies, we deduce that the
majority of the starburst radio galaxies have been triggered in galaxy mergers
in which at least one of the galaxies is gas rich. However, the triggering (or
re-triggering) of the radio jets can occur immediately before, around, or a
significant period after the final coalescence of the merging nuclei,
reflecting the complex gas infall histories of the merger events. Overall, our
results provide further evidence that powerful radio jet activity can be
triggered via a variety of mechanisms, including different evolutionary stages
of major galaxy mergers; clearly radio-loud AGN activity is not solely
associated with a particular stage of a unique type of gas accretion event.
