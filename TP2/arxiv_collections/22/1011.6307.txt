We present results from CDF and D0 on direct searches for high mass standard
model (SM) Higgs boson (H) in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron at
\sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. Compared to previous Higgs boson Tevatron combinations,
more data and new channels (H -> W+W- -> lnujj, H -> WW -> l+tau + X and
trilepton final states) have been added. Most previously used channels have
been reanalyzed to gain sensitivity. Analyzing 5.9 fb^-1 of data at CDF, and
5.4-6.7 fb^-1 at D0, the combination excludes with 95% C.L. a standard model
Higgs boson in the mass range of m_H = 158-175 GeV/c2.
