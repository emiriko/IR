We investigate numerically the finite-temperature phase diagrams of the
extended Bose-Hubbard model in a two-dimensional square lattice. In particular,
we focus on the melting of supersolid phases of two different crystal
orderings, stripe and star orders, arising from the competition of the nearest-
and next-nearest -neighbor interactions in the vicinity of quarter filling. The
two crystal orders are the result of broken translational symmetry in either
one or in both $x$, and $y$ directions. The broken gauge symmetry of the
supersolids are found to be restored via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition while
the broken translational symmetries are restored via a single second-order
phase transition, instead of two second-order transitions in the Ising
universality class. On the other hand, the phase transitions between the star
and stripe orders are first order in nature.
