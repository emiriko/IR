We propose a planar architecture for scalable quantum information processing
(QIP) that includes X-junctions through which particles can move without
micromotion. This is achieved by adjusting radio frequency (rf) amplitudes to
move an rf null along the legs of the junction. We provide a proof-of-principle
by transporting dust particles in three dimensions via adjustable rf potentials
in a 3D trap. For the proposed planar architecture, we use regularization
techniques to obtain amplitude settings that guarantee smooth transport through
the X-junction.
