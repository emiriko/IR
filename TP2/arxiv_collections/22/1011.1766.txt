In semi-supervised learning on graphs, response variables observed at one
node are used to estimate missing values at other nodes. The methods exploit
correlations between nearby nodes in the graph. In this paper we prove that
many such proposals are equivalent to kriging predictors based on a fixed
covariance matrix driven by the link structure of the graph. We then propose a
data-driven estimator of the correlation structure that exploits patterns among
the observed response values. By incorporating even a small fraction of
observed covariation into the predictions, we are able to obtain much improved
prediction on two graph data sets.
