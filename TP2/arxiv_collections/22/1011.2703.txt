Multiplicity, rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of hadrons
produced both in inelastic and nondiffractive $pp$ collisions at energies from
$\sqrt{s} = 200$\,GeV to 14\,TeV are studied within the Monte Carlo quark-gluon
string model (QGSM). Good agreement with the available experimental data up to
$\sqrt{s} = 13$\,TeV is obtained, and predictions are made for the collisions
at top LHC energy $\sqrt{s} = 14$\,TeV. The model indicates that Feynman
scaling and extended longitudinal scaling remain valid in the fragmentation
regions, whereas strong violation of Feynman scaling is observed at
midrapidity. The Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling in multiplicity
distributions is violated at LHC also. The origin of both maintenance and
violation of the scaling trends is traced to short range correlations of
particles in the strings and interplay between the multistring processes at
ultrarelativistic energies.
