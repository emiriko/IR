Utilizing regression properties of order statistics, we characterize a family
of distributions introduced by Akhundov, Balakrishnan, and Nevzorov (2004),
that includes the t-distribution with two degrees of freedom as one of its
members. Then we extend this characterization result to t-distribution with
more than two degrees of freedom.
