We investigate the metastability associated with the first order transition
from normal to superfluid phases in the phase diagram of two-component
polarised Fermi gases.We begin by detailing the dominant decay processes of
single quasiparticles.Having determined the momentum thresholds of each process
and calculated their rates, we apply this understanding to a Fermi sea of
polarons by linking its metastability to the stability of individual polarons,
and predicting a region of metastability for the normal partially polarised
phase. In the limit of a single impurity, this region extends from the
interaction strength at which a polarised phase of molecules becomes the
groundstate, to the one at which the single quasiparticle groundstate changes
character from polaronic to molecular. Our argument in terms of a Fermi sea of
polarons naturally suggests their use as an experimental probe. We propose
experiments to observe the threshold of the predicted region of metastability,
the interaction strength at which the quasiparticle groundstate changes
character, and the decay rate of polarons.
