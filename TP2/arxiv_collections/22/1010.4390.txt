For an s-wave superconductor/semiconductor/ferromagnetic-insulator structure,
the proximity effect can induce the energy gap in the semiconductor rather than
the superconducting pair potential of its microscope Hamiltonian. As a result,
it is questionable to realize topological superconducting states in that
structure.
