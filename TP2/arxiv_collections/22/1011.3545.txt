In order to derive a large set of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, but with
only first order Lagrangian, we resort to the formulation in terms of
Lagrange-Souriau 2-form formalism. A wide class of systems derived in different
phenomenological contexts are covered. The non-commutativity of the particle
position coordinates are a natural consequence. Some explicit examples are
considered.
