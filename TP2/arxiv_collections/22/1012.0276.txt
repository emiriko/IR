When microbes compete for limited resources, they often engage in chemical
warfare using bacterial toxins. This competition can be understood in terms of
evolutionary game theory (EGT). We study the predictions of EGT for the
bacterial "suicide bomber" game in terms of the phase portraits of population
dynamics, for parameter combinations that cover all interesting games for
two-players, and seven of the 38 possible phase portraits of the three-player
game. We compare these predictions to simulations of these competitions in
finite well-mixed populations, but also allowing for probabilistic rather than
pure strategies, as well as Darwinian adaptation over tens of thousands of
generations. We find that Darwinian evolution of probabilistic strategies
stabilizes games of the rock-paper-scissors type that emerge for parameters
describing realistic bacterial populations, and point to ways in which the
population fixed point can be selected by changing those parameters.
