Continued scaling of nanoscale transistors leads to broad device-to-device
fluctuation of parameters due to random dopant effects, channel length
variation, interface trap generation, etc. In this paper, we obtain the
statistics of negative bias temperature instability (NBTI)-induced interface
defect generation in ultra-scaled MOSFET by Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC)
solution of Reaction-Diffusion (R-D) model. Our results show that the interface
defect generation at a particular stress time, i.e., NIT}@tSTS in small
transistors should follow a skew-normal distribution and that the generation
and annealing of interface defects are strongly correlated. Next, we use a
random percolative network to demonstrate (which is also consistent with
previously published results in literature based on separate techniques) that
the distribution of threshold voltage shift for single interface defect, i.e.,
{\Delta}VT@NIT is exponential, with finite number of transistors having zero
{\Delta}VT. Finally, we show that the statistics of {\Delta}VT@tSTS - based on
the convolution of NIT@tSTS and {\Delta}VT@NIT - is broadly consistent with the
available experimental data in literature.
