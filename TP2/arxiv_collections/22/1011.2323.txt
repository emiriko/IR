Using a three-current model for heat, spin-up and spin-down electrons, the
thermodynamics of irreversible processes predicts that a temperature gradient
gives rise to a spin current under the conditions used to measure what is
called the spin Seebeck effect. A diffusive current proportional to a gradient
of the chemical potential is known in thermochemistry as a Soret effect or
thermophoresis.
