We analyse the oscillatory properties of resonantly damped transverse kink
oscillations in two-dimensional prominence threads. The fine structures are
modelled as cylindrically symmetric magnetic flux tubes with a dense central
part with prominence plasma properties and an evacuated part, both surrounded
by coronal plasma. The equilibrium density is allowed to vary non-uniformly in
both the transverse and the longitudinal directions.We examine the influence of
longitudinal density structuring on periods, damping times, and damping rates
for transverse kink modes computed by numerically solving the linear resistive
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. The relevant parameters are the length of
the thread and the density in the evacuated part of the tube, two quantities
that are difficult to directly estimate from observations. We find that both of
them strongly influence the oscillatory periods and damping times, and to a
lesser extent the damping ratios. The analysis of the spatial distribution of
perturbations and of the energy flux into the resonances allows us to explain
the obtained damping times. Implications for prominence seismology, the physics
of resonantly damped kink modes in two-dimensional magnetic flux tubes, and the
heating of prominence plasmas are discussed.
