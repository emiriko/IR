Low-energy E1 strength in neutron-rich $^{132-164}$Sn isotopes is analyzed in
the framework of the Skyrme random phase approximation (RPA) with different
Skyrme forces. A double folding procedure is applied to take into account the
energy-dependent width effects beyond RPA. All the considered Skyrme forces
indicate a soft prolate deformation in the open shell isotopes $^{142-164}$Sn.
The integrated E1 strength in the energy region of the pygmy resonance grows
with the neutron number. The influence of deformation on the integrated
strength near the particle emission thresholds (which is of a keen
astrophysical interest) is strictly suppressed by the mutual compensation
effect for the branches of the giant dipole resonance. The results obtained are
in a good agreement with the previous findings of the relativistic mean field
model.
