We discuss techniques for evaluating sea quark contributions to hadronic form
factors on the lattice and apply these to an exploratory calculation of the
strange electromagnetic, axial, and scalar form factors of the nucleon. We
employ the Wilson gauge and fermion actions on an anisotropic 24^3 x 64
lattice, probing a range of momentum transfer with Q^2 < 1 GeV^2. The strange
electric and magnetic form factors, G_E^s(Q^2) and G_M^s(Q^2), are found to be
small and consistent with zero within the statistics of our calculation. The
lattice data favor a small negative value for the strange axial form factor
G_A^s(Q^2) and exhibit a strong signal for the bare strange scalar matrix
element <N|ss|N>_0. We discuss the unique systematic uncertainties affecting
the latter quantity relative to the continuum, as well as prospects for
improving future determinations with Wilson-like fermions.
