Based on a supersymmetric Yukawaon model with O(3) family symmetry, possible
forms of quark and lepton mixing matrices are systematically investigated under
a condition that the up-quark mass matrix form leads to the observed nearly
tribimaximal mixing in the lepton sector. Although the previous model could not
provide a good fitting of the observed quark mixing, the present model can give
a reasonably good fitting not for lepton mixing but also the quark mixing by
using a different origin of the $CP$ violation from one in the previous model.
