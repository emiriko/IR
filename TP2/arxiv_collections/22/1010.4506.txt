Recent studies have shown that a system composed from several randomly
interdependent networks is extremely vulnerable to random failure. However,
real interdependent networks are usually not randomly interdependent, rather a
pair of dependent nodes are coupled according to some regularity which we coin
inter-similarity. For example, we study a system composed from an
interdependent world wide port network and a world wide airport network and
show that well connected ports tend to couple with well connected airports. We
introduce two quantities for measuring the level of inter-similarity between
networks (i) Inter degree-degree correlation (IDDC) (ii) Inter-clustering
coefficient (ICC). We then show both by simulation models and by analyzing the
port-airport system that as the networks become more inter-similar the system
becomes significantly more robust to random failure.
