Methodologies to test hypotheses about the tail-heaviness of an underlying
distribution are introduced based on results of Rojo (1996) using the limiting
behavior of the extreme spacings. The tests are consistent and have point-wise
robust levels in the sense of Lehmann (2005) and Lehmann and Loh (1990).
Simulation results based on these new methodologies indicate that the tests
exhibit good control of the probability of Type I error and have good power
properties for finite sample sizes. The tests are compared with a test proposed
by Bryson (1974) and it is seen that, although Bryson's test is competitive
with the tests proposed here, Bryson's test does not have point-wise robust
levels. The operating characteristics of the tests are also explored when the
data is blocked. It turns out that the power increases substantially by
blocking. The methodology is illustrated by analyzing various data sets.
