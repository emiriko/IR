We analyze the effect of pure additive noise on the long-time dynamics of the
noisy Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation in a regime close to the instability
onset. We show that when the noise is highly degenerate, in the sense that it
acts only on the first stable mode, the solution of the KS equation undergoes
several transitions between different states, including a critical on-off
intermittent state that is eventually stabilized as the noise strength is
increased. Such noise-induced transitions can be completely characterized
through critical exponents, obtaining that both the KS and the noisy Burgers
equation belong to the same universality class. The results of our numerical
investigations are explained rigorously using multiscale techniques.
