Aims. We analyze new multicolor light curves and recently published radial
velocity curves for close binaries QX And, RW Com, MR Del, and BD +07{\circ}
3142 to determine the physical parameters of the components. Methods. The light
curves are analyzed using a binary star model based on Roche geometry to fit
the photometric observations. Spectroscopic parameters, such as the mass ratios
and spectral types, were taken from recent spectroscopic studies of the systems
in question. Results. Our findings provide consistent and reliable sets of
stellar parameters for the four studied binary systems. Of particular interest
is the BD +07{\circ} 3142 system, since this is the first analysis of its light
curves. We find that it is an overcontact binary of W UMa type and W subtype,
and that each component has a large cool spot in the polar region. QX And is an
A subtype, and RW Com a W subtype W UMa binary, and in both systems we find a
bright spot in the neck region between the components. MR Del is a detached
binary with a complex light curve that we could model with two cool spots on
the hotter component.
