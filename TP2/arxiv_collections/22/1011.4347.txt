We construct an enlargement of the classifying space of mixed Hodge
structures with polarized graded quotients, by adding mixed Hodge theoretic
version of SL(2)-orbits. This space has a real analytic structure and a log
structure with sign. The SL(2)-orbit theorem in several variables for mixed
Hodge structures can be understood naturally with this space.
