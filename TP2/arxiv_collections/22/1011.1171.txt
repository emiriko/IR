The non-equilibrium state of the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta
and its ultrafast dynamics have been investigated by femtosecond time- and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy well below the critical temperature.
We probe optically excited quasiparticles at different electron momenta along
the Fermi surface and detect metastable quasiparticles near the antinode. Their
decay through e-e scattering is blocked by a phase space restricted to the
nodal region. The lack of momentum dependence in the decay rates is in
agreement with relaxation dominated by Cooper pair recombination in a boson
bottleneck limit.
