Reversible bipolar nano-switches that can be set and read electronically in a
solid-state two-terminal device are very promising for applications. We have
performed molecular-dynamics simulations that mimic systems with oxygen
vacancies interacting via realistic potentials and driven by an external bias
voltage. The competing short- and long-range interactions among charged mobile
vacancies lead to density fluctuations and short-range ordering, while
illustrating some aspects of observed experimental behavior, such as memristor
polarity inversion.
