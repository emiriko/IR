It is necessary to improve the concepts of the present web based graphical
user interface for the development of more flexible and intelligent interface
to provide ease and increase the level of comfort at user end like most of the
desktop based applications. This research is conducted targeting the goal of
implementing flexible GUI consisting of a visual component manager with
different components by functionality, design and purpose. In this research
paper we present a Rich Internet Application (RIA) based graphical user
interface for web based product development, and going into the details we
present a comparison between existing RIA Technologies, adopted methodology in
