We present new 7mm continuum observations of Orion BN/KL with the VLA. We
resolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several
epochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux
density, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This
favors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than
a jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first
time at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and
26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously
inferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios
that can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of
disks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close
(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I
and BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that
Source I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20
Msun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close
encounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though
truncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show
that the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a
single star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary
hardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large
enough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL
nebula. Assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass
for Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (>7 Msun) by Matthews
et al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g. magnetic) must play an
important role in the circumstellar gas dynamics.
