By introducing the thermo entangled state representation, we derived four new
photocount distribution formulas for a given density operator of light field.
It is shown that these new formulas, which is convenient to calculate the
photocount, can be expressed as such integrations over Laguree-Gaussian
function with characteristic function, Wigner function, Q-function, and
P-function, respectively.
