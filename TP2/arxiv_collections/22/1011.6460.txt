Intense electric field $\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}$ V/cm in crystal has been known
for a long time and has wide applications. We study the conversion of
axion-like light particle and photon in the intense electric field in crystal.
We find that the conversion of axion-like particle and photon happens for
energy larger than keV range. We propose search of axion-like light particle
using the intense crystalline field. We discuss the solar axion search
experiment and a variety of shining-through-wall experiment using crystalline
field. Due to the intense crystalline field which corresponds to magnetic field
$\sim 10^4-10^5$ Tesla these experiments are very interesting. In particular
these experiments can probe the mass range of axion-like particle from eV to
keV.
