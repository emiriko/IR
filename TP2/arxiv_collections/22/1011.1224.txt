The Andromeda galaxy (M31) hosts a central super-massive black hole (SMBH),
known as M31$^\ast$, which is remarkable for its mass
($\sim$$10^8{\rm~M_\odot}$) and extreme radiative quiescence. Over the past
decade, the Chandra X-ray observatory has pointed to the center of M31
$\sim$100 times and accumulated a total exposure of $\sim$900 ks. Based on
these observations, we present an X-ray study of a highly variable source that
we associate with M31$^\ast$ based on positional coincidence. We find that
M31$^\ast$ remained in a quiescent state from late 1999 to 2005, exhibiting an
average 0.5-8 keV luminosity $\lesssim$$10^{36}{\rm~ergs~s^{-1}}$, or only
$\sim$$10^{-10}$ of its Eddington luminosity. We report the discovery of an
outburst that occurred on January 6, 2006, during which M31$^\ast$ radiated at
$\sim$$4.3\times10^{37}{\rm~ergs~s^{-1}}$. After the outburst, M31$^\ast$
entered a more active state that apparently lasts to the present, which is
characterized by frequent flux variability around an average luminosity of
$\sim$$4.8\times10^{36}{\rm~ergs~s^{-1}}$. These flux variations are similar to
the X-ray flares found in the SMBH of our Galaxy (Sgr A$^\ast$), making
M31$^\ast$ the second SMBH known to exhibit recurrent flares. Future
coordinated X-ray/radio observations will provide useful constraints on the
physical origin of the flaring emission and help rule out a possible stellar
origin of the X-ray source.
