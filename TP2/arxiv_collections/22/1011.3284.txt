We relate the structure of cyclotomic and degenerate cyclotomic BMW algebras,
for arbitrary parameter values, to that for admissible parameter values. In
particular, we show that these algebras are cellular. We characterize those
parameter sets for affine BMW algebras over an algebraically closed field that
permit the algebras to have non--trivial cyclotomic quotients.
