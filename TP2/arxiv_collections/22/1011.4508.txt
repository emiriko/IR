We present new $^{12}$CO(J=1-0) observations of the barred galaxy NGC 4303
using the Nobeyama 45m telescope (NRO45) and the Combined Array for Research in
Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). The H$\alpha$ images of barred spiral
galaxies often show active star formation in spiral arms, but less so in bars.
We quantify the difference by measuring star formation rate and efficiency at a
scale where local star formation is spatially resolved. Our CO map covers the
central 2$\farcm$3 region of the galaxy; the combination of NRO45 and CARMA
provides a high fidelity image, enabling accurate measurements of molecular gas
surface density. We find that star formation rate and efficiency are twice as
high in the spiral arms as in the bar. We discuss this difference in the
context of the Kennicutt-Schimidt (KS) law, which indicates a constant star
formation rate at a given gas surface density. The KS law breaks down at our
native resolution ($\sim$ 250 pc), and substantial smoothing (to 500 pc) is
necessary to reproduce the KS law, although with greater scatter.
