It was recently shown that fluctuations in the initial geometry of a heavy
ion collision generally result in a dipole asymmetry of the distribution of
outgoing particles. This asymmetry, unlike the usual directed flow, is expected
to be present at a wide range of rapidity -- including midrapidity. First
evidence of this phenomenon can be seen in recent two-particle correlation data
by STAR, providing the last element necessary to quantitatively describe
long-range dihadron correlations. We extract differential directed flow from
these data and propose a new direct measurement.
