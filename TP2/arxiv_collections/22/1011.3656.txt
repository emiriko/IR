In this paper we characterize barotropic index singularities of homogeneous
isotropic cosmological models. They are shown to appear in cosmologies for
which the scale factor is analytical with a Taylor series in which the linear
and quadratic terms are absent. Though the barotropic index of the perfect
fluid is singular, the singularities are weak, as it happens for other models
for which the density and the pressure are regular.
