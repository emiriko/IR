We find the canonical and Belinfante energy-momentum tensors and their
nonzero traces. We note that the dilatation symmetry is broken and the
divergence of the dilatation current is proportional to the topological mass of
the gauge field. It was demonstrated that the gauge field possesses the `scale
dimensionality' d=1/2. Maxwell - Chern - Simons topologically massive gauge
field theory in 2+1 dimensions is formulated in the first-order formalism. It
is shown that 6x6-matrices of the relativistic wave equation obey the Duffin -
Kemmer - Petiau algebra. The Hermitianizing matrix of the relativistic wave
equation is given. The projection operators extracting solutions of field
equations for states with definite energy-momentum and spin are obtained. The
5x5-matrix Schrodinger form of the equation is derived after the exclusion of
non-dynamical components, and the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian is obtained.
Projection operators extracting physical states in the Schrodinger picture are
found.
