The Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Handling (OAI-PMHiii) is a
standard that is seeing increased use as a means for exchanging structured
metadata. OAI-PMH implementations must support Dublin Core as a metadata
standard, with other metadata formats as optional. We have developed tools
which enable Mercury to consume metadata from OAI-PMH services in any of the
metadata formats we support (Dublin Core, Darwin Core, FCDC CSDGM, GCMD DIF,
EML, and ISO 19115/19137). We are also making ORNL DAAC metadata available
through OAI-PMH for other metadata tools to utilize. This paper describes
Mercury capabilities with multiple metadata formats, in general, and, more
specifically, the results of our OAI-PMH implementations and the lessons
learned.
