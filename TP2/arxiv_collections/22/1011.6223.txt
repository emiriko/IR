This paper presents various improvements that were applied to OCamlJIT2, a
Just-In-Time compiler for the OCaml byte-code virtual machine. OCamlJIT2
currently runs on various Unix-like systems with x86 or x86-64 processors. The
improvements, including the new x86 port, are described in detail, and
performance measures are given, including a direct comparison of OCamlJIT2 to
OCamlJIT.
