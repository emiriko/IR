A small demonstration spark chamber is to be built at the Cavendish
laboratory. A prototype chamber consisting of five 20x22.5cm plates has been
built and descriptions of its properties and construction are given, while a
second chamber with a somewhat novel design is nearly complete. A discussion of
the issues surrounding the final design is presented, and recommendations are
made in light of the results of this work.
