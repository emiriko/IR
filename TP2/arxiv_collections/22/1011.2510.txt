The morphology of graphene formed on the (000-1) surface (the C-face) and the
(0001) surface (the Si-face) of SiC, by annealing in ultra-high vacuum or in an
argon environment, is studied by atomic force microscopy and low-energy
electron microscopy. The graphene forms due to preferential sublimation of Si
from the surface. In vacuum, this sublimation occurs much more rapidly for the
C-face than the Si-face, so that 150 C lower annealing temperatures are
required for the C-face to obtain films of comparable thickness. The evolution
of the morphology as a function of graphene thickness is examined, revealing
significant differences between the C-face and the Si-face. For annealing near
1320 C, graphene films of about 2 monolayers (ML) thickness are formed on the
Si-face, but 16 ML is found for the C-face. In both cases, step bunches are
formed on the surface. For the Si-face, layer-by-layer growth of the graphene
is observed in areas between the step bunches. At 1170 C, for the C-face, a
more 3-dimensional type of growth is found. The average thickness is then about
4 ML, but with a wide variation in local thickness (2 - 7 ML) over the surface.
The spatial arrangement of constant-thickness domains are found to be
correlated with step bunches on the surface, which form in a more restricted
manner than at 1320 C. It is argued that these domains are somewhat
disconnected, so that no strong driving force for planarization of the film
exists. In a 1-atm argon environment, permitting higher growth temperatures,
the graphene morphology for the Si-face is found to become more
layer-by-layer-like even for graphene thickness as low as 1 ML. However, for
the C-face the morphology becomes much worse, with the surface displaying
markedly inhomogeneous nucleation of the graphene. It is demonstrated that
these surfaces are unintentionally oxidized, which accounts for the
inhomogeneous growth.
