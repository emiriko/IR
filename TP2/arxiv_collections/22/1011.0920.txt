In this paper the potential for the discovery of new physics in the exclusive
decay $\bar{B}_d \to \bar{K}^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-$ is discussed. Attention is paid
to constructing observables which are protected from uncertainties in QCD form
factors and at the same time observe the symmetries of the angular
distribution. We discuss the sensitivity to new physics in the observables
including the effect of CP-violating phases.
