Elemental correlations and anti-correlations are known to be present in
globular clusters (GCs) owing to pollution by CNO cycled gas. Because of its
fragility Li is destroyed at the temperature at which the CNO cycling occurs,
and this makes Li a crucial study for the nature of the contaminating stars. We
observed 112 un-evolved stars at the Turnoff of the NGC6752 cluster with FLAMES
at the VLT to investigate the presence and the extent of a Li-O correlation.
This correlation is expected if there is a simple pollution scenario. Li (670.8
nm) and O triplet (771 nm) abundances are derived in NLTE. All stars belong to
a very narrow region of the color-magnitude diagram, so they have similar
stellar parameters (Teff, log g). We find that O and Li correlate, with a high
statistical significance that confirms the early results for this cluster. At
first glance this is what is expected if a simple pollution of pristine gas
with CNO cycled gas (O-poor, Li-poor) occurred. The slope of the relationship,
however, is about 0.4, and differs from unity by over 7 Sigma. A slope of one
is the value predicted for a pure contamination model. We confirm an extended
Li-O correlation in non evolved stars of NGC 6752. At the same time the
characteristic of the correlation shows that a simple pollution scenario is not
sufficient to explain the observations. Within this scenario the contaminant
gas must have been enriched in Li. This would rule out massive stars as main
polluters, and favor the hypothesis that the polluting gas was enriched by
intermediate or high-mass AGB stars, unless the former can be shown to be able
to produce Li. According to our observations, the fraction of polluting gas
contained in the stars observed is a considerable fraction of the stellar mass
of the cluster.
