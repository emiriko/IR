Recent studies have established an apparent relationship between the
repertoire of signals used for communication and neocortex size of different
species of primates and the topology of the social network formed by the
interactions between individuals. Inspired by these results, we have developed
a model that qualitatively reproduces these observations. The model presents
the social organization as a self organized processes where the size of the
repertoire in one case and of the neocortex in another play a highly relevant
role.
