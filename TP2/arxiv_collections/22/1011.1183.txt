In this paper we consider non-abelian 1-cohomology for groups with
coefficients in other groups. We prove versions of the `five lemma' arising
from this situation. We go on to show that a connected unipotent algebraic
group Q acted on morphically by a connected algebraic group G admits a
filtration with successive quotients having the structure of G-modules. From
these results we deduce extensions to results due to Cline, Parshall, Scott and
van der Kallen. Firstly, if G is a connected, reductive algebraic group with
Borel subgroup B and Q a unipotent algebraic G-group, we show the restriction
map H^1(G,Q)\to H^1(B,Q) is an isomorphism. We also show that this situation
admits a notion of rational stability and generic cohomology. We use these
results to obtain corollaries about complete reducibility and subgroup
structure.
