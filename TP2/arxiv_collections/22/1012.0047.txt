Within the paper a description of communication model of plug-in based
emuStudio emulation platform is given. The platform mentioned above allows the
emulation of whole computer systems, configurable to the level of its
components, represented by the plug-in modules of the platform. Development
tasks still are in progress at the home institution of the authors. Currently
the platform is exploited for teaching purposes within subjects aimed at
machine-oriented languages and computer architectures. Versatility of the
platform, given by its plug-in based architecture is a big advantage, when used
as a teaching support tool. The paper briefly describes the emuStudio platform
at its introductory part and then the mechanisms of inter-module communication
are described.
