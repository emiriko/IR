Tables of scalar factors are presented for 63x63 and 120x63 in
SU(8)$\supset$SU(4)xSU(2), and for 35x35 and 56x35 in
SU(6)$\supset$SU(3)xSU(2). Related tables for SU(4)$\supset$SU(3)xU(1) and
SU(3)$\supset$SU(2)xU(1) are also provided so that the Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients can be completely reconstructed. These are suitable to study
meson-meson and baryon-meson within a spin-flavor symmetric scheme.
