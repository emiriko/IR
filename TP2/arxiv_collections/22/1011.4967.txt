We study Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transitions of the Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)
phase for a two-dimensional system composed of coupled one-dimensional tubes of
fermions. The LO phase here is characterized by a stripe structure (periodic in
only one direction) in the order parameter. The low energy excitations involve
the oscillation of the stripe and the fluctuation of the phase, which can be
described by an effective theory composed of two anisotropic XY models. We
compute from a microscopic model the coefficients of the XY models from which
the KT transition temperatures are determined. We found the $T^{KT} \propto
t_{\perp}$ for small intertube tunneling $t_{\perp}$. As $t_{\perp}$ increases
the system undergoes a first-order transition to the normal phase at zero
temperature. Our method can be used to determine the Goldstone excitations of
any stripe order involving charge or spin degrees of freedom.
