We consider the generation of electric currents in the solar chromosphere
where the ionization level is typically low. We show that ambient electrons
become magnetized even for weak magnetic fields (30 G); that is, their
gyrofrequency becomes larger than the collision frequency while ion motions
continue to be dominated by ion-neutral collisions. Under such conditions, ions
are dragged by neutrals, and the magnetic field acts as if it is frozen-in to
the dynamics of the neutral gas. However, magnetized electrons drift under the
action of the electric and magnetic fields induced in the reference frame of
ions moving with the neutral gas. We find that this relative motion of
electrons and ions results in the generation of quite intense electric
currents. The dissipation of these currents leads to resistive electron heating
and efficient gas ionization. Ionization by electron-neutral impact does not
alter the dynamics of the heavy particles; thus, the gas turbulent motions
continue even when the plasma becomes fully ionized, and resistive dissipation
continues to heat electrons and ions. This heating process is so efficient that
it can result in typical temperature increases with altitude as large as
0.1-0.3 eV/km. We conclude that this process can play a major role in the
heating of the chromosphere and corona
