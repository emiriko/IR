We present experimentally testable quantum limitations on the
phase-insensitive linear amplification and phase conjugation with respect to
the transformation of a Gaussian distributed set of coherent states following
the footing to assess the success of continuous-variable quantum teleportation
and quantum memory devices. The results enable us to compare the real device
with the quantum limited device via feasible input of coherent states.
