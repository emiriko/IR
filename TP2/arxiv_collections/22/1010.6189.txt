We have examined trapping of two-armed ($m=2$) nearly vertical oscillations
(vertical p-mode) in vertically isothermal ($c_{\rm s}=$ const.) relativistic
disks with toroidal magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are stratified so that
the Alfv{\'e}n speed, $c_{\rm A}$, is constant in the vertical direction. The
ratio of $c_{\rm A}^2/c_{\rm s}^2$ in the vertical direction is taken as a
parameter examining the effects of magnetic fields on wave trapping. We find
that the two-armed nearly vertical oscillations are trapped in the inner region
of disks and their frequencies decrease with increase of $c_{\rm A}^2/c_{\rm
s}^2$. The trapped regions of the fundamental ($n=1$) and the first-overtone
($n=2$) are narrow (less than the length of the Schwarzschild radius, $r_{\rm
g}$) and their frequencies are relatively high (on the order of the angular
frequency of disk rotation in the inner region). On contrast to this, the
second-overtone ($n=3$) are trapped in a wide region (a few times $r_{\rm g}$),
and their frequencies are low and tend to zero in the limit of $c_{\rm
A}^2/c_{\rm s}^2=2.0$.
