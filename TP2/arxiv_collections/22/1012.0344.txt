We report observations of a white-light solar flare (SOL2010-06-12T00:57,
M2.0) observed by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) and the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI). The HMI data give us the first space-based high-resolution imaging
spectroscopy of a white-light flare, including continuum, Doppler, and magnetic
signatures for the photospheric FeI line at 6173.34{\AA} and its neighboring
continuum. In the impulsive phase of the flare, a bright white-light kernel
appears in each of the two magnetic footpoints. When the flare occurred, the
spectral coverage of the HMI filtergrams (six equidistant samples spanning
\pm172m{\AA} around nominal line center) encompassed the line core and the blue
continuum sufficiently far from the core to eliminate significant Doppler
crosstalk in the latter, which is otherwise a possibility for the extreme
conditions in a white-light flare. RHESSI obtained complete hard X-ray and
\Upsilon-ray spectra (this was the first \Upsilon-ray flare of Cycle 24). The
FeI line appears to be shifted to the blue during the flare but does not go
into emission; the contrast is nearly constant across the line profile. We did
not detect a seismic wave from this event. The HMI data suggest stepwise
changes of the line-of-sight magnetic field in the white-light footpoints.
