We have studied excitation spectrum of the specfic 2D model of strongly
interacting Bose particles via mapping of the many-body Schrodinger equation in
imaginary time to the classical stochastic dynamics. In a broad range of
coupling strength $\alpha$ a roton-like spectrum is found, with the roton gap
being extremely small in natural units. A single quantum phase transition
between strongly correlated supefluid and quantum Berezinsky crystal is found.
