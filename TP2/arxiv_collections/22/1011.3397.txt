The Reflexive Game Theory (RGT) has been recently proposed by Vladimir
Lefebvre to model behavior of individuals in groups. The goal of this study is
to introduce the Inverse task. We consider methods of solution together with
practical applications. We present a brief overview of the RGT for easy
understanding of the problem. We also develop the schematic representation of
the RGT inference algorithms to create the basis for soft- and hardware
solutions of the RGT tasks. We propose a unified hierarchy of schemas to
represent humans and robots. This hierarchy is considered as a unified
framework to solve the entire spectrum of the RGT tasks. We conclude by
illustrating how this framework can be applied for modeling of mixed groups of
humans and robots. All together this provides the exhaustive solution of the
Inverse task and clearly illustrates its role and relationships with other
issues considered in the RGT.
