The primary science goal of the Kepler Mission is to provide a census of
exoplanets in the solar neighborhood, including the identification and
characterization of habitable Earth-like planets. The asteroseismic
capabilities of the mission are being used to determine precise radii and ages
for the target stars from their solar-like oscillations. Chaplin et al. (2010)
published observations of three bright G-type stars, which were monitored
during the first 33.5 days of science operations. One of these stars, the
subgiant KIC 11026764, exhibits a characteristic pattern of oscillation
frequencies suggesting that it has evolved significantly. We have derived
asteroseismic estimates of the properties of KIC 11026764 from Kepler
photometry combined with ground-based spectroscopic data. We present the
results of detailed modeling for this star, employing a variety of independent
codes and analyses that attempt to match the asteroseismic and spectroscopic
constraints simultaneously. We determine both the radius and the age of KIC
11026764 with a precision near 1%, and an accuracy near 2% for the radius and
15% for the age. Continued observations of this star promise to reveal
additional oscillation frequencies that will further improve the determination
of its fundamental properties.
