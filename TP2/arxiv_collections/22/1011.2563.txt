We propose a process to convert ultracold metastable Cs$_2$ molecules in
their lowest triplet state into (singlet) ground state molecules in their
lowest vibrational levels. Molecules are first pumped into an excited triplet
state, and the triplet-singlet conversion is facilitated by a two-step
spontaneous decay through the coupled $A^{1}\Sigma_{u}^{+} \sim b ^{3}\Pi_{u}$
states. Using spectroscopic data and accurate quantum chemistry calculations
for Cs$_2$ potential curves and transition dipole moments, we show that this
process has a high rate and competes favorably with the single-photon decay
back to the lowest triplet state. In addition, we demonstrate that this
conversion process represents a loss channel for vibrational cooling of
metastable triplet molecules, preventing an efficient optical pumping cycle
down to low vibrational levels.
