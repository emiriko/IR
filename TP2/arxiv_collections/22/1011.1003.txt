We show that the usual sufficient criterion for a generic hypersurface in a
smooth projective manifold to have the same Picard number as the ambient
variety can be generalized to hypersurfaces in complete simplicial toric
varieties. This sufficient condition is always satisfied by generic K3 surfaces
embedded in Fano toric 3-folds.
