The Ising chains in a transverse magnetic field of constant strength (h=1)
and with the spin interaction value \lambda are considered. In the case of
infinitely long chain, exact analytical expressions are found for the second
central moment (dispersion) of the entropy operator S^\hat=-ln\rho with reduced
density matrix \rho which corresponds to a semi-infinite part of the model in
the ground state. It is shown that in the vicinity of a critical point
\lambda_c=1, the entanglement entropy fluctuation \Delta S (square root of
dispersion) diverges as \Delts S\sim[ln(1/|1-\lambda|)]^{1/2}. Taking into
account the known behavior of the entanglement entropy S, this leads to that
the value of relative entanglement fluctuation \delta S=(\Delta S)/S vanishes
at the critical point, i.e. in fact a state with nonfluctuating entanglement is
realized.
