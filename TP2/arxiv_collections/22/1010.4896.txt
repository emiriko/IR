Radiative decays of the B meson are known to provide important constraints on
the MSSM and many other realistic new physics models in the sub-TeV range. The
inclusive branching ratio BR(B -> Xs gamma) being the key observable is
currently measured to about 7% accuracy. Reaching a better precision on the
theory side is a challenge both for the perturbative QCD calculations and for
analyses of non-perturbative hadronic effects. The current situation is briefly
summarized here.
