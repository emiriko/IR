The phase diagram of the quasi-two-dimensional easy-plane antiferromagnetic
model, with a magnetic field applied in the easy plane, is studied using the
self-consistent harmonic approximation. We found a linear dependence of the
transition temperature as a function of the field for large values of the
field. Our results are in agreement with experimental data for the spin-1
honeycomb compound BaNi_2V_2O_3
