We present here evidence for the observation of the magneto-hydrodynamic
(MHD) sausage modes in magnetic pores in the solar photosphere. Further
evidence for the omnipresent nature of acoustic global modes is also found. The
empirical decomposition method of wave analysis is used to identify the
oscillations detected through a 4170 {\AA} 'blue continuum' filter observed
with the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instrument. Out of
phase, periodic behavior in pore size and intensity is used as an indicator of
the presence of magneto-acoustic sausage oscillations. Multiple signatures of
the magneto-acoustic sausage mode are found in a number of pores. The periods
range from as short as 30 s up to 450 s. A number of the magneto-acoustic
sausage mode oscillations found have periods of 3 and 5 minutes, similar to the
acoustic global modes of the solar interior. It is proposed that these global
oscillations could be the driver of the sausage type magneto-acoustic MHD wave
modes in pores.
