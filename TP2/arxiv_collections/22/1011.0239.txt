The immense interest in carbon nanomaterials continues to stimulate intense
research activities aimed to realize carbon nanowires, since linear chains of
carbon atoms are expected to display novel and technologically relevant
optical, electrical and mechanical properties. Although various allotropes of
carbon (e.g., diamond, nanotubes, graphene, etc.) are among the best known
materials, it remains challenging to stabilize carbon in the one-dimensional
form because of the difficulty to suitably saturate the dangling bonds of
carbon. Here, we show through first-principles calculations that ordered
polymeric carbon chains can be stabilized in solid Li$_2$C$_2$ under moderate
pressure. This pressure-induced phase (above 5 GPa) consists of parallel arrays
of twofold zigzag carbon chains embedded in lithium cages, which display a
metallic character due to the formation of partially occupied carbon lone-pair
states in \emph{sp}$^2$-like hybrids. It is found that this phase remains the
most favorable one in a wide range of pressure. At extreme pressure (larger the
215 GPa) a structural and electronic phase transition towards an insulating
single-bonded threefold-coordinated carbon network is predicted.
