We propose a new method to discover light top squarks (stops) in the
co-annihilation region at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The bino-like
neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and the lighter stop
is the next-to-LSP. Such scenarios can be consistent with electroweak
baryogenesis and also with dark matter constraints. We consider the production
of two stops in association with two b-quarks, including pure QCD as well as
mixed electroweak-QCD contributions. The stops decay into a charm quark and the
LSP. For a higgsino-like light chargino the electroweak contributions can
exceed the pure QCD prediction. We show the size of the electroweak
contributions as a function of the stop mass and present the LHC discovery
reach in the stop-neutralino mass plane.
