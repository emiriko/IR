We introduce the process calculus Multi-CCS, which extends conservatively CCS
with an operator of strong prefixing able to model atomic sequences of actions
as well as multiparty synchronization. Multi-CCS is equipped with a labeled
transition system semantics, which makes use of a minimal structural
congruence. Multi-CCS is also equipped with an unsafe P/T Petri net semantics
by means of a novel technique. This is the first rich process calculus,
including CCS as a subcalculus, which receives a semantics in terms of unsafe,
labeled P/T nets. The main result of the paper is that a class of Multi-CCS
processes, called finite-net processes, is able to represent all finite
(reduced) P/T nets.
