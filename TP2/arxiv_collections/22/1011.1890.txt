We study the group of relative Fourier-Mukai transforms for Weierstrass
fibrations, abelian schemes and Fano or anti-Fano fibrations. For Weierstrass
and Fano or anti-Fano fibrations we are able to describe this group completely.
For abelian schemes over an arbitrary base we prove that if two of them are
relative Fourier-Mukai partners then there is an isometric isomorphism between
the fibre products of each of them and its dual abelian scheme. If the base is
normal and the slope map is surjective we show that these two conditions are
equivalent. Moreover in this situation we completely determine the group of
relative Fourier-Mukai transforms and we prove that the number of relative
Fourier-Mukai partners of a given abelian scheme over a normal base is finite.
