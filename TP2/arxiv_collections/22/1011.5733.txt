Drexler dark matter is an alternate approach to dark matter that assumes that
highly relativistic protons trapped in the halo of the galaxies could account
for the missing mass. We look at various energetics involved in such a scenario
such as the energy required to produce such particles and the corresponding
lifetimes. Also we look at the energy losses from synchrotron and inverse
Compton scattering and their signatures. The Coulomb repulsive instability due
to the excess charge around the galaxies is also calculated. The above results
lead us to conclude that such a model for DM is unfeasible.
