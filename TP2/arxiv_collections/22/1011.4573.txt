We suggest a new particle model based on the symmetry group $SU(3)_{C}\otimes
SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{L'}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)_{B-L}\otimes
SU(3)_{F}\otimes U(1)_{N}$. The family symmetry and the high-energy left-handed
and right-handed isospin subgroups are respectively broken by some flavon and
Higgs fields one after another. At the low-energy scale the super-heavy
fermions are all integrated out, the model finally leads to an effective theory
with the standard model symmetry group. After the electroweak breaking all the
fermion mass matrices are elegantly characterized only by six parameters. The
model can perfectly fit and explain all the current experimental data about the
fermion masses and flavor mixings, in particular, it finely predicts the first
generation quark masses and the values of $\theta^{l}_{13}, \langle
m_{\beta\beta}\rangle, J_{CP}^{l}$ in neutrino physics. The results are all
promising to be tested in future experiments.
