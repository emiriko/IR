On the Internet large service providers tend to control the digital
identities of users. These defacto identity authorities wield significant power
over users, compelling them to comply with non-negotiable terms, before access
to services is granted. In doing so, users expose themselves to privacy risks,
manipulation and exploitation via direct marketing. Against this backdrop, the
emerging areas of Digital Ecosystems and user-centric identity emphasise
decentralised environments with independent self-determining entities that
control their own data and identity. We show that recent advances in
user-centric identity, federated identity and trust have prepared the ground
for decentralised identity provisioning. We show how social trust, rather than
blind deference to authorities, can provide a basis for identity, where risks
can be weighed and compared rather than merely accepted. Fundamentally, we are
considering the move from authority-centric centralised identity provisioning
to user-centric distributed identity provisioning. Finally, we highlight the
potential impacts of distributed identity provisioning in the Information
Society and give a brief roadmap for its general implementation and adoption.
