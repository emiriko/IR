Gravitational lensing has developed into one of the most powerful tools for
the analysis of the dark universe. This review summarises the theory of
gravitational lensing, its main current applications and representative results
achieved so far. It has two parts. In the first, starting from the equation of
geodesic deviation, the equations of thin and extended gravitational lensing
are derived. In the second, gravitational lensing by stars and planets,
galaxies, galaxy clusters and large-scale structures is discussed and
summarised.
