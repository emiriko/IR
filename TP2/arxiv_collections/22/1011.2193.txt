Locally periodic rods, which show approximate invariance with respect to
translations, are constructed by joining $N$ unit cells. The spectrum then
shows a band spectrum. We then break the local periodicity by including one or
more defects in the system. When the defects follow a certain definite
prescription, an analog of the Wannier-Stark ladders is gotten; when the
defects are random, an elastic rod showing Anderson localization is obtained.
In all cases experimental values match the theoretical predictions.
