A random null model termed the Blind Watchmaker network (BW) has been shown
to reproduce the degree distribution found in metabolic networks. This might
suggest that natural selection has had little influence on this particular
network property. We here investigate to what extent other structural network
properties have evolved under selective pressure from the corresponding ones of
the random null model: The clustering coefficient and the assortativity
measures are chosen and it is found that these measures for the metabolic
network structure are close enough to the BW-network so as to fit inside its
reachable random phase space. It is furthermore shown that the use of this null
model indicates an evolutionary pressure towards low assortativity and that
this pressure is stronger for larger networks. It is also shown that selecting
for BW networks with low assortativity causes the BW degree distribution to
slightly deviate from its power-law shape in the same way as the metabolic
networks. This implies that an equilibrium model with fluctuating degree
distribution is more suitable as a null model, when identifying selective
pressures, than a randomized counterpart with fixed degree sequence, since the
overall degree sequence itself can change under selective pressure on other
global network properties.
