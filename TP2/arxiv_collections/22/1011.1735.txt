The operating system's role in a computer system is to manage the various
resources. One of these resources is the Central Processing Unit. It is managed
by a component of the operating system called the CPU scheduler. Schedulers are
optimized for typical workloads expected to run on the platform. However, a
single scheduler may not be appropriate for all workloads. That is, a scheduler
may schedule a workload such that the completion time is minimized, but when
another type of workload is run on the platform, scheduling and therefore
completion time will not be optimal; a different scheduling algorithm, or a
different set of parameters, may work better. Several approaches to solving
this problem have been proposed. The objective of this survey is to summarize
the approaches based on data mining, which are available in the literature. In
addition to solutions that can be directly utilized for solving this problem,
we are interested in data mining research in related areas that have potential
for use in operating system scheduling. We also explain general technical
issues involved in scheduling in modern computers, including parallel
scheduling issues related to multi-core CPUs. We propose a taxonomy that
classifies the scheduling approaches we discuss into different categories.
