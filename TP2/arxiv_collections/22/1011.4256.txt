The problem of axiomatization of physics formulated by Hilbert as early as
1900 and known as the Sixth Problem of Hilbert is nowadays even more topical
than at the moment of its formulation. Axiomatic inconsistency of classic,
quantum, and geometrized relativistic physics of the general relativistic
theory does not in the least fade away, but on the contrary, becomes more
pronounced each year. This naturally evokes the following questions: 1. Is it
possible, without drastically changing the mathematics apparatus, to set up the
axiomatics of physics so as to transform physics, being presently a multitude
of unmatched theories with inconsistent axiomatics, into an integrated science?
2. Is it possible, maybe through expanding their scopes, to generalize of
transform the existing axiomatics into an integral system of axioms in such a
manner that existing axiomatics of inconsistent theories would follow there
from as a particular case?
