Geometric phases and information flows of a two-level system coupled to its
environment are calculated and analyzed. The information flow is defined as a
cumulant of changes in trace distance between two quantum states, which is
similar to the measure for non-Markovianity given by Breuer. We obtain an
analytic relation between the geometric phase and the information flow for pure
initial states, and a numerical result for mixed initial states. The geometric
phase behaves differently depending on whether there are information flows back
to the two-level system from its environment.
