We present a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe entropy function of
a factor graph, such a characterization being in contrast to the original,
analytical, definition of this function. We achieve this combinatorial
characterization by counting valid configurations in finite graph covers of the
factor graph. Analogously, we give a combinatorial characterization of the
Bethe partition function, whose original definition was also of an analytical
nature. As we point out, our approach has similarities to the replica method,
but also stark differences. The above findings are a natural backdrop for
introducing a decoder for graph-based codes that we will call symbolwise
graph-cover decoding, a decoder that extends our earlier work on blockwise
graph-cover decoding. Both graph-cover decoders are theoretical tools that help
towards a better understanding of message-passing iterative decoding, namely
blockwise graph-cover decoding links max-product (min-sum) algorithm decoding
with linear programming decoding, and symbolwise graph-cover decoding links
sum-product algorithm decoding with Bethe free energy function minimization at
temperature one. In contrast to the Gibbs entropy function, which is a concave
function, the Bethe entropy function is in general not concave everywhere. In
particular, we show that every code picked from an ensemble of regular
low-density parity-check codes with minimum Hamming distance growing (with high
probability) linearly with the block length has a Bethe entropy function that
is convex in certain regions of its domain.
