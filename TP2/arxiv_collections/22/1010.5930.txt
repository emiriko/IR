In 1985 Kazuya Kato formulated a fascinating framework of conjectures which
generalizes the Hasse principle for the Brauer group of a global field to the
so-called cohomological Hasse principle for an arithmetic scheme. In this paper
we prove the prime-to-characteristic part of the cohomological Hasse principle.
We also explain its implications on finiteness of motivic cohomology and
special values of zeta functions.
