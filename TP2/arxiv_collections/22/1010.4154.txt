We report on the 3-dimensional imaging of biological cells including living
neurons by a recently developed fibered interferometric Scanning Optical
Microscope. The topography and surface structure of mouse fibroblasts and
hippocampal neurons are clearly revealed. This straightforward technique allows
fast, high resolution observation of samples in liquids without lengthy
alignment procedures or costly components.
