Locomotion on small scales is dominated by the effects of viscous forces and,
as a result, is subject to strong physical and mathematical constraints.
Following Purcell's statement of the scallop theorem which delimitates the
types of swimmer designs which are not effective on small scales, we review the
different ways the constraints of the theorem can be escaped for locomotion
purposes.
