The onboard software and data communication in the RT-2 Experiment onboard
the Coronas-Photon satellite is organized in a hierarchical way to effectively
handle and communicate asynchronous data generated by the X-ray detectors. A
flexible data handling system is organized in the X-ray detector packages
themselves and the processing electronic device, namely RT-2/E, has the
necessary intelligence to communicate with the 3 scientific payloads by issuing
commands and receiving data. It has direct interfacing with the Satellite
systems and issues commands to the detectors and processes the detector data
before sending to the satellite systems. The onboard software is configured
with several novel features like a) device independent communication scheme, b)
loss-less data compression and c) Digital Signal Processor. Functionality of
the onboard software along with the data structure, command structure, complex
processing scheme etc. are discussed in this paper.
