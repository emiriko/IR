We have numerically studied the thermal evolution of various-mass terrestrial
planets in habitable zones, focusing on duration of dynamo activity to generate
their intrinsic magnetic fields, which may be one of key factors in
habitability on the planets. In particular, we are concerned with super-Earths,
observations of which are rapidly developing. We calculated evolution of
temperature distributions in planetary interior, using Vinet equations of
state, Arrhenius-type formula for mantle viscosity, and the astrophysical
mixing length theory for convective heat transfer modified for mantle
convection. After calibrating the model with terrestrial planets in the Solar
system, we apply it for 0.1--$10M_{\oplus}$ rocky planets with surface
temperature of $300~\mbox{K}$ (in habitable zones) and the Earth-like
compositions. With the criterion for heat flux at the CMB (core-mantle
boundary), the lifetime of the magnetic fields is evaluated from the calculated
thermal evolution. We found that the lifetime slowly increases with the
planetary mass ($M_p$) independent of initial temperature gap at the
core-mantle boundary ($\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$) but beyond a critical value
$M_{c,p}$ ($\sim O(1)M_{\oplus}$) it abruptly declines by the mantle viscosity
enhancement due to the pressure effect. We derived $M_{c,p}$ as a function of
$\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$ and a rheological parameter (activation volume, $V^*$).
Thus, the magnetic field lifetime of super-Earths with $M_p > M_{p,c}$
sensitively depends on $\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$, which reflects planetary
accretion, and $V^*$, which has uncertainty at very high pressure. More
advanced high-pressure experiments and first-principle simulation as well as
planetary accretion simulation are needed to discuss habitability of
super-Earths.
