In this paper we provide two recognition algorithms for the class of
signed-graphic matroids along with necessary and sufficient conditions for a
matroid to be signed-graphic. Specifically, we provide a polynomial-time
algorithm which determines whether a given binary matroid is signed-graphic and
an algorithm which determines whether a general matroid given by an independece
oracle is binary signed-graphic.
