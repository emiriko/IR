We present a systematic study on the excited electron-bubble states in
superfluid helium-4 using a time-dependent density functional approach. For the
evolution of the 1P bubble state, two different functionals accompanied with
two different time-development schemes are used, namely an accurate
finite-range functional for helium with an adiabatic approximation for electron
versus an efficient zero-range functional for helium with a real-time evolution
for electron. We make a detailed comparison between the quantitative results
obtained from the two methods, which allows us to employ with confidence the
optimal method for suitable problems. Based on this knowledge, we use the
finite-range functional to calculate the time-resolved absorption spectrum of
the 1P bubble, which in principle can be experimentally determined, and we use
the zero-range functional to real-time evolve the 2P bubble for several
hundreds of picoseconds, which is theoretically interesting due to the break
down of adiabaticity for this state. Our results discard the physical
realization of relaxed, metastable 2P electron-bubbles
