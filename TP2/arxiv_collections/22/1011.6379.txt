Motivated by dimensional deconstruction, we propose a model of tribimaximal
neutrino mixing based on A_4 x A_4 symmetry. In this model, the two triplet
symmetry-breaking fields of conventional A_4 models are taken to transform
under different A_4 group factors, but are not distinguished by any other
quantum numbers. An additional bi-triplet flavon field breaks A_4 x A_4 to its
diagonal subgroup. If the bi-triplet transforms under an additional Z_3
symmetry, we show that one can construct a general, renormalizable
superpotential that yields the desired pattern of symmetry breaking. We
identify the features that this model has in common with a deconstructed 5D
theory in which A_4 is a subgroup of a continuous gauged flavor symmetry in the
bulk.
