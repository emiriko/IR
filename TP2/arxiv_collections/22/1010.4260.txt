Using spectropolarimetric data of an Active Region (AR) filament we have
carried out inversions in order to infer vector magnetic fields in the
photosphere (Si I line) and in the chromosphere (He I line). Our filament lies
above the polarity inversion line (PIL) situated close to disk center and
presents strong Zeeman-like signatures in both photospheric and chromospheric
lines. Pore-like formations with both polarities are identified in the
continuum under the PIL. The azimuth ambiguity is solved at both heights using
the AZAM code. A comparison between the photospheric and chromospheric vector
magnetic fields revealed that they are well aligned in some areas of the
filament. However, especially at chromospheric heights, the magnetic field is
mostly aligned with the dark threads of the filament. Velocity signatures
indicating upflows of field lines are found at both heights. The combination of
all these findings strongly suggests an emerging flux rope scenario.
