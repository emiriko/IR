The IceCube collaboration is building a cubic kilometer scale neutrino
telescope at a depth of 2 km at the geographic South Pole, utilizing the clear
Antarctic ice as a Cherenkov medium to detect cosmic neutrinos. The IceCube
observatory is complemented by IceTop, a square kilometer air shower array on
top of the in-ice detector. The construction of the detector is nearly finished
with 79 of a planned 86 strings and 73 of 80 IceTop stations deployed. Its
completion is expected in the winter 2010/11. Using data from the partially
built detector, we present initial results of searches for neutrinos from
astrophysical sources such as supernova remnants, active galactic nuclei, and
gamma ray bursts, for anisotropies in cosmic rays, and constraints on the dark
matter scattering cross section. Further, we discuss future plans and R&D
activities towards new neutrino detection techniques.
