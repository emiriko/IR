The two highest precision determinations of alpha_s(M_Z^2), that based on the
analysis of short-distance-sensitive lattice observables, and that based on an
analysis of hadronic tau decay data, have, until very recently, given results
which are not in good agreement. I review new versions of these analyses which
bring the two determinations into excellent agreement, and discuss prospects
for additional future improvements.
