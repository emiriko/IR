Let \pi : X -> S be a morphism of algebraic stacks that is locally of finite
presentation with affine stabilizers. We prove that there is an algebraic
S-stack, the Hilbert stack, parameterizing proper algebraic stacks mapping
quasi-finitely to X. This was previously unknown, even for a morphism of
schemes.
