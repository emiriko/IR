The thermoelectric power, including the Nernst and Seebeck effects, in
graphene nanoribbon is studied. By using the non-equilibrium Green function
combining with the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the Nernst and Seebeck
coefficients are obtained. Due to the electron-hole symmetry, the Nernst
coefficient is an even function of the Fermi energy while the Seebeck
coefficient is an odd function regardless of the magnetic field. In the
presence of a strong magnetic field, the Nernst and Seebeck coefficients are
almost independent of the chirality and width of the nanoribbon, and they show
peaks when the Fermi energy crosses the Landau levels. The height of $n$-th
(excluding $n=0$) peak is $[\ln2/|n|]$ for the Nernst effect and is $\ln2/n$
for the Seebeck effect. For the zeroth peak, it is abnormal with height
$[2\ln2]$ for the Nernst effect and the peak disappears for the Seebeck effect.
When the magnetic field is turned off, however, the Nernst effect is absent and
only Seebeck effect exists. In this case, the Seebeck coefficient strongly
depends on the chirality of the nanoribbon. The peaks are equidistant for the
nanoribbons with zigzag edge but are irregularly distributed for the armchair
edge. In particular, for the insulating armchair ribbon, the Seebeck
coefficient can be very large near the Dirac point. When the magnetic field
varies from zero to large values, the differences among the Seebeck
coefficients for different chiral ribbons gradually vanish and the nonzero
value of Nernst coefficient appears first near the Dirac point then gradually
extents to the whole energy region.
