In the last decade we witness an advent of new types of dwarf stellar systems
in cluding ultra-compact dwarfs, ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals, and exotic
globular clusters, breaking the old simple paradigm for dwarf galaxies and
globular clusters. These objects become more intriguing, and understanding of
these new findings be comes more challenging. Recently we discovered a new type
of large scale structure in the Virgo cluster of galaxies: it is composed of
globular clusters. Globular clusters in Virgo are found wandering between
galaxies (intracluster globular clusters) as well as in galaxies. These
intracluster globular clusters fill a significant fraction in the area of the
Virgo cluster and they are dominated by blue globular clusters. These
intracluster globular clusters may be closely related with the first dwarf
galaxies in the universe.
