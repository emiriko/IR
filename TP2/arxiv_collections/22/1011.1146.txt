We study the physics potential of a neutrino superbeam experiment with a 2540
km baseline. We assume a neutrino beam similar to the NuMI beam in medium
energy configuration. We consider a 100 kton totally active scintillator
detector at a 7 mr off-axis location. We find that such a configuration has
outstanding hierarchy discriminating capability. In conjunction with the data
from the present reactor neutrino experiments, it can determine the neutrino
mass hierarchy at 3 sigma level in less than 5 years, if sin^2(2*theta13) >
0.01, running in the neutrino mode alone. As a stand alone experiment, with a 5
year neutrino run and a 5 year anti-neutrino run, it can determine non-zero
theta13 at 3 sigma level if sin^2(2*theta13) > 7*10^{-3} and hierarchy at 3
sigma level if sin^2(2*theta13) > 8*10^{-3}. This data can also distinguish
deltaCP = pi/2 from the CP conserving values of 0 and pi, for sin^2(2*theta13)
> 0.02.
