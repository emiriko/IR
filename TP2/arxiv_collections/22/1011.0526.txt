It is conventionally thought that the state equation of dense matter softens
and thus cannot result in high maximum mass if pulsars are quark stars, and
that a recently discovered $2M_\odot$ pulsar (PSR J1614-2230) may make quark
stars to be unlikely. However, this standard point of view would be revisited
and updated if quark clustering could occur in cold quark matter because of the
strong coupling between quarks at realistic baryon densities of compact stars,
and it is addressed that the state equation of clustering quark matter stiffs
to support compact stars with maximum mass $M_{\rm max}>2M_\odot$. In this
brief note, it is demonstrated that large parameter spaces are allowed for
$M_{\rm max}>2M_\odot$ in a Lennard-Jones model of clustered quark matter, and
the newly measured highest mass of PSR J1614-2230 would be meaningful to
constrain the number of quarks inside single quark-cluster, to be $N_q<\sim
10^3$.
