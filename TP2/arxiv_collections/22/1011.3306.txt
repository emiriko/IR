The role of the interaction with the nearest electronic state
$^3\Sigma^+_{0^-}$ on the hyperfine structure and magnetic properties of the
$a(1)[^3\Sigma^+_1]$ state of PbO is assessed. The accounting for this
contribution leads to difference between $g$-factors of the $J=1$
$\Omega$-doublet levels, $ \Delta g = 37\times10^{-4}$, that is in a good
agreement with the experimental datum $ \Delta g = 30(8)\times10^{-4}$. The
contribution of this interaction rapidly grows with $J$. For $J=30$ the
difference of $g$-factors of $\Omega$-doublet states reaches 100%; for
hyperfine constants it is 18%. These differences also depend on the electric
field and for $E=11$ V/cm for $^{207}$PbO the difference in $g$-factors turn to
zero. The latter is important for suppressing systematic effects in the
electron electric dipole moment search experiment.
