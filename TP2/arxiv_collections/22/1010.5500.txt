The early-type chemically peculiar stars often show strong magnetic fields on
their surfaces. These magnetic topologies are organized on large scales and are
believed to be close to an oblique dipole for most of the stars. In a striking
exception to this general trend, the helium-strong star HD 37776 shows an
extraordinary double-wave rotational modulation of the longitudinal magnetic
field measurements, indicating a topologically complex and, possibly, record
strong magnetic field. Here we present a new investigation of the magnetic
field structure of HD 37776, using both simple geometrical interpretation of
the longitudinal field curve and detailed modeling of the time-resolved
circular polarization line profiles with the help of magnetic Doppler imaging
technique. We derive a model of the magnetic field structure of HD 37776, which
reconciles for the first time all magnetic observations available for this
star. We find that the local surface field strength does not exceed ~30 kG,
while the overall field topology of HD 37776 is dominated by a non-axisymmetric
component and represents by far the most complex magnetic field configuration
found among early-type stars.
