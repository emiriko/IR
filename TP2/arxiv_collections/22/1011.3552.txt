Polytopes from subgraph statistics are important in applications and
conjectures and theorems in extremal graph theory can be stated as properties
of them. We have studied them with a view towards applications by inscribing
large explicit polytopes and semi-algebraic sets when the facet descriptions
are intractable. The semi-algebraic sets called curvy zonotopes are introduced
and studied using graph limits. From both volume calculations and algebraic
descriptions we find several interesting conjectures.
