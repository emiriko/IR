The present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetary
system. HD 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting Saturn-mass
exoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. It was observed by the CoRoT satellite for
34 days during the fall of 2008. We attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,
the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. We then try to improve
the star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and the
use of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. The data analysis relies
on the Fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. We find evidence of
a sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with light
reflected by the planet. Its relative amplitude is Delta Fp/F* = [13.0, 26.8]
ppm, implying an albedo A=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightness
temperature Tb ~ [1880,2030] K by assuming a radius R=1.1 R_Jup and an
inclination i=45 deg. Its orbital phase differs from that of the
radial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_RV. However, the tiny planetary
signal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluric
signal with a 1 day period. We show that this signal is suppressed, but not
eliminated, when using the time series for HD 46179 from the same CoRoT run as
a reference. This detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planet
should be confirmable with a longer CoRoT observation of the same field. In any
case, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized using
ultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by CoRoT
and Kepler. The combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the same
targets (Gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetary
science and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such as
Plato.
