We employ Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory (NSPT) together with
twisted boundary conditions (TBC) to search for the leading renormalon in the
perturbative expansion of the static energy. This renormalon is expected to
emerge four times faster than the one for the gluon conden- sate in the
plaquette. We extract the static energy from Polyakov loop calculations up to
12 loops and present preliminary results, indicating a significant step towards
confirming the theoretical expectation.
