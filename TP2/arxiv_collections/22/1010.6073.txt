Observations of sun-like stars rotating faster than our current sun tend to
exhibit increased magnetic activity as well as magnetic cycles spanning
multiple years. Using global simulations in spherical shells to study the
coupling of large-scale convection, rotation, and magnetism in a younger sun,
we have probed effects of rotation on stellar dynamos and the nature of
magnetic cycles. Major 3-D MHD simulations carried out at three times the
current solar rotation rate reveal hydromagnetic dynamo action that yields
wreaths of strong toroidal magnetic field at low latitudes, often with opposite
polarity in the two hemispheres. Our recent simulations have explored behavior
in systems with considerably lower diffusivities, achieved with sub-grid scale
models including a dynamic Smagorinsky treatment of unresolved turbulence. The
lower diffusion promotes the generation of magnetic wreaths that undergo
prominent temporal variations in field strength, exhibiting global magnetic
cycles that involve polarity reversals. In our least diffusive simulation, we
find that magnetic buoyancy coupled with advection by convective giant cells
can lead to the rise of coherent loops of magnetic field toward the top of the
simulated domain.
