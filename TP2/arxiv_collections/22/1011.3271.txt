We have obtained maps of the molecular emission within the central five
arcminutes (12 pc) of the Galactic center (GC) in selected molecular tracers:
SiO(2-1), HNCO(5_{0,5}-4_{0,4}), and the J=1-->0 transition of H^{13}CO+,
HN^{13}C, and C^{18}O at an angular resolution of 30" (1.2 pc). The mapped
region includes the circumnuclear disk (CND) and the two surrounding giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) of the Sgr A complex, known as the 20 and 50 km s^{-1}
molecular clouds.Additionally, we simultaneously observed the J=2-1 and 3-2
transitions of SiO toward selected positions to estimate the physical
conditions of the molecular gas. The SiO(2-1) and H^{13}CO+(1-0) emission
covers the same velocity range and presents a similar distribution. In
contrast, HNCO(5-4) emission appears in a narrow velocity range mostly
concentrated in the 20 and 50 km s^{-1} GMCs. The HNCO column densities and
fractional abundances present the highest contrast, with difference factors of
$\geq$60 and 28, respectively. Their highest values are found toward the cores
of the GMCs, whereas the lowest ones are measured at the CND. SiO abundances do
not follow this trend, with high values found toward the CND, as well as the
GMCs. By comparing our abundances with those of prototypical Galactic sources
we conclude that HNCO, similar to SiO, is ejected from grain mantles into
gas-phase by nondissociative C-shocks. This results in the high abundances
measured toward the CND and the GMCs. However, the strong UV radiation from the
Central cluster utterly photodissociates HNCO as we get closer to the center,
whereas SiO seems to be more resistant against UV-photons or it is produced
more efficiently by the strong shocks in the CND. Finally, we discuss the
possible connections between the molecular gas at the CND and the GMCs using
the HNCO/SiO, SiO/CS, and HNCO/CS intensity ratios as probes of distance to the
Central cluster.
