Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) offer an exciting and promising new
research avenue for finding genes for complex diseases. Traditional
case-control and cohort studies offer many advantages for such designs.
Family-based association designs have long been attractive for their robustness
properties, but robustness can mean a loss of power. In this paper we discuss
some of the special features of family designs and their relevance in the era
of GWAS.
