Deciding whether a model provides a good description of data is often based
on a goodness-of-fit criterion summarized by a p-value. Although there is
considerable confusion concerning the meaning of p-values, leading to their
misuse, they are nevertheless of practical importance in common data analysis
tasks. We motivate their application using a Bayesian argumentation. We then
describe commonly and less commonly known discrepancy variables and how they
are used to define p-values. The distribution of these are then extracted for
examples modeled on typical data analysis tasks, and comments on their
usefulness for determining goodness-of-fit are given.
