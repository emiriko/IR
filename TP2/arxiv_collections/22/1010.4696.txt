We compute the structure of the cohomology ring for the quantized enveloping
algebra (quantum group) $U_q$ associated to a finite-dimensional simple complex
Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We show that the cohomology ring is generated as an
exterior algebra by homogeneous elements in the same odd degrees as generate
the cohomology ring for the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Partial results are
also obtained for the cohomology rings of the non-restricted quantum groups
obtained from $U_q$ by specializing the parameter $q$ to a non-zero value
$\epsilon \in \mathbb{C}$.
