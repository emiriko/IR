We describe a superconducting device capable of producing laser light in the
visible range at half of the Josephson generation frequency with the optical
phase of the light locked to the superconducting phase difference. It consists
of two single-level quantum dots embedded into a p-n semiconducting
heterostructure and surrounded by a cavity supporting a resonant optical mode.
We study decoherence and spontaneous switching in the device.
