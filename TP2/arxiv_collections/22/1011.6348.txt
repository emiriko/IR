The transport of quantum electrons through hierarchical lattices is of
interest because such lattices have some properties of both regular lattices
and random systems. We calculate the electron transmission as a function of
energy in the tight binding approximation for two related Hanoi networks. HN3
is a Hanoi network with every site having three bonds. HN5 has additional bonds
added to HN3 to make the average number of bonds per site equal to five. We
present a renormalization group approach to solve the matrix equation involved
in this quantum transport calculation. We observe band gaps in HN3, while no
such band gaps are observed in linear networks or in HN5.
