This work is devoted to search and study scalar $\sigma_0 0^+[0^++]$ - mesons
in the system of $\pi^+\pi^-$ from the reaction $np -> np\pi^+\pi^-$ at the
impulse of the quasimonochromatic neutrons c from the data obtained in an
exposure of the 1m H2 bubble chamber of LHE (JINR)The resonance with and has
been found out in effective mass distribution. Value of a statistical deviation
of this peculiarity from a background is more than four. Spin of the resonance
has been estimated, which, with high probability, is equal 0. The other quantum
numbers of the resonance have been estimated.
