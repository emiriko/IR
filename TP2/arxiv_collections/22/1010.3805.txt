We discuss a neutrino mass model based on the S4 discrete symmetry where the
symmetry breaking is triggered by the boundary conditions of the bulk
right-handed neutrino in the fifth spacial dimension. While the symmetry
restricts bare mass parameters to flavor-diagonal forms, the viable mixing
angles emerge from the wave functions of the Kaluza-Klein modes which carry
symmetry breaking effect. The magnitudes of the lepton mixing angles,
especially the reactor angle is related to the neutrino mass patterns and the
model will be tested in future neutrino experiments, e.g., an early (late)
discovery of the reactor angle favors the normal (inverted) hierarchy. The size
of extra dimension has a connection to the possible mass spectrum; a small
(large) volume corresponds to the normal (inverted) mass hierarchy.
