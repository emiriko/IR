We calculate the quark spin contribution to the total angular momentum of
flavor octet and flavor decuplet ground state baryons using a spin-flavor
symmetry based parametrization method of quantum chromodynamics. We find that
third order SU(6) symmetry breaking three-quark operators are necessary to
explain the experimental result Sigma_1=0.32(10). For spin 3/2 decuplet baryons
we predict that the quark spin contribution is Sigma_3=3.93(22), i.e.
considerably larger than their total angular momentum.
