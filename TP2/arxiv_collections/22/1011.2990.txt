Physical constants and cosmological parameters could vary with position. On
the largest scales such variations would manifest themselves as gradients
across our Hubble volume, leading to dipole-modulation of the cosmic microwave
anisotropies. This generically leads to a correlation between adjacent
multipoles in the spherical harmonics expansion of the sky, a distinctive
signal which should be searched for in future data sets.
