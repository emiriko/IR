The past few years have seen intensive research efforts carried out in some
apparently unrelated areas of dynamic systems -- delay-tolerant networks,
opportunistic-mobility networks, social networks -- obtaining closely related
insights. Indeed, the concepts discovered in these investigations can be viewed
as parts of the same conceptual universe; and the formal models proposed so far
to express some specific concepts are components of a larger formal description
of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast
collection of concepts, formalisms, and results found in the literature into a
unified framework, which we call TVG (for time-varying graphs). Using this
framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only
the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to
each. Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and
original observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each
class corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed
computing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the
evolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on
whether the indicators for these properties are a-temporal (as in the majority
of existing studies) or temporal. Finally, we briefly discuss the introduction
of randomness in TVGs.
