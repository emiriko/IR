In this work we address the statistical periodicity phenomenon on a coupled
map lattice. The study was done based on the asymptotic binary patterns. The
pattern multiplicity gives us the lattice information capacity, while the
entropy rate allows us to calculate the locking-time. Our results suggest that
the lattice has low locking-time and high capacity information when the
coupling is weak. This is the condition for the system to reproduce a kind of
behavior observed in neural networks.
