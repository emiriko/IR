We review the notion of symmetry breaking and restoration within the frame of
nuclear energy density functional methods. We focus on key differences between
wave-function- and energy-functional-based methods. In particular, we point to
difficulties encountered within the energy functional framework and discuss new
potential constraints on the underlying energy density functional that could
make the restoration of broken symmetries better formulated within such a
formalism. We refer to Ref.~\cite{duguet10a} for details.
