We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a many-body bosonic system on a
lattice, subject to driving and dissipation. The time-evolution is described by
a master equation, which we treat within a generalized Gutzwiller mean field
approximation for density matrices. The dissipative processes are engineered
such that the system, in the absence of interaction between the bosons, is
driven into a homogeneous steady state with off-diagonal long range order. We
investigate how the coherent interaction affects qualitatively the properties
of the steady state of the system and derive a nonequilibrium phase diagram
featuring a phase transition into a steady state without long range order. The
phase diagram exhibits also an extended domain where an instability of the
homogeneous steady state gives rise to a persistent density pattern with
spontaneously broken translational symmetry. In the limit of small particle
density, we provide a precise analytical description of the time-evolution
during the instability. Moreover, we investigate the transient following a
quantum quench of the dissipative processes and we elucidate the prominent role
played by collective topological variables in this regime.
