We develop a method to construct elusive functions using techniques of
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The key notions of this method are
elusive subsets and evaluation mappings. We also develop the effective
elimination theory combined with algebraic number field theory in order to
construct concrete points outside the image of a polynomial mapping. Using the
developed methods, for $F = C \text{or} F = R$, we construct examples of
$(s,r)$-elusive functions whose monomial coefficients are algebraic numbers,
which give polynomials with algebraic number coefficients of large circuit
size.
