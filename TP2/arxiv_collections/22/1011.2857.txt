We study the influence of the phonon environment on the electron dynamics in
a doped quantum dot molecule. A non-perturbative quantum kinetic theory based
on correlation expansion is used in order to describe both diagonal and
off-diagonal electron-phonon couplings representing real and virtual processes
with relevant acoustic phonons. We show that the relaxation is dominated by
phonon-assisted electron tunneling between constituent quantum dots and occurs
on a picosecond time scale. The dependence of the time evolution of the quantum
dot occupation probabilities on the energy mismatch between the quantum dots is
studied in detail.
