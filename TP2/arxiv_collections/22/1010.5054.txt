The validity of our Monte Carlo simulation procedure ({\it the integral
method}) had been verified by the corresponding analytical procedure of which
is quite independent of our method methodologically. Also, the results obtained
by our procedure are compared with those obtained by the different Monte Carlo
simulation procedure ({\it the differential method}) which have been
exclusively utilized by the different authors and the agreement between them
are found to be well. By utilizing our Monte Carlo procedures, the validity of
which is guaranteed in two different procedures, we investigate not only the
fluctuation of high energy muons themselves but also fluctuation of the various
quantities related to the energy losses by the muons, which are difficult to
obtain by {\it the differential method}. Namely, we obtain fluctuation on
energy losses of the muons, fluctuation on Cherenkov lights due to the
accompanied cascade showers initiated by the muon and the correlations between
them . Finally, we obtain the transition curves for Cherenkov lights in KM3
detector, taking into account of all possible fluctuations in the stochastic
processes and point out the difficulty of the reliable estimation of the energy
of the muons which are resultants of muon neutrino events in the KM3 detectors.
