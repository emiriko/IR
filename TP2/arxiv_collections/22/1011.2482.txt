We report results from a reanalysis of data from the Cryogenic Dark Matter
Search (CDMS II) experiment at the Soudan Underground Laboratory. Data taken
between October 2006 and September 2008 using eight germanium detectors are
reanalyzed with a lowered, 2 keV recoil-energy threshold, to give increased
sensitivity to interactions from Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs)
with masses below ~10 GeV/c^2. This analysis provides stronger constraints than
previous CDMS II results for WIMP masses below 9 GeV/c^2 and excludes parameter
space associated with possible low-mass WIMP signals from the DAMA/LIBRA and
CoGeNT experiments.
