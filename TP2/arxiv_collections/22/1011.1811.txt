Cosmological models where the standard big bang is replaced by a bounce have
been studied for decades. The situation has, however, dramatically changed in
the past years for two reasons: first, because new ways to probe the early
Universe have emerged, in particular, thanks to the cosmic microwave
background, and second, because some well grounded theories -especially loop
quantum cosmology- unambiguously predict a bounce, at least for homogeneous
models. In this article, we investigate into the details the phenomenological
parameters that could be constrained or measured by next-generation B-mode
cosmic micorwave background experiments. We point out that an important
observational window could be opened. We then show that those constraints can
be converted into very meaningful limits on the fundamental loop quantum
cosmology parameters. This establishes the early Universe as an invaluable
quantum gravity laboratory.
