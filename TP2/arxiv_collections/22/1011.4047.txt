We report the first application of a recently proposed regularization
procedure for multi-reference energy density functionals, which removes
spurious divergent or non-continuous contributions to the binding energy, to a
general configuration mixing. As an example, we present a calculation that
corresponds to the particle-number and angular momentum projection of axially
symmetric time-reversal invariant quasiparticle vacua of different quadrupole
deformation for the nucleus O18. The SIII parameterization of the Skyrme energy
functional is used.
