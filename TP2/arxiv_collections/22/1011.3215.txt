This paper is an attempt to extend the notion of viscosity solution to
nonlinear stochastic partial differential integral equations with nonlinear
Neumann boundary condition. Using the recently developed theory on generalized
backward doubly stochastic differential equations driven by a L\'evy process,
we prove the existence of the stochastic viscosity solution, and further extend
the nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula.
