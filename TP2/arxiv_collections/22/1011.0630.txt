One of the challenges in fighting cybercrime is to understand the dynamics of
message propagation on botnets, networks of infected computers used to send
viruses, unsolicited commercial emails (SPAM) or denial of service attacks. We
map this problem to the propagation of multiple random walkers on directed
networks and we evaluate the inter-arrival time distribution between successive
walkers arriving at a target. We show that the temporal organization of this
process, which models information propagation on unstructured peer to peer
networks, has the same features as SPAM arriving to a single user. We study the
behavior of the message inter-arrival time distribution on three different
network topologies using two different rules for sending messages. In all
networks the propagation is not a pure Poisson process. It shows universal
features on Poissonian networks and a more complex behavior on scale free
networks. Results open the possibility to indirectly learn about the process of
sending messages on networks with unknown topologies, by studying inter-arrival
times at any node of the network.
