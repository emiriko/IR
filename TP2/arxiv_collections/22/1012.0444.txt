We quantify the performance of a non-linear Wiener filter, constructed in
wavelet space, at recovering some of the Fisher information that was lost in
the weak lensing convergence field. The proposed method consists in a
separation of the original field into the sum of a Gaussian and a non-Gaussian
contribution. After filtering an ensemble of such fields, which are obtained
from $N$-body simulations, we find that we can recapture about four times more
Fisher information, an effect that can potentially improve by a significant
amount the constraining power of weak lensing surveys on cosmological
parameters, including the dark energy equation of state $\omega$. We compare
this performance with that of the logarithmic mapping and find that the wavelet
method can recover up to three times more information.
