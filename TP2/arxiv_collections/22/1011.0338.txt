In the paper, a theoretical work is done for investigating effects of
splitting data sequence into packs of data set. We proved that a partitioning
of data sequence is possible to find such that the entropy rate at each
subsequence is lower than entropy rate of the source. Effects of sequence
partitioning on overall compression rate are argued on the bases of
partitioning statistics, and then, an optimization problem for an optimal
partition is defined to improve overall compression rate of a sequence.
