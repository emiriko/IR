This paper presents an improved analysis of a structured dimension-reduction
map called the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform. This argument
demonstrates that the map preserves the Euclidean geometry of an entire
subspace of vectors. The new proof is much simpler than previous approaches,
and it offers---for the first time---optimal constants in the estimate on the
number of dimensions required for the embedding.
