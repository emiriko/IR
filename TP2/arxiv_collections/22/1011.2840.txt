The novel aspect of the centre (NV-) in diamond is the high degree of spin
polarisation achieved through optical illumination. In this paper it is shown
that the spin polarisation occurs as a consequence of an electron-vibration
interaction combined with spin-orbit interaction, and an electronic model
involving these interactions is developed to account for the observed
polarisation.
