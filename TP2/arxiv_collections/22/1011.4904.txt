Conductivity of p-Si and p-Ge is considered for two band model with due
regard for mutual drag of light and heavy holes. It is shown that for small and
moderate temperatures this drag significantly diminishes drift velocity of
light holes and, as result, the total conductivity of crystal. Considered here
drag-effect appears as well in the form of nonmonotonous dependences of
conductivity on temperature and carrier density.
