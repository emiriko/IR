We present a detailed study of the dynamics of correlations in non-Markovian
environments, applying the hierarchy equations approach. This theoretical
treatment is able to take the system-bath interaction into consideration
carefully. It is shown that crosses and sudden changes of classical and quantum
correlations can happen if we gradually reduce the strength of the interactions
between qubits. For some special initial states, sudden transitions between
classical and quantum correlations even occur.
