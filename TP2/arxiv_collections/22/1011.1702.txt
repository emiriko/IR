Crystallization is observed during long molecular dynamics simulations of
bent trimers, a molecular model proposed by Lewis and Wahnstr\"{o}m for
ortho-terphenyl. In the crystal, the three spheres that make up the rigid
molecule sit near sites of a body centered cubic lattice, the trimer bond angle
being almost optimal for this structure. The crystal exhibits orientational
disorder with the molecules aligned randomly along the three Cartesian axis (an
example of cubatic orientational order). The rotational and translational
mobilities exhibit only modest decreases on crystallization, by factors of 10
and 3 respectively. The rotational relaxation does change from Debye-like in
the liquid to large angle jumps in the crystal. We consider the origin of the
superior glass forming ability of the the trimer over the monatomic liquid.
