A possibility of amplification of the 7.6 eV $\gamma$-radiation by the
stimulated $\gamma$-emission of the ensemble of the $^{229m}$Th isomeric nuclei
in a host dielectric crystal is proved theoretically. This amplification is a
result of: 1) the excitation of a large number of the $^{229m}$Th isomers by
laser radiation; 2) the creation of the inverse population of nuclear levels in
a cooled sample owing to the interaction of thorium nuclei with the crystal
electric field or with an external magnetic field; 3) the emissions/absorption
of the optical photons by thorium nuclei in the crystal without recoil; 4) the
nuclear spin relaxation through the conduction electrons of the metallic
covering.
