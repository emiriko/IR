Quantum entanglement, one of the defining features of quantum mechanics, has
been demonstrated in a variety of nonlinear spin-like systems. Quantum
entanglement in linear systems has proven significantly more challenging, as
the intrinsic energy level degeneracy associated with linearity makes quantum
control more difficult. Here we demonstrate the quantum entanglement of photon
states in two independent linear microwave resonators, creating N-photon NOON
states as a benchmark demonstration. We use a superconducting quantum circuit
that includes Josephson qubits to control and measure the two resonators, and
we completely characterize the entangled states with bipartite Wigner
tomography. These results demonstrate a significant advance in the quantum
control of linear resonators in superconducting circuits.
