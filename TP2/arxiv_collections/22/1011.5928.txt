We characterize theoretically and experimentally the degradation of
polarization entanglement in a fiber-optic entanglement distribution system
where one of the optical fibers is exposed to the effects of polarization mode
dispersion (PMD). We show gradual reduction of entanglement with increasing PMD
and find that the highest PMD tolerance is achieved when the bandwidth of the
pump used to generate the entangled photons in a $\chi^{(3)}$ process is
approximately half the bandwidth of the quantum channels.
