In order to clarify the origin of the enhancement of the thermal conductivity
in the Bose-Einstein Condensed (BEC) state of field-induced triplons, we have
measured the thermal conductivity along the [101] direction parallel to
spin-chains, $kappa_{\|[101]}$, and perpendicular to spin-chains,
$kappa_{\perp[101]}$, of the S=1/2 bond-alternating spin-chain system Pb2V3O9
in magnetic fields up to 14 T. With increasing field at 3 K, it has been found
that both $kappa_{\|[101]}$ and $kappa_{\perp[101]}$ are suppressed in the
gapped normal state in low fields. In the BEC state of field-induced triplons
in high fields, on the other hand, $kappa_{\|[101]}$ is enhanced with
increasing field, while $kappa_{\perp[101]}$ is suppressed. That is, the
thermal conductivity along the direction, where the magnetic interaction is
strong, is markedly enhanced in the BEC state. Accordingly, our results suggest
that the enhancement of $kappa_{\|[101]}$ in the BEC state is caused by the
enhancement of the thermal conductivity due to triplons on the basis of the
two-fluid model, as in the case of the superfluid state of liquid 4He.
