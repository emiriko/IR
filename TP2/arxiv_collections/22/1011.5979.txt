We confirm that in order to account for the recent D\O\ result of large
like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry, a considerable large new physics effect in
$\Gamma_{12}^s$ is required in addition to a large CP violating phase in $B_s
-\bar{B}_s$ mixing. In the Randall-Sundrum model of warped geometry, where the
fermion fields reside in the bulk, new sources of flavor and CP violation are
obtained. We analyze the like-sign dimuon asymmetry in this class of model, as
an example of the desired new physics. We show that the wrong charge asymmetry,
$a_{sl}^s$, which is related to the dimuon asymmetry, is significantly altered
compared to the Standard Model value. However, experimental limits from $\Delta
M_s$, $\Delta\Gamma_s$ as well as $K$ mixing and electroweak corrections
constrain it to be greater than a $\sigma$ away from its experimental average
value. This model cannot fully account for the D\O\ anomaly due to its
inability to generate sufficient new contribution to the width difference
$\Gamma^s_{12}$, even though the model can generate large contribution to the
mass difference $M^s_{12}$.
