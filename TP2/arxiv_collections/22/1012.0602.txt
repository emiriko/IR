We present a mathematical connection between channel coding and compressed
sensing. In particular, we link, on the one hand, \emph{channel coding linear
programming decoding (CC-LPD)}, which is a well-known relaxation o
maximum-likelihood channel decoding for binary linear codes, and, on the other
hand, \emph{compressed sensing linear programming decoding (CS-LPD)}, also
known as basis pursuit, which is a widely used linear programming relaxation
for the problem of finding the sparsest solution of an under-determined system
of linear equations. More specifically, we establis a tight connection between
CS-LPD based on a zero-one measurement matrix over the reals and CC-LPD of the
binary linear channel code that is obtained by viewing this measurement matrix
as a binary parity-check matrix. This connection allows the translation of
performance guarantees from one setup to the other. The main message of this
paper is that parity-check matrices of "good" channel codes can be used as
provably "good" measurement matrices under basis pursuit. In particular, we
provide the first deterministic construction of compressed sensing measurement
matrices with an order-optimal number of rows using high-girth low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed by Gallager.
