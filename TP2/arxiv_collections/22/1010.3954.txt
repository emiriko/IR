In this paper, we study properties of Weil height functions associated with
numerically trivial divisors.
  It helps us to define the fractional limit of $h_E$ with respect to $h_D$ on
$U$, with $D$ ample:
  \[
  \Flim_D(E,U) := \liminf_{\substack{P \in U h_D(P) \rightarrow
\infty}}\dfrac{h_E(P)}{h_D(P)}.
  \]
  The value of $\Flim_D(E,U)$ contains numerical information about a divisor
$E$, enough to determine whether $E$ is ample, numerically effective or
pseudo-effective.
