We present and discuss different protocols for preparing an arbitrary quantum
state of a qubit using only a restricted set of measurements, with no unitary
operations at all. We show that an arbitrary state can indeed be prepared,
provided that the available measurements satisfy certain requirements. Our
results shed light on the role that measurement-induced back-action plays in
quantum feedback control and the extent to which this back-action can be
exploited in quantum-control protocols.
