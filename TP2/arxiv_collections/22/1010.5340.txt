Here we present neutron diffraction results on the mineral azurite. We have
found that the crystal structure of azurite can be described in the space group
$P2_1$ which is the next lower symmetric group of $P2_1/c$ as found in earlier
work. This small change in symmetry does not greatly influence the lattice
parameters or atomic fractional coordinates which are presented here for single
crystal diffraction refinements. The ordered magnetic moment structure of this
material has been determined and is comprised of two inequivalent magnetic
moments on copper sites of magnitude 0.68(1) and 0.25(1) $\mu_{B}$. This result
is discussed in terms of the anisotropic exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions. It is found that the system is likely governed by one-dimensional
behaviour despite the long-range ordered ground state. We also highlight the
significance of strain in this material which is strongly coupled to the
magnetism.
