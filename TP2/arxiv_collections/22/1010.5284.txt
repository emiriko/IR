The role of a super-Alfv\'enic plasmoid instability in the onset of fast
reconnection is studied by means of the largest Hall magnetohydrodynamics
simulations to date, with system sizes up to $10^{4}$ ion skin depths
($d_{i}$). It is demonstrated that the plasmoid instability can facilitate the
onset of rapid Hall reconnection, in a regime where the onset would otherwise
be inaccessible because the Sweet-Parker width is significantly above $d_{i}$.
However, the topology of Hall reconnection is not inevitably a single stable
X-point. There exists an intermediate regime where the single X-point topology
itself exhibits instability, causing the system to alternate between a single
X-point geometry and an extended current sheet with multiple X-points produced
by the plasmoid instability. Through a series of simulations with various
system sizes relative to $d_{i}$, it is shown that system size affects the
accessibility of the intermediate regime. The larger the system size is, the
easier it is to realize the intermediate regime. Although our Hall MHD model
lacks many important physical effects included in fully kinetic models, the
fact that a single X-point geometry is not inevitable raises the interesting
possibility for the first time that Hall MHD simulations may have the potential
to realize reconnection with geometrical features similar to those seen in
fully kinetic simulations, namely, extended current sheets and plasmoid
formation.
