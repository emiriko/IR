We identify the mechanism of energy dissipation relevant to spin-sensitive
nanomechanics including the recently introduced magnetic exchange force
microscopy, where oscillating magnetic tips approach surface atomic spins. The
tip-surface exchange couples spin and atom coordinates, leading to a
spin-phonon problem with Caldeira-Leggett type dissipation. In the overdamped
regime, that can lead to a hysteretic flip of the local spin with a large
spin-dependent dissipation, even down to the very low experimental tip
oscillation frequencies, describing recent observations for Fe tips on NiO. A
phase transition to an underdamped regime with dramatic drop of magnetic tip
dissipation should in principle be possible by tuning tip-surface distance.
