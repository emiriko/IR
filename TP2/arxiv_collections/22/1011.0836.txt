The diagonalization of Hermitian supermatrices is studied. Such a change of
coordinates is inevitable to find certain structures in random matrix theory.
However it still poses serious problems since up to now the calculation of all
Rothstein contributions known as Efetov-Wegner terms in physics was quite
cumbersome. We derive the supermatrix Bessel function with all Efetov-Wegner
terms for an arbitrary rotation invariant probability density function. As
applications we consider representations of generating functions for Hermitian
random matrices with and without an external field as integrals over
eigenvalues of Hermitian supermatrices. All results are obtained with all
Efetov-Wegner terms which were unknown before in such an explicit and compact
representation.
