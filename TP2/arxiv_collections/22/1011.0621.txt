Dynamical A and B maps have been employed extensively by Sudarshan and
co-workers to investigate open system evolution of quantum systems. A canonical
structure of the A-map is introduced here. It is shown that this canonical
A-map enables us to investigate if the dynamics is completely positive (CP) or
non-completely positive (NCP) in an elegant way and hence, it subsumes the
basic results on open system dynamics. Identifying memory effects in open
system evolution is gaining increasing importance recently and here, a
criterion of non-Markovianity, based on the relative entropy of the dynamical
state is proposed. The relative entropy difference of the dynamical system
serves as a complementary characterization - though not related directly - to
the fidelity difference criterion proposed recently. Three typical examples of
open system evolution of a qubit, prepared initially in a correlated state with
another qubit (environment), and evolving jointly under a specific unitary
dynamics - which corresponds to a NCP dynamical map - are investigated by
employing both the relative entropy difference and fidelity difference tests of
non-Markovianity. The two qubit initial states are chosen to be (i) a pure
entangled state, (ii) theWerner state, which exemplifies both entangled and
separable states of qubits, depending on a real parameter, and (3) a separable
mixed state. Both the relative entropy and fidelity criteria offer a nice
display of how non-Markovianity manifests in all the three examples.
