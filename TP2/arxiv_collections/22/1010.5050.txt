We have calculated the binding energy, root-mean-square radius and quadrupole
deformation parameter for the recently synthesized superheavy element Z=117,
using the axially deformed relativistic mean field (RMF) model. The calculation
is extended to various isotopes of Z=117 element, strarting from A=286 till
A=310. We predict almost spherical structures in the ground state for almost
all the isotopes. A shape transition appears at about A=292 from prolate to a
oblate shape structures of Z=117 nucleus in our mean field approach. The most
stable isotope (largest binding energy per nucleon) is found to be the
$^{288}$117 nucleus. Also, the Q-value of $\alpha$-decay $Q_\alpha$ and the
half-lives $T_{\alpha}$ are calculated for the $\alpha$-decay chains of
$^{293}$117 and $^{294}$117, supporting the magic numbers at N=172 and/ or 184.
