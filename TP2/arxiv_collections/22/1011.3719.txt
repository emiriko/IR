There is a serious disconnect between quantum theory and gravity. It occurs
at the level of the very foundations of quantum theory, and is far deeper than
just the matter of trying to quantize a non-linear theory. We shall examine
some of the physical reasons for this disconnect and show how it manifests
itself at the beginning, at the level of the equivalence principle.
