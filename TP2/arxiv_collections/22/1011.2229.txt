As part of the NASA EPOXI Mission of Opportunity, we observed seven known
transiting extrasolar planet systems in order to construct time series
photometry of extremely high phase coverage and precision. Here we present the
results for four "hot-Jupiter systems" with near-solar stars - HAT-P-4, TrES-3,
TrES-2 and WASP-3. We observe ten transits of HAT-P-4, estimating the planet
radius Rp = 1.332 \pm 0.052 RJup, the stellar radius R \star = 1.602 \pm 0.061
R \odot, the inclination i = 89.67 \pm 0.30 degrees and the transit duration
from first to fourth contact T = 255.6 \pm 1.9 minutes. For TrES-3, we observe
seven transits, and find Rp = 1.320 \pm 0.057 RJup, R\star = 0.817 \pm 0.022
R\odot, i = 81.99 \pm 0.30 degrees and T = 81.9 \pm 1.1 minutes. We also note a
long term variability in the TrES-3 light curve, which may be due to star
spots. We observe nine transits of TrES-2, and find Rp = 1.169 \pm 0.034 RJup,
R\star = 0.940 \pm 0.026 R\odot, i = 84.15 \pm 0.16 degrees and T = 107.3 \pm
1.1 minutes. Finally we observe eight transits of WASP-3, finding Rp = 1.385
\pm 0.060 RJup, R\star = 1.354 \pm 0.056 R\odot, i = 84.22 \pm 0.81 degrees and
T = 167.3 \pm 1.3 minutes. We present refined orbital periods and times of
transit for each target. We state 95% confidence upper limits on the secondary
eclipse depths in our broadband visible bandpass centered on 650 nm. These
limits are 0.073% for HAT-P-4, 0.062% for TrES-3, 0.16% for TrES-2 and 0.11%
for WASP-3. We combine the TrES-3 secondary eclipse information with the
existing published data and confirm that the atmosphere likely does not have a
temperature inversion.
