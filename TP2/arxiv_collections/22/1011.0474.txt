Perfect Space-Time Codes (STC) are optimal codes in their original
construction for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. Based on Cyclic
Division Algebras (CDA), they are full-rate, full-diversity codes, have
Non-Vanishing Determinants (NVD) and hence achieve Diversity-Multiplexing
Tradeoff (DMT). In addition, these codes have led to optimal distributed
space-time codes when applied in cooperative networks under the assumption of
perfect synchronization between relays. However, they loose their diversity
when delays are introduced and thus are not delay-tolerant. In this paper,
using the cyclic division algebras of perfect codes, we construct new codes
that maintain the same properties as perfect codes in the synchronous case.
Moreover, these codes preserve their full-diversity in asynchronous
transmission.
