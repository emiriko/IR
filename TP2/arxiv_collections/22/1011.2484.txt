We study the effects of decoherence on some particular bipartite qutrit
states under the influence of global, collective, local and multilocal
depolarizing noise. We show that certain free entangled distillable qutrit
density matrices become bound entangled or separable and hence convert into
nondistillable density matrices in global noise. The collective noise increases
the degree of entanglement of the qutrit bipartite states. Furthermore, we show
that some particular local operation cannot avoid the Nondistillability of the
distillable states.
