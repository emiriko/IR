We propose a measure of quantum efficiency of a multimode state of light that
quantifies the amount of optical loss this state has experienced, and prove
that this efficiency cannot increase in any linear-optical processing with
destructive conditional measurements. Any loss that has affected a state can
neither be removed nor redistributed so as to further increase the efficiency
in higher-efficiency modes at the expense of lower-efficiency modes. This
result eliminates the possibility of catalytically improving photon sources.
