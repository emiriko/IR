Optimal design of a Phase I cancer trial can be formulated as a stochastic
optimization problem. By making use of recent advances in approximate dynamic
programming to tackle the problem, we develop an approximation of the Bayesian
optimal design. The resulting design is a convex combination of a "treatment"
design, such as Babb et al.'s (1998) escalation with overdose control, and a
"learning" design, such as Haines et al.'s (2003) $c$-optimal design, thus
directly addressing the treatment versus experimentation dilemma inherent in
Phase I trials and providing a simple and intuitive design for clinical use.
Computational details are given and the proposed design is compared to existing
designs in a simulation study. The design can also be readily modified to
include a first stage that cautiously escalates doses similarly to traditional
nonparametric step-up/down schemes, while validating the Bayesian parametric
model for the efficient model-based design in the second stage.
