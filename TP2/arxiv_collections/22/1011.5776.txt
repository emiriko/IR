The analysis of events containing multiple high Pt leptons (electrons and
muons) produced in ep collisions has been performed with the H1 and ZEUS
detectors at HERA, using the full data sets collected by the experiments in the
period 1994-2007. Mutually exclusive event topologies containing at least two
charged leptons are analysed. The H1 and ZEUS data, corresponding to a total
integrated luminosity of about 1 fb^-1, are combined in a common phase space.
The observed event yields are compared to the predictions from the Standard
Model. In general a good agreement is found, where the expectation is dominated
by photon-photon collisions. Interesting events at high mass and high Pt are
observed by both experiments. The total and differential cross sections for
multi-lepton production at HERA are also measured.
