We consider experimental signatures of WIMPless dark matter. We focus on
models where the WIMPless dark matter candidate is a Majorana fermion, and dark
matter scattering is predominantly spin-dependent. These models can be probed
by IceCube/DeepCore, which can potentially find $3\sigma$ evidence with ~ 5
years of data.
