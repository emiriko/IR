Measurements of production cross sections and polarizations are essential
inputs for a theoretical understanding of heavy vector meson production. In
this article the CDF measurement of the Y(1S) polarization in the kinematic
range |y|<0.6 and 2 < pT [GeV/c] < 40 using a data sample of 2.9/fb is
described. Compared to the CDF Run I measurement, with which it agrees, it
extends the covered pT range, allowing for a better comparison to predictions
in the perturbative regime. The observed trend towards longitudinal
polarization at high transverse momentum disagrees with predictions based on
non-relativistic QCD.
