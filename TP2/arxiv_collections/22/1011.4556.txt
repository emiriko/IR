In this article, we explore the holographic Q-picture description for the
charged rotating black holes in the five-dimensional minimal supergravity. The
central charge in the Q-picture depends only on black hole charge, therefore
can be computed from the near horizon geometry of the extremal and non-rotating
counterpart. Moreover, the CFT temperatures can be identified by studying the
hidden conformal symmetry, and the related gravity-CFT dictionary can be
translated via thermodynamics analysis. The entropy and absorption cross
section computed from both gravity and CFT sides properly agree with each
other.
