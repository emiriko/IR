The non-retarded Casimir interaction (van der Waals interaction) between two
free standing graphene sheets as well as between a graphene sheet and a
substrate is determined. An exact analytical expression is given for the
dielectric function of graphene along the imaginary frequency axis within the
random phase approximation for arbitrary frequency, wave vector, and doping.
