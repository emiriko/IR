We present a large collection of photometric data on the Blazar PKS 0537-441
in the VRIJHK bands taken in 2004-2009. At least three flare-like episodes with
months duration, and >3 mag amplitude are apparent. The spectral energy
distribution is consistent with a power law, and no indication of a thermal
component is found. We searched for short time scale variability, and an
interesting event was identified in the J band, with a duration of ~25 minutes.
