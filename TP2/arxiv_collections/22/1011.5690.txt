By offering effective modal volumes significantly less than a cubic
wavelength, slot-waveguide cavities offer a new in-road into strong atom-photon
coupling in the visible regime. Here we explore two-dimensional arrays of
coupled slot cavities which underpin designs for novel quantum emulators and
polaritonic quantum phase transition devices. Specifically, we investigate the
lateral coupling characteristics of diamond-air and GaP-air slot waveguides
using numerically-assisted coupled-mode theory, and the longitudinal coupling
properties via distributed Bragg reflectors using mode-propagation simulations.
We find that slot-waveguide cavities in the Fabry-Perot arrangement can be
coupled and effectively treated with a tight-binding description, and are a
suitable platform for realizing Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard physics.
