Gauge-invariant treatments of general-relativistic higher-order perturbations
on generic background spacetime is proposed. After reviewing the general
framework of the second-order gauge-invariant perturbation theory, we show the
fact that the linear-order metric perturbation is decomposed into
gauge-invariant and gauge-variant parts, which was the important premis of this
general framework. This means that the development the higher-order
gauge-invariant perturbation theory on generic background spacetime is
possible. A remaining issue to be resolve is also disscussed.
