The central theme in this paper is the Hopf-Laplace equation, which
represents stationary solutions with respect to the inner variation of the
Dirichlet integral. Among such solutions are harmonic maps. Nevertheless,
minimization of the Dirichlet energy among homeomorphisms often leads to
mappings which are neither harmonic nor homeomorphisms. We prove that such
mappings are harmonic outside of a singular set with small image. On the
singular set they are locally Lipschitz, but not necessarily differentiable.
