The standard inflationary version of the origin of the cosmic structure as
the result of the quantum fluctuations during the inflationary stage is less
than fully satisfactory: how exactly does the Universe transit from a
homogeneous and isotropic stage to one where the quantum uncertainties become
actual inhomogeneous fluctuactions? The point is that the predictions of
inflation in this regard cannot be fully justified in any known scheme of
quantum physics. A proposal was made in [A. Perez, H. Sahlmann and D. Sudarsky,
Classical and Quantum Gravity 23, 2317 (2006)] to solve this problem by
invoking a process similar to the collapse of the quantum mechanical wave
function of the various modes of the inflaton field. This in turn was inspired
by ideas of R. Penrose about the roles that quantum gravity might play in
bringing about such breakdown of standard unitary evolution of quantum
mechanics. In this work we propose and study a new collapse scheme that follows
the correlations indicated in the Wigner functional of the initial state.
Furthermore, in his thesis work we will focus on a more detailed study of three
collapse schemes (robustness, multiple collapses) and on the traces they might
leave on the observational data.
