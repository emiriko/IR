Magnetic phase diagram of a spatially anisotropic, frustrated spin-1/2
Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a stacked square lattice is investigated using
second-order spin-wave expansion. The effects of interlayer coupling and the
spatial anisotropy on the magnetic ordering of two ordered ground states are
explicitly studied. It is shown that with increase in next nearest neighbor
frustration the second-order corrections play a significant role in stabilizing
the magnetization. We obtain two ordered magnetic phases (Neel and stripe)
separated by a paramagnetic disordered phase. Within second-order spin-wave
expansion we find that the width of the disordered phase diminishes with
increase in the interlayer coupling or with decrease in spatial anisotropy but
it does not disappear. Our obtained phase diagram differs significantly from
the phase diagram obtained using linear spin-wave theory.
