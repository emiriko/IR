We present mid-infrared spectra and images from the GEMINI-N (+Michelle)
observations of fragments SW3-[B] and SW3-[C] of the ecliptic (Jupiter Family)
comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 pre-perihelion. We observed fragment B soon
after an outburst event (between 2006 April 16 - 26 UT) and detected
crystalline silicates. The mineralogy of both fragments was dominated by
amorphous carbon and amorphous pyroxene. The grain size distribution (assuming
a Hanner modified power-law) for fragment SW3-[B] has a peak grain radius of
a_p ~ 0.5 micron, and for fragment SW3-[C], a_p ~ 0.3 micron; both values
larger than the peak grain radius of the size distribution for the dust ejected
from ecliptic comet 9P/Tempel 1 during the Deep Impact event (a_p = 0.2 micron.
The silicate-to-carbon ratio and the silicate crystalline mass fraction for the
submicron to micron-size portion of the grain size distribution on the nucleus
of fragment SW3-[B] was 1.341 +0.250 -0.253 and 0.335 +0.089 -0.112,
respectively, while on the nucleus of fragment SW3-[C] was 0.671 +0.076 -0.076
and 0.257 +0.039 -0.043, respectively. The similarity in mineralogy and grain
properties between the two fragments implies that 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is
homogeneous in composition. The slight differences in grain size distribution
and silicate-to-carbon ratio between the two fragments likely arises because
SW3-[B] was actively fragmenting throughout its passage while the activity in
SW3-[C] was primarily driven by jets. The lack of diverse mineralogy in the
fragments SW3-[B] and SW3-[C] of 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 along with the
relatively larger peak in the coma grain size distribution suggests the parent
body of this comet may have formed in a region of the solar nebula with
different environmental properties than the natal sites where comet C/1995 O1
(Hale-Bopp) and 9P/Tempel 1 nuclei aggregated.
