We present and interpret observations of two morphologically homologous
flares that occurred in active region (AR) NOAA 10501 on 20 November 2003. Both
flares displayed four homologous H-alpha ribbons and were both accompanied by
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The central flare ribbons were located at the
site of an emerging bipole in the center of the active region. The negative
polarity of this bipole fragmented in two main pieces, one rotating around the
positive polarity by ~ 110 deg within 32 hours. We model the coronal magnetic
field and compute its topology, using as boundary condition the magnetogram
closest in time to each flare. In particular, we calculate the location of
quasiseparatrix layers (QSLs) in order to understand the connectivity between
the flare ribbons. Though several polarities were present in AR 10501, the
global magnetic field topology corresponds to a quadrupolar magnetic field
distribution without magnetic null points. For both flares, the photospheric
traces of QSLs are similar and match well the locations of the four H-alpha
ribbons. This globally unchanged topology and the continuous shearing by the
rotating bipole are two key factors responsible for the flare homology.
However, our analyses also indicate that different magnetic connectivity
domains of the quadrupolar configuration become unstable during each flare, so
that magnetic reconnection proceeds differently in both events.
