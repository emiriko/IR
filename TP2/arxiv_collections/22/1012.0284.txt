A fast simple O(\log n) iteration algorithm for individual Lucas numbers is
given. This is faster than using Fibonacci based methods because of the
structure of Lucas numbers. Using a sqrt 5 conversion factor on Lucus numbers
gives a faster Fibonacci algorithm. In addition, a fast simple recursive
algorithm for individual Lucas numbers is given that is O(log n).
