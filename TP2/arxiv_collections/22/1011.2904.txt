The Great Nebula in Carina is a superb location in which to study the physics
of violent massive star-formation and the resulting feedback effects, including
cloud dispersal and triggered star-formation. In order to reveal the cold dusty
clouds in the Carina Nebula complex, we used the Large APEX Bolometer Camera
LABOCA at the APEX telescope to map a 1.25 deg x 1.25 deg (= 50 x 50 pc^2)
region at 870 micrometer. From a comparison to Halpha images we infer that
about 6% of the 870 micrometer flux in the observed area is likely free-free
emission from the HII region, while about 94% of the flux is very likely
thermal dust emission. The total (dust + gas) mass of all clouds for which our
map is sensitive is ~ 60 000 Msun, in good agreement with the mass of the
compact clouds in this region derived from 13CO line observations. We generally
find good agreement in the cloud morphology seen at 870 micrometer and the
Spitzer 8 micrometer emission maps, but also identify a prominent infrared dark
cloud. Finally, we construct a radiative transfer model for the Carina Nebula
complex that reproduces the observed integrated spectral energy distribution
reasonably well. Our analysis suggests a total gas + dust mass of about 200000
Msun in the investigated area; most of this material is in the form of
molecular clouds, but a widely distributed component of (partly) atomic gas,
containing up to ~ 50% of the total mass, may also be present. Currently, only
some 10% of the gas is in sufficiently dense clouds to be immediately available
for future star formation, but this fraction may increase with time owing to
the ongoing compression of the strongly irradiated clouds and the expected
shockwaves of the imminent supernova explosions.
