We describe the information that can be gained when a survey is done
multi-epoch, and its particular impact for open clusters. We first explain the
irreplaceable information that multi-epoch observations are giving within
astrometry, photometry and spectroscopy. Then we give three examples for
results on open clusters from multi-epoch surveys, namely, the distance to the
Pleiades, the angular momentum evolution of low mass stars and
asteroseismology. Finally we mention several very large surveys, which are
ongoing or planned for the future, Gaia, JASMINE, LSST, and VVV.
