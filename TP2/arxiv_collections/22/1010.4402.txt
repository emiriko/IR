Employing the trace distance as a measure for the distinguishability of
quantum states, we study the influence of initial correlations on the dynamics
of open systems. We concentrate on the Jaynes-Cummings model for which the
knowledge of the exact joint dynamics of system and reservoir allows the
treatment of initial states with arbitrary correlations. As a measure for the
correlations in the initial state we consider the trace distance between the
system-environment state and the product of its marginal states. In particular,
we examine the correlations contained in the thermal equilibrium state for the
total system, analyze their dependence on the temperature and on the coupling
strength, and demonstrate their connection to the entanglement properties of
the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. A detailed study of the time dependence of
the distinguishability of the open system states evolving from the thermal
equilibrium state and its corresponding uncorrelated product state shows that
the open system dynamically uncovers typical features of the initial
correlations.
