We examine the quantum Zeno effect on the dynamics of quantum discord in two
initially entangled qubits which are subjected to frequent measurements via
decoherent coupling with independent reservoirs. The links between
characteristic parameters such as system bias, measurement time duration,
strength of initial entanglement between the two qubit systems and the dynamics
of quantum discord are examined in the case of two initial state
configurations. For weak or unsharp measurements, the quantum discord, which is
an intrinsically distinct entity from concurrence, serves as a reliable
indicator of the crossover point in Zeno to anti-Zeno transitions. However at
highly precise quantum measurements, the monitoring device interferes
significantly with the evolution dynamics of the monitored system, and the
quantum discord yields indeterminate values in a reference frame where the
observer is not an active constituent of the subsystems.
