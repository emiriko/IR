Based on a thorough comparison of the nucleon and $\Delta$ excitation
spectrum with models we show that parity doublets observed in the mass spectra
do not entail the consequence that highly excited $N$ or $\Delta$ resonances
are insensitive to chiral symmetry breaking. Instead, the mechanism of mass
generation in excited states is suggested to be the same as for the baryon
ground states: the mass is assigned to fluctuating gluon fields and their
strong attraction. In excited baryons, the field energy has to be integrated
over a larger volume, and the total mass increases. Thus, also the additional
mass of resonances, the excitation energy, is generated by spontaneous breaking
of chiral symmetry.
