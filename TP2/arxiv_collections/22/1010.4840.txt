In this paper, we extend past work done on the application of the mathematics
of category theory to quantum information science. Specifically, we present a
realization of a dagger-compact category that can model finite-dimensional
quantum systems and explicitly allows for the interaction of systems of
arbitrary, possibly unequal, dimensions. Hence our framework can handle generic
tensor network states, including matrix product states. Our categorical model
subsumes the traditional quantum circuit model while remaining directly and
easily applicable to problems stated in the language of quantum information
science. The circuit diagrams themselves now become morphisms in a category,
making quantum circuits a special case of a much more general mathematical
framework. We introduce the key algebraic properties of our tensor calculus
diagrammatically and show how they can be applied to solve problems in the
field of quantum information.
