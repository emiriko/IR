We show that the sharp constant in the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality
can be derived using the method that we employed earlier for a similar
inequality on the Heisenberg group. The merit of this proof is that it does not
rely on rearrangement inequalities; it is the first one to do so for the whole
parameter range.
