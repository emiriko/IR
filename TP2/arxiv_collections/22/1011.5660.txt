The reaction rate probability integral is extended from Maxwell-Boltzmann
approach to a more general approach by using the pathway model introduced by
Mathai [Mathai A.M.:2005, A pathway to matrix-variate gamma and normal
densities, Linear Algebra and Its Applications}, 396, 317-328]. The extended
thermonuclear reaction rate is obtained in closed form via a Meijer's
G-function and the so obtained G-function is represented as a solution of a
homogeneous linear differential equation. A physical model for the
hydrodynamical process in a fusion plasma compressed and laser-driven spherical
shock wave is used for evaluating the fusion energy integral by integrating the
extended thermonuclear reaction rate integral over the temperature. The result
obtained is compared with the standard fusion yield obtained by Haubold and
John in 1981.[Haubold, H.J. and John, R.W.:1981, Analytical representation of
the thermonuclear reaction rate and fusion energy production in a spherical
plasma shock wave, Plasma Physics, 23, 399-411]. An interpretation for the
pathway parameter is also given.
