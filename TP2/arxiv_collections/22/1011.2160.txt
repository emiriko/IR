We present measurements of the magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity and
electrical resistivity of Pu$_{1-x}$Lu$_x$Pd$_3$, with $x$=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
0.8 and 1. PuPd$_3$ is an antiferromagnetic heavy fermion compound with
$T_N=24$~K. With increasing Lu doping, both the Kondo and RKKY interaction
strengths fall, as judged by the Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma$ and N\'eel
temperature $T_N$. Fits to a crystal field model of the resistivity also
support these conclusions. The paramagnetic effective moment
$\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ increases with Lu dilution, indicating a decrease in the
Kondo screening. In the highly dilute limit, $\mu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ approaches
the value predicted by intermediate coupling calculations. In conjunction with
an observed Schottky peak at $\sim$60~K in the magnetic heat capacity,
corresponding to a crystal field splitting of $\sim$12~meV, a mean-field
intermediate coupling model with nearest neighbour interactions has been
developed.
