Single photons are fundamental elements for quantum information technologies
such as quantum cryptography, quantum information storage and optical quantum
computing. Colour centres in diamond have proven to be stable single photon
sources and thus essential components for reliable and integrated quantum
information technology. A key requirement for such applications is a large
photon flux and a high efficiency. Paying tribute to various attempts to
maximise the single photon flux we show that collection efficiencies of photons
from colour centres can be increased with a rather simple experimental setup.
To do so we spin-coated nanodiamonds containing single nitrogen-vacancy colour
centres on the flat surface of a ZrO2 solid immersion lens. We found stable
single photon count rates of up to 853 kcts/s at saturation under continuous
wave excitation while having excess to more than 100 defect centres with count
rates from 400 kcts/s to 500 kcts/s. For a blinking defect centre we found
count rates up to 2.4 Mcts/s for time intervals of several ten seconds. It
seems to be a general feature that very high rates are accompanied by a
blinking behaviour. The overall collection efficiency of our setup of up to
4.2% is the highest yet reported for N-V defect centres in diamond. Under
pulsed excitation of a stable emitter of 10 MHz, 2.2% of all pulses caused a
click on the detector adding to 221 kcts/s thus opening the way towards diamond
based on-demand single photon sources for quantum applications.
