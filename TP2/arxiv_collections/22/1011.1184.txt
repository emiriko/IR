We survey the current situation regarding chemical modelling of the synthesis
of molecules in the interstellar medium. The present state of knowledge
concerning the rate coefficients and their uncertainties for the major
gas-phase processes -- ion-neutral reactions, neutral-neutral reactions,
radiative association, and dissociative recombination -- is reviewed. Emphasis
is placed on those reactions that have been identified, by sensitivity
analyses, as 'crucial' in determining the predicted abundances of the species
observed in the interstellar medium. These sensitivity analyses have been
carried out for gas-phase models of three representative, molecule-rich,
astronomical sources: the cold dense molecular clouds TMC-1 and L134N, and the
expanding circumstellar envelope IRC +10216. Our review has led to the proposal
of new values and uncertainties for the rate coefficients of many of the key
reactions. The impact of these new data on the predicted abundances in TMC-1
and L134N is reported. Interstellar dust particles also influence the observed
abundances of molecules in the interstellar medium. Their role is included in
gas-grain, as distinct from gas-phase only, models. We review the methods for
incorporating both accretion onto, and reactions on, the surfaces of grains in
such models, as well as describing some recent experimental efforts to simulate
and examine relevant processes in the laboratory. These efforts include
experiments on the surface-catalysed recombination of hydrogen atoms, on
chemical processing on and in the ices that are known to exist on the surface
of interstellar grains, and on desorption processes, which may enable species
formed on grains to return to the gas-phase.
