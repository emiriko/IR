In this paper, we establish a blow-up criterion for the compressible liquid
crystals equations in terms of the gradient of the velocity only, similar to
the Beale-Kato-Majda criterion \cite{majda} for ideal incompressible flows and
the criterion obtained by Huang and Xin \cite{xin2} for the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations.
