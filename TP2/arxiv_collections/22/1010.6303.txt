We report the detection of a pair of degree-long tidal tails associated with
the globular cluster Palomar 14, using images obtained at the CFHT. We reveal a
power-law departure from a King profile at large distances to the cluster
center. The density map constructed with the optimal matched filter technique
shows a nearly symmetrical and elongated distribution of stars on both sides of
the cluster, forming a S-shape characteristic of mass loss. This evidence may
be the telltale signature of tidal stripping in action. This, together with its
large Galactocentric distance, imposes strong constraints on its orbit and/or
origin: i) it must follow an external orbit confined to the peripheral region
of the Galactic halo and/or ii) it formed in a satellite galaxy later accreted
by the Milky Way.
