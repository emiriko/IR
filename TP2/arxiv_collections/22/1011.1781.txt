The research of strongly coupled beyond-the-standard-model theories has
generated significant interest in non-abelian gauge field theories with
different number of fermions in different representations. Motivated by the
increased interest to various technicolor scenarios, we study the
non-perturbative improvement of the Wilson-clover action with SU(2) gauge
fields and 2 flavors of fermions in the fundamental and adjoint
representations. The Sheikholeslami-Wohlert coefficients are fixed using
Schroedinger functional boundary conditions. The adjoint representation theory
is a candidate for a "minimal technicolor" theory, already studied on the
lattice using unimproved Wilson fermions.
