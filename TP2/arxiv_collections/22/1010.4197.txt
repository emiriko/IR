The Aharonov-Casher (AC) oscillations of spin current through a 2D ballistic
ring in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction and external magnetic
field has been calculated using the semiclassical path integral method. For
classically chaotic trajectories the Fokker-Planck equation determining
dynamics of the particle spin polarization has been derived. On the basis of
this equation an analytic expression for the spin conductance has been obtained
taking into account a finite width of the ring arms carrying large number of
conducting channels. It was shown that the finite width results in a broadening
and damping of spin current AC oscillations. We found that an external magnetic
field leads to appearance of new nondiagonal components of the spin
conductance, allowing thus by applying a rather weak magnetic field to change a
direction of the transmitted spin current polarization.
