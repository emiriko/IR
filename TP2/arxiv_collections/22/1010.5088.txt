The rigorous coupled wave analysis method (RCWA) is applied to the graded
chiral TiO2 thin films in axial and non-axial excited states using the
Bruggeman homogenization formalism. The dependence of the filtering frequency
and polarization selectivity as a function of different structural parameters,
are investigated. A good agreement with experimental results reported by other
researchers is achieved.
