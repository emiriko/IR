We report BVR photometry of the V1343 Aql= SS 433 microquasar at different
phases of the 13--day orbital cycle for the 1986--1990 observing seasons. The
data include five complete cycles of the 163$^{d}$ precession period of the
system. We obtain mean light curves and color--color diagrams with the orbital
period for all intervals of precession phases. The optical component of the
close binary system (CBS) fills its critical Roche lobe and loses mass on the
thermal relaxation time scale. Gaseous flow show up actively in the system and
activity manifestations differ substantially at different precession phases.
The collimated relativistic jets perpendicular to the plane of the disk appear
to be associated with supercritical accretion onto the compact relativistic
object in the massive CBS, which shows up in the shapes of the light curves at
different orbital and precession phases. An analysis of color indices confirmed
the earlier discovered peculiarities of the system.
