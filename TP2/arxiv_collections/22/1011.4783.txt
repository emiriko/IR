In this talk, we report our recent studies for the chiral magnetic effect,
which signals the P- and CP-violations at the heavy ion collisions. We compute
the electric current and its correlations, induced by the external magnetic
field, inside the hot and dense QCD matter created in the heavy ion collisions.
For this purpose, we employ the instanton-liquid model, modified by the
Harrington-Shepard caloron at finite T. We observe that the chiral magnetic
effect current and its correlations increase with respect to the magnetic
field, whereas they decrease as functions of T, due to the diluting instanton
ensemble. It turns out that the numerical results are in good agreement with
those from the model-independent analyses and lattice QCD simulations. We also
reproduce the charge separations, observed in the STAR experiment,
qualitatively well, considering the simplified Lienard-Wiechert potential,
screening and size effects.
