In this paper we show how it is possible to reuse optical supports (CDs,
DVDs, etc.) without using chemical or physical transformation, only employing a
software that can easily run on domestic computers. This software can make
obsolete optical supports useful again, converting de facto WEEE (Waste
electric and electronic equipment) into EEE (Electric and electronic
equipment). A massive use of such a software can lead to a significant change
in EEE every-day use, reducing its production to sustainable levels.
