In the two-Higgs-doublet model the alignment of the Yukawa matrices in
flavour space guarantees the absence of flavour-changing neutral currents at
tree level, while introducing new sources for CP violation parametrized in a
very economical way. This implies potentially large influence in a number of
processes, b -> s gamma being a prominent example where rather high
experimental and theoretical precision meet. We analyze the CP rate asymmetry
in this inclusive decay and determine the resulting constraints on the model
parameters. We demonstrate the compatibility with previously obtained limits.
Moreover we extend the phenomenological analysis of the branching ratio, and
examine the influence of resulting correlations on the like-sign dimuon charge
asymmetry in B decays.
