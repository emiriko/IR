Assuming $Y_{b}(10890)$ as a P-wave $bq$-scalar-diquark
$\bar{b}\bar{q}$-scalar-antidiquark tetraquark state, the mass of
$Y_{b}(10890)$ is computed in the framework of QCD sum rule method.
Technically, contributions of operators up to dimension six are included in the
operator product expansion (OPE). The numerical result $10.88\pm0.13 GeV$ for
$Y_{b}(10890)$ agrees well with the experimental value, which favors the P-wave
$[bq][\bar{b}\bar{q}]$ tetraquark configuration for $Y_{b}(10890)$. In the same
picture, the mass of $Y(4360)$ is calculated and the result $4.32\pm0.20 GeV$
is compatible with the experimental data, which supports $Y(4360)$'s P-wave
$[cq][\bar{c}\bar{q}]$ structure.
