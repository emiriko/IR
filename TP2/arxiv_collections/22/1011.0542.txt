In this letter, we show that a perfect lens can be employed to make multiple
objects appear like only one in the far field, leading to a new concept of
illusion optics. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the
functionalities for both passive and active objects. The conceptual device can
be utilized to enhance the illumination brightness for both incoherent and
coherent systems.
