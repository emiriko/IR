We consider the unwinding of two lattice polymer strands of length N that are
initially wound around each other in a double-helical conformation and evolve
through Rouse dynamics. The problem relates to quickly bringing a
double-stranded polymer well above its melting temperature, i.e., the binding
interactions between the strands are neglected, and the strands separate from
each other as it is entropically favorable for them to do so. The strands
unwind by rotating around each other until they separate. We find that the
process proceeds from the ends inward; intermediate conformations can be
characterized by a tightly wound inner part, from which loose strands are
sticking out, with length l~t^0.39. The total time needed for the two strands
to unwind scales as a power of N as tu~N^(2.57+-0.03). We present a theoretical
argument, which suggests that during this unwinding process, these loose
strands are far out of equilibrium.
