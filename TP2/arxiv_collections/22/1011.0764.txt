We discuss flavor states of the knot model and their relation to the KM and
the PMNS matrices. These states are eigenstates of absorption-emission
operators and are analogous to the coherent states of the Maxwell field. The
underlying model has been proposed as a possible substructure of the standard
model. We include a knot parameterization of the CKM matrix.
