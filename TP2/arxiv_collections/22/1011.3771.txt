Magnetic interactions are generally believed to play a key role in mediating
electron pairing for superconductivity in iron arsenides; yet their character
is only partially understood. Experimentally, the antiferromagnetic (AF)
transition is always preceded by or coincident with a tetragonal to
orthorhombic structural distortion. Although it has been suggested that this
lattice distortion is driven by an electronic nematic phase, where a
spontaneously generated electronic liquid crystal state breaks the C4
rotational symmetry of the paramagnetic state, experimental evidence for
electronic anisotropy has been either in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase
or the tetragonal phase under uniaxial pressure that breaks this symmetry. Here
we use inelastic neutron scattering to demonstrate the presence of a large
in-plane spin anisotropy above TN in the unstressed tetragonal phase of
BaFe2As2. In the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, we find highly anisotropic
spin waves with a large damping along the AF a-axis direction. On warming the
system to the paramagnetic tetragonal phase, the low-energy spin waves evolve
into quasi-elastic excitations, while the anisotropic spin excitations near the
zone boundary persist. These results strongly suggest that the spin nematicity
we find in the tetragonal phase of BaFe2As2 is the source of the electronic and
orbital anisotropy observed above TN by other probes, and has profound
consequences for the physics of these materials.
