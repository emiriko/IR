We present a catalogue of about 6 million unresolved photometric detections
in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Seventh Data Release classifying them into
stars, galaxies and quasars. We use a machine learning classifier trained on a
subset of spectroscopically confirmed objects from 14th to 22nd magnitude in
the SDSS {\it i}-band. Our catalogue consists of 2,430,625 quasars, 3,544,036
stars and 63,586 unresolved galaxies from 14th to 24th magnitude in the SDSS
{\it i}-band. Our algorithm recovers 99.96% of spectroscopically confirmed
quasars and 99.51% of stars to i $\sim$21.3 in the colour window that we study.
The level of contamination due to data artefacts for objects beyond $i=21.3$ is
highly uncertain and all mention of completeness and contamination in the paper
are valid only for objects brighter than this magnitude. However, a comparison
of the predicted number of quasars with the theoretical number counts shows
reasonable agreement.
