We investigate phase diffusion of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
prepared initially in arbitrary coherent spin state $|\theta_0,\phi_0\rangle$.
Analytical expression of the phase-diffusion time is presented for
$\theta_0\neq\pi/2$ case. In comparison with the symmetrical case (i.e.,
$\theta_0=\pi/2$), we find that the diffusion process becomes slowly due to the
reduced atom number variance.
