The thermodynamics expected of systems undergoing third order phase
transition has been investigated by identifying the orders through the analytic
continuation of the functional of the free energy, using Ehrenfest
thermodynamic theory. We developed the Euler - Lagrange equations for the order
parameter and the vector potential and solved them for the first time using
well - known mathematical formulations.
