A simple derivation of the optimal state estimation of a quantum bit was
obtained by using the no-signaling principle. In particular, the no-signaling
principle determines a unique form of the guessing probability independently of
figures of merit, such as the fidelity or information gain. This proves that
the optimal estimation for a quantum bit can be achieved by the same
measurement for almost all figures of merit.
