The extremely luminous supernova 2006gy (SN 2006gy) is among the most
energetic ever observed. The peak brightness was 100 times that of a typical
supernova and it spent an unheard of 250 days at magnitude -19 or brighter.
Efforts to describe SN 2006gy have pushed the boundaries of current supernova
theory. In this work we aspire to simultaneously reproduce the photometric and
spectroscopic observations of SN 2006gy using a quark nova model. This analysis
considers the supernova explosion of a massive star followed days later by the
quark nova detonation of a neutron star. We lay out a detailed model of the
interaction between the supernova envelope and the quark nova ejecta paying
special attention to a mixing region which forms at the inner edge of the
supernova envelope. This model is then fit to photometric and spectroscopic
observations of SN 2006gy. This QN model naturally describes several features
of SN 2006gy including the late stage light curve plateau, the broad H{\alpha}
line and the peculiar blue H{\alpha} absorption. We find that a progenitor mass
between 20Msun and 40Msun provides ample energy to power SN 2006gy in the
context of a QN.
