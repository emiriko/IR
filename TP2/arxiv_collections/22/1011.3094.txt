Most traditional alarm systems cannot address security threats in a
satisfactory manner. To alleviate this problem, we developed a high-confidence
cyber-physical alarm system (CPAS), a new kind of alarm systems. This system
establishes the connection of the Internet (i.e. TCP/IP) through GPRS/CDMA/3G.
It achieves mutual communication control among terminal equipments, human
machine interfaces and users by using the existing mobile communication
network. The CPAS will enable the transformation in alarm mode from traditional
one-way alarm to two-way alarm. The system has been successfully applied in
practice. The results show that the CPAS could avoid false alarms and satisfy
residents' security needs.
