This paper describes a learning environment for image-guided prostate
biopsies in cancer diagnosis; it is based on an ultrasound probe simulator
virtually exploring real datasets obtained from patients. The aim is to make
the training of young physicians easier and faster with a tool that combines
lectures, biopsy simulations and recommended exercises to master this medical
gesture. It will particularly help acquiring the three-dimensional
representation of the prostate needed for practicing biopsy sequences. The
simulator uses a haptic feedback to compute the position of the virtual probe
from three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound recorded data. This paper presents the
current version of this learning environment.
