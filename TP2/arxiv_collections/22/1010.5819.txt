Forming giant planets by disk instability requires a gaseous disk that is
massive enough to become gravitationally unstable and able to cool fast enough
for self-gravitating clumps to form and survive. Models with simplified disk
cooling have shown the critical importance of the ratio of the cooling to the
orbital timescales. Uncertainties about the proper value of this ratio can be
sidestepped by including radiative transfer. Three-dimensional radiative
hydrodynamics models of a disk with a mass of $0.043 M_\odot$ from 4 to 20 AU
in orbit around a $1 M_\odot$ protostar show that disk instabilities are
considerably less successful in producing self-gravitating clumps than in a
disk with twice this mass. The results are sensitive to the assumed initial
outer disk ($T_o$) temperatures. Models with $T_o$ = 20 K are able to form a
single self-gravitating clump, whereas models with $T_o$ = 25 K form clumps
that are not quite self-gravitating. These models imply that disk instability
requires a disk with a mass of at least $\sim 0.043 M_\odot$ inside 20 AU in
order to form giant planets around solar-mass protostars with realistic disk
cooling rates and outer disk temperatures. Lower mass disks around solar-mass
protostars must rely upon core accretion to form inner giant planets.
