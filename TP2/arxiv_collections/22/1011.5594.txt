We consider ensembles of $N \times N$ Hermitian Wigner matrices, whose
entries are (up to the symmetry constraints) independent and identically
distributed random variables. Assuming sufficient regularity for the
probability density function of the entries, we show that the expectation of
the density of states on {\it arbitrarily} small intervals converges to the
semicircle law, as $N$ tends to infinity.
