We elaborate two generic methods for producing two-dimensional (2D) spatial
soliton arrays (SSAs) in the framework of the cubic-quintic (CQ) complex
Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) model. The first approach deals with a broad beam
launched into the dissipative nonlinear medium, which is equipped with an
imprinted grating of a sufficiently sharp form. The beam splits into a cluster
of jets, each subsequently self-trapping into a stable soliton, if the power is
sufficient for that. We consider two kinds of sharp gratings -- "raised-cosine"
(RC) and Kronig-Penney (KP) lattices -- and two types of the input beams,
fundamental and vortical. By selecting appropriate parameters, this method
makes it possible to create various types of solitons arrays, such as solid,
annular (with single and double rings), and cross-shaped ones. The second
method uses a "virtual lattice", in the form of a periodic transverse phase
modulation imprinted into the broad beam, which is passed through an
appropriate phase mask and then shone into a uniform nonlinear medium. Two
different types of the masks are considered, in the form of a "checkerboard" or
"tilings". In that case, broad fundamental and vortical beams may also evolve
into stable SSAs, if the beam's power and spacing of the virtual phase lattice
are large enough. By means of the latter technique, square-shaped, hexagonal,
and quasi-crystalline SSAs can be created.
