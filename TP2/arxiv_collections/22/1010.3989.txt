Context: L1448-mm is the prototype of a low-mass Class 0 protostar driving a
high-velocity jet. Given its bright H2O spectra observed with ISO, L1448-mm is
an ideal laboratory to observe heavy water (HDO) emission. Aims: Our aim is to
image the HDO emission in the protostar surroundings, the possible occurrence
of HDO emission also investigating off L1448-mm, towards the molecular outflow.
Methods: We carried out observations of L1448-mm in the HDO(1_10-1_11) line at
80.6 GHz, an excellent tracer of HDO column density, with the IRAM Plateau de
Bure Interferometer. Results: We image for the first time HDO emission around
L1448-mm. The HDO structure reveals a main clump at velocities close to the
ambient one towards the the continuum peak that is caused by the dust heated by
the protostar. In addition, the HDO map shows tentative weaker emission at
about 2000 AU from the protostar towards the south, which is possibly
associated with the walls of the outflow cavity opened by the protostellar
wind. Conclusions: Using an LVG code, modelling the density and temperature
profile of the hot-corino, and adopting a gas temperature of 100 K and a
density of 1.5 10^8 cm^-3, we derive a beam diluted HDO column density of about
7 10^13 cm^-2, corresponding to a HDO abundance of about 4 10^-7. In addition,
the present map supports the scenario where HDO can be efficiently produced in
shocked regions and not uniquely in hot corinos heated by the newly born star.
