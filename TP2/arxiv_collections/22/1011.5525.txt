In this short note, we construct mappings from one-dimensional integrable
spinor BECs to matrix nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and solve the
Bogoliubov equation of these systems. A map of spin-$n$ BEC is constructed from
the $2^n$-dimensional spinor representation of irreducible tensor operators of
$so(2n+1)$. Solutions of Bogoliubov equation are obtained with the aid of the
theory of squared Jost functions.
