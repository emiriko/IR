We compute the mass spectrum of the fermionic sector of the Dirac-Kaehler
extension of the SM (DK-SM) by showing that there exists a Bogoliubov
transformation that transforms the DK-SM into a flavor U(4) extension of the SM
(SM-4) with a particular choice of masses and mixing textures. Mass relations
of the model allow determination of masses of the 4th generation. Tree level
prediction for the mass of the 4th charged lepton is 370 GeV. The model selects
the normal hierarchy for neutrino masses and reproduces naturally the near
tri-bimaximal and quark mixing textures. The electron neutrino and the 4th
neutrino masses are related via a see-saw-like mechanism.
