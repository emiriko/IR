We consider in our work high quality single crystal thin films of Bi2Se3,
grown by molecular beam epitaxy, both with and without Pb doping. Our ARPES
data demonstrate topological surface states with a Fermi level lying inside the
bulk band gap in the Pb doped filims. Transport data show weak localization
behavior, as expected for a 2D system, but a detailed analysis within the
standard theoretical framework of diffusive transport shows that the
temperature and magnetic field dependences of resistance cannot be reconciled
in a theory that neglects inter-electron interactions. We demonstrate that an
excellent account of quantum corrections to conductivity is achieved when both
disorder and interaction are taken into account. These results clearly
demonstrate that it is crucial to include electron electron interaction for a
comprehensive understanding of diffusive transport in topological insulators.
