We reinterpret the generic CDF charged massive particle limit to obtain a
limit on the mass of a stable or long-lived gluino. Various sources of
uncertainty are examined. The $R$-hadron spectrum and scattering cross sections
are modeled based on known low-energy hadron physics and the resultant
uncertainties are quantified and found to be small compared to uncertainties
from the scale dependence of the NLO pQCD production cross sections. The
largest uncertainty in the limit comes from the unknown squark mass: when the
squark -- gluino mass splitting is small, we obtain a gluino mass limit of 407
GeV, while in the limit of heavy squarks the gluino mass limit is 397 GeV. For
arbitrary (degenerate) squark masses, we obtain a lower limit of 322 GeV on the
gluino mass. These limits apply for any gluino lifetime longer than $\sim 30$
ns, and are the most stringent limits for such a long-lived or stable gluino.
