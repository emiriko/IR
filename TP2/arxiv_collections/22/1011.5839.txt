We study Andreev reflection at an interface between a half metal and a
superconductor with spin-orbit interaction. While the absence of minority
carriers in the half metal makes singlet Andreev reflection impossible, the
spin-orbit interaction gives rise to triplet Andreev reflection, i.e., the
reflection of a majority electron into a majority hole or vice versa. As an
application of our calculation, we consider a thin half metal film or wire
laterally attached to a superconducting contact. If the half metal is disorder
free, an excitation gap is opened that is proportional to the spin-orbit
interaction strength in the superconductor. For electrons with energy below
this gap a lateral half-metal--superconductor contact becomes a perfect triplet
Andreev reflector. We show that the system supports localized Majorana end
states in this limit.
