We determine the dynamic magnetization induced in non-magnetic metal wedges
composed of silver, copper and platinum by means of Brillouin light scattering
(BLS) microscopy. The magnetization is transferred from a ferromagnetic
Ni80Fe20 layer to the metal wedge via the spin pumping effect. The spin pumping
efficiency can be controlled by adding an insulating but transparent interlayer
between the magnetic and non-magnetic layer. By comparing the experimental
results to a dynamical macroscopic spin-transport model we determine the
transverse relaxation time of the pumped spin current which is much smaller
than the longitudinal relaxation time.
