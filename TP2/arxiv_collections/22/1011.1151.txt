In this work we present some applications about the use of the so-called
Cosmography with GRBs. In particular, we try to calibrate the Amati relation by
using the luminosity distance obtained from the cosmographic analysis. Thus, we
analyze the possibility of use GRBs as possible estimators for the cosmological
parameters, obtaining as preliminary results a good estimate of the
cosmological density parameters, just by using a GRB data sample.
