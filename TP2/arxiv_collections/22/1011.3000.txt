Extending to 4 degrees of freedom a symplectomorphism used in attitude
dynamics it is shown in a direct way the connection between the 4-D isotropic
harmonic oscillator and the 3-D Kepler systems. This approach made transparent
that only when we refer to rectilinear solutions, the {\sl bilinear relation}
defining the KS transformation is needed.
