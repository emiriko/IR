In this research paper we address the importance of Product Data Management
(PDM) with respect to its contributions in industry. Moreover we also present
some currently available major challenges to PDM communities and targeting some
of these challenges we present an approach i.e. I-SOAS, and briefly discuss how
this approach can be helpful in solving the PDM community's faced problems.
Furthermore, limiting the scope of this research to one challenge, we focus on
the implementation of a semantic based search mechanism in PDM Systems. Going
into the details, at first we describe the respective field i.e. Language
Technology (LT), contributing towards natural language processing, to take
advantage in implementing a search engine capable of understanding the semantic
out of natural language based search queries. Then we discuss how can we
practically take advantage of LT by implementing its concepts in the form of
software application with the use of semantic web technology i.e. Ontology.
Later, in the end of this research paper, we briefly present a prototype
application developed with the use of concepts of LT towards semantic based
search.
