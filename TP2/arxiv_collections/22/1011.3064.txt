We explore the consequences of the mass generation due to the Higgs field in
strong gravity astrophysical environments. The vacuum expectation value of the
Higgs field is predicted to depend on the curvature of spacetime, potentially
giving rise to peculiar spectroscopic shifts, named hereafter "Higgs shifts."
Higgs shifts could be searched through dedicated multiwavelength and
multispecies surveys with high spatial and spectral resolution near strong
gravity sources such as Sagittarius A* or broad searches for signals due to
primordial black holes. The possible absence of Higgs shifts in these surveys
should provide limits to the coupling between the Higgs particle and the
curvature of spacetime, a topic of interest for a recently proposed
Higgs-driven inflationary model. We discuss some conceptual issues regarding
the coexistence between the Higgs mechanism and gravity, especially for their
different handling of fundamental and composite particles.
