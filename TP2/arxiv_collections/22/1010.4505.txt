Real-time detection of single electron tunneling through a T-shaped double
quantum dot is simulated, based on a Monte Carlo scheme. The double dot is
embedded in a dissipative environment and the presence of electrons on the
double dot is detected with a nearby quantum point contact. We demonstrate
directly the bunching behavior in electron transport, which leads eventually to
a super-Poissonian noise. Particularly, in the context of full counting
statistics, we investigate the essential difference between the dephasing
mechanisms induced by the quantum point contact detection and the coupling to
the external phonon bath. A number of intriguing noise features associated with
various transport mechanisms are revealed.
