Using the Resonance Chiral Theory Lagrangian, we perform a calculation of the
vector form factor of the pion at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in the 1/N(C)
expansion. Imposing the correct QCD short-distance constraints, one fixes the
amplitude in terms of the pion decay constant F and resonance masses. Its low
momentum expansion determines then the corresponding O(p4) and O(p6) low-energy
chiral couplings at NLO, keeping control of their renormalization scale
dependence. At mu0=0.77 GeV, we obtain L9(mu0) = (7.9 \pm 0.4) 10^{-3} and
C88(mu0)-C90(mu0)=(-4.6 \pm 0.4) 10^{-5}.
