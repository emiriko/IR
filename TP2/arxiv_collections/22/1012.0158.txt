This is a study of localised structures in one-dimensional cellular automata,
with the elementary cellular automaton Rule 54 as a guiding example.
  A formalism for particles on a periodic background is derived, applicable to
all one-dimensional cellular automata. One can compute which particles collide
and in how many ways. One can also compute the fate of a particle after an
unlimited number of collisions - whether they only produce other particles, or
the result is a growing structure that destroys the background pattern.
  For Rule 54, formulas for the four most common particles are given and all
two-particle collisions are found. We show that no other particles arise, which
particles are stable and which can be created, provided that only two particles
interact at a time. More complex behaviour of Rule 54 requires therefore
multi-particle collisions.
