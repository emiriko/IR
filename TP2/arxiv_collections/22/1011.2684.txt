Ap star magnetism is often attributed to fossil magnetic fields which have
not changed much since the pre-main-sequence epoch of the stars. Stable
magnetic field configurations are known which could persist probably for the
entire main-sequence life of the star, but they may not show the complexity and
diversity exhibited by the Ap stars observed. We suggest that the Ap star
magnetism is not a result of stable configurations, but is the result of an
instability based on strong toroidal magnetic fields buried in the stars. The
highly nonaxisymmetric remainders of the instability are reminiscent of the
diversity of fields seen on Ap stars. The strengths of these remnant magnetic
fields is actually between a few per cent up to considerable fractions of the
internal toroidal field; this means field strengths of the order of kGauss
being compatible with what is observed. The magnetic fields emerge at the
surface rather quickly; rough estimates deliver time-scales of the order of a
few years. Since rotation stabilizes the instability, normal A stars may still
host considerable, invisible toroidal magnetic fields.
