The main goal of these notes, compiled in 2008-2009, is to present a
more-or-less self-contained discussion of some of the recent results and
techniques of R. Berman and S. Boucksom in the setting of weighted
pluripotential theory. We include some background results on pluripotential
theory and weighted pluripotential theory, although many items are stated
without proof (references are provided). Although slightly dated and certainly
not error-free, we hope someone finds them helpful.
