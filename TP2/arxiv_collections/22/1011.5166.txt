We analyze theoretically the bound state spectrum of an Aharonov Bohm (AB)
ring in a two-dimensional topological insulator using the four-band model of
HgTe-quantum wells as a concrete example. We calculate analytically the
circular helical edge states and their spectrum as well as the bound states
evolving out of the bulk spectrum as a function of the applied magnetic flux
and dimension of the ring. We also analyze the spin-dependent persistent
currents, which can be used to measure the spin of single electrons. We further
take into account the Rashba spin-orbit interaction which mixes the spin states
and derive its effect on the ring spectrum. The flux tunability of the ring
states allows for coherent mixing of the edge- and the spin degrees of freedom
of bound electrons which could be exploited for quantum information processing
in topological insulator rings.
