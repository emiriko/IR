The transverse electron scattering response function of 3He was recently
studied by us in the quasi-elastic peak region for momentum transfers q between
500 and 700 MeV/c. Those results, obtained using the Active Nucleon Breit frame
(ANB), are here supplemented by calculations in the laboratory, Breit and ANB
frames using the two-fragment model discussed in our earlier work on the frame
dependence of the the longitudinal response function R_L(q,omega). We find
relatively frame independent results and good agreement with experiment
especially for the lower momentum transfers. This agreement occurs when we
neglect an omega-dependent piece of the one-body current relativistic
correction. An inclusion of this term leads however to a rather pronounced
frame dependence at q=700 MeV/c. A discussion of this term is given here. This
report also includes a correction to our previous ANB results for R_T(q,omega).
