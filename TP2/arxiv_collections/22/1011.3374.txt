We analyze multipartite entanglement in systems of spin-1/2 particles from a
relativistic perspective. General conditions which have to be met for any
classification of multipartite entanglement to be Lorentz invariant are
derived, which contributes to a physical understanding of entanglement
classification. We show that quantum information in a relativistic setting
requires the partition of the Hilbert space into particles to be taken
seriously. Furthermore, we study exemplary cases and show how the spin and
momentum entanglement transforms relativistically in a multipartite setting.
