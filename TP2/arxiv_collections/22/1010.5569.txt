SAGAs calculi (or simply SAGAs) have been proposed by Bruni et al. as a model
for long-running transactions. The approach therein can be considered static,
while a dynamic approach has been proposed by Lanese and Zavattaro. In this
paper we first extend both static SAGAs (in the centralized interruption
policy) and dynamic SAGAs to deal with nesting, then we compare the two
approaches.
