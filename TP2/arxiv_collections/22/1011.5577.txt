We present in this study a mapping of the optical turbulence (OT) above
different astronomical sites. The mesoscale model Meso-NH was used together
with the Astro-Meso-Nh package and a set of diagnostic tools allowing for a
full 3D investigation of the Cn2. The diagnostics implemented in the
Astro-Meso-Nh, allowing for a full 3D investigation of the OT structure in a
volumetric space above different sites, are presented. To illustrate the
different diagnostics and their potentialities, we investigated one night and
looked at instantaneous fields of meteorologic and astroclimatic parameters. To
show the potentialities of this tool for applications in an Observatory we ran
the model above sites with very different OT distributions: the antarctic
plateau (Dome C, Dome A, South Pole) and a mid-latitude site (Mt. Graham,
Arizona). We put particular emphasis on the 2D maps of integrated astroclimatic
parameters (seeing, isoplanatic angles) calculated in different slices at
different heights in the troposhere. This is an useful tool of prediction and
investigation of the turbulence structure. It can support the optimization of
the AO, GLAO and MCAO systems running at the focus of the ground-based
telescopes.From this studies it emerges that the astronomical sites clearly
present different OT behaviors. Besides, our tool allowed us for discriminating
these sites.
