The possible role of magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and its driven MHD
turbulence in the solar interior is studied on the basis of the linear and
nonlinear theories coupling with physical parameters, providing solar rotation
profile inverted from the helioseismic observation and a standard model for the
internal structure of the sun. We find that the MRI venue is confined to the
higher-latitude tachocline and lower-latitude near-surface shear layer. It is
especially interesting that the MRI-active region around the tachocline closely
overlaps with the area indicating a steep entropy rise which is required from
the thermal wind balance in the sun. This suggests that the MRI-driven
turbulence plays a crucial role in maintaining the thermal wind balance in the
sun via the exceptional turbulent heating and equatorward angular momentum
transports. The warm pole existing around the tachocline might be a natural
outcome of the turbulent activities energized by the MRI.
