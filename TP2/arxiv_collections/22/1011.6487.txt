We study a one--dimensional Ising spin systems with ferromagnetic,
long--range interaction decaying as $n^{-2+\a}$, $\a \in [0,\frac 12]$, in the
presence of external random fields. We assume that the random fields are given
by a collection of symmetric, independent, identically distributed real random
variables, gaussian or subgaussian with variance $\theta$. We show that for
temperature and variance of the randomness small enough, with an overwhelming
probability with respect to the random fields, the typical configurations,
within volumes centered at the origin whose size grow faster than any power of
$\th^{-1}$, % {\bf around the origin} are intervals of $+$ spins followed by
intervals of $-$ spins whose typical length is $ \simeq
\th^{-\frac{2}{(1-2\a)}}$ for $0\le \a<1/2$ and $\simeq e^{\frac 1 {\th^{2}}}$
for $\a=1/2$.
