We consider a family of non-evolutionary partial differential equations known
as Holm - Staley b - family which includes the integrable Camassa-Holm and
Degasperis-Procesi equations. We show that the solution map is not uniformly
continuous. The proof relies on a construction of smooth periodic travelling
waves with small amplitude.
