During the outburst of V713 Cephei in August 2009 the times of 8 eclipses
were measured and these, together with 5 eclipse timings obtained during
quiescence in August 2007, provide an improved orbital period of
0.085418432(4)d. No superhumps were observed in the light curve indicating this
was a normal UG-type dwarf nova outburst. We found the eclipse depth decreased
linearly with rising system excitation level, falling from ~3 magnitudes in
quiescence to ~2 magnitudes during outburst. The depth and totality of eclipses
in quiescence suggests a high orbital inclination. We saw no variation in the
FWHM of eclipses between quiescence and outburst despite a significant change
in shape of the eclipse profile.
