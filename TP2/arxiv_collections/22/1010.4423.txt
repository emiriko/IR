Graphs and graph transformation systems are a frequently used modelling
technique for a wide range of different domains, cover- ing areas as diverse as
refactorings, network topologies or reconfigurable software. Being a formal
method, graph transformation systems lend themselves to a formal analysis. This
has inspired the development of various verification methods, in particular
also model checking tools. In this paper, we present a verification technique
for infinite-state graph transformation systems. The technique employs the
abstraction principle used in shape analysis of programs, summarising possibly
infinitely many nodes thus giving shape graphs. The technique has been
implemented using the 3-valued logical foundations of standard shape analysis.
We exemplify the approach on an example from the railway domain.
