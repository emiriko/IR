I describe the various elements of the NASA Science Mission Directorate's
Astrophysics Division Research and Analysis Program and provide quantitative
descriptions for factors such as proposal submission characteristics, proposal
success rates, distribution of science areas for selected proposals, as well as
funding distributions for the various program elements. I examine the variation
of these factors with time to explore possible trends. The measures described
here can be used as starting points for future discussions about issues related
to balance within the astronomy and astrophysics research and analysis program.
