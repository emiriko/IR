We study the quantum-confined Stark effect in single InAs/GaAs quantum dots
embedded within a AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. By significantly increasing
the barrier height we can observe emission from a dot at electric fields of
-500 kV/cm, leading to Stark shifts of up to 25 meV. Our results suggest this
technique may enable future applications that require self-assembled dots with
transitions at the same energy.
