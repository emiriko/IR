The role of coherent population oscillations is evidenced in the noise
spectrum of an ultra-low noise lasers. This effect is isolated in the intensity
noise spectrum of an optimized single-frequency vertical external cavity
surface emitting laser. The coherent population oscillations induced by the
lasing mode manifest themselves through their associated dispersion that leads
to slow light effects probed by the spontaneous emission present in the
non-lasing side modes.
