The seminal theorem of Cobham has given rise during the last 40 years to a
lot of works around non-standard numeration systems and has been extended to
many contexts. In this paper, as a result of fifteen years of improvements, we
obtain a complete and general version for the so-called substitutive sequences.
Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be two multiplicatively independent Perron numbers.
Then, a sequence $x\in A^\mathbb{N}$, where $A$ is a finite alphabet, is both
$\alpha$-substitutive and $\beta$-substitutive if and only if $x$ is ultimately
periodic.
