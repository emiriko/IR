We consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the difference equations
of the form $x(n+1)=Ax(n) + \sum_{k=0}^n B(n-k)x(k) + y(n)$ in a Banach space
$\X$, where $n=0,1,2,...$; $A,B(n)$ are linear bounded operator in $\X$. Our
method of study is based on the concept of spectrum of a unilateral sequence.
The obtained results on asymptotic stability and almost periodicity are stated
in terms of spectral properties of the equation and its solutions. To this end,
a relation between the Z-transform and spectrum of a unilateral sequence is
established. The main results extend previous ones.
