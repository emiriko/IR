Bounds on the expansion coefficients of the strangeness changing $K\pi$ form
factors were derived recently from analyticity and unitarity, using as input
suitable correlation functions calculated by perturbative QCD in the Euclidian
region. We investigate two types of invariant amplitudes and their
corresponding dispersion relations, and show that they lead to similar results
for the shape of the vector and scalar $K_{\ell 3}$ form factors.
