The effect of a constant electric field on two-photon absorption in a direct
band gap semiconductor is calculated using an independent-particle theory. Two
band structure models for GaAs are used: a two-band parabolic model and an
eight-band "k dot p" model. Both predict a strong dependence of the two-photon
electroabsorption spectrum on the polarization of the light with respect to the
constant field. We attribute the polarization dependence to the strong effect
of a constant field on intraband dynamics.
