We investigate the dynamical mode population statistics and associated first-
and second-order coherence of an interacting bosonic two-mode model when the
pair-exchange coupling is quenched from negative to positive values. It is
shown that for moderately rapid second-order transitions, a new pair-coherent
phase emerges on the positive coupling side in an excited state, which is not
fragmented as the ground-state single-particle density matrix would prescribe
it to be.
