We have studied the effect of metastable, irreversibility induced by repeated
thermal cycles on the electric transport and magnetization of polycrystalline
samples of La1-xCaxMnO3 (0.48\leq x \leq 0.55) close to charge ordering. With
time and thermal cycling (T<300 K) there is an irreversible transformation of
the low-temperature phase from a partially ferromagnetic and metallic to one
that is less ferromagnetic and highly resistive for the composition close to
charge ordering (x=050 and 0.52). Irrespective of the actual ground state of
the compound, the effect of thermal cycling is towards an increase of the
amount of the insulating phase. We have observed the magnetic relaxation in the
metastable state and also the revival of the metastable state (in a relaxed
sample) due to high temperature thermal treatment. We observed changes in the
resistivity and magnetization as the revived metastable state is cycled. The
time changes in the magnetization are logarithmic in general and activation
energies are consistent with those expected for electron transfer between Mn
ions. Changes induced by thermal cycling can be inhibited by applying magnetic
field. These results suggest that oxygen non-stoichiometry results in
mechanical strains in this two-phase system, leading to the development of
frustrated metastable states which relax towards the more stable charge-ordered
and antiferromagnetic microdomains. Our results also suggest that the growth
and coexistence of phases gives rise to microstructural tracks and strain
accommodation, producing the observed irreversibility.
