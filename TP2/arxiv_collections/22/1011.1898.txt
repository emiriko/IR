A versatile stroboscopic technique based on active phase-locking of a surface
acoustic wave to picosecond laser pulses is used to monitor dynamic
acoustoelectric effects. Time-integrated multi-channel detection is applied to
probe the modulation of the emission of a quantum well for different
frequencies of the surface acoustic wave. For quantum posts we resolve
dynamically controlled generation of neutral and charged excitons and
preferential injection of holes into localized states within the nanostructure.
