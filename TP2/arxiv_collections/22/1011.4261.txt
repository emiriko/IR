Conformal low-spin anomalous currents and shadow fields in flat space-time of
dimension greater than or equal to four are studied. Gauge invariant
formulation for such currents and shadow fields is developed. Gauge symmetries
are realized by involving Stueckelberg and auxiliary fields. Gauge invariant
differential constraints for anomalous currents and shadow fields and
realization of global conformal symmetries are obtained. Gauge invariant
two-point vertices for anomalous shadow fields are also obtained. In
Stueckelberg gauge frame, these gauge invariant vertices become the standard
two-point vertices of CFT. Light-cone gauge two-point vertices of the anomalous
shadow fields are derived. AdS/CFT correspondence for anomalous currents and
shadow fields and the respective normalizable and non-normalizable solutions of
massive low-spin AdS fields is studied. The bulk fields are considered in
modified de Donder gauge that leads to decoupled equations of motion. We
demonstrate that leftover on-shell gauge symmetries of bulk massive fields
correspond to gauge symmetries of boundary anomalous currents and shadow
fields, while the modified (Lorentz) de Donder gauge conditions for bulk
massive fields correspond to differential constraints for boundary anomalous
currents and shadow fields.
