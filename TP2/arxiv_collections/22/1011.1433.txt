We construct new non-stationary cosmological solutions to five-dimensional
minimal supergravity that don't have any tri-holomorphic U(1) isometries. Our
new solutions, in part, contain some of the previously constructed solutions to
the minimal supergravity. The c-function of solutions shows monotonic
increasing/decreasing behaviour in time, in agreement with the expected
behaviour of c-function in spacetimes with positive cosmological constant.
