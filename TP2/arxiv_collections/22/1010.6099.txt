We report the capacitive spring softening effect observed in single-walled
carbon nanotube (SWNT) nanoelectromechanical (NEM) resonators. The nanotube
resonators adopt dual-gate configuration with both bottom-gate and side-gate
capable of tuning the resonance frequency through capacitive coupling.
Interestingly, downward resonance frequency shifting is observed with
increasing side-gate voltage, which can be attributed to the capacitive
softening of spring constant. Furthermore, in-plane vibrational modes exhibit
much stronger spring softening effect than out-of-plan modes. Our dual-gate
design should enable the differentiation between these two types of vibrational
modes, and open up new possibility for nonlinear operation of nanotube
resonators.
