In this work, we theoretically construct exact mappings of many-particle
bosonic systems onto quantum rotor models. In particular, we analyze the rotor
representation of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. In a previous work it was
shown that there is an exact mapping of a spin-one condensate of fixed particle
number with quadratic Zeeman interaction onto a quantum rotor model. Since the
rotor model has an unbounded spectrum from above, it has many more eigenstates
than the original bosonic model. Here we show that for each subset of states
with fixed spin F_z, the physical rotor eigenstates are always those with
lowest energy. We classify three distinct physical limits of the rotor model:
the Rabi, Josephson, and Fock regimes. The last regime corresponds to a
fragmented condensate and is thus not captured by the Bogoliubov theory. We
next consider the semiclassical limit of the rotor problem and make connections
with the quantum wave functions through use of the Husimi distribution
function. Finally, we describe how to extend the analysis to higher-spin
systems and derive a rotor model for the spin-two condensate. Theoretical
details of the rotor mapping are also provided here.
