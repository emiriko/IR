A proof of concept detector is presented for scintillation light detection in
liquid argon using Silicon Photo-Multipliers. The aim of the work is to build
an anti-Compton veto for germanium detectors operated directly in liquid argon
like in the GERDA experiment. Properties of the Multi-Pixel Photon Counter
(MPPC) are studied at cryogenic temperatures. To increase the light collection
efficiency of the MPPCs wavelength shifting fibers were used. A veto efficiency
comparable to a similar setup with a Photo-Multiplier Tube was achieved.
