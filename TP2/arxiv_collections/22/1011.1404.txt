We survey the lepton flavor violation branching ratios Br(mu->e,gamma),
Br(tau->mu,gamma), and Br(tau->e,gamma) in mSUGRA for a broad class of lepton
mass matrix textures that give nearly tribimaximal lepton mixing. Small
neutrino masses are generated by the type-I seesaw mechanism with
non-degenerate right-handed neutrino masses. The textures exhibit a
hierarchical mass pattern and can be understood from flavor models giving rise
to large leptonic mixing. We study the branching ratios for the most general
CP-violating forms of the textures. It is demonstrated that the branching
ratios can be enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude as compared to the
CP-conserving case. The branching ratios exhibit, however, a strong dependence
on the choice of the phases in the Lagrangian which affects the significance of
flavor models. In particular, for general CP-phases, the lepton flavor
violating rates appear to be essentially uncorrelated with the possible high-
and low-energy lepton mixing parameters, such as the reactor angle.
