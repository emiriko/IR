Thermophoresis is a tool often applied in complex plasma experiments. One of
the usual stated benefits over other experimental tools is that changes induced
by thermophoresis neither directly depend on, nor directly influence, the
plasma parameters. From electronic data, plasma emission profiles in the
sheath, and Langmuir probe data in the plasma bulk, we conclude that this
assumption does not hold. An important effect on the levitation of dust
particles in argon plasma is observed as well. The reason behind the changes in
plasma parameters seems to be the change in neutral atom density accompanying
the increased gas temperature while running at constant pressure.
