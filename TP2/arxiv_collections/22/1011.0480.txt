Recent developments on the determination of the spin-1/2 spectrum of the
nucleon in full QCD are presented. Our focus is on the PACS-CS 2+1 flavor
configurations made available through the ILDG. Using correlation matrix
techniques, in which a wide variety of gauge-invariant Gaussian-smeared
fermion-propagator sources and sinks are considered, excited states are
determined. We consider several correlation matrices of various sizes, each
constructed with a different set of basis interpolators, in order to
demonstrate the invariance of the eigenstates on the basis choice. Of
particular interest is the approach to the elusive Roper resonance and we
report preliminary results in full QCD.
