Motivated by recent experiments on interacting cold atoms, we analyze
interaction quenches in Luttinger liquids (LL), where the interaction is ramped
from zero to a finite value within a finite time. The fermionic single particle
density matrix reveals several regions of spatial and temporal coordinates
relative to the quench time, termed as Fermi liquid, sudden quench LL,
adiabatic LL regimes, and a LL regime with time dependent exponent. The various
regimes can also be observed in the momentum distribution of the fermions,
directly accessible through time of flight experiments. Most of our results
apply to arbitrary quench protocols.
