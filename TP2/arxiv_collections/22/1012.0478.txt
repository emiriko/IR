We indicated in our previous work that for QED the role of the scalar
potential which appears at the loop level is much smaller than that of the
vector potential and in fact negligible. But the situation is different for
QCD, one reason is that the loop effects are more significant because
$\alpha_s$ is much larger than $\alpha$, and secondly the non-perturbative QCD
effects may induce a sizable scalar potential. In this work, we
phenomenologically study the contribution of the scalar potential to the
spectra of charmonia, bottomonia and $b\bar c(\bar b c)$ family. Taking into
account both vector and scalar potentials, by fitting the well measured
charmonia and bottomonia spectra, we re-fix the relevant parameters and test
them by calculating other states of not only the charmonia, bottomonia, but
also further the $b\bar c$ family. We also consider the Lamb shift of the
spectra.
