Radiative feedback and magnetic field are understood to have a strong impact
on the protostellar collapse. We present high resolution numerical calculations
of the collapse of a 1 solar mass dense core in solid body rotation, including
both radiative transfer and magnetic field. Using typical parameters for
low-mass cores, we study thoroughly the effect of radiative transfer and
magnetic field on the first core formation and fragmentation. We show that
including the two aforementioned physical processes does not correspond to the
simple picture of adding them separately. The interplay between the two is
extremely strong, via the magnetic braking and the radiation from the accretion
shock.
