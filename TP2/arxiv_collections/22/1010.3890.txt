We analyze theoretically the influence of backward propagating waves on the
primary threshold when a linearly polarized light impinges at normal incidence
on a planarly aligned nematic liquid crystal films. We show, that the primary
threshold, as a function of the phase delay induced by the nematic layer,
exhibits oscillations. The amplitude of oscillations depends strongly on the
drop of the refractivity indices of the nematic and outer media at the
boundaries.
