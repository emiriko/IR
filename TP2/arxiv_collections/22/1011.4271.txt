We introduce a new experimental approach to study the structural transitions
of large numbers of nanoparticle-coated droplets as their volume is reduced. We
use an emulsion system where the dispersed phase is slightly soluble in the
continuous phase. By adding a fixed amount of unsaturated continuous phase, the
volume of the droplets can be controllably reduced, causing them to buckle or
crumple, thereby becoming nonspherical. The resultant morphologies depend both
on the extent of volume reduction and the average droplet size. The buckling
and crumpling behavior implies that the droplet surfaces are solid.
