The detection of exclusive processes induced by antiproton beams in the GeV
range at PANDA(FAIR) opens possibilities for testing QCD predictions on the
nucleon structure. In particular, the measurement of electromagnetic nucleon
form factors through the proton-antiproton annihilation in a lepton pair can be
studied. However, other processes, although interesting by themselves, play the
role of background. We will focus on two examples: an 'electromagnetic
process', the S-channel annihilation of proton and antiproton into a neutral
pion and a virtual photon (followed by lepton pair emission) and a possible
mechanism for the production of kaon and pion pairs, through physical vacuum
excitations.
