We study the quantum walk search algorithm of Shenvi, Kempe and Whaley [PRA
67 052307 (2003)] on data structures of one to two spatial dimensions, on which
the algorithm is thought to be less efficient than in three or more spatial
dimensions. Our aim is to understand why the quantum algorithm is dimension
dependent whereas the best classical algorithm is not, and to show in more
detail how the efficiency of the quantum algorithm varies with spatial
dimension or accessibility of the data. Our numerical results agree with the
expected scaling in 2D of $O(\sqrt{N \log N})$, and show how the prefactors
display significant dependence on both the degree and symmetry of the graph.
Specifically, we see, as expected, the prefactor of the time complexity
dropping as the degree (connectivity) of the structure is increased.
