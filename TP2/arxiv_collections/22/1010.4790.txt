The morphological scaling properties of linear polymer films grown by vapor
deposition polymerization (VDP) are studied by 1+1D Monte Carlo simulations.
The model implements the basic processes of random angle ballistic deposition
($F$), free-monomer diffusion ($D$) and monomer adsorption along with the
dynamical processes of polymer chain initiation, extension, and merger. The
ratio $G=D/F$ is found to have a strong influence on the polymer film
morphology. Spatial and temporal behavior of kinetic roughening has been
extensively studied using finite-length scaling and height-height correlations
$H(r,t)$. The scaling analysis has been performed within the no-overhang
approximation and the scaling behaviors at local and global length scales were
found to be very different. The global and local scaling exponents for
morphological evolution have been evaluated for varying free-monomer diffusion
by growing the films at $G$ = $10$, $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4$ and fixing the
deposition flux $F$. With an increase in $G$ from $10$ to $10^4$, the average
growth exponent $\beta \approx 0.50$ was found to be invariant, where as the
global roughness exponent $\alpha_{g}$ decreased from $0.87(1)$ to $0.73(1)$
along with a corresponding decrease in the global dynamic exponent $z_g$ from
$1.71(1)$ to $1.38(2)$. The global scaling exponents were observed to follow
the dynamic scaling hypothesis, $z_g=\alpha_{g}/\beta$. With a similar increase
in $G$ however, the average local roughness exponent ${\alpha_{l}}$ remained
close to $0.46$ and the anomalous growth exponent ${\beta}_{\ast}$ decreased
from 0.23(4) to 0.18(8). The interfaces display anomalous scaling and
multiscaling in the relevant height-height correlations. The variation of
$H(r,t)$ with deposition time $t$ indicates non-stationary growth.
