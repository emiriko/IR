The bispectrum vanishes for linear Gaussian fields and is thus a sensitive
probe of non-linearities and non-Gaussianities in the cosmic density field.
Hence, a detection of the bispectrum in the halo density field would enable
tight constraints on non-Gaussian processes in the early Universe and allow
inference of the dynamics driving inflation. We present a tree level derivation
of the halo bispectrum arising from non-linear clustering, non-linear biasing
and primordial non-Gaussianity. A diagrammatic description is developed to
provide an intuitive understanding of the contributing terms and their
dependence on scale, shape and the non-Gaussianity parameter fNL. We compute
the terms based on a multivariate bias expansion and the peak-background split
method and show that non-Gaussian modifications to the bias parameters lead to
amplifications of the tree level bispectrum that were ignored in previous
studies. Our results are in a good agreement with published simulation
measurements of the halo bispectrum. Finally, we estimate the expected signal
to noise on fNL and show that the constraint obtainable from the bispectrum
analysis significantly exceeds the one obtainable from the power spectrum
analysis.
