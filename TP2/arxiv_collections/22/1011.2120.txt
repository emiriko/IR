Bound information, a cryptographic classical analogue of bound entanglement,
is defined as classical secret correlations from which no secret key can be
extracted. Its existence was conjectured and shown in a multipartite case. In
this work, we provide a new example of bound information in a four-partite
scenario. Later, using this example, we prove that bound information can be
superactivated in a finite-copy scenario and unlockable. We also show that
bound entangled states (bound information) can be used to distribute
multipartite pure-state entanglement (secret key).
