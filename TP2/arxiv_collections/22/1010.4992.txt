The quantum Monte Carlo methods represent a powerful and broadly applicable
computational tool for finding very accurate solutions of the stationary
Schroedinger equation for atoms, molecules, solids and a variety of model
systems. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel and are able to take full
advantage of the present-day high-performance computing systems. This review
article concentrates on the fixed-node/fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo method
with emphasis on its applications to electronic structure of solids and other
extended many-particle systems.
