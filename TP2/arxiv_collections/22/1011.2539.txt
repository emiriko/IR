A molecular sieve for hydrogen is presented based on a carbon nanotube
intramolecular junction and a $C_{60}$. The small interspace formed between
$C_{60}$ and junction provides a size changeable channel for the
permselectivity of hydrogen while blocking $Ne$ and $Ar$. The sieving mechanism
is due to the high compressibility of hydrogen.
