The well-known Ising model used in statistical physics was adapted to a
social dynamics context to simulate the adoption of a technological innovation.
The model explicitly combines (a) an individual's perception of the advantages
of an innovation and (b) social influence from members of the decision-maker's
social network. The micro-level adoption dynamics are embedded into an
agent-based model that allows exploration of macro-level patterns of technology
diffusion throughout systems with different configurations (number and
distributions of early adopters, social network topologies). In the present
work we carry out many numerical simulations. We find that when the gap between
the individual's perception of the options is high, the adoption speed
increases if the dispersion of early adopters grows. Another test was based on
changing the network topology by means of stochastic connections to a common
opinion reference (hub), which resulted in an increment in the adoption speed.
Finally, we performed a simulation of competition between options for both
regular and small world networks.
