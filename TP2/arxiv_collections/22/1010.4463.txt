We discuss the possibility of quantum entanglement for pairs of charged
particles produced in high-energy $pp$-collisions at the LHC. Using a framework
of interacting Wilson lines, we calculate 2-D and 1-D two-particle angular
correlation functions in terms of the differences of the pseudorapidities and
azimuthal angles of the produced particles. The calculated near-side angular
correlation shows a localized maximum around $\Delta\phi \approx 0$, though it
is less pronounced compared to the peak observed by the CMS Collaboration. We
argue that this soft correlation is universal and insensitive to the specific
properties of the matter (quark-gluon plasma, QCD vacuum, etc.) used to
describe hadronic states---though such properties can be included to further
improve the results.
