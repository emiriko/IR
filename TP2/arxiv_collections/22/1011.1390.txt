Assume that the coefficients of a polynomial in a complex variable are
Laurent polynomials in some complex parameters. The parameter space (a complex
torus) splits into strata corresponding to different combinations of
coincidence of the roots of the polynomial. For generic Laurent polynomials
with fixed Newton polyhedra the Euler characteristics of these strata are also
fixed. We provide explicit formulae for the Euler characteristics of the strata
in terms of the polyhedra of the Laurent polynomials in the cases of degrees 2
and 3. We also obtain some corollaries in combinatorial geometry, which follows
from two different ways of computing the Euler characteristic of the
bifurcation set for a reduced polynomial of degree 2.
