We study the AC optical and hall conductivities of Dp/Dq-branes intersections
in the probe approximation and use sum-rules to study various associated
transport coefficients. We determine that the presence of massive fundamental
matter, as compared to massless fundamental matter described holographically by
a theory with no dimensional defects, reduces the plasma frequency. We further
show that this is not the case when the brane intersections include defects. We
discuss in detail how to implement correctly the regularization of retarded
Green's functions so that the dispersion relations are satisfied and the low
energy behaviour of the system is physically realistic.
