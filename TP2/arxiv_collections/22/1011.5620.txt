When pressure is not negligible in comparison with energy density, the
external gravitational field and the motion of particles in it are modified.
For spherically symmetric body two effective mass parameters determine the
external gravitational field and the motion of particles in it. For distances
much larger than the gravitational radius we use the linearized Einstein
equations to consider the effects of pressure on test particle motion.
