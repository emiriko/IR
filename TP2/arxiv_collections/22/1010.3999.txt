The Island of Inversion nucleus 32Mg has been studied by a (t,p) two neutron
transfer reaction in inverse kinematics at REX-ISOLDE. The shape coexistent
excited 0+ state in 32Mg has been identified by the characteristic angular
distribution of the protons of the DeltaL = 0 transfer. The excitation energy
of 1058 keV is much lower than predicted by any theoretical model. The low
gamma-ray intensity observed for the decay of this 0+ state indicates a
lifetime of more than 10 ns. Deduced spectroscopic amplitudes are compared with
occupation numbers from shell model calculations.
