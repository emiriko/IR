A systematic multiple hypothesis testing approach is applied to the search
for astrophysical sources of high energy neutrinos. The method is based on the
maximisation of the detection power maintaining the control of the confidence
level of an hypothetical discovery. This is achieved by using the so-called
"False Discovery Rate" (FDR) controlling procedure. It has the advantage to be
independent of the signal modelling and to naturally take into account the
trial factor. Moreover it is well suited to the detection of multiple sources.
