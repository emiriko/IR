We extend Krivine's strict positivstellensatz for usual (real multivariate)
polynomials to symmetric matrix polynomials with scalar constraints. The proof
is an elementary computation with Schur complements. Analogous extensions of
Schm\" udgen's and Putinar's strict positivstellensatz were recently proved by
Hol and Scherer using methods from optimization theory.
