Finite-resolution digital receiver is recently considered as a potential way
to Ultra Wide Band (UWB) communication systems due to its ability of mitigating
the challenge of Analog-Digital Converter (ADC). In this paper, the effects of
narrowband interference (NBI) are investigated when finite-resolution digital
receiver is used for Impulse Radio-UWB (IR-UWB) system. It is shown that
finite-resolution receiver enlarges the impact of NBI. The lower resolution of
the UWB receiver is, the more degradations NBI causes.
