A direct connection is proved between the Non-Abelian Bianchi Identities and
the Abelian Bianchi identities for the 't Hooft tensor in a generic gauge; the
existence of a magnetic current is related to the violation of NABI's. Using
this relation it is shown that not all gauges are equivalent to detect
monopoles on the lattice, that e.g. the Maximal Abelian Gauge is a legitimate
choice while the Landau gauge is not. Nevertheless monopole condensation is
found to be a gauge invariant property.
