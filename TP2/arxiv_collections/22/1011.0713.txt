A system of identical bosons with short-range (contact) interactions is
studied. Their motion is confined to one dimension by a tight lateral trapping
potential and, additionally, subject to a weak harmonic confinement in the
longitudinal direction. Finite delay time associated with penetration of
quantum particles through each other in the course of a pairwise
one-dimensional collision in the presence of the longitudinal potential makes
the system non-integrable and, hence, provides a mechanism for relaxation to
thermal equilibrium. To analyse this effect quantitatively in the limit of a
non-degenerate gas, we develop a system of kinetic equations and solve it for
small-amplitude monopole oscillations of the gas. The obtained damping rate is
long enough to be neglected in a realistic cold-atom experiment, and therefore
longitudinal trapping does not hinder integrable dynamics of atomic gases in
the 1D regime.
