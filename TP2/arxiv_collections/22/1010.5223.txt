This paper examines historical patterns of ROA (return on assets) for a
cohort of 53,038 publicly traded firms across 93 countries, measured over the
past 45 years. Our goal is to screen for firms whose ROA trajectories suggest
that they have systematically outperformed their peer groups over time. Such a
project faces at least three statistical difficulties: adjustment for relevant
covariates, massive multiplicity, and longitudinal dependence. We conclude
that, once these difficulties are taken into account, demonstrably superior
performance appears to be quite rare. We compare our findings with other recent
management studies on the same subject, and with the popular literature on
corporate success. Our methodological contribution is to propose a new class of
priors for use in large-scale simultaneous testing. These priors are based on
the hypergeometric inverted-beta family, and have two main attractive features:
heavy tails and computational tractability. The family is a four-parameter
generalization of the normal/inverted-beta prior, and is the natural conjugate
prior for shrinkage coefficients in a hierarchical normal model. Our results
emphasize the usefulness of these heavy-tailed priors in large multiple-testing
problems, as they have a mild rate of tail decay in the marginal likelihood
$m(y)$---a property long recognized to be important in testing.
