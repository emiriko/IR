Elastic waves with transverse polarization inside incidence plane can create
longitudinal surface wave (LSW) after reflection from a free surface. At a
critical incidence angle this LSW accumulates energy density, which can be
orders of magnitude higher than energy density of the incident transverse wave.
A specially arranged vessel for storage of ultracold neutrons (UCN) can be used
to verify this effect.
