We propose a method to generate analytical quantum Bell inequalities based on
the principle of Macroscopic Locality. By imposing locality over binary
processings of virtual macroscopic intensities, we establish a correspondence
between Bell inequalities and quantum Bell inequalities in bipartite scenarios
with dichotomic observables. We discuss how to improve the latter approximation
and how to extend our ideas to scenarios with more than two outcomes per
setting.
