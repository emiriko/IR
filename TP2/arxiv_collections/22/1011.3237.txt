Recent work shows not only the necessity of a 1/N_c expansion to explain the
observed mass spectrum of the lightest baryons, but also that at least two
distinct large N_c expansions, in which quarks transform under either the color
fundamental or the two-index antisymmetric representation of SU(N_c), work
comparably well. Here we show that the baryon magnetic moments do not support
this ambivalence; they strongly prefer the color-fundamental 1/N_c expansion,
providing experimental evidence that nature decisively distinguishes among
1/N_c expansions for this observable.
