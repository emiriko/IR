The radial velocity (RV) method for detecting extrasolar planets has been the
most successful to date. The RV signal imprinted by a few Earth-mass planet
around a cool star is at the limit of the typical single measurement
uncertainty obtained using state-of-the-art spectrographs. This requires
relying on statistics in order to unearth signals buried below noise. Artifacts
introduced by observing cadences can produce spurious signals or mask genuine
planets that should be easily detected otherwise. Here we discuss a
particularly confusing statistical degeneracy resulting from the yearly
aliasing of the first eccentric harmonic of an already-detected planet. This
problem came sharply into focus after the recent announcement of the detection
of a 3.1 Earth mass planet candidate in the habitable zone of the nearby low
mass star GJ 581. The orbital period of the new candidate planet (GJ 581g)
corresponds to an alias of the first eccentric harmonic of a previously
reported planet, GJ 581d. Although the star is stable, the combination of the
observing cadence and the presence of multiple planets can cause period
misinterpretations. In this work, we determine whether the detection of GJ 581g
is justified given this degeneracy. We also discuss the implications of our
analysis for the recent Bayesian studies of the same data set, which failed to
confirm the existence of the new planet. Performing a number of statistical
tests, we show that, despite some caveats, the existence of GJ 581g remains the
most likely orbital solution to the currently available RV data.
