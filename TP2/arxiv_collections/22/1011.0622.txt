I compute Polyakov loop, the deconfinement order parameter, for SU(2) lattice
gauge theory using the fixed scale approach for several different scales and
show how to obtain a renormalized physical order parameter. The generalization
to other gauge theories, including quenched or full QCD, is straightforward.
