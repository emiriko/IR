This is the third installment of the Financial Bubble Experiment. Here we
provide the digital fingerprint of an electronic document in which we identify
27 bubbles in 27 different global assets; for 25 of these assets, we present
windows of dates of the most likely ending time of each bubble. We will provide
that document of the original analysis on 2 May 2011.
