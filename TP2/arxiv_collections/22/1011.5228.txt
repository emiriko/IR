We present a simple and transparent method to study custodial symmetry in the
Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. The method allows to formulate the basis independent,
sufficient and necessary, conditions for the custodial symmetry of the scalar
potential. The relation between the custodial transformation and CP is
discussed and clarified.
