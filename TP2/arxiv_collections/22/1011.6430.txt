We introduce a new criterion, replacement freeness, to discern the relative
expressiveness of process calculi. Intuitively, a calculus is strongly
replacement free if replacing, within an enclosing context, a process that
cannot perform any visible action by an arbitrary process never inhibits the
capability of the resulting process to perform a visible action. We prove that
there exists no compositional and interaction sensitive encoding of a not
strongly replacement free calculus into any strongly replacement free one. We
then define a weaker version of replacement freeness, by only considering
replacement of closed processes, and prove that, if we additionally require the
encoding to preserve name independence, it is not even possible to encode a non
replacement free calculus into a weakly replacement free one. As a consequence
of our encodability results, we get that many calculi equipped with priority
are not replacement free and hence are not encodable into mainstream calculi
like CCS and pi-calculus, that instead are strongly replacement free. We also
prove that variants of pi-calculus with match among names, pattern matching or
polyadic synchronization are only weakly replacement free, hence they are
separated both from process calculi with priority and from mainstream calculi.
