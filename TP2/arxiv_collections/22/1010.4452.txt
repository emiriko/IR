Motions of stars in close binary systems with a conservative mass exchange
are examined. It is shown that Paczynski-Huang model widely used now for
obtaining the semi-major axis variation of a relative stars orbit is incorrect,
because it brings about large mistakes. A new model suitable for elliptical
orbits of stars is proposed. Both of reactive and attractive forces between
stars and a substance of the flowing jet are taken into account. A possibility
of a mass exchange at presence of accretion disk is considered
