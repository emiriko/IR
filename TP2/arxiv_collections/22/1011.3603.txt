The review chapter starts by a pedagogical introduction to the general
concept of the scattering theory: from the fundamental wave-function picture to
the second-quantization language, with the aim to clear possible ambiguity in
conventional textbooks. Recent progress in applying the method to current
fluctuations and oscillating-parameter driven quantum pumping processes is
presented with inclusion of contributions by B\"{u}ttiker, Brouwer, Moskalets,
Zhu, etc. In particular, the spin-orbit-coupling affected shot noise can be
dealt with by taking into account the spin-dependent scattering processes. A
large shot noise suppression with the Fano factor below 0.5 observed
experimentally can be illustrated by effective repulsion between electrons with
antiparallel spin induced by the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling effect. A
Floquet scattering theory for quantum-mechanical pumping in mesoscopic
conductors is developed by Moskalets et al., which gives a general picture of
quantum pumping phenomenon, from adiabatic to non-adiabatic and from weak
pumping to strong pumping.
