We consider the noncommutative deformation of the Sakai--Sugimoto model at
finite temperature and finite baryon chemical potential. The space
noncommutativity is possible to have an influence on the flavor dynamics of the
QCD. The critical temperature and critical value of the chemical potential are
modified by the space noncommutativity. The influence of the space
noncommutativity on the flavor dynamics of the QCD is caused by the
Wess--Zumino term in the effective action of the D8-branes. The intermediate
temperature phase, in which the gluons deconfine but the chiral symmetry
remains broken, is easy to be realized in some region of the noncommutativity
parameter.
