We report experimental and analytical work on spin-transfer torque induced
vortex dynamics in metallic nanopillars with in-plane magnetized layers. We
study nanopillars with a diameter of 150 nm, containing two Fe layers with a
thickness of 15 nm and 30 nm respectively, separated by a 6 nm Ag spacer. The
sample geometry is such that it allows for the formation of magnetic vortices
in the Fe disks. As confirmed by micromagnetic simulations, we are able to
prepare states where one magnetic layer is homogeneously magnetized while the
other contains a vortex. We experimentally show that in this configuration
spin-transfer torque can excite vortex dynamics and analyze their dependence on
a magnetic field applied in the sample plane. The center of gyration is
continuously dislocated from the disk center, and the potential changes its
shape with field strength. The latter is reflected in the field dependence of
the excitation frequency. In the second part we propose a novel mechanism for
the excitation of the gyrotropic mode in nanopillars with a perfectly
homogeneously magnetized in-plane polarizing layer. We analytically show that
in this configuration the vortex can absorb energy from the spin-polarized
electric current if the angular spin-transfer efficiency function is
asymmetric. This effect is supported by micromagnetic simulations.
