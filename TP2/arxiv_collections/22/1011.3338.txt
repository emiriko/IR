Imaging in hard X-rays of any astrophysical source with high angular
resolution is a challenging job. Shadow-casting technique is one of the most
viable options for imaging in hard X-rays. We have used two different types of
shadow-casters, namely, Coded Aperture Mask (CAM) and Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP)
pair and two types of pixellated solid-state detectors, namely, CZT and CMOS in
RT-2/CZT payload, the hard X-ray imaging instrument onboard the CORONAS-PHOTON
satellite. In this paper, we present the results of simulations with different
combinations of coders (CAM & FZP) and detectors that are employed in the
RT-2/CZT payload. We discuss the possibility of detecting transient Solar
flares with good angular resolution for various combinations. Simulated results
are compared with laboratory experiments to verify the consistency of the
designed configuration.
