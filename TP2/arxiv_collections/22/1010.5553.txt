We show that the dynamical melting of a Mott insulator in a three-dimensional
lattice leads to condensation at nonzero momenta, a phenomenon that can be used
to generate strongly interacting atom lasers in optical lattices. For infinite
onsite repulsion, the case considered here, the momenta at which bosons
condense is determined analytically and found to have a simple dependence on
the hopping amplitudes. The occupation of the condensates is shown to scale
linearly with the total number of atoms in the initial Mott insulator. Our
results are obtained using a Gutzwiller-type mean-field approach, gauged
against exact diagonalization solutions of small systems.
