The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) was launched on June 11, 2008 and
began its first year sky survey on August 11, 2008. The Large Area Telescope
(LAT), a wide field-of-view pair-conversion telescope covering the energy range
from 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV, is the primary instrument on Fermi. While
this review focuses on results obtained with the LAT, the Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (GBM) complements the LAT in its observations of transient sources and
is sensitive to X-rays and gamma-rays with energies between 8 keV and 40 MeV.
During the first year in orbit, the Fermi LAT has observed a large number of
sources that include active galaxies, pulsars, compact binaries, globular
clusters, supernova remnants, as well as the Sun, the Moon and the Earth. The
GBM and LAT together have uncovered surprising characteristics in the
high-energy emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that have been used to set
significant new limits on violations of Lorentz invariance. The Fermi LAT has
also made important new measurements of the Galactic diffuse radiation and has
made precise measurements of the spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons and positrons
from 20 GeV to 1 TeV.
