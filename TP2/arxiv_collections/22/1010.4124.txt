A two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann model with 19 discrete velocities for
compressible Euler equations is proposed (D2V19-LBM). The fifth-order Weighted
Essentially Non-Oscillatory (5th-WENO) finite difference scheme is employed to
calculate the convection term of the lattice Boltzmann equation. The validity
of the model is verified by comparing simulation results of the Sod shock tube
with its corresponding analytical solutions. The velocity and density gradient
effects on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) are investigated using the
proposed model. Sharp density contours are obtained in our simulations. It is
found that, the linear growth rate $\gamma$ for the KHI decreases with
increasing the width of velocity transition layer ${D_{v}}$ but increases with
increasing the width of density transition layer ${D_{\rho}}$. After the
initial transient period and before the vortex has been well formed, the linear
growth rates, $\gamma_v$ and $\gamma_{\rho}$, vary with ${D_{v}}$ and
${D_{\rho}}$ approximately in the following way, $\ln\gamma_{v}=a-bD_{v}$ and
$\gamma_{\rho}=c+e\ln D_{\rho} ({D_{\rho}}<{D_{\rho}^{E}})$, where $a$, $b$,
$c$ and $e$ are fitting parameters and ${D_{\rho}^{E}}$ is the effective
interaction width of density transition layer. When ${D_{\rho}}>{D_{\rho}^{E}}$
the linear growth rate $\gamma_{\rho}$ does not vary significantly any more.
One can use the hybrid effects of velocity and density transition layers to
stabilize the KHI. Our numerical simulation results are in general agreement
with the analytical results [L. F. Wang, \emph{et al.}, Phys. Plasma
