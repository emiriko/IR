We study the thermodynamics of the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model with an
external potential playing the role of a "magnetic field". If we consider only
fully stable states, this system does not present any phase transition.
However, if we take into account metastable states (for a restricted class of
perturbations), we find a very rich phenomenology. In particular, the system
displays a region of negative specific heats in the microcanonical ensemble in
which the temperature decreases as the energy increases. This leads to
ensembles inequivalence and to zeroth order phase transitions similar to the
"gravothermal catastrophe" and to the "isothermal collapse" of self-gravitating
systems. In the present case, they correspond to the reorganization of the
system from an "anti-aligned" phase (magnetization pointing in the direction
opposite to the magnetic field) to an "aligned" phase (magnetization pointing
in the same direction as the magnetic field). We also find that the magnetic
susceptibility can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble so that the
magnetization decreases as the magnetic field increases. The magnetic curves
can take various shapes depending on the values of energy or temperature. We
describe hysteretic cycles involving positive or negative susceptibilities. We
also show that this model exhibits gaps in the magnetization at fixed energy,
resulting in ergodicity breaking.
