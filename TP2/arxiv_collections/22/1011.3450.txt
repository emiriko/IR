In this talk we summarize previous work on mass bounds of a light neutralino
in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that without the GUT
relation between the gaugino mass parameters M_1 and M_2, the mass of the
lightest neutralino is essentially unconstrained by collider bounds and
precision observables. We conclude by considering also the astrophysics and
cosmology of a light neutralino.
