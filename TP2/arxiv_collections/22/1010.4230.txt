Pulsars PSR J0248+6021 (rotation period P=217 ms and spin-down power Edot =
2.13E35 erg/s) and PSR J2240+5832 (P=140 ms, Edot = 2.12E35 erg/s) were
discovered in 1997 with the Nancay radio telescope during a northern Galactic
plane survey, using the Navy-Berkeley Pulsar Processor (NBPP) filter bank. GeV
gamma-ray pulsations from both were discovered using the Fermi Large Area
Telescope. Twelve years of radio and polarization data allow detailed
investigations. The two pulsars resemble each other both in radio and in
gamma-ray data. Both are rare in having a single gamma-ray pulse offset far
from the radio peak. The high dispersion measure for PSR J0248+6021 (DM = 370
pc cm^-3) is most likely due to its being within the dense, giant HII region W5
in the Perseus arm at a distance of 2 kpc, not beyond the edge of the Galaxy as
obtained from models of average electron distributions. Its high transverse
velocity and the low magnetic field along the line-of-sight favor this small
distance. Neither gamma-ray, X-ray, nor optical data yield evidence for a
pulsar wind nebula surrounding PSR J0248+6021. The gamma-ray luminosity for PSR
J0248+6021 is L_ gamma = (1.4 \pm 0.3)\times 10^34 erg/s. For PSR J2240+5832,
we find either L_gamma = (7.9 \pm 5.2) \times 10^34 erg/s if the pulsar is in
the Outer arm, or L_gamma = (2.2 \pm 1.7) \times 10^34 erg/s for the Perseus
arm. These luminosities are consistent with an L_gamma ~ sqrt(Edot) rule.
Comparison of the gamma-ray pulse profiles with model predictions, including
the constraints obtained from radio polarization data, favor emission in the
far magnetosphere. These two pulsars differ mainly in their inclination angles
and acceleration gap widths, which in turn explains the observed differences in
the gamma-ray peak widths.
