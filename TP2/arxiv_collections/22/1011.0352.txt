The Belle detector at the KEKB electron-positron collider has collected
almost 1 billion Y(4S) events in its decade of operation. Super-KEKB, an
upgrade of KEKB is under construction, to increase the luminosity by two orders
of magnitude during a three-year shutdown, with an ultimate goal of 8E35 /cm^2
/s luminosity. To exploit the increased luminosity, an upgrade of the Belle
detector has been proposed. A new international collaboration Belle-II, is
being formed. The Technical Design Report presents physics motivation, basic
methods of the accelerator upgrade, as well as key improvements of the
detector.
