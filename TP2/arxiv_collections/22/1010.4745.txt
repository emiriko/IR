We provided a class of legitimate memory kernels leading to completely
positive trace preserving dynamical maps. Our construction is based on a simple
normalization procedure. Interestingly, when applied to the celebrated
Wigner-Weisskopf theory it gives the standard Markovian evolution governed by
the local master equation.
