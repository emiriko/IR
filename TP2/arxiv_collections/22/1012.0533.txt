Following a brief exposition of the morphological process, two examples of
its application in contemporary astronomy are presented. The first comprises a
major digital, blue-violet spectral classification program on Galactic O stars,
that has already revealed three special categories or new members thereof: the
Ofc class with C III lambda4650 emission comparable to N III lambda4640, the
Of?p class of magnetic oblique rotators, and the ONn class of nitrogen-rich
rapid rotators. All of these categories portend further understanding of
massive stellar atmospheres and evolution. The second example concerns the
structure of massive young clusters and nebulae as a function of age on
timescales of the order of or less than 10 Myr, which has provided a new
insight into the Antennae major-merger starburst.
