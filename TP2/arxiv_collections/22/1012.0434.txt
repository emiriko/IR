Thermal soaring saves much energy, but flying large distances in this form
represents a great challenge for birds, people and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs). The solution is to make use of so-called thermals, which are localized,
warmer regions in the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the
descent rate of birds and planes. Saving energy by exploiting the environment
more efficiently is an important possibility for autonomous UAVs as well.
Successful control strategies have been developed recently for UAVs in
simulations and in real applications. This paper first presents an overview of
our knowledge of the soaring flight and strategy of birds, followed by a
discussion of control strategies that have been developed for soaring UAVs both
in simulations and applications on real platforms. To improve the accuracy of
simulation of thermal exploitation strategies we propose a method to take into
account the effect of turbulence. Finally we propose a new GPS independent
control strategy for exploiting thermal updraft.
