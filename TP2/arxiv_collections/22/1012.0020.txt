For evaluation of the undrained thermo-poro-elastic properties of saturated
porous materials in conventional triaxial cells, it is important to take into
account the effect of the dead volume of the drainage system. The
compressibility and the thermal expansion of the drainage system along with the
dead volume of the fluid filling this system, influence the measured pore
pressure and volumetric strain during undrained thermal or mechanical loading
in a triaxial cell. A correction method is presented in this paper to correct
these effects during an undrained isotropic compression test or an undrained
heating test. A parametric study has demonstrated that the porosity and the
drained compressibility of the tested material and the ratio of the vol-ume of
the drainage system to the one of the tested sample are the key parameters
which influence the most the error induced on the measurements by the drainage
system.
