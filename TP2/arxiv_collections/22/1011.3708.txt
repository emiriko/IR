A Catalan pair is a pair of binary relations (S,R) satisfying certain axioms.
These objects are enumerated by the well-known Catalan numbers, and have been
introduced with the aim of giving a common language to most of the structures
counted by Catalan numbers. Here, we give a simple method to pass from the
recursive definition of a generic Catalan structure to the recursive definition
of the Catalan pair on the same structure, thus giving an automatic way to
interpret Catalan structures in terms of Catalan pairs. We apply our method to
many well-known Catalan structures, focusing on the meaning of the relations S
and R in each considered case.
