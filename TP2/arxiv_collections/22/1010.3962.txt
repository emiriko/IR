Fermion masses may arise via mixing of elementary fermions with composite
fermions of a strong sector in scenarios of strongly-coupled electroweak
symmetry breaking. The strong sector may contain leptoquark states with masses
as light as several hundred GeV. In the present study we focus on the scalar
modes of such leptoquarks since their bosonic couplings are determined
completely and hence their production cross sections only depend on their
masses. We study all the possible gauge-invariant non-derivative and
single-derivative couplings of the scalar leptoquarks to the quarks and
leptons, which turn out to be, predominantly, of the third generation. We
examine their phenomenology and outline search strategies for their dominant
decay modes at the LHC.
