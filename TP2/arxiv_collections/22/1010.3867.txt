We present here a first prototype of a "Speed Limit Support" Advance Driving
Assistance System (ADAS) producing permanent reliable information on the
current speed limit applicable to the vehicle. Such a module can be used either
for information of the driver, or could even serve for automatic setting of the
maximum speed of a smart Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Our system is based on
a joint interpretation of cartographic information (for static reference
information) with on-board vision, used for traffic sign detection and
recognition (including supplementary sub-signs) and visual road lines
localization (for detection of lane changes). The visual traffic sign detection
part is quite robust (90% global correct detection and recognition for main
speed signs, and 80% for exit-lane sub-signs detection). Our approach for joint
interpretation with cartography is original, and logic-based rather than
probability-based, which allows correct behaviour even in cases, which do
happen, when both vision and cartography may provide the same erroneous
information.
