Five previously unknown inequalities relating equilibrium free energy
differences and non-equilibrium work fluctuations are derived, and lucid path
to derivation of many similar inequalities is presented. These results are
based upon combined exploitation of the Jarzynski equality and the
generalization of the scheme for producing uncertainty-type inequalities due to
H. Weyl. The inequalities may possibly lead to better understanding of behavior
of the equilibrium free-energy estimators from non-equilibrium experimental
data in many important applications concerning biological, chemical, and
physical molecular processes.
