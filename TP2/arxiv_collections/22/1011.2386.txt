This paper presents a semantic wiki prototype application named SHAWN [later
WikSAR] that allows structuring concepts within a wiki environment. To entice
the use of Semantic Web technologies applications need to offer both high
usability and instant gratification. Concept creation is exceptionally easy in
SHAWN since metadata as well as plain text is entered within a single edit box
on each wiki page in a self-explaining fashion. The entered data is immediately
used for rendering sophisticated navigational means on the wiki. By editing
simple wiki pages ontologies emerge.
