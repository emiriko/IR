We consider the use of aspect-oriented techniques as a flexible way to deal
with security policies in distributed systems. Recent work suggests to use
aspects for analysing the future behaviour of programs and to make access
control decisions based on this; this gives the flavour of dealing with
information flow rather than mere access control. We show in this paper that it
is beneficial to augment this approach with history-based components as is the
traditional approach in reference monitor-based approaches to mandatory access
control. Our developments are performed in an aspect-oriented coordination
language aiming to describe the Bell-LaPadula policy as elegantly as possible.
Furthermore, the resulting language has the capability of combining both
history- and future-sensitive policies, providing even more flexibility and
power.
