Vojta's Conjectures are well known to imply a wide range of results, known
and unknown, in arithmetic geometry. In this paper, we add to the list by
proving that they imply that rational points tend to repel each other on
algebraic varieties with nonnegative Kodaira dimension. We use this to deduce,
from Vojta's Conjectures, conjectures of Batyrev-Manin and Manin on the
distribution of rational points on algebraic varieties. In particular, we show
that Vojta's Main Conjecture implies the Batyrev-Manin Conjecture for $K3$
surfaces.
