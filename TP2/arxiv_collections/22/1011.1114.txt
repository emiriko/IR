The efficiency of extracting single atoms or molecules from an ultracold
bosonic reservoir is theoretically investigated for a protocol based on lasers,
coupling the hyperfine state in which the atoms form a condensate to another
stable state, in which the atom experiences a tight potential in the regime of
collisional blockade, the quantum tweezers. The transfer efficiency into the
single-atom ground state of the tight trap is fundamentally limited by the
collective modes of the condensate, which are thermally and dynamically
excited. The noise due to these excitations can be quenched for sufficiently
long laser pulses, thereby achieving high efficiencies. These results show that
this protocol can be applied for initializing a quantum register based on
tweezer traps for neutral atoms.
