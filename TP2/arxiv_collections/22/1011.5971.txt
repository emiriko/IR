Ziv-Lempel and Crochemore factorization are two kinds of factorizations of
words related to text processing. In this paper, we find these factorizations
for standard epiesturmian words. Thus the previously known c-factorization of
standard Sturmian words is provided as a special case. Moreover, the two
factorizations are compared.
