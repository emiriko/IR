We investigate evolutionary dynamics related to periodicity fossil
biodiversity. Coherent periodic fluctuation in origination/extinction of marine
genera that survive <45 million years is the source of an observed ~62 million
year periodicity analyzed in Paper I. We also show that the evolutionary
dynamics of "long-lived" genera (those that survive >45 million years) do not
participate in the periodic fluctuation in diversity and differ from those of
"short-lived" genera. The difference between the evolutionary dynamics of these
2 genera classes indicates that the periodic pattern is not an artifact of
variation in quality of the geologic record. The interplay of these two
previously undifferentiated systems, together with the secular increase in
abundance of "long-lived" genera, is probably the source of heretofore
unexplained differences in evolutionary dynamics between the Paleozoic and
post-Paleozoic as reported by others. Testing for cycles similar to the 62 Myr
cycle in fossil biodiversity superimposed on the long-term trends of the
Phanerozoic as described in Paper I, we find a significant (but weaker) signal
in sedimentary rock packages, particularly carbonates, which suggests a
connection. The presence of a periodic pattern in evolutionary dynamics of the
vulnerable "short-lived" component of marine fauna demonstrates that a
long-term periodic fluctuation in environmental conditions capable of affecting
evolution in the marine realm characterizes our planet. Coincidence in timing
is more consistent with a common cause than sampling bias. A previously
identified set of mass extinctions preferentially occur during the declining
phase of the 62 Myr periodicity, supporting the idea that the periodicity
relates to variation in biotically important stresses. Further work should
focus on finding links to physical phenomena that might reveal the causal
system or systems.
