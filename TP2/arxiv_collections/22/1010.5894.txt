A numerical approach is employed to explain transport characteristics in
realistic, quantum Hall based Aharonov-Bohm interferometers. First, the spatial
distribution of incompressible strips, and thus the current channels, are
obtained applying a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi method to a realistic
heterostructure under quantized Hall conditions. Second, the time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation is solved for electrons injected in the current
channels. Distinctive Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are found as a function of the
magnetic flux. The oscillation amplitude strongly depends on the mutual
distance between the transport channels and on their width. At an optimal
distance the amplitude and thus the interchannel transport is maximized, which
determines the maximum visibility condition. On the other hand, the transport
is fully suppressed at magnetic fields corresponding to half-integer flux
quanta. The results confirm the applicability of realistic Aharonov-Bohm
interferometers as controllable current switches.
