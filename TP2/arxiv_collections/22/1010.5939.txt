The first part of our work is connected with the analysis of typical random
variables for the specific human-initiated process. We study the data
characterizing editorial work with received manuscripts in several scientific
journals. In such a way we found the waiting time distributions that could be
called the typical for an ordinary peer-review scientific journal. In the
second part of this study a model of editorial processing of received
manuscripts is developed. Within the model, different scenarios of the
manuscript editorial processing are examined. Combining the results of the
quantitative experiment and model simulations we arrive to the set of
conclusions about time characteristics of editorial process in scientific
journals and a peer-review contribution.
