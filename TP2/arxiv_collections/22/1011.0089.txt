The structure of Bell-type inequalities detecting genuine multipartite
non-locality, and hence detecting genuine multipartite entanglement, is
investigated. We first present a simple and intuitive approach to Svetlichny's
original inequality, which provides a clear understanding of its structure and
of its violation in quantum mechanics. Based on this approach, we then derive a
family of Bell-type inequalities for detecting genuine multipartite
non-locality in scenarios involving an arbitrary number of parties and systems
of arbitrary dimension. Finally we discuss the thightness and quantum
mechanical violations of these inequalities.
