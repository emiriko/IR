The symmetric Anderson model for a single impurity coupled to two leads is
studied at strong interaction using the GW approximation within the $\sigma G
\sigma W$ formalism. We find that the low energy properties show universal
scaling behavior in the asymptotic regime. While the GW scaling functions are
similar in form to the scaling functions known from the numerically exact
solution, they are characterized by a different parameter value indicating that
GW fails to describe correctly spin correlations between the impurity and lead
electrons. We also compare the GW and exact Kondo scales for a broad range of
the interaction strength. In contrast to the exponential behavior shown by the
exact solution, the GW Kondo scale depends algebraically on the interaction
strength.
