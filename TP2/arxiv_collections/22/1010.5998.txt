We improve and update the discussion, given some years ago by my
collaborators and me, of infrared divergences and Bremsstrahlung in one-loop
gluon scattering probabilities in lightcone gauge. In that work, we showed that
adding soft and collinear gluon radiation, satisfying simple Lorentz invariant
constraints, not only cancelled all IR divergences, but resulted in compact
expressions for the consequent scattering probabilities. Here we impose less
restrictive (albeit noncovariant) constraints on the unobserved radiation,
which increases the high energy (s) fixed momentum transfer (t) behavior of the
total probabilities from -ln^2s to ln s ln t, a behavior shared by the (IR
divergent) elastic probabilities. Using this new treatment we also make a much
more detailed comparison of the lightcone results to covariant calculations
using dimensional regularization, finding complete agreement between the two
styles of calculation.
