We derive a holographic dual description of free quantum field theory in
arbitrary dimensions, by reinterpreting the exact renormalization group, to
obtain a higher spin gravity theory of the general type which had been proposed
and studied as a dual theory. We show that the dual theory reproduces all
correlation functions.
