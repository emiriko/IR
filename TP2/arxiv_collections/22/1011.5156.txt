We study theoretically some effects produced by a propagation of the charged
particles in dilute gases of alkali-metal atoms in the state with Bose-Einstein
condensates. The energy change of the high-speed (relativistic) particle that
corresponds to the Cherenkov effect in the condensate is investigated. We show
that in the studied cases the particle can both loose and receive the energy
from a gas. We find the necessary conditions for the particle acceleration in
the multi-component condensate. It is shown that the Cherenkov effect in
Bose-Einstein condensates can be used also for defining the spectral
characteristics of atoms.
