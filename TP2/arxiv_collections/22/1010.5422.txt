The multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock method (MCTDHF) is
applied for simulations of the two-photon ionization of Helium. We present
results for the single- and double ionization from the groundstate for photon
energies in the non-sequential regime, and compare them to direct solutions of
the Schr\"odinger equation using the time-dependent (full) Configuration
Interaction method (TDCI). We find that the single-ionization is accurately
reproduced by MCTDHF, whereas the double ionization results correctly capture
the main trends of TDCI.
