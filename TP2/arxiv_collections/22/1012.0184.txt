The construction of the IceCube neutrino observatory is practically
terminated. At the time of this writing, and with 79 strings taking data out of
the 86 foreseen, we are one deployment season away from completion. The
detector, however, has been taking data since 2006 in different partial
configurations. We have evaluated these data for evidence of dark matter
annihilations in the Sun, in the Galactic Center and in the Galactic Halo,
searching for an excess neutrino flux over the expected atmospheric neutrino
background.
  This contribution reviews the results of dark matter searches for WIMPs,
Kaluza-Klein modes and superheavy candidates (Simpzillas), using the 22- and
40-string configurations of IceCube. The results are presented in the form of
muon flux limits, constrains on the candidates' spin-dependent cross-section
with protons, and constrains in the self-annihilation cross section. These
results are presented in the context of direct searches and searches in space
