Possible applications of carbon nanotubes in nanoelectromechanical systems
(NEMSs) based on rela-tive motion and interaction of nanotubes walls are
considered for wide set of NEMS. This set includes nanomotors, nanoactuator,
nanorelay, variable nanoresistor, gigahertz oscillator, nanothermometer and so
on. The nanotube properties and theory for relative motion and interaction of
nanotubes walls is de-scribed. The principal schemes, operation principles, and
methods of actuation of the considered NEMS are considered. The development of
nanotechnological techniques which are necessary for production of
nanotube-baseb NEMS are discussed.
