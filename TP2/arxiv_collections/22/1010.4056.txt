We present an overview of experimental work to embed high-Q mesoscopic
mechanical oscillators in microwave and optical cavities. Based upon recent
progress, the prospect for a broad field of "cavity quantum mechanics" is very
real. These systems introduce mesoscopic mechanical oscillators as a new
quantum resource and also inherently couple their motion to photons throughout
the electromagnetic spectrum.
