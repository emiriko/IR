The Dirac-Moshinsky oscillator is an elegant example of an exactly solvable
quantum relativistic model that under certain circumstances can be mapped onto
the Jaynes-Cummings model in quantum optics. In this work we show, how to do
this in detail. Then we extend it by considering its coupling with an external
(isospin) field and find the conditions that maintain solvability. We use this
extended system to explore entanglement in relativistic systems and then
identify its quantum optical analog: two different atoms interacting with an
electromagnetic mode. We show different aspects of entanglement which gain
relevance in this last system, which can be used to emulate the former.
