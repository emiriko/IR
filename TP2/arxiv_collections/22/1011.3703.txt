We prove a general comparison result for homotopic finite $p$-energy $C^{1}$
$p$-harmonic maps $u,v:M\to N$ between Riemannian manifolds, assuming that $M$
is $p$-parabolic and $N$ is complete and non-positively curved. In particular,
we construct a homotopy through constant $p$-energy maps, which turn out to be
$p$-harmonic when $N$ is compact. Moreover, we obtain uniqueness in the case of
negatively curved $N$. This generalizes a well known result in the harmonic
setting due to R. Schoen and S.T. Yau.
