In this paper, we consider a p-Laplacian equation in {R}^{N}with
sign-changing potential and subcritical p-superlinear nonlinearity. By using
the cohomological linking method for cones developed by Degiovanni and
Lancelotti in 2007, an existence result is obtained. We also give a result on
the existence of periodic solutions for one-dimensional $p$-Laplacian equations
which can be proved by the same method.
