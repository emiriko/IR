We present an effective time approach to predict long and short time
rheological behavior of soft glassy materials from experiments carried out over
practical time scales. Effective time approach takes advantage of relaxation
time dependence on aging time that allows time-aging time superposition even
when aging occurs over the experimental timescales. Interestingly experiments
on variety of soft materials demonstrate that the effective time approach
successfully predicts superposition for diverse aging regimes ranging from
sub-aging to hyper-aging behaviors. This approach can also be used to predict
behavior of any response function in molecular as well as spin glasses.
