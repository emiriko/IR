Spin polarized states in neutron matter at strong magnetic fields up to
$10^{18}$ G are considered in the model with the Skyrme effective interaction.
Analyzing the self-consistent equations at zero temperature, it is shown that a
thermodynamically stable branch of solutions for the spin polarization
parameter as a function of density corresponds to the negative spin
polarization when the majority of neutron spins are oriented oppositely to the
direction of the magnetic field. Besides, it is found that in a strong magnetic
field the state with the positive spin polarization can be realized as a
metastable state at the high density region in neutron matter. At finite
temperature, the entropy of the thermodynamically stable branch demonstrates
the unusual behavior being larger than that for the nonpolarized state (at
vanishing magnetic field) above certain critical density which is caused by the
dependence of the entropy on the effective masses of neutrons in a spin
polarized state.
