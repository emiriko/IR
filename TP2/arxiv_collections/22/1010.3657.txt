We analyze the adjoint field inflation in supersymmetric (SUSY) SU(5) model.
In minimal SUSY SU(5) hybrid inflation monopoles are produced at the end of
inflation. We therefore explore the non-minimal model of inflation based on
SUSY SU(5), like shifted hybrid, which provides a natural solution for the
monopole problem. We find that the supergravity corrections with non-minimal
Kahler potential are crucial to realize the central value of the scalar
spectral index n_s ~ 0.96 consistent with the seven year WMAP data. The tensor
to scalar ratio r is quite small, taking on values r < 10^{-5}. Due to
R-symmetry massless SU(3) octet and SU(2) triplet Higgs bosons are present and
could spoil for gauge coupling unification. To keep gauge coupling unification
intact, light vector-like particles are added which are expected to be observed
at LHC.
