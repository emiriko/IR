Transport measurements on few layer graphene (FLG) are important as they
interpolate between the properties of single layer graphene (SLG) as a true
2-dimensional material and the 3-dimensional bulk properties of graphite. In
this article we present 4-probe local charge transport and non-local spin valve
and spin precession measurements on lateral spin field-effect transistors (FET)
on FLG. We study systematically the charge and spin transport properties
depending on the number of layers and the electrical back gating of the device.
We explain the charge transport measurements by taking the screening of
scattering potentials into account and use the results to understand the spin
data. The measured samples are between 3 and 20 layers thick and we include in
our analysis our earlier results of the measurements on SLG for comparison. In
our room temperature spin transport measurements we manage to observe spin
signals over distances up to 10 u m and measure spin-relaxation times up to
tau_s ~500 ps, about 4 times higher than in SLG. We calculate the density of
states (DOS) of FLG using a zone-folding scheme to determine the charge
diffusion coefficient D_C from the square resistance R_S. The resulting D_C and
the spin diffusion coefficient D_S show similar values and depend only weakly
on the number of layers and gate induced charge carriers. We discuss the
implications of this on the identification of the spin-relaxation mechanism.
