In this paper the elementary moves of the BFACF-algorithm for lattice
polygons are generalised to elementary moves of BFACF-style algorithms for
lattice polygons in the body-centred (BCC) and face-centred (FCC) cubic
lattices. We prove that the ergodicity classes of these new elementary moves
coincide with the knot types of unrooted polygons in the BCC and FCC lattices
and so expand a similar result for the cubic lattice. Implementations of these
algorithms for knotted polygons using the GAS algorithm produce estimates of
the minimal length of knotted polygons in the BCC and FCC lattices.
