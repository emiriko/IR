We study a new flavor symmetric model with non-Abelian discrete symmetry
T_{13}. The T_{13} group is isomorphic to Z_{13} \rtimes Z_3, and it is the
minimal group having two complex triplets as the irreducible representations.
We show that the T_{13} symmetry can derive lepton masses and mixings
consistently. Moreover, if we assume a gauge-singlet fermionic decaying dark
matter, its decay operators are also constrained by the T_{13} symmetry so that
only dimension six operators of leptonic decay are allowed. We find that the
cosmic-ray anomalies reported by PAMELA and Fermi-LAT are explained by decaying
dark matter controlled by the T_{13} flavor symmetry.
