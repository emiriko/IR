We study topological insulators characterized by the integer topological
invariant Z, in even and odd spacial dimensions. These are well understood in
case when there are no interactions. We extend the earlier work on this subject
to construct their topological invariants in terms of their Green's functions.
In this form, they can be used even if there are interactions. Specializing to
one and two spacial dimensions, we further show that if two topologically
distinct topological insulators border each other, the difference of their
topological invariants is equal to the difference between the number of zero
energy boundary excitations and the number of zeroes of the Green's function at
the boundary. In the absence of interactions Green's functions have no zeroes
thus there are always edge states at the boundary, as is well known. In the
presence of interactions, in principle Green's functions could have zeroes. In
that case, there could be no edge states at the boundary of two topological
insulators with different topological invariants. This may provide an
alternative explanation to the recent results on one dimensional interacting
topological insulators.
