The extremely fascinating behaviors of the quantum walks of particles, which
differ much from the classical counterparts, have attracted many physicists.
Here we investigate another interesting part of the quantum walks, that is the
quantum walks of waves. Firstly, we show the behaviors of the quantum walks of
plane wave, which are largely different from the counterparts of either the
classical or the quantum walks of particles. Two situations - with and without
intermediate time measurements of the walks are considered. At last, it is
shown that the quantum walks of plane wave can be used to calculate the
evolution of the general wave packets, e.g., Gaussian wave packet.
