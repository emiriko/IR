We discuss the early performance of the reconstruction of electrons and
photons at ATLAS with a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Using a data sample of
about 15 nb^-1, we present a measurement of the transverse momentum
distribution of inclusive electrons, as well as an observation of prompt
photons and a measurement of the purity of this sample. We also demonstrate the
reconstruction of J/psi mesons with a data sample of 78 nb^-1.
