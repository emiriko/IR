The paper \cite{Dance0601} tentatively suggested a physical picture that
might underlie string theories. The string parameters $\tau $ and $\sigma_i $
were interpreted as spacetime dimensions which a simple quantum mechanical
observer can observe, while symmetries of the relevant observer states could
limit the observability of other dimensions. An atomic observer was the focus
of the discussion. The present paper extends the discussion of\cite{Dance0601}
to molecular observers, including the nature of some common molecular bonds and
their symmetries.
