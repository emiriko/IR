The measure problem of cosmology is how to assign normalized probabilities to
observations in a universe so large that it may have many observations
occurring at many different spacetime locations. I have previously shown how
the Boltzmann brain problem (that observations arising from thermal or quantum
fluctuations may dominate over ordinary observations if the universe expands
sufficiently and/or lasts long enough) may be ameliorated by volume averaging,
but that still leaves problems if the universe lasts too long. Here a solution
is proposed for that residual problem by a simple weighting factor 1/(1+t^2) to
make the time integral convergent. The resulting Agnesi measure appears to
avoid problems other measures may have with vacua of zero or negative
cosmological constant.
