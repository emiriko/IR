In this paper we present a minimal list decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon
(RS) codes. Minimal list decoding for a code $C$ refers to list decoding with
radius $L$, where $L$ is the minimum of the distances between the received word
$\mathbf{r}$ and any codeword in $C$. We consider the problem of determining
the value of $L$ as well as determining all the codewords at distance $L$. Our
approach involves a parametrization of interpolating polynomials of a minimal
Gr\"obner basis $G$. We present two efficient ways to compute $G$. We also show
that so-called re-encoding can be used to further reduce the complexity. We
then demonstrate how our parametric approach can be solved by a computationally
feasible rational curve fitting solution from a recent paper by Wu. Besides, we
present an algorithm to compute the minimum multiplicity as well as the optimal
values of the parameters associated with this multiplicity which results in
overall savings in both memory and computation.
