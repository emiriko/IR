In this paper, we analyze 91 coronal mass ejection (CME) events studied by
Manoharan et al. (2004) and Gopalswamy and Xie (2008). These earth-directed
CMEs are large (width $>$160$^\circ$) and cover a wide range of speeds
($\sim$120--2400 {\kmps}) in the LASCO field of view. This set of events also
includes interacting CMEs and some of them take longer time to reach 1 AU than
the travel time inferred from their speeds at 1 AU. We study the link between
the travel time of the CME to 1 AU (combined with its final speed at the Earth)
and the effective acceleration in the Sun-Earth distance. Results indicate that
(1) for almost all the events (85 out of 91 events), the speed of the CME at 1
AU is always less than or equal to its initial speed measured at the near-Sun
region, (2) the distributions of initial speeds, CME-driven shock and CME
speeds at 1 AU clearly show the effects of aero-dynamical drag between the CME
and the solar wind and in consequence, the speed of the CME tends to equalize
to that of the background solar wind, (3) for a large fraction of CMEs (for
$\sim$50% of the events), the inferred effective acceleration along the
Sun-Earth line dominates the above drag force. The net acceleration suggests an
average dissipation of energy $\sim$10$^{31-32}$ ergs, which is likely provided
by the Lorentz force associated with the internal magnetic energy carried by
the CME.
