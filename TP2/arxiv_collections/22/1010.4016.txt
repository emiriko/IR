We write down the basic equations of Fermi-liquid theory for mixtures of
fermions and bosons, an example being 3He-4He mixtures at low temperatures.
Basically the theory is identical to the one derived by Khalatnikov, but it is
derived in a different way, and includes more discussion. A simplifying
transformation of the equations is found where the coupling of the normal and
superfluid components appears in a simple form. The boundary conditions are
discussed.
