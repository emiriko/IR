A goodness-of-fit test for the fitting of a parametric model to data obtained
from a detector with finite resolution and limited acceptance is proposed. The
parameters of the model are found by minimization of a statistic that is used
for comparing experimental data and simulated reconstructed data. Numerical
examples are presented to illustrate and validate the fitting procedure.
