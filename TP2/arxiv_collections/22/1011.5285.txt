We show how pulsar observations may be used to construct a time standard that
is independent of terrestrial time standards. The pulsar time scale provides a
method to determine the stability of terrestrial time standards over years to
decades. Here, we summarise the method, provide initial results and discuss the
possibilities and limitations of our pulsar time scale.
