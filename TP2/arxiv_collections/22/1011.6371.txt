A recent work [1] demonstrated, for an ideal spinless p+ip superconductor,
that Majorana end-states can be realized outside the strict one-dimensional
limit, so long as: 1) the sample width does not greatly exceed the
superconducting coherence length and 2) an odd number of transverse sub-bands
are occupied. Here we extend this analysis to the case of an effective p+ip
superconductor engineered from Rashba spin-orbit coupled surface with induced
magnetization and superconductivity, and find a number of new features.
Specifically, we find that finite size quantization allows Majorana end-states
even when the chemical potential is outside of the induced Zeeman gap where the
bulk material would not be topological. This is relevant to proposals utilizing
semiconducting quantum wires, however, we also find that the bulk energy gap is
substantially reduced if the induced magnetization is too large. We next
consider a slightly different geometry, and show that Majorana end-states can
be created at the ends of ferromagnetic domains. Finally, we consider the case
of meandering edges and find, surprisingly, that the existence of well-defined
transverse sub-bands is not necessary for the formation of robust Majorana
end-states.
