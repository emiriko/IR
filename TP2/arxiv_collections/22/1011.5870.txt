For t a positive integer, the t-term rank of a (0,1)-matrix A is defined to
be the largest number of 1s in A with at most one 1 in each column and at most
t 1s in each row. Thus the 1-term rank is the ordinary term rank. We generalize
some basic results for the term rank to the t-term rank, including a formula
for the maximum term rank over a nonempty class of (0,1)-matrices with the the
same row sum and column sum vectors. We also show the surprising result that in
such a class there exists a matrix which realizes all of the maximum terms
ranks between 1 and t.
