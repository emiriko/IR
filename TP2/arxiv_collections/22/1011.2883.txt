We calculated the first two moments of the light-cone distribution amplitudes
for the pseudoscalar mesons ($\pi$ and $K$) and the longitudinally polarised
vector mesons ($\rho$, $K^*$ and $\phi$) as part of the UKQCD and RBC
collaborations' $N_f=2+1$ domain-wall fermion phenomenology programme. These
quantities were obtained with a good precision and, in particular, the expected
effects of $SU(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking were observed. Operators were
renormalised non-perturbatively and extrapolations to the physical point were
made, guided by leading order chiral perturbation theory. The main results
presented are for two volumes, $16^3\times 32$ and $24^3\times 64$, with a
common lattice spacing. Preliminary results for a lattice with a finer lattice
spacing, $32^3\times64$, are discussed and a first look is taken at the use of
twisted boundary conditions to extract distribution amplitudes.
