We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary quantum
computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be
efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model
of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a
linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of
photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for
quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the
model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is
able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically
intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there
exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same
probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P^#P=BPP^NP, and
hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately,
this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests
that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a
collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven
conjectures: the "Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture", which says that it is
#P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1)
Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the "Permanent
Anti-Concentration Conjecture", which says that |Per(A)|>=sqrt(n!)/poly(n) with
high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of
which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not
assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the
beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its
connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to
theoretical computer scientists.
