A non-equilibrium extension of Onsager's canonical theory of thermal
fluctuations is employed to derive a self-consistent theory for the description
of the statistical properties of the instantaneous local concentration profile
n(r,t) of a colloidal liquid in terms of the coupled time evolution equations
of its mean value n(r,t) and of the covariance {\sigma}(r,r';t) \equiv
<{\delta}n(r,t){\delta}n(r',t)> of its fluctuations {\delta}n(r, t) = n(r, t) -
n(r, t). These two coarse-grained equations involve a local mobility function
b(r, t) which, in its turn, is written in terms of the memory function of the
two-time correlation function C(r, r' ; t, t') \equiv <{\delta}n(r,
t){\delta}n(r',t')>. For given effective interactions between colloidal
particles and applied external fields, the resulting self-consistent theory is
aimed at describing the evolution of a strongly correlated colloidal liquid
from an initial state with arbitrary mean and covariance n^0(r) and
{\sigma}^0(r,r') towards its equilibrium state characterized by the equilibrium
local concentration profile n^(eq)(r) and equilibrium covariance
{\sigma}^(eq)(r,r').
  This theory also provides a general theoretical framework to describe
irreversible processes associated with dynamic arrest transitions, such as
aging, and the effects of spatial heterogeneities.
