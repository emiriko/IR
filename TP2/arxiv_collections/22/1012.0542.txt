We present measurements of fundamental astrophysical properties of nearby,
low-mass, K- and M-dwarfs from our DISCOS survey (DIameterS of COol Stars). The
principal goal of our study is the determination of linear radii and effective
temperatures for these stars. We calculate their radii from angular diameter
measurements using the CHARA Array and Hipparcos distances. Combined with
bolometric flux measurements based on literature photometry, we use our angular
diameter results to calculate their effective surface temperatures. We present
preliminary results established on an assortment of empirical relations to the
stellar effective temperature and radius that are based upon these
measurements. We elaborate on the discrepancy seen between theoretical and
observed stellar radii, previously claimed to be related to stellar activity
and/or metallicity. Our preliminary conclusion, however, is that convection
plays a larger role in the determination of radii of these late-type stars.
Understanding the source of the radius disagreement is likely to impact other
areas of study for low-mass stars, such as the detection and characterization
of extrasolar planets in the habitable zones.
