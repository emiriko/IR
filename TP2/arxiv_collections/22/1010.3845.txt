Existing theoretical models of evolution focus on the relative fitness
advantages of different mutants in a population while the dynamic behavior of
the population size is mostly left unconsidered. We here present a generic
stochastic model which combines the growth dynamics of the population and its
internal evolution. Our model thereby accounts for the fact that both
evolutionary and growth dynamics are based on individual reproduction events
and hence are highly coupled and stochastic in nature. We exemplify our
approach by studying the dilemma of cooperation in growing populations and show
that genuinely stochastic events can ease the dilemma by leading to a transient
but robust increase in cooperation
