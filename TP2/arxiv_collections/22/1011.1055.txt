We report a transport study of ultrathin Bi2Se3 topological insulators with
thickness from one quintuple layer to six quintuple layers grown by molecular
beam epitaxy. At low temperatures, the film resistance increases
logarithmically with decreasing temperature, revealing an insulating ground
state. The sharp increase of resistance with magnetic field, however, indicates
the existence of weak antilocalization, which should reduce the resistance as
temperature decreases. We show that these apparently contradictory behaviors
can be understood by considering the electron interaction effect, which plays a
crucial role in determining the electronic ground state of topological
insulators in the two dimensional limit.
