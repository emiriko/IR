It is proposed that the variable TeV emission observed in M87 may be produced
in a starved magnetospheric region, above which the outflow associated with the
VLBA jet is established. It is shown that annihilation of MeV photons emitted
by the radiative inefficient flow in the vicinity of the black hole, can lead
to injection of seed charges on open magnetic field lines, with a density that
depends sensitively on accretion rate, $n_\pm\propto\dot{m}^{4}$. For an
accretion rate that corresponds to the inferred jet power, and to a fit of the
observed SED by an ADAF model, the density of injected pairs is found to be
smaller than the Goldreich-Julian density by a factor of a few. It is also
shown that inverse Compton scattering of ambient photons by electrons
(positrons) accelerating in the gap can lead to a large multiplicity, $\sim
10^3$, while still allowing photons at energies of up to a few TeV to freely
escape the system. The estimated gap width is not smaller than $0.01 r_s$ if
the density of seed charges is below the Goldreich-Julian value. The VHE power
radiated by the gap can easily account for the luminosity of the TeV source
detected by H.E.S.S. The strong dependence of injected pair density on
accretion rate should render the gap emission highly intermittent. We also
discuss briefly the application of this mechanism to Sgr A$^\star$.
