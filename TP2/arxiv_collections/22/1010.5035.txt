The WIDeField telescope for Gamma-ray burst Early Timing (WIDGET) is used for
a fully automated, ultra-wide-field survey aimed at detecting the prompt
optical emission associated with Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs). WIDGET surveys the
HETE-2 and Swift/BAT pointing directions covering a total field of view of 62
degree x 62 degree every 10 secounds using an unfiltered system. This
monitoring survey allows exploration of the optical emission before the
gamma-ray trigger. The unfiltered magnitude is well converted to the SDSS r'
system at a 0.1 mag level. Since 2004, WIDGET has made a total of ten
simultaneous and one pre-trigger GRB observations. The efficiency of
synchronized observation with HETE-2 is four times better than that of Swift.
There has been no bright optical emission similar to that from GRB 080319B. The
statistical analysis implies that GRB080319B is a rare event. This paper
summarizes the design and operation of the WIDGET system and the simultaneous
GRB observations obtained with this instrument.
