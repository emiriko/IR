Neutrinoless double beta decay is a process of fundamental importance for
particle physics. It can be mediated by light massive Majorana neutrinos
(standard interpretation) or by something else (non-standard interpretations).
We review its dependence on the neutrino parameters, its complementarity to
other observables sensitive to neutrino mass, and emphasize its ability to
distinguish different neutrino mass models. Then we discuss mechanisms
different from light Majorana neutrino exchange, and show what can be learned
from those and how they could be tested.
