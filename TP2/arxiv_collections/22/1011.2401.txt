Compact formulas for trapped-particle and passing-particle guiding-center
orbits in axisymmetric tokamak geometry are given in terms of the Jacobi
elliptic functions and complete elliptic integrals. These formulas can find
applications in bounce-center kinetic theory as well as neoclassical transport
theory.
