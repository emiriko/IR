The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope with its main instrument onboard, the
Large Area Telescope (LAT), opened a new era in high-energy astrophysics and in
particular for the study of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), which are short flashes of
-rays associated with the brightest and most distant events ever observed in
our universe after the Big Bang. My thesis work focused primarily on the
observations of this phenomenon with the LAT (20 MeV - 300 GeV) and the
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (10 keV - 40 MeV) onboard the Fermi satellite. After
describing the procedure used for detection and analysis of LAT GRBs, I will
provide an overview of the temporal and spectral features observed during the
prompt emission of these events after one year and a half of operation for
Fermi. GRBs can also be used as a tool to probe interesting physics. My focus
will be on the detection of very high energy photons (typically above 10 GeV)
associated with LAT GRBs and which were used to set significant constraints
both on a possible violation of Lorentz invariance - which postulates that all
observers measure exactly the same speed of light in vacuum, independently of
photon energy - and on the Optical-Ultraviolet extragalactic background light
in the Universe.
