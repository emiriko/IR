A theory of the electronic structure and excitonic absorption spectra of PbS
and PbSe nanowires and nanorods in the framework of a four-band effective mass
model is presented. Calculations conducted for PbSe show that dielectric
contrast dramatically strengthens the exciton binding in narrow nanowires and
nanorods. However, the self-interaction energies of the electron and hole
nearly cancel the Coulomb binding, and as a result the optical absorption
spectra are practically unaffected by the strong dielectric contrast between
PbSe and the surrounding medium. Measurements of the size-dependent absorption
spectra of colloidal PbSe nanorods are also presented. Using room-temperature
energy-band parameters extracted from the optical spectra of spherical PbSe
nanocrystals, the theory provides good quantitative agreement with the measured
spectra.
