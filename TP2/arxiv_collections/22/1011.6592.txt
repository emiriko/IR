We construct a model for inelastic neutrino- and electron-nucleon scattering
cross sections using effective leading order parton distribution functions with
a new scaling variable $\xi_w$. Non-perturbative effects are well described
using the $\xi_w$ scaling variable, in combination with multiplicative $K$
factors at low $Q^2$.Our model describes all inelastic charged lepton-nucleon
scattering (including resonance) data (HERA/NMC/BCDMS/SLAC/JLab) ranging from
very high $Q^2$ to very low $Q^2$ and down to the photo-production region. The
model describes existing inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering measurements,
and has been developed to be used in analysis of neutrino oscillation
experiments in the few GeV region.
