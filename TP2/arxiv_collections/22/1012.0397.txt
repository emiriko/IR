The goal of this paper is to design compact support basis spline functions
that best approximate a given filter (e.g., an ideal Lowpass filter). The
optimum function is found by minimizing the least square problem ($\ell$2 norm
of the difference between the desired and the approximated filters) by means of
the calculus of variation; more precisely, the introduced splines give optimal
filtering properties with respect to their time support interval. Both
mathematical analysis and simulation results confirm the superiority of these
splines.
