We develop a technique, denoted as the finite radius approximation (FRA),
that uses a two-dimensional version of the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem to
determine transverse densities and their uncertainties from experimental
quantities. Uncertainties arising from experimental uncertainties on the form
factors and lack of measured data at high $Q^2$ are treated. A key feature of
the FRA is that a form factor measured at a given value of $Q^2$ is related to
a definite region in coordinate space. An exact relation between the FRA and
the use of a Bessel series is derived. The proton Dirac form factor is well
enough known such that the transverse charge density is very accurately known
except for transverse separations $b$ less than about 0.1 fm. The Pauli form
factor is well known to $Q^2$ of about 10 GeV$^2$, and this allows a
reasonable, but improvable, determination of the anomalous magnetic moment
density.
