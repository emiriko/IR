The spectral evolution from periodic structure to random structure has always
been an interesting topic in solid state physics, the generalized n-component
Fibonacci sequences (n- CF) provide a convenient tool to investigate such
process since its randomness can be controlled via the parameter n. In this
letter, the band-gap structures of n-CF piezoelectric superlattices have been
calculated using the transfer-matrix-method, the self-similarity behavior and
recovery rule have been systematically analyzed. Consistent with the rigorous
mathematical proof by Hu et al.[A. Hu et al. Phys. Rev. B. 48, 829 (1993)], we
find that the n-CF sequences with 2 \leq n \leq 4 are identified as
quasiperiodic. The imaginary wave numbers are characterized by the self-similar
spectrum, their major peaks can all be properly indexed. In addition, we find
that the n = 5 sequence belongs to a critical case which lies at the border
between quasiperiodic to aperiodic structures. The frequency range of
self-similarity pattern approaches to zero and a unique indexing of imaginary
wave numbers becomes impossible. Our study offers the information on the
critical 5-CF superlattice which was not available before. The classification
of band-gap structures and the scaling laws around fixed points are also given.
