We propose a survey of the literature about archaeological and geophysical
researches and on the paleoclimatology of the basin of Titicaca Lake, in
connection with the agricultural system of the raised fields. Here again we
discuss the use of Google Maps and satellite imagery as fundamental tools to
understand this ancient agricultural system and its role in the history of
pre-Incaic cultures.
