Whenever a distinct state is immersed in a sea of complicated and dense
states, the strength of the distinct state, which we refer to as a doorway, is
distributed in their neighboring states. We analyze this mechanism for 2-D
billiards with different geometries. One of them is symmetric and integrable,
another is symmetric but chaotic, and the third has a capricious form. The fact
that the doorway-state mechanism is valid for such highly diverse cases, proves
that it is robust.
