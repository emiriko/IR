We propose a scheme for coherent rotation of the valley isospin of a single
electron confined in a carbon nanotube quantum dot. The scheme exploits the
ubiquitous atomic disorder of the nanotube crystal lattice, which induces
time-dependent valley mixing as the confined electron is pushed back and forth
along the nanotube axis by an applied ac electric field. Using experimentally
determined values for the disorder strength we estimate that valley Rabi
oscillations with a period on the nanosecond timescale are feasible. The valley
resonance effect can be detected in the electric current through a double
quantum dot in the single-electron transport regime.
