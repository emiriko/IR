Scalar-isoscalar states are analyzed within the large-Nc Regge approach. We
find that the lightest f0(600) scalar-isoscalar state fits very well into the
pattern of the radial Regge trajectory. We confirm the obtained mass values
from an analysis of the pion and nucleon spin-0 gravitational form factors,
recently measured on the lattice. We find that a simple two-state model
suggests a meson nature of f0(600), and a glueball nature of f0(980), which
naturally explains the ratios of various coupling constants. Finally, matching
to the OPE requires a fine-tuned mass condition of the vanishing dimension-2
condensate in the Regge approach with infinitely many scalar-isoscalar states.
