Prompted by the Fermi LAT discovery of a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar inside
the CTA 1 supernova remnant, we obtained a 130 ks XMM-Newton observation to
assess the timing behavior of this pulsar. Exploiting both the unprecedented
photon harvest and the contemporary Fermi LAT timing measurements, a 4.7 sigma
single peak pulsation is detected, making PSR J0007+7303 the second example,
after Geminga, of a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar also seen to pulsate in
X-rays. Phase-resolved spectroscopy shows that the off-pulse portion of the
light curve is dominated by a power-law, non-thermal spectrum, while the X-ray
peak emission appears to be mainly of thermal origin, probably from a polar cap
heated by magnetospheric return currents, pointing to a hot spot varying
throughout the pulsar rotation.
