We re-examine the question of whether the geometrical ground state of neutral
and ionized clusters are identical. Using a well defined criterion for being
"identical" together, the extensive sampling methods on a potential energy
surface calculated by density functional theory, we show that the ground states
are in general different. This behavior is to be expected whenever there are
metastable configurations which are close in energy to the ground state, but it
disagrees with previous studies.
