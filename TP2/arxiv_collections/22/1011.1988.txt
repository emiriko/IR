We compute cross sections for incoherent diffractive J/Psi production in
lepton-nucleus deep inelastic scattering. The cross section is proportional to
A in the dilute limit and to A^(1/3) in the black disc limit, with a large
nuclear suppression due to saturation effects. The t-dependence of the cross
section, if it can be measured accurately enough, is sensitive to the impact
parameter profile of the gluons in the nucleus and their fluctuations, a
quantity that determines the initial conditions of a relativistic heavy ion
collision. The nuclear suppression in incoherent diffraction shows how the
transverse spatial distribution of the gluons in the nucleus gradually becomes
smoother at high energy. Since the values of the momentum transfer |t| involved
are relatively large, this process should be easier to measure in future
nuclear DIS experiments than coherent diffraction.
