Bell's theorem prevents local Kolmogorov-simulations of the singlet state of
two spin-1/2 particles. We derive a positive lower bound for the $L^{2}%
$-distance between the quantum mechanical spin singlet anticorrelation function
$\cos$ and any of its classical approximants $C$ formed by the stationary
autocorrelation functions of mean-square-continuous, $2\pi $-periodic,
$\pm1$-valued, stochastic processes. This bound is given by $\Vert C-\cos\Vert
\geq(1-\frac{8}{\pi^{2}}) /\sqrt{2}\approx0.133\,95.$
