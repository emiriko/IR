Spontaneous CP violation motivates the introduction of two Higgs doublets in
the electroweak theory. Such a simple extension of the standard model has three
neutral Higgs bosons and a pair charged Higgs, especially it leads to rich
CP-violating sources including the induced Kobayashi-Maskawa CP-violating
phase, the mixing of the neutral Higgs bosons due to the CP-odd Higgs and the
effective complex Yukawa couplings of the charged and neutral Higgs bosons.
Within this model, we present the production of a charged Higgs boson in
association with a W boson at the LHC, and calculate in detail the cross
section and the transverse momentum distribution of the associated W boson.
