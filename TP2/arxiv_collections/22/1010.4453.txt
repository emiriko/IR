In March 2009 the well-studied quasar, PG 0844+349, was discovered with Swift
to be in an X-ray weak state. A follow-up XMM-Newton observation several weeks
later generated a good quality spectrum of the source, showing substantial
curvature and spectral hardening. In combination with archival data at two
previous epochs when the source was in a bright state, we examine the long-term
spectral and timing properties of PG 0844+349 spanning nearly ten years and a
factor of ten in brightness. Partial covering and blurred reflection models are
compared to the data at each flux state while attempting to maintain
consistency between the various epochs. In terms of the blurred reflection
model, PG 0844+349 is in a reflection dominated state during the 2009 X-ray
weak observations, which can be understood in terms of light bending. Moreover,
the light bending scenario can also account for the short-term (i.e. ~1000s)
spectral variability in the source. Other models cannot be decisively ruled
out, but we note distinguishing features of the models that can be explored for
in higher signal-to-noise data from current and future observatories.
