We propose a simple deterministic dynamic equation and reveal the mechanism
of large-scale endless evolvement of spatial density inhomogeneity in active
nematic. We determine the phase regions analytically. The interplay of density,
magnitude of nematic order, and nematic director is crucial for the
long-wave-length instability and the emergence of seemingly fluctuated
collective motions. Ordered nematic domains can absorb particles, grow and
divide endlessly. The present finding extends our understanding of the
large-scale and seemingly fluctuated organization in active fluids.
