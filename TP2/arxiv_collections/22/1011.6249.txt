Accurate predictions for both signal and background events at the LHC are of
paramount importance in order to confirm even the smallest deviations from
Standard Model predictions. Next-to-leading order Monte Carlo event generators
are an essential tool to reach that goal. Concerning the charged Higgs boson,
NLO calculations of the production cross section already exist. Reiterating the
calculation using a subtraction formalism enables us to implement the cross
section into Monte Carlo generators, which can then be used by experiments.
