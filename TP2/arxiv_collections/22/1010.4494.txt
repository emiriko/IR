In the Quantum Hall regime, near integer filling factors, electrons should
only be transmitted through spatially-separated edge states. However, in
mesoscopic systems, electronic transmission turns out to be more complex,
giving rise to a large spectrum of magnetoresistance oscillations. To explain
these observations, recent models put forward that, as edge states come close
to each other, electrons can hop between counterpropagating edge channels, or
tunnel through Coulomb islands. Here, we use scanning gate microscopy to
demonstrate the presence of quantum Hall Coulomb islands, and reveal the
spatial structure of transport inside a quantum Hall interferometer. Electron
islands locations are found by modulating the tunneling between edge states and
confined electron orbits. Tuning the magnetic field, we unveil a continuous
evolution of active electron islands. This allows to decrypt the complexity of
high magnetic field magnetoresistance oscillations, and opens the way to
further local scale manipulations of quantum Hall localized states.
