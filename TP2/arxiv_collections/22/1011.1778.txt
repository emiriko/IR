We have carried out numerical simulation based on the equations of radiation
magnetohydrodynamics to study the interaction of solar granules and small-scale
magnetic fields in photospheric regions with various magnetic fluxes. Four
sequences of 2D time-dependent models were calculated for photospheric regions
with average vertical magnetic fluxes of 0, 10, 20, and 30 mT. The models
exhibit no substantial variations in their temperature structure with varying
average field strength, while the density and gas pressure profiles display
gross changes. The solar granulation brightness field also varies substantially
with magnetic flux. The contribution of the small-scale component to the
intensity power spectrum increases with average field strength, whereas the
large-scale component (of about a granule size) contributes less, the total rms
intensity fluctuations being approximately the same. Thus the observed decrease
in rms intensity fluctuations with growing average magnetic flux can be
interpreted as smoothing of the small-scale component in the power spectrum by
the modulation transfer function of the telescope.
