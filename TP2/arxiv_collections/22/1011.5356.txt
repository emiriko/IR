We present a novel numerical method that allows the calculation of nonlinear
force-free magnetostatic solutions above a boundary surface on which only the
distribution of the normal magnetic field component is given. The method relies
on the theory of force-free electrodynamics and applies directly to the
reconstruction of the solar coronal magnetic field for a given distribution of
the photospheric radial field component. The method works as follows: we start
with any initial magnetostatic global field configuration (e.g. zero, dipole),
and along the boundary surface we create an evolving distribution of tangential
(horizontal) electric fields that, via Faraday's equation, give rise to a
respective normal field distribution approaching asymptotically the target
distribution. At the same time, these electric fields are used as boundary
condition to numerically evolve the resulting electromagnetic field above the
boundary surface, modelled as a thin ideal plasma with non-reflecting,
perfectly absorbing outer boundaries. The simulation relaxes to a nonlinear
force-free configuration that satisfies the given normal field distribution on
the boundary. This is different from existing methods relying on a fixed
boundary condition - the boundary evolves toward the a priori given one, at the
same time evolving the three-dimensional field solution above it. Moreover,
this is the first time a nonlinear force-free solution is reached by using only
the normal field component on the boundary. This solution is not unique, but
depends on the initial magnetic field configuration and on the evolutionary
course along the boundary surface. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that the formalism of force-free electrodynamics, used very successfully in
other astrophysical contexts, is applied to the global solar magnetic field.
