We present a multi-channel P2P Video-on-Demand (VoD) system using
"plug-and-play" helpers. Helpers are heterogenous "micro-servers" with limited
storage, bandwidth and number of users they can serve simultaneously. Our
proposed system has the following salient features: (1) it minimizes the server
load; (2) it is distributed, and requires little or no maintenance overhead and
which can easily adapt to system dynamics; and (3) it is adaptable to varying
supply and demand patterns across multiple video channels irrespective of video
popularity. Our proposed solution jointly optimizes over helper-user topology,
video storage allocation and bandwidth allocation. The combinatorial nature of
the problem and the system demand for distributed algorithms makes the problem
uniquely challenging. By utilizing Lagrangian decomposition and Markov chain
approximation based arguments, we address this challenge by designing two
distributed algorithms running in tandem: a primal-dual storage and bandwidth
allocation algorithm and a "soft-worst-neighbor-choking" topology-building
algorithm. Our scheme provably converges to a near-optimal solution, and is
easy to implement in practice. Simulation results validate that the proposed
scheme achieves minimum sever load under highly heterogeneous combinations of
supply and demand patterns, and is robust to system dynamics of user/helper
churn, user/helper asynchrony, and random delays in the network.
