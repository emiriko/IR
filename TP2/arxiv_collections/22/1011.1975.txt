We calculate the probability distributions of quarks in the ground state of
the proton, and how they are affected in the presence of a constant background
magnetic field. We focus on wave functions in the Landau and Coulomb gauges. We
observe the formation of a scalar u-d diquark clustering. The overall
distortion of the quark probability distribution under a very large magnetic
field, as demanded by the quantisation conditions on the field, is quite small.
The effect is to elongate the distributions along the external field axis while
localizing the remainder of the distribution.
