We analyze the common errors of the recent papers in which the solitary wave
solutions of nonlinear differential equations are presented. Seven common
errors are formulated and classified. These errors are illustrated by using
multiple examples of the common errors from the recent publications. We show
that many popular methods in finding of the exact solutions are equivalent each
other. We demonstrate that some authors look for the solitary wave solutions of
nonlinear ordinary differential equations and do not take into account the well
- known general solutions of these equations. We illustrate several cases when
authors present some functions for describing solutions but do not use
arbitrary constants. As this fact takes place the redundant solutions of
differential equations are found. A few examples of incorrect solutions by some
authors are presented. Several other errors in finding the exact solutions of
nonlinear differential equations are also discussed.
