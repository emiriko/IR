We develop a general method to evaluate the Kondo temperature in a multilevel
quantum dot that is weakly coupled to conducting leads. Our theory reveals that
the Kondo temperature is strongly enhanced when the intradot energy-level
spacing is comparable to or smaller than the charging energy. We propose an
experiment to test our result, which consists of measuring the size-dependence
of the Kondo temperature.
