The ATLAS and CMS experiments have collected data at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) since December 2009, and with a collision energy \sprts=7 TeV
since March 2010. Both detectors work remarkably well at this early stage of
operation, and several physics analyses have already been published. It is
currently expected that an integrated luminosity of ~1 fb-1 will be collected
before a 15 month shutdown from early 2012, and that up to 10 (100) fb-1 will
be collected at a collision energy at or near \sqrts=14 Tev by the end of 2013
(2016). Taking account of the outstanding Tevatron results obtained so far, a
perspective is given of key physics measurements using data at the end of 2011
and beyond.
