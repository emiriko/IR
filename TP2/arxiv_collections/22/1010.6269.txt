Chiral effective field theory (ChEFT) is a modern framework to analyze the
properties of few-nucleon systems at low energies. It is based on the most
general effective Lagrangian for pions and nucleons consistent with the chiral
symmetry of QCD. For energies below the pion-production threshold it is
possible to eliminate the pionic degrees of freedom and derive nuclear
potentials and nuclear current operators solely in terms of the nucleonic
degrees of freedom. This is very important because, despite a lot of experience
gained in the past, the consistency between two-nucleon forces, many-nucleon
forces and the corresponding current operators has not been achieved yet. In
this presentation we consider the recently derived long-range two-pion exchange
(TPE) contributions to the nuclear current operator which appear at next-to
leading order of the chiral expansion. These operators do not contain any free
parameters. We study their role in the deuteron photodisintegration reaction
and compare our predictions with experimental data. The bound and scattering
states are calculated using five different chiral N2LO nucleon-nucleon (NN)
potentials which allows to estimate the theoretical uncertainty at a given
order in the chiral expansion. For some observables the results are very close
to the reference predictions based on the AV18 NN potential and the current
operator (partly) consistent with this force.
