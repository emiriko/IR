We present an adaptive multigrid Dirac solver developed for Wilson clover
fermions which offers order-of-magnitude reductions in solution time compared
to conventional Krylov solvers. The solver incorporates even-odd
preconditioning and mixed precision to solve the Dirac equation to double
precision accuracy and shows only a mild increase in time to solution for
decreasing quark mass. We show actual time to solution on production lattices
in comparison to conventional Krylov solvers and will also discuss the setup
process and its relative cost to the total solution time.
