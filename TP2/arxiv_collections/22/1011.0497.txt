Turbulence and angular momentum transport in accretion disks remains a topic
of debate. With the realization that dead zones are robust features of
protoplanetary disks, the search for hydrodynamical sources of turbulence
continues. A possible source is the baroclinic instability (BI), which has been
shown to exist in unmagnetized non-barotropic disks. We present shearing box
simulations of baroclinicly unstable, magnetized, 3D disks, in order to assess
the interplay between the BI and other instabilities, namely the
magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and the magneto-elliptical instability. We
find that the vortices generated and sustained by the baroclinic instability in
the purely hydrodynamical regime do not survive when magnetic fields are
included. The MRI by far supersedes the BI in growth rate and strength at
saturation. The resulting turbulence is virtually identical to an MRI-only
scenario. We measured the intrinsic vorticity profile of the vortex, finding
little radial variation in the vortex core. Nevertheless, the core is disrupted
by an MHD instability, which we identify with the magneto-elliptic instability.
This instability has nearly the same range of unstable wavelengths as the MRI,
but has higher growth rates. In fact, we identify the MRI as a limiting case of
the magneto-elliptic instability, when the vortex aspect ratio tends to
infinity (pure shear flow). We conclude that vortex excitation and
self-sustenance by the baroclinic instability in protoplanetary disks is viable
only in low ionization, i.e., the dead zone. Our results are thus in accordance
with the layered accretion paradigm. A baroclinicly unstable dead zone should
be characterized by the presence of large-scale vortices whose cores are
elliptically unstable, yet sustained by the baroclinic feedback. As magnetic
fields destroy the vortices and the MRI outweighs the BI, the active layers are
unmodified.
