We consider a rotating BEC in an optical lattices in a regime which can be
mapped to the Joseohson junction arrays. In this regime, we formulate the
ground state energy in terms of vortex configuration. This method give us the
vortex lattice in the ground state in a natural way. We apply our result for an
approximation scheme of the problem which we suppose that the coupling of the
Josephson junctions are uniform. Application of method for ladder case
presented and the results compared with Monte-Carlo method numerically.We
discuss about restriction of method and suggest improvement for it.
