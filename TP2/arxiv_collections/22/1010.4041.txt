The Palomar High-precision Astrometric Search for Exoplanet Systems (PHASES)
monitored 51 sub-arcsecond binary systems to determine precision binary orbits,
study the geometries of triple and quadruple star systems, and discover
previously unknown faint astrometric companions as small as giant planets.
PHASES measurements made with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) from
2002 until PTI ceased normal operations in late 2008 are presented. Infrared
differential photometry of several PHASES targets were measured with Keck
Adaptive Optics and are presented.
