We present LDA calculated electronic structure of recently discovered
superconductor SrPt2As2 with Tc=5.2K. Despite its chemical composition and
crystal structure are somehow similar to FeAs-based high-temperature
superconductors, the electronic structure of SrPt2As2 is very much different.
Crystal structure is orthorhombic (or tetragonal if idealized) and has layered
nature with alternating PtAs4 and AsPt4 tetrahedra slabs sandwiched with Sr
ions. The Fermi level is crossed by Pt-5d states with rather strong admixture
of As-4p states. Fermi surface of SrPt2As2 is essentially three dimensional,
with complicated sheets corresponding to multiple bands. We compare SrPt2As2
with 1111 and 122 representatives of FeAs-class of superconductors, as well as
with isovalent (Ba,Sr)Ni2As2 superconductors. Brief discussion of
superconductivity in SrPt2As2 is also presented.
