We present transport measurements of a tunable silicon
metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot device with lateral geometry.
Experimentally extracted gate-to-dot capacitances show that the device is
largely symmetric under the gate voltages applied. Intriguingly, these gate
voltages themselves are not symmetric. Comparison with numerical simulations
indicates that the applied gate voltages serve to offset an intrinsic asymmetry
in the physical device. We also show a transition from a large single dot to
two well isolated coupled dots, where the central gate of the device is used to
controllably tune the interdot coupling.
