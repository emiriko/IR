Hinode's observations revealed a very dynamic and complex chromosphere. This
require revisiting the assumption that the chromospheric footpoints of solar
flares are areas where accelerated particles only lose energy due to
collisions. Traditionally electrons are thought to be accelerated in the
coronal part of the loop, then travel to the footpoints where they lose their
energy and radiate the observed Hard X-ray. Increasing observational evidence
challenges this assumption. We review the evidence against this assumption and
present the new Local Re-acceleration Thick Target Model (LRTTM) where at the
footpoints electrons receive a boost of re-acceleration in addition to the
usual collisional loses. Such model may offer an alternative to the 'standard'
collisional thick target injection model (TTM) (Brown 1971) of solar HXR burst
sources, requiring far fewer electrons and solving some recent problems with
the TTM interpretation. We look at the different scenarios which could lead to
such re-acceleration and present numerical results from one of them.
