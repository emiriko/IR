Based on the recently published generalized Miller formula, we derive the
spectral dependence of the contribution of arbitrary-order non-linear indices
to the group-velocity index. We show that in the context of laser filamentation
in gases all experimentally-accessible orders (up to the $9^{th}$-order
non-linear susceptibility $\chi^{(9)}$ in air and $\chi^{(11)}$ in argon) have
contributions of alternative signs and similar magnitudes. Moreover, we show
both analytically and numerically that the dispersion term of the non-linear
indices must be considered when computing the intensity-dependent group
velocity.
