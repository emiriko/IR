In arXiv:0909.4731 [hep-th], we argued that the free string lightcone
Schrodinger wavefunctional in the vicinity of null Kasner-like cosmological
singularities has nonsingular time-dependence if the Kasner exponents satisfy
certain relations. These backgrounds are anisotropic plane waves with
singularities. We first show here that only certain singularities admit a
Rosen-Kasner frame with exponents satisfying relations leading to a
wavefunctional with nonsingular time-dependence. Then we build on the (Rosen)
description further and study various physical observables for a time-dependent
harmonic oscillator toy model and then the free string, reconciling this with
the corresponding description in the conventional plane wave variables. We find
that observables containing no time derivatives are identical in these
variables while those with time derivatives are different. Various free string
observables are still divergent, perhaps consistent with string oscillator
states becoming light in the vicinity of the singularity.
