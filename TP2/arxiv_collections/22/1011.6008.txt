The effect of non-magnetic Zn impurity on superconductivity in electron-type
pnictide superconductor LaFe$_{0.925-y}$Co$_{0.075}$Zn$_y$AsO is studied
systematically. The optimally doped LaFe$_{0.925}$Co$_{0.075}$AsO without Zn
impurity exhibits superconductivity at $T_c^{mid}$ of 13.2 K, where $T_c^{mid}$
is defiend as the mid-point in the resistive transition. In the presence of Zn
impurity, the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c^{mid}$, is severely
suppressed. The result is consistent with the theoretic prediction on the
effect of non-magnetic impurity in the scenario of $s_{\pm}$ pairing, but it is
in sharp contrast to the previous report on the effect of Zn impurity in the
F-doped systems. The possible interpretation of the different effects of Zn
impurity on superconductivity in different systems is discussed.
