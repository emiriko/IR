We investigate the phase diagram and the BCS-BEC crossover of a homogeneous
three-component ultracold Fermi gas with a U(3) invariant attractive
interaction. We show that the system at sufficiently low temperatures exhibits
population imbalance, as well as fermionic pairing. We describe the crossover
in this system, connecting the weakly interacting BCS regime of the partially
population-imbalanced fermion pairing state and the BEC limit with three weakly
interacting species of molecules, including pairing fluctuations within a
t-matrix calculation of the particle self-energies.
