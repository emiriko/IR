We follow the Feynman procedure to obtain a path integral formulation of loop
quantum cosmology starting from the Hilbert space framework. Quantum geometry
effects modify the weight associated with each path so that the effective
measure on the space of paths is different from that used in the Wheeler-DeWitt
theory. These differences introduce some conceptual subtleties in arriving at
the WKB approximation. But the approximation is well defined and provides
intuition for the differences between loop quantum cosmology and the
Wheeler-DeWitt theory from a path integral perspective.
