Self-gravitating relativistic disks around black holes can form as transient
structures in a number of astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star
and black hole-neutron star coalescences, as well as the core-collapse of
massive stars. We explore the stability of such disks against runaway and
non-axisymmetric instabilities using three-dimensional hydrodynamics
simulations in full general relativity using the THOR code. We model the disk
matter using the ideal fluid approximation with a $\Gamma$-law equation of
state with $\Gamma=4/3$. We explore three disk models around non-rotating black
holes with disk-to-black hole mass ratios of 0.24, 0.17 and 0.11. Due to metric
blending in our initial data, all of our initial models contain an initial
axisymmetric perturbation which induces radial disk oscillations. Despite these
oscillations, our models do not develop the runaway instability during the
first several orbital periods. Instead, all of the models develop unstable
non-axisymmetric modes on a dynamical timescale. We observe two distinct types
of instabilities: the Papaloizou-Pringle and the so-called intermediate type
instabilities. The development of the non-axisymmetric mode with azimuthal
number m = 1 is accompanied by an outspiraling motion of the black hole, which
significantly amplifies the growth rate of the m = 1 mode in some cases.
Overall, our simulations show that the properties of the unstable
non-axisymmetric modes in our disk models are qualitatively similar to those in
Newtonian theory.
