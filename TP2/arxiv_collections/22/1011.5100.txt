For a homogeneous space X of a connected algebraic group G (with connected
stabilizers) over a field k of characteristic zero, we construct a canonical
complex of Galois modules of length 3 and a canonical isomorphism between an
hypercohomology group of this complex and an explicit subgroup of the Brauer
group of X. This result is obtained as a consequence of a formula describing
the "algebraic Brauer group of a torsor", and it generalizes recent results by
Borovoi and van Hamel, by considering non-linear groups G and by taking into
account some transcendental elements in the Brauer group of X.
