We study single top production in association with a charged Higgs in the
type II two Higgs doublet model at the Large Hadron Collider. The polarization
of the top, reflected in the angular distributions of its decay products, can
be a sensitive probe of new physics in its production. We present theoretically
expected polarizations of the top for top charged-Higgs production, which is
significantly different from that in the closely related process of t-W
production in the Standard Model. We then show that an azimuthal symmetry,
constructed from the decay lepton angular distribution in the laboratory frame,
is a sensitive probe of top polarization and can be used to constrain
parameters involved in top charged-Higgs production.
