The origin of the irregular satellites of the giant planets has been long
debated since their discovery. Their dynamical features argue against an
in-situ formation suggesting they are captured bodies, yet there is no global
consensus on the physical process at the basis of their capture. In this paper
we explore the collisional capture scenario, where the actual satellites
originated from impacts occurred within Saturn's influence sphere. By modeling
the inverse capture problem, we estimated the families of orbits of the
possible parent bodies and the specific impulse needed for their capture. The
orbits of these putative parent bodies are compared to those of the minor
bodies of the outer Solar System to outline their possible region of formation.
Finally, we tested the collisional capture hypothesis on Phoebe by taking
advantage of the data supplied by Cassini on its major crater, Jason. Our
results presented a realistic range of solutions matching the observational and
dynamical data.
