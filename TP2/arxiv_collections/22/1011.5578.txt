The dynamics of a phase-separated two-component Bose-Einstein condensate are
investigated, in which a bubble of one component moves through the other
component. Numerical simulations of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation reveal a
variety of dynamics associated with the creation of quantized vortices. In two
dimensions, a circular bubble deforms into an ellipse and splits into fragments
with vortices, which undergo the Magnus effect. The B\'enard--von K\'arm\'an
vortex street is also generated. In three dimensions, a spherical bubble
deforms into toruses with vortex rings. When two rings are formed, they exhibit
leapfrogging dynamics.
