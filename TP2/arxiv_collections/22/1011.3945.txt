We measure the optical conductivity of (SrMnO3)n/(LaMnO3)2n superlattices
(SL) for n=1,3,5, and 8 and 10 < T < 400 K. Data show a T-dependent insulator
to metal transition (IMT) for n \leq 3, driven by the softening of a polaronic
mid-infrared band. At n = 5 that softening is incomplete, while at the
largest-period n=8 compound the MIR band is independent of T and the SL remains
insulating. One can thus first observe the IMT in a manganite system in the
absence of the disorder due to chemical doping. Unsuccessful reconstruction of
the SL optical properties from those of the original bulk materials suggests
that (SrMnO3)n/(LaMnO3)2n heterostructures give rise to a novel electronic
state.
