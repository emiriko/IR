Early work on the iron-arsenide compounds supported the view, that a reduced
dimensionality might be a necessary prerequisite for high-Tc superconductivity.
Later, however, it was found that the zero-temperature upper critical magnetic
field, Hc2(0), for the 122 iron pnictides is in fact rather isotropic. Here, we
report measurements of the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity, \Gamma(T), in Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2 and Ba0.68K0.32Fe2As2 single
crystals in zero magnetic field and for Ba0.68K0.32Fe2As2 as well in static and
pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T. We find that the resistivity of both
compounds in zero field is well described by an exponential term due to
inter-sheet umklapp electron-phonon scattering between light electrons around
the M point to heavy hole sheets at the \Gamma point in reciprocal space. From
our data, we construct an H-T phase diagram for the inter-plane (H || c) and
in-plane (H || ab) directions for Ba0.68K0.32Fe2As2. Contrary to published data
for underdoped 122 FeAs compounds, we find that Hc2(T) is in fact anisotropic
in optimally doped samples down to low temperatures. The anisotropy parameter,
{\gamma} = Habc2/Hcc2, is about 2.2 at Tc. For both field orientations we find
a concave curvature of the Hc2 lines with decreasing anisotropy and saturation
towards lower temperature. Taking into account Pauli spin paramagnetism we
perfectly can describe Hc2(T) and its anisotropy.
