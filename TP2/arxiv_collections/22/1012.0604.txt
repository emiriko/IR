A microwave setup for mode-resolved transport measurement in
quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) structures is presented. We will demonstrate a
technique for direct measurement of the Green's function of the system. With
its help we will investigate quasi-1D structures with various types of
disorder. We will focus on stratified structures, i.e., structures that are
homogeneous perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. In this case
the interaction between different channels is absent, so wave propagation
occurs individually in each open channel. We will apply analytical results
developed in the theory of one-dimensional (1D) disordered models in order to
explain main features of the quasi-1D transport. The main focus will be
selective transport due to long-range correlations in the disorder. In our
setup, we can intentionally introduce correlations by changing the positions of
periodically spaced brass bars of finite thickness. Because of the equivalence
of the stationary Schr\"odinger equation and the Helmholtz equation, the result
can be directly applied to selective electron transport in nanowires,
nanostripes, and superlattices.
