We propose a mean-field, phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau free energy
functional with two competing order parameters for a two-component,
spin-polarized Fermi gas. This free energy supports a tricritical point which
is different from the conventional one and this change offers a correct
understanding of the experimental phase diagram of imbalanced Fermi systems
(Shin et al, Nature, 2008). The specific heat also happens to be different than
in standard theory.
