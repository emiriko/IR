We show that, for arbitrary quantum feedback networks consisting of several
quantum mechanical components connected by quantum fields, the limit of
adiabatic elimination of fast oscillator modes in the components and the limit
of instantaneous transmission along internal quantum field connections commute.
The underlying technique is to show that both limits involve a Schur complement
procedure. The result shows that the frequently used approximations, for
instance to eliminate strongly coupled optical cavities, are mathematically
consistent.
