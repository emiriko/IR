We introduce and study a combinatorially defined notion of root basis of a
(real) root system of a possibly infinite Coxeter group. Known results on
conjugacy up to sign of root bases of certain irreducible finite rank real root
systems are extended to abstract root bases, to a larger class of real root
systems, and, with a short list of (genuine) exceptions, to infinite rank
irreducible Coxeter systems.
