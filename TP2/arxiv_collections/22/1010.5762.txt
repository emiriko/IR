The CGMV method allows for the general discussion of localization properties
for the states of a one-dimensional quantum walk, both in the case of the
integers and in the case of the non negative integers. Using this method we
classify, according to such localization properties, all the quantum walks with
one defect at the origin, providing explicit expressions for the asymptotic
return probabilities at the origin.
