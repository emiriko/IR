We offer a unified approach to the theory of convex minorants of L\'{e}vy
processes with continuous distributions. New results include simple explicit
constructions of the convex minorant of a L\'{e}vy process on both finite and
infinite time intervals, and of a Poisson point process of excursions above the
convex minorant up to an independent exponential time. The Poisson-Dirichlet
distribution of parameter 1 is shown to be the universal law of ranked lengths
of excursions of a L\'{e}vy process with continuous distributions above its
convex minorant on the interval $[0,1]$.
