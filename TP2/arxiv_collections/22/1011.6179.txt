The recently claimed observations of non-negligible amounts of 6Li in old
halo stars have renewed interest in the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) of 6Li.
One important ingredient in the predicted BBN abundance of 6Li is the
low-energy 2H(alpha,gamma)6Li cross section. Up to now, the only available
experimental result for this cross section showed an almost constant
astrophysical S-factor below 400 keV, contrary to theoretical expectations. We
report on a new measurement of the 2H(alpha,gamma)6Li reaction using the
break-up of 6Li at 150 A MeV. Even though we cannot separate experimentally the
Coulomb contribution from the nuclear one, we find clear evidence for
Coulomb-nuclear interference by analyzing the scattering-angular distributions.
This is in-line with our theoretical description which indicates a drop of the
S_24-factor at low energies as predicted also by most other models.
Consequently, we find even lower upper limits for the calculated primordial 6Li
abundance than before.
