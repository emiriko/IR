Soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) is applied to compute electroweak
radiative corrections to Higgs production via gauge boson fusion, q q -> q q H.
There are several novel features which make this process an interesting
application of SCET. The amplitude is proportional to the Higgs vacuum
expectation value (VEV), and so is not a gauge singlet amplitude. Standard
resummation methods require a gauge singlet operator and do not apply here. The
SCET analysis requires operators with both collinear and soft external fields,
with the Higgs VEV being described by an external soft \phi\ field. There is a
scalar soft-collinear transition operator in the SCET Lagrangian which
contributes to the scattering amplitude, and is derived here.
