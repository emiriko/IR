Commutative Replicated Data-Type (CRDT) is a new class of algorithms that
ensures scalable consistency of replicated data. It has been successfully
applied to collaborative editing of texts without complex concurrency control.
In this paper, we present a CRDT to edit XML data. Compared to existing
approaches for XML collaborative editing, our approach is more scalable and
handles all the XML editing aspects : elements, contents, attributes and undo.
Indeed, undo is recognized as an important feature for collaborative editing
that allows to overcome system complexity through error recovery or
collaborative conflict resolution.
