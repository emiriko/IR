We describe SR-POEM, a Galilean test of the weak equivalence principle, which
is to be conducted during the free fall portion of a sounding rocket flight.
This test of a single pair of substances is aimed at a measurement uncertainty
of \sigma(\eta) < 10-16 after averaging the results of eight separate drops,
each of 40 s duration. The weak equivalence principle measurement is made with
a set of four laser gauges that are expected to achieve 0.1 pm/\sqrt{Hz}. We
address the two sources of systematic error that are currently of greatest
concern, magnetic force and electrostatic (patch effect) force on the test mass
assemblies. The discovery of a violation (\eta \not= 0) would have profound
implications for physics, astrophysics and cosmology.
