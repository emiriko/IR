The distance-redshift relation plays an important role in cosmology. In the
standard approach to cosmology it is assumed that this relation is the same as
in the homogeneous universe. As the real universe is not homogeneous there are
several methods to calculate the correction. The weak lensing approximation and
the Dyer-Roeder relation are one of them. This paper establishes a link between
these two approximations. It is shown that if the universe is homogeneous with
only small, vanishing after averaging, density fluctuations along the line of
sight, then the distance correction is negligible. It is also shown that a
vanishing 3D average of density fluctuations does not imply that the mean of
density fluctuations along the line of sight is zero. In this case, even within
the linear approximation, the distance correction is not negligible. The
modified version of the Dyer-Roeder relation is presented and it is shown that
this modified relation is consistent with the correction obtained within the
weak lensing approximation. The correction to the distance for a source at z ~
2 is of order of a few percent. Thus, with an increasing precision of
cosmological observations an accurate estimation of the distance is essential.
Otherwise errors due to miscalculation the distance can become a major source
of systematics.
