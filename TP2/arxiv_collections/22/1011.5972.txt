We propose an example of smooth autonomous system governed by differential
delay equation manifesting chaotic dynamics apparently associated with
hyperbolic attractor of Smale - Williams type. The general idea is to depart
from a system generating successive pulses of oscillations, each of which gives
rise to the next one with transformation of the phase in accordance with
chaotic Bernoulli map. From mathematical point of view, it is an
infinite-dimensional system due to presence of the time delay. Nevertheless,
the material we present gives a foundation to assert that the model delivers an
example of a small-dimensional hyperbolic strange attractor, embedded in the
infinite-dimensional phase space.
