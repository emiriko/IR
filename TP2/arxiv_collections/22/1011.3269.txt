Transfer printing methods are used to pattern and assemble monolithic carbon
nanotube (CNT) thin-film transistors on large-area transparent, flexible
substrates. Airbrushed CNT thin-films with sheet resistance 1kOhmsquare^{-1} at
80% transparency were used as electrodes, and high quality chemical vapor
deposition (CVD)-grown CNT networks were used as the semiconductor component.
Transfer printing was used to pre-pattern and assemble thin film transistors on
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates which incorporated
Al_{2}O_{3}/poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA) dielectric bi-layer. CNT-based
ambipolar devices exhibit field-effect mobility in range 1 - 33 cm^{2}/Vs and
on/off ratio ~10^{3}, comparable to the control devices fabricated using Au as
the electrode material.
