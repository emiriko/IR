We study the one-dimensional quantum critical spin systems with the
sine-square deformation, in which the energy scale in the Hamiltonian at the
position $x$ is modified by the function $f_x = \sin^2\left[{\pi}{L}(x-1/2)]$,
where $L$ is the length of the system. By investigating the entanglement
entropy, spin correlation functions, and wave-function overlap, we show that
the sine-square deformation changes the topology of the geometrical connection
of the ground state drastically; Although the system apparently has open edges,
the sine-square deformation links those ends and realizes the periodic ground
state at the level of wave function. Our results propose a new method to
control the topology of quantum states by energy-scale deformation.
