Extreme conditions in natural flows are examined, starting with a turbulent
big bang. A hydro-gravitational-dynamics cosmology model is adopted.
Planck-Kerr turbulence instability causes Planck-particle turbulent combustion.
Inertial-vortex forces induce a non-turbulent kinetic energy cascade to
Planck-Kolmogorov scales where vorticity is produced, overcoming 10^113 Pa
Planck-Fortov pressures. The spinning, expanding fireball has a slight deficit
of Planck antiparticles. Space and mass-energy powered by gluon viscous
stresses expand exponentially at speeds >10^25 c. Turbulent temperature and
spin fluctuations fossilize at scales larger than ct, where c is light speed
and t is time. Because "dark-energy" antigravity forces vanish when inflation
ceases, and because turbulence produces entropy, the universe is closed and
will collapse and rebound. Density and spin fossils of big bang turbulent
mixing trigger structure formation in the plasma epoch. Fragmenting
protosuperclustervoids and protoclustervoids produce weak turbulence until the
plasma-gas transition give chains of protogalaxies with the morphology of
turbulence. Chain galaxy clusters observed at large redshifts ~8.6 support this
interpretation. Protogalaxies fragment into clumps, each with a trillion
Earth-mass H-He gas planets. These make stars, supernovae, the first chemicals,
the first oceans and the first life soon after the cosmological event.
