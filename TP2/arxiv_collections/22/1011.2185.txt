In $e^+e^-$ collisions, transverse beam polarization can be a useful tool in
studying the properties of particles associated with new physics beyond the
Standard Model(SM). However, unlike in the case of measurements associated with
longitudinal polarization, the formation of azimuthal asymmetries used to probe
this physics in the case of transverse polarization requires both $e^\pm$ beams
to be simultaneously polarized. In this paper we discuss the further use of
transverse polarization as a probe of new physics models at a high energy,
$\sqrt s=3$ TeV version of CLIC. In particular, we show ($i$) how measurements
of the sign of these asymmetries is sufficient to discriminate the production
of spin-0 supersymmetric states from the spin-1/2 Kaluza-Klein excitations of
Universal Extra Dimensions. Simultaneously, the contribution to this asymmetry
arising from the potentially large SM $W^+W^-$ background can be made
negligibly small. We then show ($ii$) how measurements of such asymmetries and
their associated angular distributions on the peak of a new resonant $Z'$-like
state can be used to extract precision information on the $Z'$ couplings to the
SM fermions.
