Bayesian networks are basic graphical models, used widely both in statistics
and artificial intelligence. These statistical models of conditional
independence structure are described by acyclic directed graphs whose nodes
correspond to (random) variables in consideration. A quite important topic is
the learning of Bayesian network structures, which is determining the best
fitting statistical model on the basis of given data. Although there are
learning methods based on statistical conditional independence tests,
contemporary methods are mainly based on maximization of a suitable quality
criterion that evaluates how good the graph explains the occurrence of the
observed data. This leads to a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem
that is in general NP-hard to solve. In this paper we deal with the complexity
of learning restricted Bayesian network structures, that is, we wish to find
network structures of highest score within a given subset of all possible
network structures. For this, we introduce a new unique algebraic
representative for these structures, called the characteristic imset. We show
that these imsets are always 0-1-vectors and that they have many nice
properties that allow us to simplify long proofs for some known results and to
easily establish new complexity results for learning restricted Bayes network
structures.
