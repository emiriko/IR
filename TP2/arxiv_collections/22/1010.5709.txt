We apply the Painleve test for integrability of partial differential
equations to a system of two coupled Burgers-type equations found by Foursov,
which was recently shown by Sergyeyev to possess infinitely many commuting
local generalized symmetries without any recursion operator. The Painleve
analysis easily detects that this is a typical C-integrable system in the
Calogero sense and rediscovers its linearizing transformation.
