In this contribution we analyse the cross sections for the exclusive vector
meson production as well as the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS)
relying on the color dipole approach and considering the numerical solution of
the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation including running coupling corrections.
Comparisons to DESY-HERA data on exclusive processes and predictions to the
Large Hadron Electron Collider, LHeC, are presented.
