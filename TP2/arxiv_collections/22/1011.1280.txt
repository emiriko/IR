Focusing on the DNA-bridging nucleoid proteins Fis and H-NS, and integrating
several independent experimental and bioinformatic data sources, we investigate
the links between chromosomal spatial organization and global transcriptional
regulation. By means of a novel multi-scale spatial aggregation analysis, we
uncover the existence of contiguous clusters of nucleoid-perturbation sensitive
genes along the genome, whose expression is affected by a combination of
topological DNA state and nucleoid-shaping protein occupancy. The clusters
correlate well with the macrodomain structure of the genome. The most
significant of them lay symmetrically at the edges of the ter macrodomain and
involve all of the flagellar and chemotaxis machinery, in addition to key
regulators of biofilm formation, suggesting that the regulation of the physical
state of the chromosome by the nucleoid proteins plays an important role in
coordinating the transcriptional response leading to the switch between a
motile and a biofilm lifestyle.
