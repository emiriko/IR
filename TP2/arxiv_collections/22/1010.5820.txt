Using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy the excitation of
uniform precession modes in individual domains of a weakly coupled spin-valve
system has been studied. A coupling dependence of the precession frequencies
has been found that can be reasonably well understood on the basis of a
macrospin model. By tuning the frequency of the excitation source the uniform
precession modes are excited in a resonant way.
