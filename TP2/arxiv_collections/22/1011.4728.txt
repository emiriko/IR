We have studied the stability of low degree $g$-modes in uniformly rotating
B-type stars, taking into account the effects of the Coriolis force and the
rotational deformation. From an analysis treating rotation frequency as a small
parameter it is found that slow rotation tends to $destabilize$ high
radial-order $retrograde$ $g$-modes, although the effect is very small or
absent for relatively low order modes. Calculating eigenfrequencies at selected
rotation rates, we find, on the other hand, that rapid rotation tends to
$stabilize$ $retrograde$ $g$-modes. The stabilizing effect appears stronger for
less massive B-type stars having low effective temperatures. If we change
rotation rate continuously, the frequency of a $g$-mode belonging to ($l', m$)
crosses frequencies of other $g$-modes belonging to ($l', m$). If the parity of
the two encountering modes are the same, they interact each other and the
stability (i.e., imaginary part of eigenfrequency) of each mode is modified.
Using an asymptotic method we discuss the property of such mode crossings and
couplings. For rapidly rotating stars mode couplings are important for the
stability of low degree $g$-modes. In particular, we find that the
stabilization of retrograde $g$-modes in rapidly rotating stars is due to many
strong mode couplings, while %prograde sectoral% modes are exceptionally immune
to the damping effects from the mode couplings.
