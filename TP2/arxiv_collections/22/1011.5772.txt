We discuss how to extract observables from an inhomogeneous vertex
Bethe-Salpeter equation without resorting to the corresponding homogeneous
equation. As an example we present a prediction for the $e^+e^-$ decay width of
the $\rho(1450)$ or $\rho'$ meson. We also attempt to identify the momentum
range contributing to a vector meson's decay constant.
