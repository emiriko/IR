The main goal of this thesis is to study the physical processes that can
produce non-thermal emission at high energies in astrophysical objects capable
to accelerate particles up to relativistic velocities. In particular, we have
studied the gamma-ray emission produced in cosmic sources with different
spatial scales, from young stellar objects to clusters of galaxies, going
through microquasars and active galactic nuclei. In the former cases, we have
modeled the gamma-ray emission using the radio data from the sources IRAS
16547-4247 and Abell 3376. In the latter, we have developed a specific
radiation model based on the interaction of the inhomogeneities of the external
medium with the jets generated by the compact object. Specifically, we have
considered clumps of the massive stellar wind in microquasars, and clouds of
the broad line region in active galactic nuclei, interacting with the jets of
the sources. In all cases, the developed models allow us to make predictions
testables with the new generation of instruments operating at high energies,
such as the satellites Fermi and AGILE, and the Cherenkov telescopes HESS,
MAGIC, and the forthcoming CTA.
