We report on previously overlooked solutions of the usual gauge
transformation equations that exhibit a new form of nonlocal quantal behavior
with the well-known Relativistic Causality of classical fields affecting
directly the phases of wavefunctions. The new nonlocalities compete with
Aharonov-Bohm behaviors and they provide: a correction to a number of erroneous
results in the literature, a new interpretation of semiclassical observations
and further extensions to delocalized states, a natural remedy of earlier
"paradoxes", and a new formulation in the study of time-dependent
slit-experiments.
