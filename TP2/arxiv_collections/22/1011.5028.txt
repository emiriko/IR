Ab initio random structure searching with density functional theory was used
to determine the zero-temperature structures of atomic metallic hydrogen from
500 GPa to 5 TPa. Including zero point motion in the harmonic approximation, we
estimate that molecular hydrogen dissociates into a monatomic body-centered
tetragonal structure near 500 GPa (r_s = 1.225), which then remains stable to
2.5 TPa (r_s = 0.969). At higher pressures, hydrogen stabilizes in an
...ABCABC... planar structure that is remarkably similar to the ground state of
lithium, which compresses to the face-centered cubic lattice beyond 5 TPa (r_s
< 0.86). At this level of theory, our results provide a complete ab initio
description of the atomic metallic structures of hydrogen, resolving one of the
most fundamental and long outstanding issues concerning the structures of the
elements.
