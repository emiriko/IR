We use inelastic neutron scattering to show that the spin waves in the iron
chalcogenide Fe$_{1.05}$Te display novel dispersion clearly different from
those in the related iron pnictide systems. By fitting the spin waves to a
Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we extract magnetic exchange couplings that are
dramatically different from both predictions by density functional calculations
and measurements on the iron pnictide CaFe$_2$As$_2$. While the
nearest-neighbor exchange couplings in CaFe$_2$As$_2$ and Fe$_{1.05}$Te are
quite different, their next-nearest-neighbor exchange couplings are similar.
These results suggest that superconductivity in the pnictides and chalcogenides
share a common magnetic origin that is intimately associated with the
next-nearest-neighbor magnetic coupling between the irons.
