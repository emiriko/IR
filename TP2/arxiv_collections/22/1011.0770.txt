We report new radio-continuum observations with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) of the region surrounding the peculiar galaxy pair ESO
295-IG022, at the centre of the poor cluster Abell S0102. We observed this
cluster at wavelengths of lambda=20/13 and 6/3 cm with the ATCA 6 km array.
With these configurations, we achieved a resolution of ~2" at 3 cm which is
sufficient to resolve the jet-like structure of ~3' length detected at 20 cm.
From our new high resolution images at 6 and 3 cm we confirm the presence of a
double jet structure, most likely originating from the northern galaxy
(ESO295-IG022-N), bent and twisted towards the south. We found the spectral
index of the jet to be very steep (alpha=-1.32). No point source was detected
that could be associated with the core of ESO 295-IG022-N. On the other hand,
ESO 295-IG022-S does not show any jet structure, but does show a point radio
source. This source has variable flux and spectral index, and appears to be
superposed on the line-of-sight of the jets (seen at 20-cm) originating from
the northern galaxy ESO 295-IG022-N. Finally, regions of very high and somewhat
well ordered polarisation were detected at the level of 70%.
