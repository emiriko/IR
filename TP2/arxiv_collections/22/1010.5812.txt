The radio properties of blazars detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on
board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope have been observed as part of the
VLBA Imaging and Polarimetry Survey (VIPS). This large, flux-limited sample of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides insights into the mechanism that produces
strong gamma-ray emission. At lower flux levels, radio flux density does not
directly correlate with gamma-ray flux. We find that the LAT-detected BL Lacs
tend to be similar to the non-LAT BL Lacs, but that the LAT-detected FSRQs are
often significantly different from the non-LAT FSRQs. The differences between
the gamma-ray loud and quiet FSRQs can be explained by Doppler boosting; these
objects appear to require larger Doppler factors than those of the BL Lacs. It
is possible that the gamma-ray loud FSRQs are fundamentally different from the
gamma-ray quiet FSRQs. Strong polarization at the base of the jet appears to be
a signature for gamma-ray loud AGN.
