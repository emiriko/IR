We discuss the phase structure of dense matter, in particular the nature of
the transition between hadronic and quark matter. Calculations within a
Ginzburg-Landau approach show that the axial anomaly can induce a critical
point in this transition region. This is possible because in three-flavor quark
matter with instanton effects a chiral condensate can be added to the
color-flavor locked (CFL) phase without changing the symmetries of the ground
state. In (massless) two-flavor quark matter such a critical point is not
possible since the corresponding color superconductor (2SC) does not break
chiral symmetry. We study the effects of a nonzero but finite strange quark
mass which interpolates between these two cases. Since at ultra-high density
the first reaction of CFL to a nonzero strange quark mass is to develop a kaon
condensate, we extend previous Ginzburg-Landau studies by including such a
condensate. We discuss the fate of the critical point systematically and show
that the continuity between hadronic and quark matter can be disrupted by the
onset of a kaon condensate. Moreover, we identify the mass terms in the
Ginzburg-Landau potential which are needed for the 2SC phase to occur in the
phase diagram.
