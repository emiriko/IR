The dynamics of a qubit under the decoherence of a two level fluctuator (TLF)
in addition to its coupling to a bosonic bath is investigated theoretically.
Two different methods are applied and compared for this problem. One is a
perturbation method based on a unitary transformation. With the merit of our
unitary transformation, non-adiabatic effect can be taken into account
efficiently. And the other one is the numerically exact method, namely the
quasi-adiabatic path-integral (QUAPI) propagator technique. We find that the
analytical method works well for a wide parameter range and show good agreement
with QUAPI. On the other hand, The enhancement and the reduction of quantum
decoherence of the qubit is checked with varying bath temperature $T$ and
TLF-bath coupling.
