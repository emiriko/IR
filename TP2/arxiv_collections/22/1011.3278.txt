We recently found that marine bacteria Vibrio alginolyticus execute a cyclic
3-step (run- reverse-flick) motility pattern that is distinctively different
from the 2-step (run-tumble) pattern of Escherichia coli. How this novel
swimming pattern is regulated by cells of V. alginolyticus is not currently
known, but its significance for bacterial chemotaxis is self- evident and will
be delineated herein. Using an approach introduced by de Gennes, we calculated
the migration speed of a cell executing the 3-step pattern in a linear chemical
gradient, and found that a biphasic chemotactic response arises naturally. The
implication of such a response for the cells to adapt to ocean environments and
its possible connection to E. coli 's response are also discussed.
