Inhomogeneous distribution of the pinning force in superconductor results in
a magnetization asymmetry. A model considering the field distribution in
superconductor was developed and symmetric and asymmetric magnetization loops
of porous and textured Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} were fitted.
It is found that the thermal equilibrium magnetization realizes in crystals
smaller than some size depending on temperature and magnetic field.
