One of the fastest evolving field among teaching and learning research is
students' performance evaluation. Computer based testing systems are
increasingly adopted by universities. However, the implementation and
maintenance of such a system and its underlying item bank is a challenge for an
inexperienced tutor. Therefore, this paper discusses the advantages and
disadvantages of Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) systems compared to Computer
Based Test systems. Furthermore, a few item selection strategies are compared
in order to overcome the item exposure drawback of such systems. The paper also
presents our CAT system along its development steps. Besides, an item
difficulty estimation technique is presented based on data taken from our
self-assessment system.
