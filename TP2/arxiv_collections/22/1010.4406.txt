Under the Basel II standards, the Operational Risk (OpRisk) advanced
measurement approach allows a provision for reduction of capital as a result of
insurance mitigation of up to 20%. This paper studies the behaviour of
different insurance policies in the context of capital reduction for a range of
possible extreme loss models and insurance policy scenarios in a multi-period,
multiple risk settings. A Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) for modelling of
the annual loss process, involving homogeneous compound Poisson processes for
the annual losses, with heavy tailed severity models comprised of alpha-stable
severities is considered. There has been little analysis of such models to date
and it is believed, insurance models will play more of a role in OpRisk
mitigation and capital reduction in future. The first question of interest is
when would it be equitable for a bank or financial institution to purchase
insurance for heavy tailed OpRisk losses under different insurance policy
scenarios? The second question then pertains to Solvency II and addresses what
the insurers capital would be for such operational risk scenarios under
different policy offerings. In addition we consider the insurers perspective
with respect to fair premium as a percentage above the expected annual claim
for each insurance policy. The intention being to address questions related to
VaR reduction under Basel II, SCR under Solvency II and fair insurance premiums
in OpRisk for different extreme loss scenarios. In the process we provide
closed form solutions for the distribution of loss process and claims process
in an LDA structure as well as closed form analytic solutions for the Expected
Shortfall, SCR and MCR under Basel II and Solvency II. We also provide closed
form analytic solutions for the annual loss distribution of multiple risks
including insurance mitigation.
