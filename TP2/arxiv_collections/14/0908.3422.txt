The relation between the dynamical regimes (weak and strong coupling) and
entanglement for a dissipative quantum - dot microcavity system is studied. In
the framework of a phenomenological temperature model an analysis in both,
temporal (population dynamics) and frequency domain (photoluminescence) is
carried out in order to identify the associated dynamical behavior. The Wigner
function and concurrence are employed to quantify the entanglement in each
regime. We find that sudden death of entanglement is a typical characteristic
of the strong coupling regime.
