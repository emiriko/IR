Neutrino tribimaximal mixing is obtained from the breaking of A_4 to Z_3 in
the charged-lepton sector and to Z_2 in the neutrino sector. To enforce this
conflicting pattern, extra particles and symmetries are usually invoked, often
accompanied by nonrenormalizable interactions and even extra dimensions. It is
shown here in a specific renormalizable model how A_4 alone will accomplish
this, with only the help of lepton number.
