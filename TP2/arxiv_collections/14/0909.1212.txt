Precise absolute far-infra-red magneto-transmission experiments have been
performed in magnetic fields up to 33 T on a series of single GaAs quantum
wells doped at different levels. The transmission spectra have been simulated
with a multilayer dielectric model. The imaginary part of the optical response
function which reveals new singular features related to the electron-phonon
interactions has been extracted. In addition to the expected polaronic effects
due to the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon of GaAs, a new kind of carrier
concentration dependent interaction with interface phonons is observed. A
simple physical model is used to try to quantify these interactions and explore
their origin.
