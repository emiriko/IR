Intraband cyclotron resonance (CR) transitions of a two-electron quantum dot
containing a single magnetic ion is investigated for different Coulomb
interaction strengths and different positions of the magnetic ion. In contrast
to the usual parabolic quantum dots where CR is independent of the number of
electrons, we found here that due to the presence of the magnetic ion Kohn's
theorem no longer holds and CR is different for systems with different number
of electrons and different effective electron-electron Coulomb interaction
strength. Many-body effects result in \emph{shifts in the transition energies}
and \emph{change the number of CR lines}. The position of the magnetic ion
inside the quantum dot affects the structure of the CR spectrum by changing the
position and the number of crossings and anti-crossings in the transition
energies and oscillator strengths.
