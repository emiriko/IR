Critical current density of composite free layer (CFL) in magnetic tunneling
junction is investigated. CFL consists of two exchange coupled ferromagnetic
layers, where the coupling is parallel or anti-parallel. Instability condition
of the CFL under the spin transfer torque, which is related with critical
current density, is obtained by analytic spin wave excitation model and
confirmed by macro-spin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The critical current
densities for the coupled two identical layers are investigated with various
coupling strengths, and spin transfer torque efficiencies.
