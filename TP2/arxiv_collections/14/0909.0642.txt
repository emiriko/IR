We present a model for neutrino-nucleus scattering in the energy region
relevant for present and forthcoming neutrino-oscillation experiments. The
model is based on the RPA treatment of the nuclear responses in the
quasi-elastic and Delta-resonance region. It includes also in a
phenomenological way nucleon knock-out. It aims at the description, within a
single framework, of several final state channels i.e. quasi-elastic,
incoherent and coherent one-pion production and two- or several-nucleon
knock-out.
