C. Ragoonatha Chary, the first assistant at Madras Observatory during 1864 to
1880 was not only a celebrated observational astronomer but also a person who
emphasized the need for incorporating modern observations based improvements
into the traditional methods of astronomical calculations. He was one of the
first few people who argued for establishment of independent modern Indian
observatory for education and training. He was credited with the discovery of
two variable stars R Reticuli and another star whose identity is uncertain. The
person and his variable star discoveries are discussed.
