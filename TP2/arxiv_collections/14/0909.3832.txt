We follow Paper I with predictions of how gas leaking through the lunar
surface could influence the regolith, as might be observed via optical
Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLPs) and related effects. We touch on several
processes, but concentrate on low and high flow rate extremes, perhaps the most
likely. We model explosive outgassing for the smallest gas overpressure at the
regolith base that releases the regolith plug above it. This disturbance's
timescale and affected area are consistent with observed TLPs; we also discuss
other effects. For slow flow, escape through the regolith is prolonged by low
diffusivity. Water, found recently in deep magma samples, is unique among
candidate volatiles, capable of freezing between the regolith base and surface,
especially near the lunar poles. For major outgassing sites, we consider the
possible accumulation of water ice. Over geological time ice accumulation can
evolve downward through the regolith. Depending on gases additional to water,
regolith diffusivity might be suppressed chemically, blocking seepage and
forcing the ice zone to expand to larger areas, up to square km scales, again,
particularly at high latitudes. We propose an empirical path forward, wherein
current and forthcoming technologies provide controlled, sensitive probes of
outgassing. The optical transient/outgassing connection, addressed via
Earth-based remote sensing, suggests imaging and/or spectroscopy, but aspects
of lunar outgassing might be more covert, as indicated above. TLPs betray some
outgassing, but does outgassing necessarily produces TLPs? We also suggest more
intrusive techniques from radar to in-situ probes. Many of these approaches
should be practiced in a pristine lunar atmosphere, before significant
confusing signals likely to be produced upon humans returning to the Moon.
