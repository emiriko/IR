We have performed simulations to study how increasing humidity affects the
structure of Nafion-like ionomers under conditions of low sulfonate
concentration and low humidity. At the onset of membrane hydration, the
clusters split into smaller parts. These subsequently swell, but then maintain
constant the number of sulfonates per cluster. We find that the distribution of
water in low-sulfonate membranes depends strongly on the sulfonate
concentration. For a relatively low sulfonate concentration, nearly all the
side-chain terminal groups are within cluster formations, and the average water
loading per cluster matches the water content of membrane. However, for a
relatively higher sulfonate concentration the water-to-sulfonate ratio becomes
non-uniform. The clusters become wetter, while the inter-cluster bridges become
drier. We note the formation of unusual shells of water-rich material that
surround the sulfonate clusters.
