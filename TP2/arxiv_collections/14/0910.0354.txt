The influence of the heating mechanism on the kinetic energy densities of the
components of a vibrated granular mixture is investigated. Collisions of the
particles with the vibrating wall are inelastic and characterized by two
coefficients of normal restitution, one for each of the two species. By means
of molecular dynamics simulations, it is shown that the non-equipartition of
kinetic energy is not affected by the differential mechanism of energy
injection, aside the usual boundary layer around the wall. The macroscopic
state of the mixture in the bulk is defined by intensive variables that do not
include the partial granular temperatures of the components.
