The Mount Wilson Ca HK survey revealed magnetic activity variations in a
large sample of solar-type stars with timescales ranging from 2.5 to 25 years.
This broad range of cycle periods is thought to reflect differences in the
rotational properties and the depths of the surface convection zones for stars
with various masses and ages. Asteroseismic data will soon provide direct
measurements of these quantities for individual stars, but many of the most
promising targets are in the southern sky (e.g., alpha Cen A & B, beta Hyi, mu
Ara, tau Cet, nu Ind), while long-term magnetic activity cycle surveys are
largely confined to the north. In 2007 we began using the SMARTS 1.5-m
telescope to conduct a long-term monitoring campaign of Ca II H & K emission
for a sample of 57 southern solar-type stars to measure their magnetic activity
cycles and their rotational properties when possible. This sample includes the
most likely southern asteroseismic targets to be observed by the Stellar
Oscillations Network Group (SONG), currently scheduled to begin operations in
2012. We present selected results from the first two years of the survey, and
from the longer time baseline sampled by a single-epoch survey conducted in
1992.
