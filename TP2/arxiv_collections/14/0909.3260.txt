Additional Z' gauge bosons are predicted by a wide variety of extensions of
the standard model (SM). Possibilities include TeV-scale bosons with
electroweak coupling, very light bosons which nearly decouple from the standard
model particles, and bosons which communicate with a quasi-hidden sector. A
broad survey is given of the theoretical possibilities and of the physics
implications for particle physics and cosmology. Several novel examples,
including light Z's suggested by PAMELA, Stueckelberg Z's, and Z's associated
with the mediation of supersymmetry breaking, are described.
