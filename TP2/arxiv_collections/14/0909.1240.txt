If large-angle multigluon radiation gives significant contributions to parton
showers in the LHC high-energy region, appropriate generalizations of parton
branching methods are required for Monte Carlo simulations of exclusive
high-multiplicity final states.
  We discuss the use in this context of transverse-momentum dependent kernels
which factorize in the region of high energies. We give examples based on ep
and p pbar multi-jet data, and point to possible developments for distributions
associated with massive final states at the LHC.
