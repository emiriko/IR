If electroweak symmetry breaking arises via strongly-coupled physics, the
observed suppression of flavour-changing processes suggests that fermion masses
should arise via mixing of elementary fermions with composite fermions of the
strong sector. The strong sector then carries colour charge, and may contain
composite leptoquark states, arising either as TeV scale resonances, or even as
light, pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The latter, since they are coupled to
colour, get a mass of the order of several hundred GeV, beyond the reach of
current searches at the Tevatron. The same generic mechanism that suppresses
flavour-changing processes suppresses leptoquark-mediated rare processes,
making it conceivable that the many stringent constraints may be evaded. The
leptoquarks couple predominantly to third-generation quarks and leptons, and
the prospects for discovery at LHC appear to be good. As an illustration, a
model based on the Pati-Salam symmetry is described, and its embedding in
models with a larger symmetry incorporating unification of gauge couplings,
which provide additional motivation for leptoquark states at or below the TeV
scale, is discussed.
