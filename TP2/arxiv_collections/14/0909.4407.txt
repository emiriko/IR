ICE-T (International Concordia Explorer Telescope) is a double 60 cm f/1.1
photometric robotic telescope, on a parallactic mount, which will operate at
Dome C, in the long Antarctic night, aiming to investigate exoplanets and
activity of the hosting stars. Antarctic Plateau site is well known to be one
of the best in the world for observations because of sky transparency in all
wavelengths and low scintillation noise. Due to the extremely harsh
environmental conditions (the lowest average temperature is -80$^\circ$C) the
criteria adopted for an optimal design are really challenging. Here we present
the strategies we have adopted so far to fulfill the mechanical and optical
requirements.
