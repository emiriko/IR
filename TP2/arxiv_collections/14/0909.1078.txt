Using simple stellar population synthesis, we model the bulge stellar
contribution in the optical spectrum of a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE
J1034+396. We find that its bulge stellar velocity dispersion is $67.7\pm 8$
\kms. The supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass is about $(1-4)\times 10^6 \msun$
if it follows the well-known $\mbh-\sigma_*$ relation found in quiescent
galaxies. We also derive the SMBH mass from the H$\beta$ second moment, which
is consistent with that from its bulge stellar velocity dispersion. The SMBH
mass of $(1-4)\times 10^6 \msun$ implies that the X-ray quasi-periodic
oscillation (QPO) of RE J1034+396 can be scaled to a high-frequency QPO at
27-108 Hz found in Galactic black hole binaries with a 10 $\msun$ black hole.
With the mass distribution in different age stellar populations, we find that
the mean specific star formation rate (SSFR) over past 0.1 Gyr is $0.0163\pm
0.0011$ $\rm Gyr^{-1}$, the stellar mass in the logarithm is $10.155\pm 0.06$
in units of solar mass, and the current star formation rate is $0.23\pm 0.016
\msun \rm yr^{-1}$. RE J1034+396 does not follow the relation between the
Eddington ratio and the SSFR suggested by Chen et al., although a larger
scatter in their relation. We also suggest that about 7.0% of the total \ha
luminosity and 50% of the total \oii luminosity come from the star formation
process.
