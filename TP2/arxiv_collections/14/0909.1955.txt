The nonlinear evolution of relativistic magnetic reconnection in sheared
magnetic configuration (with a guide field) is investigated by using
two-dimensional relativistic two-fluid simulations. Relativistic guide field
reconnection features the charge separation and the guide field compression in
and around the outflow channel. As the guide field increases, the composition
of the outgoing energy changes from enthalpy-dominated to Poynting-dominated.
The inertial effects of the two-fluid model play an important role to sustain
magnetic reconnection. Implications for the single fluid magnetohydrodynamic
approach and the physics models of relativistic reconnection are briefly
addressed.
