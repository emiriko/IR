While Saturn's moon Titan appears to support an active methane hydrological
cycle, no direct evidence for surface-atmosphere exchange has yet appeared. It
is possible that the identified lake-features could be filled with ethane, an
involatile long term residue of atmospheric photolysis; the apparent stream and
channel features could be ancient from a previous climate; and the tropospheric
methane clouds, while frequent, could cause no rain to reach the surface. We
report here the detection of fog at the south pole of Titan during late summer
using observations from the VIMS instrument on board the Cassini spacecraft.
While terrestrial fog can form from a variety of causes, most of these
processes are inoperable on Titan. Fog on Titan can only be caused by
evaporation of liquid methane; the detection of fog provides the first direct
link between surface and atmospheric methane. Based on the detections presented
here, liquid methane appears widespread at the south pole of Titan in late
southern summer, and the hydrolgical cycle on Titan is current active.
