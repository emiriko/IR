We present results from a study of proto-globular cluster candidates in the
interacting galaxy system Arp 284 (NGC 7714/5). Studies of the Antennae and M51
have suggested that the majority of these star clusters dissolve within 20 Myr
due to mass loss. We obtain cluster colors using archival \emph{HST} data, and
estimate ages and extinctions for over 150 clusters using evolutionary
synthesis models. We find that clusters in NGC 7714 are generally less than 20
Myr old, while the data in the bridge is too limited to allow good estimates
for individual clusters. We also examine {H {\sc ii}} region complexes with
lower-resolution \emph{GALEX} and ground-based H$\alpha$ images. Several of
these regions appear to be much older than the detected clusters within them,
which may indicate the presence of an older, unresolved population of low mass
or dispersed clusters.
