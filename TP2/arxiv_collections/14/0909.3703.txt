The aftermath of supernova (SN) 1987A continues to provide spectacular
insights into the interaction between a SN blastwave and its circumstellar en-
vironment. We here present 36 GHz observations from the Australia Telescope
Compact Array of the radio remnant of SN 1987A. These new images, taken in 2008
Apr and 2008 Oct, substantially extend the frequency range of an ongo- ing
monitoring and imaging program conducted between 1.4 and 20 GHz. Our 36.2 GHz
images have a diffraction-limited angular resolution of 0.3-0.4 arcseconds,
which covers the gap between high resolution, low dynamic range VLBI images of
the remnant and low resolution, high dynamic range images at frequencies
between 1 and 20 GHz. The radio morphology of the remnant at 36 GHz is an
elliptical ring with enhanced emission on the eastern and western sides,
similar to that seen previously at lower frequencies. Model fits to the data in
the Fourier domain show that the emitting region is consistent with a thick
inclined torus of mean radius 0.85 arcsec, and a 2008 Oct flux density of 27
+/- 6 mJy at 36.2 GHz. The spectral index for the remnant at this epoch,
determined between 1.4 GHz and 36.2 GHz, is -0.83. There is tentative evidence
for an unresolved central source with flatter spectral index.
