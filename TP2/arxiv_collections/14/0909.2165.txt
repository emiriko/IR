We formulate Euler-Poincar\'e and Lagrange-Poincar\'e equations for systems
with broken symmetry. We specialize the general theory to present explicit
equations of motion for nematic systems, ranging from single nematic molecules
to biaxial liquid crystals. The geometric construction applies to order
parameter spaces consisting of either unsigned unit vectors (directors) or
symmetric matrices (alignment tensors). On the Hamiltonian side, we provide the
corresponding Poisson brackets in both Lie-Poisson and Hamilton-Poincar\'e
formulations. The explicit form of the helicity invariant for uniaxial nematics
is also presented, together with a whole class of invariant quantities
(Casimirs) for two dimensional incompressible flows.
