In the framework of the unimodular metagravity, with the scalar
graviton/graviscalar dark matter, a regular anomalous one-parameter solution to
the static spherically symmetric metagravity equations in empty space is found.
The solution presents a smooth graviscalar halo, with a finite central density
profile, qualitatively reproducing the asymptotically flat rotation curves of
galaxies. To refine the description studying the axisymmetric case in the
presence of luminous matter is in order.
