Bremsstrahlung from relativistic electrons is considered under conditions
when some transverse direction of momentum transfer is statistically preferred.
It is shown that in the dipole approximation all the medium anisotropy effects
can be accumulated into a special modulus-bound transverse vector, $\bm N$. To
exemplify a target with $N^2\sim1$, we calculate radiation from electron
incident at a small angle on an atomic row in oriented crystal. Radiation
intensity and polarization dependence on the emission angle and frequency for
constant $\bm N$ is investigated. Net polarization for the angle-integral
cross-section is evaluated, which appears to be proportional to $N^2/2$, and
decreases with the increase of the photon energy fraction. A prominent feature
of the radiation angular distribution is the existence of an angle at which the
radiation may be completely polarized, in spite of the target complete or
partial isotropy -- that owes to existence of an origin-centered tangential
circle for polarization in the fully differential radiation probability kernel.
Possibilities for utilizing various properties of the polarized bremsstrahlung
flux for preparation of polarized photon beams and for probing intrinsic
anisotropy of the medium are analyzed.
