A large hadron machine like the LHC with its high track multiplicities always
asks for powerful tools that drastically reduce the large background while
selecting signal events efficiently. Actually such tools are widely needed and
used in all parts of particle physics. Regarding the huge amount of data that
will be produced at the LHC, the process of training as well as the process of
applying these tools to data, must be time efficient. Such tools can be
multivariate analysis -- also called data mining -- tools. In this contribution
we present the results for the application of the multivariate analysis, rule
growing algorithm RIPPER on a problem of particle selection. It turns out that
the meta-methods bagging and cost-sensitivity are essential for the quality of
the outcome. The results are compared to other multivariate analysis
techniques.
