Overconstraining the CKM unitarity triangle with precision measurements of
its angles continues to test the validity of the Standard Model. One of these
angles, gamma/phi_3, has been measured by studying B+- -> D K+- decays, where D
= D0 or D0-bar. I present recent results of hadronic D decays which will
improve the sensitivity of gamma/phi_3 measurements.
