We propose a new method of the analytical computation of the spectral
dimension which is based on the equivalence of the random walk and the q-state
Potts model with non-zero magnetic field in the limit $q\to 0$. Calculating the
critical exponent of the magnetization of this model on the dynamically
triangulated random surface by means of a matrix model technique we obtain that
the spectral dimension of this surface is equal to two.
