Consider a fully connected network where up to $t$ processes may crash, and
all processes start in an arbitrary memory state. The self-stabilizing firing
squad problem consists of eventually guaranteeing simultaneous response to an
external input. This is modeled by requiring that the non-crashed processes
"fire" simultaneously if some correct process received an external "GO" input,
and that they only fire as a response to some process receiving such an input.
This paper presents FireAlg, the first self-stabilizing firing squad algorithm.
  The FireAlg algorithm is optimal in two respects: (a) Once the algorithm is
in a safe state, it fires in response to a GO input as fast as any other
algorithm does, and (b) Starting from an arbitrary state, it converges to a
safe state as fast as any other algorithm does.
