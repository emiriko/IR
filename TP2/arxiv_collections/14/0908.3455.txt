Optimized data transfer services are highly demanded nowadays, due to the
large amounts of data which are frequently being produced and accessed. In this
paper we consider several data transfer service optimization problems (optimal
server location in path networks, optimal packet sequencing and minimum
makespan packet scheduling), for which we provide novel algorithmic solutions.
