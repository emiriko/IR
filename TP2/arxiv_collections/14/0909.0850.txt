Dielectric response has been studied for a new manganocuprate,
Gd3Ba2Mn2Cu2O12 (Gd3222) as a function of temperature (100 - 300 K) and
frequency (75 kHz to 1 MHz). The dielectric constant (e) exhibits a two step
increase (two peaks) in e(T) with increasing temperature from 100 to 300 K. The
first peak is seen around 150 K and the second one around 210 K (both for 75
kHz). Increasing frequency shifts both the peaks to higher temperature side.
The behavior of dielectric constant (e) and dielectric loss (tan_delta) matches
with glassy behavior observed in many dipolar molecules.
