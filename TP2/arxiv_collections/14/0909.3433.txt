Using magneto-optical materials, an asymmetric multi-quantum state magnetic
lattice is proposed to host an entangled multipartite system formed by using a
quantum degenerate gas of ultracold atoms in a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC).
The discrete magnetic bands magnetic lattice is devised to locate a
controllable long-range entanglement of a many harmonic oscillator system well
separated in space. The confinement of the coupled magnetic quantum well (CMQW)
system may significantly improve the condition for the long-range entanglement
of the multipartite (multi-qubits) to be used in quantum information
processors.
