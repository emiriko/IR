Static and dynamic properties of matter-wave solitons in dense Bose-Einstein
condensates, where three-body interactions play a significant role, have been
studied by a variational approximation (VA) and numerical simulations. For
experimentally relevant parameters, matter-wave solitons may acquire a flat-top
shape, which suggests employing a super-Gaussian trial function for VA.
Comparison of the soliton profiles, predicted by VA and those found from
numerical solution of the governing Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows good
agreement, thereby validating the proposed approach.
