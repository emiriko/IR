A novel feature of electron transport is explored through a thin film of
varying impurity density with the distance from its surface. The film, attached
to two metallic electrodes, is described by simple tight-binding model and its
coupling to the electrodes is treated through Newns-Anderson chemisorption
theory. Quite interestingly it is observed that, in the strong disorder regime
the amplitude of the current passing through the film increases with the
increase of the disorder strength, while it decreases in the weak disorder
regime. This anomalous behavior is completely opposite to that of conventional
disordered systems. Our results also predict that the electron transport is
significantly influenced by the finite size of the thin film.
