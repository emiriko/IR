We propose that generic magnetic equilibrium of an ideally conducting fluid
contains a volume-filling set of singular current layers. Singular current
layers should exist inside neutron stars. Residual dissipation in the singular
current layers might be the main mechanism for the magnetic field decay. The
slow decay of the field might be the clock responsible for triggering the
magnetar flares.
