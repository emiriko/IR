By introducing a concept of "minifying layer", we propose a universal device
to hide the position of an object by shifting its scattering without scaling
effect for a distance, independent of the direction of incident wave and
observation. Unlike the previously reported similar cloaks whose configurations
are relevant to the objects to be cloaked. The design here is able to shift the
scattering of various objects by one cloak. Moreover, via adjusting the
parameter of the "minifying layer", tunable magnifying or even minifying effect
on the shifted scattering can also be achieved. The performances of the devices
are demonstrated by finite element simulations. This design provides a more
flexible way to shift the scattering of an object, and thus can be expected to
have wide applications.
