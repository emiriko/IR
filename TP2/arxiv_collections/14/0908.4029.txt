We analyze the big bounce transition of the quantum FRW model in the setting
of the nonstandard loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Elementary observables are
used to quantize composite observables. The spectrum of the energy density
operator is bounded and continuous. The spectrum of the volume operator is
bounded from below and discrete. It has equally distant levels defining a
quantum of the volume. The discreteness may imply a foamy structure of
spacetime at semiclassical level which may be detected in astro-cosmo
observations. The nonstandard LQC method has a free parameter that should be
fixed in some way to specify the big bounce transition.
