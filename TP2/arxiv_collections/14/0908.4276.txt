We use the new SNe Ia discovered by the SDSS-II Supernova Survey together
with additional supernova datasets as well as observations of the cosmic
microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations to constrain cosmological
models. This complements the analysis presented by Kessler et al. in that we
discuss and rank a number of the most popular non-standard cosmology scenarios.
When this combined data-set is analyzed using the MLCS2k2 light-curve fitter,
we find that more exotic models for cosmic acceleration provide a better fit to
the data than the Lambda-CDM model. For example, the flat DGP model is ranked
higher by our information criteria tests than the standard model. When the
dataset is instead analyzed using the SALT-II light-curve fitter, the standard
cosmological constant model fares best. Our investigation also includes
inhomogeneous Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models. While our LTB models can be
made to fit the supernova data as well as any other model, the extra parameters
they require are not supported by our information criteria analysis.
