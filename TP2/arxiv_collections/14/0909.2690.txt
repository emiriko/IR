A Keller-Segel model describes macroscopic dynamics of bacterial colonies and
biological cells. Bacteria secret chemical which attracts other bacteria so
that they move towards chemical gradient creating nonlocal attraction between
bacteria. If bacterial density exceeds a critical value then the density
collapses (blows up) in a finite time which corresponds to bacterial
aggregation. Collapse in the Keller-Segel model has striking qualitative
similarities with a nonlinear Schrodinger equation including critical collapse
in two dimensions and supercritical in three dimensions. A self-similar
solution near blow up point is studied in the critical case and it has a form
of a rescaled steady state solution which contains a critical number of
bacteria. Time dependence of scaling of that solution has square root scaling
law with logarithmic corrections.
