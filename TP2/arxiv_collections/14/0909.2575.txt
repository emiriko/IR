We point out a strong time-evolution of the mass-to-light conversion factor
eta commonly used to estimate masses of unresolved star clusters from observed
cluster spectro-photometric measures. We present a series of gas-dynamical
models coupled with the Cambridge stellar evolution tracks to compute
line-of-sight velocity dispersions and half-light radii weighted by the
luminosity. We explore a range of initial conditions, varying in turn the
cluster mass and/or density, and the stellar population's IMF. We find that
eta, and hence the estimated cluster mass, may increase by factors as large as
3 over time-scales of 50 million years. We apply these results to an hypothetic
cluster mass distribution function (d.f.) and show that the d.f. shape may be
strongly affected at the low-mass end by this effect. Fitting truncated
isothermal (Michie-King) models to the projected light profile leads to
over-estimates of the concentration parameter c of delta c ~ 0.3 compared to
the same functional fit applied to the projected mass density.
