Though feedback from central active galactic nuclei provides an attractive
solution to the problem of overcooling in galaxy cluster cores, another
possible source of heating may come from ``sloshing'' of the cluster core gas
initiated by mergers. We present a set of simulations of galaxy cluster mergers
with subclusters in order to determine the amount of heating provided by the
mechanism of sloshing, exploring a parameter space over mass ratio, impact
parameter, and viscosity of the intracluster medium (ICM). Our results show
that for sloshing caused by mergers with gasless subclusters cooling may be
partially offset by heating from sloshing, but this mechanism is less effective
if the ICM is viscous.
