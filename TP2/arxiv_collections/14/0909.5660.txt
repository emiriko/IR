We present a microscopic model of the quantum paraelectric-ferroelectric
phase transition with a focus on the influence of coupled fluctuating phonon
modes. These may drive the continuous phase transition first order through a
metaelectric transition and furthermore stimulate the emergence of a textured
phase that preempts the transition. We discuss two further consequences of
fluctuations, firstly for the heat capacity, and secondly we show that the
inverse paraelectric susceptibility displays T^2 quantum critical behavior, and
can also adopt a characteristic minimum with temperature. Finally, we discuss
the observable consequences of our results.
