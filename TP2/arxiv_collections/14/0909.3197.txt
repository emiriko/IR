Prototypes of MICROMEGAS chambers, using bulk technology and analog readout,
with 1x1cm2 readout segmentation have been built and tested. Measurements in
Ar/iC4H10 (95/5) and Ar/CO2 (80/20) are reported. The dependency of the
prototypes gas gain versus pressure, gas temperature and amplification gap
thickness variations has been measured with an 55Fe source and a method for
temperature and pressure correction of data is presented. A stack of four
chambers has been tested in 200GeV/c and 7GeV/c muon and pion beams
respectively. Measurements of response uniformity, detection efficiency and hit
multiplicity are reported. A bulk MICROMEGAS prototype with embedded digital
readout electronics has been assembled and tested. The chamber layout and first
results are presented.
