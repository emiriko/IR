We developed a density matrix renormalization-group technique to study
quantum Hall fractions of fast rotating bosons. In this paper we present a
discussion of the method together with the results which we obtain in three
distinct cases of the narrow channel, cylinder and spherical geometries. In the
narrow channel case, which is relevant to anisotropic confining traps in the
limit of extremely fast rotation, we find a series of zero-temperature phase
transitions in the strongly interacting regime as a function of the interaction
strength between bosons. We compute energies and density profiles for different
filling fractions on a cylinder and compare the convergence rates of the method
in the cylinder and a sphere geometries.
