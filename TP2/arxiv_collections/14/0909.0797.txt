This article improves the BCS theory to include the inverse isotope effect on
superconductivity. An affective model can be deduced from the model including
electron-phonon interactions, and the phonon-induced attraction is simply and
clearly explained on the electron Green function. The focus of this work is on
how the positive or inverse isotope effect occurs in superconductors.
