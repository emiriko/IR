We extend some algebraic properties of the classical modular group SL_2(Z) to
equivalent groups in the theory of Drinfeld modules, in particular properties
which are important in the theory of modular curves.
  We study cusp amplitudes and the level of a (congruence) subgroup of SL_2(D)
for any Dedekind domain D, as ideals of D. In particular, we extend a
remarkable result of Larcher.
  We introduce finer notions of quasi-amplitude and quasi-level, which are not
required to be ideals and encode more information about the subgroup.
  Our results also provide several new necessary conditions for a subgroup of
SL_2(D) to be a congruence subgroup.
