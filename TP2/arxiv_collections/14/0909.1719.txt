The ground state energy of ideal alpha-matter at T=0 is analyzed within the
framework of variational theory of Bose quantum liquids. Calculations are done
for three local alpha-alpha potentials with positive volume integrals and
two-body correlation functions obtained from the Pandharipande-Bethe equation.
The energy per particle of $\alp$ matter is evaluated in the cluster expansion
formalism up to four-body diagrams, and using the HNC/0 and HNC/4 approximation
for a Bose liquid. Inclusion of higher order terms in the cluster expansion of
the condensate fraction are leading to a stronger depletion of the alpha
condensate with the density compared to the two-body approximation prediction.
