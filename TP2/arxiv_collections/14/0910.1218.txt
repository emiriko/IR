We explore electron transport through a moebius strip attached to two
metallic electrodes by the use of Green's function technique. A parametric
approach is used based on the tight-binding model to characterize the electron
transport through such a bridge system and it is observed that the transport
properties are significantly affected by (a) the transverse hopping strength
between the two channels and (b) the strip-to-electrode coupling strength. In
this context we also describe the noise power of the current fluctuations that
provides a key information about the electron correlation which is obtained by
calculating the Fano factor ($F$). The knowledge of this current fluctuations
gives important ideas for fabrication of efficient electronic devices.
