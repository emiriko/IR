(Abridged) Dust radiative transfer models are presented for 101 carbon stars
and 86 oxygen-rich evolved stars in the Magellanic Clouds for which 5-35 \mum\
{\it Spitzer} IRS spectra are available. The spectra are complemented with
available optical and infrared photometry to construct the spectral energy
distribution. A minimisation procedure is used to fit luminosity, mass-loss
rate and dust temperature at the inner radius. Different effective temperatures
and dust content are also considered. Periods from the literature and from new
OGLE-III data are compiled and derived. The O-rich stars are classified in
foreground objects, AGB stars and Red Super Giants.
  For the O-rich stars silicates based on laboratory optical constants are
compared to "astronomical silicates". Overall, the grain type by Volk & Kwok
(1988) fit the data best. However, the fit based on laboratory optical
constants for the grains can be improved by abandoning the small-particle
limit. The influence of grain size, core-mantle grains and porosity are
explored.
  Relations between mass-loss rates and luminosity and pulsation period are
presented and compared to the predictions of evolutionary models, those by
Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) and their adopted mass-loss recipe, and those based
on a Reimers mass-loss law with a scaling of a factor of five. The Vassiliadis
& Wood models describe the data better, although there are also some
deficiencies, in particular to the maximum adopted mass-loss rate.
  The OGLE-III data reveal an O-rich star in the SMC with a period of 1749
days. Its absolute magnitude of $M_{\rm bol}= -8.0$ makes it a good candidate
for a super-AGB star.
