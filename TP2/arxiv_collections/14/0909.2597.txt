In the quantization of simple cosmological models (minisuperspace models)
described by the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, an important step is the
construction, from the wave function, of a probability distribution answering
various questions of physical interest, such as the probability of the system
entering a given region of configuration space at any stage in its entire
history. A standard but heuristic procedure is to use the flux of (components
of) the wave function in a WKB approximation. This gives sensible semiclassical
results but lacks an underlying operator formalism. In this paper, we address
the issue of constructing probability distributions linked to the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation using the decoherent histories approach to quantum
theory. We show that the appropriate class operators (the generalization of
strings of projectors) in quantum cosmology are readily constructed using a
complex potential. We derive the class operator for entering or not entering
one or more regions in configuration space. They commute with the Hamiltonian,
have a sensible classical limit and are closely related to intersection number
operators. We show that oscillatory WKB solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation give approximate decoherence of histories, as do superpositions of WKB
solutions, as long as the regions of configuration space are sufficiently
large. The corresponding probabilities coincide, in a semiclassical
approximation, with standard heuristic procedures. In brief, we exhibit the
well-defined operator formalism underlying the usual heuristic interpretational
methods in quantum cosmology.
