We study the effects of chemical bonding on Raman scattering from
benzenethiol chemisorbed on silver clusters using time-dependent density
functional theory (TDDFT). Raman scattering cross sections are computed using a
formalism that employs analytical derivatives of frequency-dependent electronic
polarizabilities, which treats both off-resonant and resonant enhancement
within the same scheme. In the off-resonant regime, Raman scattering into
molecular vibrational modes is enhanced by one order of magnitude and shows
pronounced dependence on the orientation and the local symmetry of the
molecule. Additional strong enhancement of the order of $10^2$ arises from
resonant transitions to mixed metal--molecular electronic states. The Raman
enhancement is analyzed using Raman excitation profiles (REPs) for the range of
excitation energies $1.6-3.0$ eV, in which isolated benzenethiol does not have
electronic transitions. The computed vibrational frequency shifts and relative
Raman scattering cross sections of the metal--molecular complexes are in good
agreement with experimental data on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
for benzenethiol adsorbed on silver surfaces. Characterization and
understanding of these effects, associated with chemical enhancement mechanism,
may be used to improve the detection sensitivity in molecular Raman scattering.
