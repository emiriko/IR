Neutron star properties, such as its mass, radius, and moment of inertia, are
calculated by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations using the
ring-diagram equation of state (EOS) obtained from realistic low-momentum NN
interactions $V_{low-k}$. Several NN potentials (CDBonn, Nijmegen, Argonne V18
and BonnA) have been employed to calculate the ring-diagram EOS where the
particle-particle hole-hole ring diagrams are summed to all orders. The proton
fractions for different radial regions of a $\beta$-stable neutron star are
determined from the chemical potential conditions $\mu_n-\mu_p = \mu_e =
\mu_\mu$. The neutron star masses, radii and moments of inertia given by the
above potentials all tend to be too small compared with the accepted values.
Our results are largely improved with the inclusion of medium corrections based
on Brown-Rho scaling where the in-medium meson masses, particularly those of
$\omega$, $\rho$ and $\sigma$, are slightly decreased compared with their
in-vacuum values. Representative results using such medium corrected
interactions are neutron star mass $M\sim 1.8 M_{\odot}$, radius $R\sim 9$ km
and moment of inertia $\sim 60 M_{\odot}km^2$. The mass-radius trajectories
given by the above four realistic NN potentials are by and large overlapping.
