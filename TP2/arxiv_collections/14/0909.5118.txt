Modified Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions were recenty proposed to model
multi-parton radiation in a dense medium and describe jet quenching, one of
most striking features of heavy-ion collisions. We implement medium-modified
splitting functions in the HERWIG parton shower algorithm, which satisfies the
angular ordering prescription, and present a few parton-level results, such as
transverse momentum, angle and energy-fraction distributions, which exhibit
remarkable medium-induced effects. We also comment on the comparison with
respect to the results yielded by other implementations of medium-modified
splitting functions in the framework of virtuality-ordered parton cascades.
