We propose a way to accelerate adiabatic dynamics of wave functions in
quantum mechanics to obtain a final adiabatic state except for the spatially
uniform phase in any desired short time. We develop the previous theory of
fast-forward (Masuda & Nakamura 2008) so as to derive a driving potential for
the fast-forward of the adiabatic dynamics. A typical example is the
fast-forward of adiabatic transport of a wave function which is the ideal
transport in the sense that a stationary wave function is transported to an
aimed position in any desired short time without leaving any disturbance at the
final time of the fast-forward. As other important examples we show accelerated
manipulations of wave functions such as their splitting and squeezing. The
theory is also applicable to macroscopic quantum mechanics described by the
nonlinear Schroedinger equation.
