The Josephson junction phase qubit has been shown to be a viable candidate
for quantum computation. In recent years, the two coupled phase system has been
extensively studied theoretically and experimentally. We have analyzed the
quantum behavior of three and four capacitively-coupled phase qubits with
different possible configurations, using a two-level system model. Energy
levels and eigenstates have been calculated as a function of bias current and
detuning. The properties of these simple networks are discussed.
