We present results of tight binding calculations demonstrating existence of
degenerate electronic shells of Dirac Fermions in narrow, charge neutral
graphene quantum rings. We predict removal of degeneracy with finite magnetic
field. We show, using a combination of tight binding and configuration
interaction methods, that by filling a graphene ring with additional electrons
this carbon based structure with half-filled shell acquires a finite magnetic
moment.
