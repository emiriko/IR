Single-site dynamical mean field theory is used to determine the magnetic and
orbital-ordering phase diagram for a model of electrons moving on a lattice
with three orbital states per site and with the fully rotationally invariant
Slater-Kanamori on-site interactions. The model captures important aspects of
the physics of transition metal oxides with partially filled $t_{2g}$ shells,
and of electron-doped C$_{60}$. We introduce an unbiased, computationally
simple and inexpensive method for estimating the presence of two sublattice
order, determine the regimes in which spatially uniform and two-sublattice spin
and orbital orderings are present and give physical arguments for the origins
of the different phases. Guidelines are determined for optimizing the presence
of ferromagnetism, which may be desirable in applications
