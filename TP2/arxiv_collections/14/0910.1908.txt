We investigate conductance fluctuations as a function of carrier density $n$
and magnetic field in diffusive mesoscopic samples made from monolayer and
bilayer graphene. We show that the fluctuations' correlation energy and field,
which are functions of the diffusion coefficient, have fundamentally different
variations with $n$, illustrating the contrast between massive and massless
carriers. The field dependent fluctuations are nearly independent of $n$, but
the $n$-dependent fluctuations are not universal and are largest at the charge
neutrality point. We also measure the second order conductance fluctuations
(mesoscopic rectification). Its field asymmetry, due to electron-electron
interaction, decays with conductance, as predicted for diffusive systems.
