The goal of this investigation is to study, in the line of previous works,
the level of velocity fluctuations in different scenarios of the TJ-II
stellarator. The method followed consists in measuring the apparent Doppler
temperature of C4+ and protons with high spectral resolution techniques with
spatial resolution. The level of turbulent velocities in the plasma has been
deduced from the difference observed between the apparent temperature of both
species, following a method previously presented and borrowed from
astrophysics. The study of this difference, as a function of plasma density and
injected power, provides a way to explore if this turbulence plays any role in
the confinement of the hot TJ-II plasma.
