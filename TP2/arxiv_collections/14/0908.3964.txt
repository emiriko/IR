In the literature, there are five distinct, fragmented sets of analytic
predictions for the scaling behaviour at the phase transition in the
random-site Ising model in four dimensions. Here, the scaling relations for
logarithmic corrections are used to complete the scaling pictures for each set.
A numerical approach is then used to confirm the leading scaling picture coming
from these predictions and to discriminate between them at the level of
logarithmic corrections.
