In this paper, we develop the notion of the linear atomic quantum coupler.
This device consists of two modes propagating into two waveguides, each of them
includes a localized and/or a trapped atom. These waveguides are placed close
enough to allow exchanging energy between them via evanescent waves. Each mode
interacts with the atom in the same waveguide in the standard way, i.e. as the
Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), and with the atom-mode in the second waveguide via
evanescent wave. We present the Hamiltonian for the system and deduce the exact
form for the wavefunction. We investigate the atomic inversions and the
second-order correlation function. In contrast to the conventional linear
coupler, the atomic quantum coupler is able to generate nonclassical effects.
The atomic inversions can exhibit long revival-collapse phenomenon as well as
subsidiary revivals based on the competition among the switching mechanisms in
the system. Finally, under certain conditions, the system can yield the results
of the two-mode JCM.
