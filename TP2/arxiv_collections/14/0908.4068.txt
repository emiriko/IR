We use the 2 particle irreducible Schwinger-Keldysh effective action to set
up consistent equations for the velocity and pressure correlations of a
turbulent flow. We use these equations to derive the Kadanoff-Baym equations
describing the relaxation to Kolmogorov turbulence in the absence of mean
velocities.
