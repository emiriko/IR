Let A be an associative algebra over a field, and let M be a finite family of
right A-modules. Study of the noncommutative deformation functor of the family
M leads to the construction of the algebra of observables and the Generalized
Burnside Theorem, due to Laudal. In this paper, we give an overview of aspects
of noncommutative deformations closely connected to the Generalized Burnside
Theorem.
