We present the results of a 5.5-year CCD photometric campaign that monitored
261 bright, southern, semi-regular variables with relatively precise Hipparcos
parallaxes. The data are supplemented with independent photoelectric
observations of 34 of the brightest stars, including 11 that were not part of
the CCD survey, and a previously unpublished long time-series of VZ Cam.
Pulsation periods and amplitudes are established for 247 of these stars, the
majority of which have not been determined before. All M giants with sufficient
observations for period determination are found to be variable, with 87% of the
sample (at S/N >= 7.5) exhibiting multi-periodic behaviour. The period ratios
of local SRVs are in excellent agreement with those in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. Apparent K-band magnitudes are extracted from multiple NIR catalogues
and analysed to determine the most reliable values. We review the effects of
interstellar and circumstellar extinction and calculate absolute K-band
magnitudes using revised Hipparcos parallaxes.
