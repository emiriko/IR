We show that the class of antenna layouts for telescope arrays allowing cheap
analysis hardware (with correlator cost scaling as N log N rather than N^2 with
the number of antennas N) is encouragingly large, including not only previously
discussed rectangular grids but also arbitrary hierarchies of such grids, with
arbitrary rotations and shears at each level. We show that all correlations for
such a 2D array with an n-level hierarchy can be efficiently computed via a
Fast Fourier Transform in not 2 but 2n dimensions. This can allow major
correlator cost reductions for science applications requiring exquisite
sensitivity at widely separated angular scales, for example 21cm tomography
(where short baselines are needed to probe the cosmological signal and long
baselines are needed for point source removal), helping enable future 21cm
experiments with thousands or millions of cheap dipole-like antennas. Such
hierarchical grids combine the angular resolution advantage of traditional
array layouts with the cost advantage of a rectangular Fast Fourier Transform
Telescope. We also describe an algorithm for how a subclass of hierarchical
arrays can efficiently use rotation synthesis to produce global sky maps with
minimal noise and a well-characterized synthesized beam.
