I report the results of the test, where the takers had to tell the prose of
Charles Dickens from that of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who is considered by many to
be the worst writer in history of letters. The average score is about 50%,
which is on the level of random guessing. This suggests that the quality of
Dickens' prose is the same as of that of Bulwer-Lytton.
