We present an ongoing study of 18 nearby galaxy groups, chosen for the
availability of Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data and evidence for AGN/hot
intragroup gas interaction. We have obtained 235 and 610 MHz observations at
the GMRT for all the groups, and 327 and 150 MHz for a few. We discuss two
interesting cases - NGC 5044 and AWM 4 - which exhibit different kinds of
AGN/hot gas interaction. With the help of these examples we show how joining
low-frequency radio data (to track the history of AGN outbursts through
emission from aged electron populations) with X-ray data (to determine the
state of hot gas, its disturbances, heating and cooling) can provide a unique
insight into the nature of the feedback mechanism in galaxy groups.
