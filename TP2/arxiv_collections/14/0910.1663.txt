Circularly polarized Gauss-Laguerre GL(0,0) and GL(0,1) laser beams that
cross at their waists at a small angle are shown to generate a quasi-paraxial
field that contains an axial line of circular polarization, a C line,
surrounded by polarization ellipses whose major and minor axes generate
multi-twist Mobius strips with twist numbers that increase with distance from
the C point. These Mobius strips are interpreted in terms of Berry's phase for
parallel transport of the ellipse axes around the C point.
