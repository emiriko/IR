The sticking of a soft polystyrene colloidal particle to a planar glass plate
was studied by a microrheological technique using an optical tweezer to trap
the particle and a piezoelectric-stage to position the plate and to
sinusoidally drive it in-planeThe sticking process was well-described by a
crossover of the mechanical coupling between the plate and the particle from
being dominantly viscous to becoming dominantly elastic. By varying three
parameters in the experiment, namely, the strength of the tweezer potential,
the strength of the particle-plate interaction and the strength of the
oscillatory drive, three different regimes of dynamics - stuck, non-stuck and
ageing were observed, corresponding to the coupling that is elastic, viscous
and viscoelastic, respectively. The observations of [1] can be illustrated
better by a parametric Nyquist plot of the real and imaginary parts of the
effective rigidity modulus of the coupling medium. Upon contact between the
particle and the plate, these parameters change abruptly from their bulk
values, regardless of whether the particle is stuck or non-stuck in the
terminal steady state. In the ageing regime, where sticking evolves gradually
in time, the system shows a parametric plot significantly different from what
would be expected from a single-relaxation process. A tendency of clustering of
the data in the Nyquist plot provides an interesting contrast between truly
many-body systems and one with a few degrees of freedom.
