We generalize the Swiss-cheese cosmologies so as to include nonzero linear
momenta of the associated boundary surfaces. The evolution of mass scales in
these generalized cosmologies is studied for a variety of models for the
background without having to specify any details within the local
inhomogeneities. We find that the final effective gravitational mass and size
of the evolving inhomogeneities depends on their linear momenta but these
properties are essentially unaffected by the details of the background model.
