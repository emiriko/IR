We study scaling limits and conformal invariance of critical site percolation
on triangular lattice. We show that some percolation-related quantities are
harmonic conformal invariants, and calculate their values in the scaling limit.
As a particular case we obtain conformal invariance of the crossing
probabilities and Cardy's formula. Then we prove existence, uniqueness, and
conformal invariance of the continuum scaling limit.
