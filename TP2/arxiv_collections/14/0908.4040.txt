This paper presents the optical design of a multi-spectral piston sensor
suitable to co-phasing giant segmented mirrors equipping the Future Extremely
Large Telescopes (ELTs). The general theory of the sensor is described in
detail and numerical simulations have been carried out, demonstrating that
direct piston and tip-tilt measurements are feasible within accuracies
respectively close to 20 nm and 10 nano-radians. Those values are compatible
with the co-phasing requirements, although the method seems to be perturbed by
uncorrected atmospheric seeing
