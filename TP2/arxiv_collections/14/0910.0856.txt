Fusion reactions relevant for the carbon and oxygen burning cycles in highly
evolved stars are investigated in a standard approach to fusion. We employ the
double folding method to evaluate the ion-ion interactions with Gogny-D1 and
M3Y-Paris $n-n$ effective forces. The cross-section evaluation do not indicate
a possible hindrance even at the lowest energies under the barrier. Reaction
rates at temperatures relevant for the stellar processes are estimated and
compared to the traditional and modern extrapolation formulas.
