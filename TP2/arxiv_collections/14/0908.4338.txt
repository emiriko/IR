Antineutrinos are electrically neutral, nearly massless fundamental particles
produced in large numbers in the cores of nuclear reactors and in nuclear
explosions. In the half century since their discovery, major advances in the
understanding of their properties, and in detector technology, have opened the
door to a new discipline: Applied Antineutrino Physics. Because antineutrinos
are inextricably linked to the process of nuclear fission, many applications of
interest are in nuclear nonproliferation. This white paper presents a
comprehensive survey of applied antineutrino physics relevant for
nonproliferation, summarizes recent advances in the field, describes the
overlap of this nascent discipline with other ongoing fundamental and applied
antineutrino research, and charts a course for research and development for
future applications. It is intended as a resource for policymakers,
researchers, and the wider nuclear nonproliferation community.
