A consistent combination of covariant density functional theory (CDFT) and
Landau-Migdal Theory of Finite Fermi Systems (TFFS) is presented. Both methods
are in principle exact, but Landau-Migdal theory cannot describe ground state
properties and density functional theory does not take into account the energy
dependence of the self-energy and therefore fails to yield proper single-%
particle spectra as well as the coupling to complex configurations in the width
of giant resonances. Starting from an energy functional, phonons and their
vertices are calculated without any further parameters. They form the basis of
particle-vibrational coupling leading to an energy dependence of the
self-energy and an induced energy-dependent interaction in the response
equation. A subtraction procedure avoids double counting. Applications in
doubly magic nuclei and in a chain of superfluid nuclei show excellent
agreement with experimental data.
