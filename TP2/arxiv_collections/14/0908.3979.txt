Very deep neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC
3079 with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) are presented. The
galaxy has been studied extensively in different wavelengths and known for its
several unique and complex features. However, the new data still revealed
several new features and show that the galaxy is even more complicated and
interesting than previously thought. In the new data a large stream of gas,
encircling the entire galaxy, was discovered, while the data also show, for the
first time, that not only hot gas is blown into space by the starburst/AGN, but
also large amounts of cold gas, despite the high energies involved in the
outflow.
