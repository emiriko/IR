We prove the existence of a large class of dynamical solutions to the
Einstein-Euler equations for which the fluid density and spatial three-velocity
converge to a solution of the Poisson-Euler equations of Newtonian gravity. The
results presented here generalize those of \cite{Oli06} to allow for a larger
class of initial data. As in \cite{Oli06}, the proof is based on a non-local
symmetric hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein-Euler equations which contain
a singular parameter $\ep=v_T/c$ with $v_T$ a characteristic speed associated
to the fluid and $c$ the speed of light. Energy and dispersive estimates on
weighted Sobolev spaces are the main technical tools used to analyze the
solutions in the singular limit $\ep\searrow 0$.
