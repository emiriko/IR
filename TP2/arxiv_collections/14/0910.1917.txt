Recently Horava proposed a renormalizable gravity theory with higher
derivatives by abandoning the Lorenz invariance in UV. But there have been
confusions regarding the extra scalar graviton mode and the consistency of the
Horava model. I reconsider these problems and show that, in the Minkowski
vacuum background, the scalar graviton mode can be consistency decoupled from
the usual tensor graviton modes by imposing the (local) Hamiltonian as well as
the momentum constraints.
