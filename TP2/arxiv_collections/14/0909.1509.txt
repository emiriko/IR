The Moon is a unique platform for fundamental astrophysical measurements of
gravitation, the Sun, and the Universe. Lacking a permanent ionosphere and, on
the farside, shielded from terrestrial radio emissions, a radio telescope on
the Moon will be an unparalleled heliospheric and astrophysical observatory.
Crucial stages in particle acceleration near the Sun can be imaged and tracked.
The evolution of the Universe before and during the formation of the first
stars will be traced, yielding high precision cosmological constraints. Lunar
Laser Ranging of the Earth-Moon distance provides extremely high precision
constraints on General Relativity and alternative models of gravity, and also
reveals details about the interior structure of the Moon. With the aim of
providing additional perspective on the Moon as a scientific platform, this
white paper describes key research projects in these areas of astrophysics from
the Moon that are being undertaken by the NLSI-funded LUNAR consortium. The
NASA Lunar Science Institute (NLSI) recently funded 7 mostly university-based
teams to study science of, on, and from the Moon. The LUNAR consortium was
selected by the NLSI for astrophysical research and education that focuses on
the key, unique instruments that most effectively take scientific advantage of
sites on the lunar surface - low frequency heliophysics and cosmology, and
lunar laser ranging. We are submitting this white paper to the Planetary
Sciences Decadal Survey to provide additional perspective on the value of Moon
for conducting cutting-edge research in astrophysics and gravitational physics
by describing our key projects for LUNAR. This program of astrophysics from the
Moon complements as well as takes advantage of expected scientific
infrastructure on the Moon during the next few decades.
