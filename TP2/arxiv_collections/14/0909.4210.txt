Some of the satellites in the Solar System, including the Moon, appear to
have been captured from heliocentric orbits at some point in their past, and
then have evolved to the present configurations. The exact process of how this
trapping occurred is unknown, but the dissociation of a planetesimal binary in
the gravitational field of the planet, gas drag, or a massive collision seem to
be the best candidates. However, all these mechanisms leave the satellites in
elliptical orbits that need to be damped to the present almost circular ones.
Here we give a complete description of the secular tidal evolution of a
satellite just after entering a bounding state with the planet. In particular,
we take into account the spin evolution of the satellite, which has often been
assumed synchronous in previous studies. We apply our model to Triton and
successfully explain some geophysical properties of this satellite, as well as
the main dynamical features observed for the Neptunian system.
