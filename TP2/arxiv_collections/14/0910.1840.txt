A remarkable feature of quantum theory is non-locality (i.e. the presence of
correlations which violate Bell inequalities). However, quantum correlations
are not maximally non-local, and it is natural to ask whether there are
compelling reasons for rejecting theories in which stronger violations are
possible. To shed light on this question, we consider post-quantum theories in
which maximally non-local states (non-local boxes) occur. It has previously
been conjectured that the set of dynamical transformations possible in such
theories is severely limited. We settle the question affirmatively in the case
of reversible dynamics, by completely characterizing all such transformations
allowed in this setting. We find that the dynamical group is trivial, in the
sense that it is generated solely by local operations and permutations of
systems. In particular, no correlations can ever be created; non-local boxes
cannot be prepared from product states (in other words, no analogues of
entangling unitary operations exist), and classical computers can efficiently
simulate all such processes.
