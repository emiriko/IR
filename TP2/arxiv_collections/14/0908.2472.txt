One way of avoiding the destabilization of the electroweak scale through a
strong coupled regime naturally occurs in models with a Landau-like pole at the
TeV scale. Hence, the quadratic divergence contributions to the scalar masses
are not considered as a problem anymore since a new nonperturbative dynamic
emerges at the TeV scale. This scale should be an intrinsic feature of the
models and there is no need to invoke any other sort of protection for the
electroweak scale. In some models based on the $SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_W\otimes
U(1)_{X}$ gauge symmetry, a nonperturbative dynamics arise and it stabilizes
the electroweak scale.
