We recall the theory of linear discrete Riemann surfaces and show how to use
it in order to interpret a surface embedded in R^3 as a discrete Riemann
surface and compute its basis of holomorphic forms on it. We present numerical
examples, recovering known results to test the numerics and giving the yet
unknown period matrix of the Lawson genus-2 surface.
