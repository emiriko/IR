The problem of separation of different signals in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) radiation using the difference in their statistics is
analyzed. Considering samples of sequences which model the CMB as a
superposition of signals, we show how the Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter
acts as a relevant descriptor, either qualitatively or quantitatively, to
distinguish the statistical properties of the cosmological and secondary
signals.
