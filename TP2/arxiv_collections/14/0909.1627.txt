We investigate creation of optimal entanglement in symmetric networks. The
proposed network is one in which the connections are organized by a group table
in other words a group association scheme. We show that optimal entanglement
can be provided over such networks by adjusting couplings and initial state. We
find that the optimal initial state is a simple local excited state. Moreover
we obtain an analytic formula for entanglement achievable between vertex pairs
located in the same strata and calculate their relevant optimal couplings. For
those pairs located in different strata two upper bounds are presented. These
results are also checked numerically.
