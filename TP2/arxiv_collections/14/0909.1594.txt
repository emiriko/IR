We discuss classical and quantum computations in terms of corresponding
Hamiltonian dynamics. This allows us to introduce quantum computations which
involve parallel processing of both: the data and programme instructions. Using
mixed quantum-classical dynamics we look for a full cost of computations on
quantum computers with classical terminals.
