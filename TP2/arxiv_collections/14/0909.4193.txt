The measurement of a quantitative and macroscopic parameter to estimate the
global motility of a large population of swimming biological cells is a
challenge Experiments on the rheology of active suspensions have been
performed. Effective viscosity of sheared suspensions of live unicellular
motile micro-algae (\textit{Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii}) is far greater than for
suspensions containing the same volume fraction of dead cells and suspensions
show shear thinning behaviour. We relate these macroscopic measurements to the
orientation of individual swimming cells under flow and discuss our results in
the light of several existing models.
