The distributions that regulate the spatial domains of the Poissonian Voronoi
Diagrams are discussed adopting the sum of gamma variate of argument two. The
distributions that arise from the product and quotient of two gamma variates of
argument two are also derived. Three examples of non Poissonian seeds for the
Voronoi Diagrams are discussed. The developed algorithm allows the simulation
of an aggregation of methanol and water.
