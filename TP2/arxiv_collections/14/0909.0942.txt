We discuss cosmological perturbation theory at third order, deriving the
gauge transformation rules for metric and matter perturbations, and
constructing third order gauge invariant quantities. We present the Einstein
tensor components, the evolution equations for a perfect fluid, and the
Klein-Gordon equation at third order, including scalar, vector and tensor
perturbations. In doing so, we also give all second order tensor components and
evolution equations in full, exhilarating generality.
