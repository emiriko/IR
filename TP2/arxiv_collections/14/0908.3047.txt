Clusters traverse a gas and collide with gas particles. The gas particles are
adsorbed and the clusters become hosts. If the clusters are size selected, the
number of guests will be Poisson distributed. We review this by showcasing four
laboratory procedures that all rely on the validity of the Poisson model. The
effects of a statistical distribution of the cluster sizes in a beam of
clusters are discussed. We derive the average collision rates. Additionally, we
present Poisson mixture models that involve also standard deviations. We derive
the collision statistics for common size distributions of hosts and also for
some generalizations thereof. The models can be applied to large noble gas
clusters traversing doping gas. While outlining how to fit a generalized
Poisson to the statistics, we still find even these Poisson models to be often
insufficient.
