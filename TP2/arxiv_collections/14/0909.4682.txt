The dust feature G159.6--18.5 in the Perseus region has previously been
observed with the COSMOSOMAS experiment \citep{Watson:05} on angular scales of
$\approx$ 1$^{\circ}$, and was found to exhibit anomalous microwave emission.
We present new observations of this dust feature, performed with the Very Small
Array (VSA) at 33 GHz, to help increase the understanding of the nature of this
anomalous emission.
  On the angular scales observed with the VSA ($\approx$ 10 -- 40$^{\prime}$),
G159.6--18.5 consists of five distinct components, each of which have been
individually analysed. All five of these components are found to exhibit an
excess of emission at 33 GHz, and are found to be highly correlated with
far-infrared emission. We provide evidence that each of these compact
components have anomalous emission that is consistent with electric dipole
emission from very small, rapidly rotating dust grains. These components
contribute $\approx$ 10 % to the flux density of the diffuse extended emission
detected by COSMOSOMAS, and are found to have a similar radio emissivity.
