In this paper we present a prototype of a Strip Resistive Thick GEM
photosensitive gaseous detector filled with Ne and ethylferrocene vapours at a
total pressure of 1 atm for an early forest fire detection system. Tests show
that it is one hundred times more sensitive than the best commercial
ultraviolet flame detectors and therefore, it is able to reliably detect a
flame of 1.5x1.5x1.5 m3 at a distance of about 1km. An additional and unique
feature of this detector is its imaging capability, which in combination with
other techniques, may significantly reduce false fire alarms when operating in
an automatic mode.
  Preliminary results conducted with air filled photosensitive gaseous
detectors are also presented. The approach main advantages include both the
simplicity of manufacturing and affordability of construction materials such as
plastics and glues specifically reducing detector production cost. The
sensitivity of these air filled detectors at certain conditions may be as high
as those filled with Ne and EF. Long term test results of such sealed detectors
indicate a significant progress in this direction.
  We believe that our detectors utilized in addition to other flame and smoke
sensors will exceptionally increase the sensitivity of forest fire detection
systems. Our future efforts will be focused on attempts to commercialize such
detectors utilizing our aforementioned findings.
