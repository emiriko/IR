We present a calculation of $1/m_b^2$ corrections to the lifetime differences
of $B_s$ mesons in the heavy-quark expansion. We find that they are small to
significantly affect $\Delta\Gamma$ $(B_s)$ and present the result for lifetime
difference including non-perturbative $1/m_b$ and $1/m_b^2$ corrections. We
also analyze the generic $\Delta B$ = 1 New Physics contributions to the
lifetime difference of $B_s$ mesons and provide several examples
