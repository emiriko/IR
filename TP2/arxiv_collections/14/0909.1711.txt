Based on our recent NNLO dynamical parton distributions as obtained in the
`fixed flavor number scheme', we generate radiatively parton distributions in
the `variable flavor number scheme' where also the heavy quark flavors (c,b,t)
become massless partons within the nucleon. Only within this latter
factorization scheme NNLO calculations are feasible at present, since the
required partonic subprocesses are only available in the approximation of
massless initial-state partons. The NNLO predictions for gauge boson production
are typically larger (by more than 1 sigma) than the NLO ones, and rates at LHC
energies can be predicted with an accuracy of about 5%, whereas at Tevatron
they are more than 2 sigma above the NLO ones. The NNLO predictions for SM
Higgs boson production via the dominant gluon fusion process have a total (pdf
and scale) uncertainty of about 10% at LHC which almost doubles at the lower
Tevatron energies; they are typically about 20% larger than the ones at NLO but
the total uncertainty bands overlap.
