Mathematical semantic web services are very useful in practice, but only a
small number of research results are reported in this area. In this paper we
present a method of obtaining an approximation of a mathematical semantic web
service, from its semantic description, using existing mathematical semantic
web services, approximation formulas, and numerical methods techniques. We also
give a method for automatic comparison of two complexity functions. In
addition, we present a method for classifying the numerical methods
mathematical semantic web services from a library.
