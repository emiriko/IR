We measure charge transport in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) using
a nanometer scale silicon MOSFET as a charge sensor. This charge detection
technique makes possible the measurement of extremely large resistances. At
high temperatures, where the a-Si:H resistance is not too large, the charge
detection measurement agrees with a direct measurement of current. The device
geometry allows us to probe both the field effect and dispersive transport in
the a-Si:H using charge sensing and to extract the density of states near the
Fermi energy.
