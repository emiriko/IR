We study a structure consisting of a ferromagnetic (F) layer coupled to two
normal metal (N) leads. The system is driven out of equilibrium by the
simultaneous application of external dc and ac voltages across the N/F/N
structure. Using the Keldysh diagrammatic approach, and modeling the
ferromagnet as a classical spin of size S >> 1, we derive the Langevin equation
for the magnetization dynamics and calculate the noise correlator. We find that
the noise has an explicit frequency dependence in addition to depending on the
characteristics of the ac and dc drive. Further, we calculate the
current-voltage characteristics of the structure to O(1/S^2) and find that the
nonequilibrium dynamics of the ferromagnetic layer gives rise to corrections to
the current that are both linear and nonlinear in voltage.
