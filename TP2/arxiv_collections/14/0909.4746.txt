We derive relativistic equations for charged and neutral spin particles. The
approach for higher-spin particles is based on generalizations of the
Bargmann-Wigner formalism. Next, we study, what new physical information can
the introduction of non-commutativity give us. Additional non-commutative
parameters can provide a suitable basis for explanation of the origin of mass.
