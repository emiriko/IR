We point out that mirror dark matter predicts low energy ($E_R
\stackrel{<}{\sim} 2$ keV) electron recoils from mirror electron scattering as
well as nuclear recoils from mirror ion scattering. The former effect is
examined and applied to the recently released low energy electron recoil data
from the CDMS collaboration. We speculate that the sharp rise in electron
recoils seen in CDMS below 2 keV might be due to mirror electron scattering and
show that the parameters suggested by the data are roughly consistent with the
mirror dark matter explanation of the annual modulation signal observed in the
DAMA/Libra and DAMA/NaI experiments. Thus, the CDMS data offer tentative
evidence supporting the mirror dark matter explanation of the DAMA experiments,
which can be more rigorously checked by future low energy electron recoil
measurements.
