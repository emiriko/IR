Quantum point contacts implemented in p-type GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures are
investigated by low-temperature electrical conductance spectroscopy
measurements. Besides one-dimensional conductance quantization in units of
$2e^{2}/h$ a pronounced extra plateau is found at about $0.7(2e^{2}/h)$ which
possesses the characteristic properties of the so-called "0.7 anomaly" known
from experiments with n-type samples. The evolution of the 0.7 plateau in high
perpendicular magnetic field reveals the existence of a quasi-localized state
and supports the explanation of the 0.7 anomaly based on self-consistent charge
localization. These observations are robust when lateral electrical fields are
applied which shift the relative position of the electron wavefunction in the
quantum point contact, testifying to the intrinsic nature of the underlying
physics.
