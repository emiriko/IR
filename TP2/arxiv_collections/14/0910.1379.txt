Based on the physical model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth via
gas accretion in a circumnuclear disk (CND) proposed by Kawakatu & Wada (2008),
we describe the formation of high-$z$ ($z > 6$) quasars (QSOs) whose BH masses
are M_{BH}> 10^{9} M_{\odot}. We derive the necessary conditions to form QSOs
at z > 6 by only gas accretion: (i) A large mass supply with M_{sup} >
10^{10}M_{\odot} from host galaxies to CNDs, because the final BH mass is only
1-10% of the total supplied mass from QSO hosts. (ii) High star formation
efficiency for a rapid BH growth. We also find that if the BH growth is limited
by the Eddington accretion, the final BH mass is greatly suppressed. Thus, the
super-Eddington growth is required for the QSO formation. The evolution of the
QSO luminosity depends on the redshift z_{i} at which accretion onto a seed BH
is initiated. In other words, the brighter QSOs at z >6 favor the late growth
of SMBHs (i.e., z_{i}=10) rather than early growth (i.e., z_{i}=30). Moreover,
we predict the observable properties and the evolution of QSOs at z >6. In a
QSO phase, there should exist a stellar rich massive CND, whose gas mass is
about 10% of the dynamical mass inside 0.1-1 kpc}. On the other hand, in a
phase where the BH grows (i.e., a proto-QSO phase), the proto-QSO has a gas
rich massive CNDs whose gas mass is comparable to the dynamical mass
(abridged).
