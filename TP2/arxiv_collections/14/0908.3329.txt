The notion of symmetry is defined in the context of Linear and Integer
Programming. Symmetric linear and integer programs are studied from a group
theoretical viewpoint. We show that for any linear program there exists an
optimal solution in the fixed point set of its symmetry group. Using this
result, we develop an algorithm that allows for reducing the dimension of any
linear program having a non-trivial group of symmetries.
