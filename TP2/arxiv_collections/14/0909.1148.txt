We extend de Finetti's [Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'{e} 7 (1937) 1--68] notion of
exchangeability to finite and countable sequences of variables, when a
subject's beliefs about them are modelled using coherent lower previsions
rather than (linear) previsions. We derive representation theorems in both the
finite and countable cases, in terms of sampling without and with replacement,
respectively.
