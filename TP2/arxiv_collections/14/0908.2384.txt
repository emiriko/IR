Femtosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy was used to systematically
study photoexcited carrier relaxation dynamics in the intermediate-valence
heavy fermion system Yb1-xLuxAl3 (0 < x < 1). Given the demonstrated
sensitivity of this experimental technique to the presence of the low energy
gaps in the charge excitation spectrum, the aim of this work was to study the
effect of dilution of the Kondo lattice on its low energy electronic structure.
The results imply that in Yb1-xLuxAl3 the hybridization gap, resulting from
hybridization of local moments and conduction electrons, persists up to 30%
doping. Interestingly, below some characteristic, doping dependent temperature
T*(x) the relaxation time divergence, governed by the relaxation bottleneck due
to the presence of the indirect hybridization gap, is truncated. This
observation is attributed to the competing ballistic transport of hot electrons
out of the probed volume at low temperatures. The derived theoretical model
accounts for both the functional form of relaxation dynamics below T*(x), as
well as the doping dependence of the low temperature relaxation rate in
Yb1-xLuxAl3.
