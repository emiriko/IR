We discuss the implementation of bulk fermions in soft wall models. The
introduction of a position dependent bulk mass allows for a well defined
Kaluza-Klein expansion for bulk fermions. The realization of flavor and the
contribution to electroweak precision observables are shown to be very similar
to the hard wall case. The bounds from electroweak precision test are however
milder with gauge boson Kaluza-Klein modes as light as $\sim 1.5$ TeV
compatible with current experimental bounds.
