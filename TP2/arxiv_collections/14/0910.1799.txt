The phase diagram of a correlated material is the result of a complex
interplay between several degrees of freedom, providing a map of the material's
behavior. One can understand (and ultimately control) the material's ground
state by associating features and regions of the phase diagram, with specific
physical events or underlying quantum mechanical properties. The phase diagram
of the newly discovered iron arsenic high temperature superconductors is
particularly rich and interesting. In the AE(Fe1-xTx)2As2 class (AE being Ca,
Sr, Ba, T being transition metals), the simultaneous structural/magnetic phase
transition that occurs at elevated temperature in the undoped material, splits
and is suppressed by carrier doping, the suppression being complete around
optimal doping. A dome of superconductivity exists with apparent equal ease in
the orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic (AFM) state as well as in the tetragonal
state with no long range magnetic order. The question then is what determines
the critical doping at which superconductivity emerges, if the AFM order is
fully suppressed only at higher doping values. Here we report evidence from
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) that critical changes in the
Fermi surface (FS) occur at the doping level that marks the onset of
superconductivity. The presence of the AFM order leads to a reconstruction of
the electronic structure, most significantly the appearance of the small hole
pockets at the Fermi level. These hole pockets vanish, i. e. undergo a Lifshitz
transition, at the onset of superconductivity. Superconductivity and magnetism
are competing states in the iron arsenic superconductors. In the presence of
the hole pockets superconductivity is fully suppressed, while in their absence
the two states can coexist.
