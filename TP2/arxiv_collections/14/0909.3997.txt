Tilings and tiling systems are an abstract concept that arise both as a
computational model and as a dynamical system. In this paper, we characterize
the sets of periods that a tiling system can produce. We prove that up to a
slight recoding, they correspond exactly to languages in the complexity classes
$\nspace{n}$ and $\cne$.
