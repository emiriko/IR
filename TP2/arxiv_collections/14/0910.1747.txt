A low-dimensional model of large Prandtl-number ($P$) Rayleigh B\'{e}nard
convection is constructed using some of the important modes of pseudospectral
direct numerical simulations. A detailed bifurcation analysis of the
low-dimensional model for $P=6.8$ and aspect ratio of $2\sqrt{2}$ reveals a
rich instability and chaos picture: steady rolls, time-periodicity,
quasiperiodicity, phase locking, chaos, and crisis. Bifurcation analysis also
reveals multiple co-existing attractors, and a window with time-periodicity
after chaos. The results of the low-dimensional model matches quite closely
with some of the past simulations and experimental results where they observe
chaos in RBC through quasiperiodicity and phase locking.
