We present time-resolved Kerr rotation measurements of electron spin dynamics
in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction system that contains a high-mobility
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Due to the complex layer structure of this
material the Kerr rotation signals contain information from electron spins in
three different layers: the 2DEG layer, a GaAs epilayer in the heterostructure,
and the underlying GaAs substrate. The 2DEG electrons can be observed at low
pump intensities, using that they have a less negative g-factor than electrons
in bulk GaAs regions. At high pump intensities, the Kerr signals from the GaAs
epilayer and the substrate can be distinguished when using a barrier between
the two layers that blocks intermixing of the two electron populations. This
allows for stronger pumping of the epilayer, which results in a shift of the
effective g-factor. Thus, three populations can be distinguished using
differences in g-factor. We support this interpretation by studying how the
spin dynamics of each population has its unique dependence on temperature, and
how they correlate with time-resolved reflectance signals.
