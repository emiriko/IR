We present a search for standard model Higgs boson to WW(*) production in
dilepton plus missing transverse energy final states in data collected by the
CDF II detector corresponding to 4.8/fb of integrated luminosity. To maximize
sensitivity, the multivariate discriminants used to separate signal from
background in the opposite-sign dilepton event sample are independently
optimized for final states with zero, one, or two or more identified jets. All
significant Higgs boson production modes (gluon fusion, associated production
with either a W or Z boson, and vector boson fusion) are considered in
determining potential signal contributions. We also incorporate a separate
analysis of the same-sign dilepton event sample which potentially contains
additional signal events originating from associated Higgs boson production
mechanisms. Cross section limits relative to the combined SM predictions are
presented for a range of Higgs boson mass hypotheses between 110 and 200
GeV/c^2.
