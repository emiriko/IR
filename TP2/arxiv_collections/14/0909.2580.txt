Magnetic fields connecting the immediate environs of rotating black holes to
large distances appear to be the most promising mechanism for launching
relativistic jets, an idea first developed by Blandford and Znajek in the
mid-1970s. To enable an understanding of this process, we provide a brief
introduction to dynamics and electromagnetism in the spacetime near black
holes. We then present a brief summary of the classical Blandford-Znajek
mechanism and its conceptual foundations. Recently, it has become possible to
study these effects in much greater detail using numerical simulation. After
discussing which aspects of the problem can be handled well by numerical means
and which aspects remain beyond the grasp of such methods, we summarize their
results so far. Simulations have confirmed that processes akin to the classical
Blandford-Znajek mechanism can launch powerful electromagnetically-dominated
jets, and have shown how the jet luminosity can be related to black hole spin
and concurrent accretion rate. However, they have also shown that the
luminosity and variability of jets can depend strongly on magnetic field
geometry. We close with a discussion of several important open questions.
