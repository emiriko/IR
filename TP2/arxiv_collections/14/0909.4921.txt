The null findings of the terrestrially conducted Michelson-Morley type
experiments have been influential to determining which physical theory best
fits reality. Here, we propose the use of parallax and ranging techniques of
distance measurement for Michelson-Morley type experimentation on astronomical
scales, elaborating with the earth-moon system. A motivation is the bypass of
any hypothetical earth-bound medium as an explanation for the earlier null
findings. When the solar system 370 kms-1 motion relative to the cosmic
microwave background is taken into consideration, the higher value of receptor
velocity and the longer distance sets the stage for a confrontation between
Lorentzian and Galileo-Newton dynamical transformations. Two-way ranging time
carries along with it information about light's dynamical transformation, thus
a comparison of distance measured by ranging with that by parallax, a
geometrical method can reveal the correctness of assumptions underlying the
dynamical behaviour of light. Two-way ranging times unaffected by the 370 kms-1
velocity indicate null results and further buttress Einstein's relativity
theory, while ranging times affected by this velocity indicate non-null results
and will manifest as a general increase of ranging distance above actual
geometric lunar distance, up to 500 metres in RA 11h 11.649m and 23h 11.649m
coordinate directions.
