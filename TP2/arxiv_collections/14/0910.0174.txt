A modification to the contransverse mass (MCT) technique for measuring the
masses of pair-produced semi-invisibly decaying heavy particles is proposed in
which MCT is corrected for non-zero boosts of the centre-of-momentum (CoM)
frame of the heavy states in the laboratory transverse plane. Lack of knowledge
of the mass of the CoM frame prevents exact correction for this boost, however
it is shown that a conservative correction can nevertheless be derived which
always generates an MCT value which is less than or equal to the true value of
MCT in the CoM frame. The new technique is demonstrated with case studies of
mass measurement with fully leptonic ttbar events and with SUSY events
possessing a similar final state.
