It is assumed that, for weak spacetime curvature, the main gravitational
effect of the quantum vacuum stress-energy corresponds to adding two terms to
the Einstein-Hilbert action, proportional to the square of the curvature scalar
and to the contraction of two Ricci tensors, respectively. It is shown that
compatibility with terrestrial and solar systems observaction implies that the
square roorts of the coefficients of these terms should be either a few
millimeters or a few hundred meters. It is shown that the vacuum contribution
increase the stability of white dwarfs.
