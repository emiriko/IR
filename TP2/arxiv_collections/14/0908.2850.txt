Extensive multi-band afterglow data are available for GRB 980703. Especially,
its radio afterglow was very bright and was monitored until more than 1000 days
after the trigger time. Additionally, there is no obvious special feature,
i.e., no rebrightenings, no plateau, and no special steep decay or slow decay
in the multi-band afterglow light curves. All these conditions make GRB 980703
a precious sample in gamma-ray burst research. Here we use the observational
data of GRB 980703 to test the standard fireball model in depth. It is found
that the model can give a satisfactory explanation to the multi-band and
overall afterglow light curves. The beaming angle of GRB 980703 is derived as
~0.23 radian, and the circum-burst medium density is ~ 27 cm-3. The total
isotropic equivalent kinetic energy of the ejecta is ~ 3.8E52 ergs. A
rest-frame extinction of Av ~ 2.5 mag in the host galaxy is also derived.
