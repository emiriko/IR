We construct Zero-Coupon Bond markets driven by a cylindrical Brownian motion
in which the notion of generalized portfolio has important flaws: There exist
bounded smooth random variables with generalized hedging portfolios for which
the price of their risky part is $+\infty$ at each time. For these generalized
portfolios, sequences of the prices of the risky part of approximating
portfolios can be made to converges to any given extended real number in
$[-\infty,\infty].$
