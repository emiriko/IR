We study the extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) density functional of the superfluid
unitary Fermi gas. This functional includes a gradient term which is essential
to describe accurately the surface effects of the system, in particular with a
small number of atoms, where the Thomas-Fermi (local density) approximation
fails. We find that our ETF functional gives density profiles which are in good
agreement with recent Monte Carlo results and also with a more sophisticated
superfluid density functional based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. In
addition, by using extended hydrodynamics equations of superfluids, we
calculate the frequencies of collective surface oscillations of the unitary
Fermi gas, showing that quadrupole and octupole modes strongly depend on the
number of trapped atoms.
