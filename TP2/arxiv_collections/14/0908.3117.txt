The Littlest Higgs Model with T parity (LHT) is an interesting alternative
model for New Physics at the TeV scale. Although Flavour Physics was not the
reason for creating the LHT model, significant effects (such as large CP
violation where not predicted by the SM) can be created without violating
existing experimental bounds. We study the B-, K- and especially the D-sector.
