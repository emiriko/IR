Motivated by potential applications in multiplexing and by recent results on
Gabor analysis with Hermite windows due to Gr\"{o}chenig and Lyubarskii, we
investigate vector-valued wavelet transforms and vector-valued wavelet frames,
which constitute special cases of super-wavelets, with a particular attention
to the case when the analyzing wavelet vector is related to Fourier transforms
of Laguerre functions. We construct an isometric isomorphism between
$L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{+},\mathbf{C}^{n})$ and poly-Bergman spaces, with a view to
relate the sampling sequences in the poly-Bergman spaces to the wavelet frames
and super-frames with the windows $\Phi_{n}$. One of the applications of the
theory is a proof that $b\ln a<2\pi (n+1)$ is a necessary condition for the
(scalar) wavelet frame associated to the $\Phi_{n}$ to exist. This seems to be
the first known result of this type outside the setting of analytic functions
(the case $n=0$, which has been completely studied by Seip in 1993).
