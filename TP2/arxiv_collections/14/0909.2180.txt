Aims. The detailed analysis of all data taken by the XMM-Newton satellite of
UGC11763 to characterize the different components that are emitting and
absorbing radiation in the vicinity of the active nucleus.
  Methods. The continuum emission was studied through the EPIC spectra taking
profit of the spectral range of these cameras. The high resolution RGS spectra
were analyzed in order to characterize the absorbing features and the emission
line features that arise in the spectra of this source.
  Results. A power law with a photon index \Gamma = 1.72^{+0.03}_{-0.01}
accounts for the continuum emission of this source in the hard X-rays from 10
down to 1 keV. At lower energies, a black body model with kT= 0.100\pm 0.003
keV provides a good description of the observed soft excess. The absorption
signatures in the spectra of UGC11763 are consistent with the presence of a two
phase ionized material (log U=1.65^{+0.07}_{-0.08}; 2.6\pm 0.1 and log N_{H} =
21.2\pm 0.2; 21.51\pm 0.01 cm^{-2}, respectively) in the line of sight. The
physical conditions found are consistent with the two phases being in pressure
equilibrium. The low ionization component is more ionized than typically found
for warm absorbers in other Seyfert 1 galaxies. There are also signatures of
some emission lines: Ovii He$\alpha$(r), Ovii He$\alpha$(f), a blend of the
Neix He$\alpha$ triplet and Fexviii at \lambda 17.5 \AA.
