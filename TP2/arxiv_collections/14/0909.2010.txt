We aim to obtain accurate rate coefficients for the collisional excitation of
CH+ by He for high gas temperatures. The ab initio coupled-cluster [CCSD(T)]
approximation was used to compute the interaction potential energy. Cross
sections are then derived in the close coupling (CC) approach and rate
coefficients inferred by averaging these cross sections over a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energies. Cross sections are
calculated up to 10'000 cm^-1 for J ranging from 0 to 10. Rate coefficients are
obtained at high temperatures up to 2000 K.
