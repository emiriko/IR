In ordinary semiconductor bilayers, exciton condensates appear at total
Landau level filling factor $\nu_{T}=1$. We predict that similar states will
occur in Bernal stacked graphene bilayers at many non-zero integer filling
factors. For $\nu_{T} = -3,1$ we find that the superfluid density of the
exciton condensate vanishes and that a finite-temperature fluctuation induced
first order isotropic-smectic phase transition occurs when the layer densities
are not balanced. These anomalous properties of bilayer graphene exciton
condensates are due to the degeneracy of Landau levels with $n=0$ and $n=1$
orbital character.
