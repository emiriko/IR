Measurements of the production of events containing isolated high energy
leptons (electrons and muons) produced in ep collisions have been performed
with the H1 and ZEUS detectors at HERA, using data collected in the period
1994-2007. Topologies with more than one charged lepton or with a charged
lepton in coincidence with missing transverse momentum are analysed. The H1 and
ZEUS data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 0.5 fb^-1 per
experiment, are combined in a common phase space. The observed event yields are
compared to the predictions from the Standard Model. In general a good
agreement is found, where the expectation is dominated by photon-photon
collisions for the multi-lepton topologies and by single W production in the
case of events with an isolated electron or muon and missing transverse
momentum. Events with large transverse momentum are observed. Total and
differential cross sections of these processes are measured.
