We describe a Monte Carlo radiative transport code intended for calculating
spectra of hot, optically thin plasmas in full general relativity. The version
we describe here is designed to model hot accretion flows in the Kerr metric
and therefore incorporates synchrotron emission and absorption, and Compton
scattering. The code can be readily generalized, however, to account for other
radiative processes and an arbitrary spacetime. We describe a suite of test
problems, and demonstrate the expected $N^{-1/2}$ convergence rate, where $N$
is the number of Monte Carlo samples. Finally we illustrate the capabilities of
the code with a model calculation, a spectrum of the slowly accreting black
hole Sgr A* based on data provided by a numerical general relativistic MHD
model of the accreting plasma.
