We present experimental results approximating the Jones polynomial using 4
qubits in a liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information
processor. This is the first experimental implementation of a complete problem
for the deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit model of quantum
computation, which uses a single qubit accompanied by a register of completely
random states. The Jones polynomial is a knot invariant that is important not
only to knot theory, but also to statistical mechanics and quantum field
theory. The implemented algorithm is a modification of the algorithm developed
by Shor and Jordan suitable for implementation in NMR. These experimental
results show that for the restricted case of knots whose braid representations
have four strands and exactly three crossings, identifying distinct knots is
possible 91% of the time.
