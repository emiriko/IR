Even though people in our contemporary, technological society are depending
on communication, our understanding of the underlying laws of human
communicational behavior continues to be poorly understood. Here we investigate
the communication patterns in two social Internet communities in search of
statistical laws in human interaction activity. This research reveals that
human communication networks dynamically follow scaling laws that may also
explain the observed trends in economic growth. Specifically, we identify a
generalized version of Gibrat's law of social activity expressed as a scaling
law between the fluctuations in the number of messages sent by members and
their level of activity. Gibrat's law has been essential in understanding
economic growth patterns, yet without an underlying general principle for its
origin. We attribute this scaling law to long-term correlation patterns in
human activity, which surprisingly span from days to the entire period of the
available data of more than one year. Further, we provide a mathematical
framework that relates the generalized version of Gibrat's law to the long-term
correlated dynamics, which suggests that the same underlying mechanism could be
the source of Gibrat's law in economics, ranging from large firms, research and
development expenditures, gross domestic product of countries, to city
population growth. These findings are also of importance for designing
communication networks and for the understanding of the dynamics of social
systems in which communication plays a role, such as economic markets and
political systems.
