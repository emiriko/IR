Coherent pion production in low energy neutrino reactions is discussed in the
framework of the partially conserved axial vector current theory (PCAC). The
role of lepton mass effects in suppressing production of positively charged
pions is discussed. Instead of using models of pion nucleus scattering, the
available data on pion carbon scattering are implemented for an analysis of the
PCAC prediction. Our results agree well with the published upper limits for
positively charged production but are much below the recent MiniBooNE result
for neutral pion production.
