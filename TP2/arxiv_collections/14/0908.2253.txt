We study steady-state charge transfer across an interacting resonance-level
model connected asymmetrically to two leads. For a linear energy dispersion
relation of the leads, we calculate current-voltage characteristics of the
model exactly employing the scattering Bethe-Ansatz of Mehta-Andrei and find
symmetric transport showing the absence of diode effect. Next we study a
lattice version of this model with a nonlinear dispersion for the leads using
the Lippmann-Schwinger scattering theory. We find that the inclusion of
nonlinearity in the leads' dispersion causes rectification for asymmetric
junctions but does not rectify for asymmetric interactions and perfect
junctions. The model in the latter case can be mapped into a model of a single
noninteracting electron in higher dimensions.
