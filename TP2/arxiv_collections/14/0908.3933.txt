The ATCA, MERLIN and VLA interferometers were used to measure the absolute
positions of 35 6.7 GHz methanol masers to subarcsecond or higher accuracy. Our
measurements represent essential preparatory data for Very Long Baseline
Interferometry, which can provide accurate parallax and proper motion
determinations of the star-forming regions harboring the masers. Our data also
allow associations to be established with infrared sources at different
wavelengths. Our findings support the view that the 6.7 GHz masers are
associated with the earliest phases of high-mass star formation.
