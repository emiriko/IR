Energy and decay estimates for the wave equation on the exterior region of
slowly rotating Kerr spacetimes are proved. The method used is a generalization
of the vector-field method, which allows the use of higher-order symmetry
operators. In particular, our method makes use of the second-order Carter
operator, which is a hidden symmetry in the sense that it does not correspond
to a Killing symmetry of the spacetime.
