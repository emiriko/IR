Exotic stable massive particles (SMP) are proposed in a number of scenarios
of physics beyond the Standard Model.
  It is important that LHC experiments are able to detect hadronic SMP with
masses around the TeV scale. To do this, an understanding of the interactions
of SMPs in matter is required. In this paper a Regge-based model of $R$-hadron
scattering is extended and implemented in Geant-4.
