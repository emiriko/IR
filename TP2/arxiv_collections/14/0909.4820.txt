In this work, we focus our studies on the subject of nonlinear discrete
self-trapping of S=2 (doubly-charged) vortices in two-dimensional photonic
lattices, including theoretical analysis, numerical computation and
experimental demonstration. We revisit earlier findings about S=2 vortices with
a discrete model, and find that S=2 vortices extended over eight lattice sites
can indeed be stable (or only weakly unstable) under certain conditions, not
only for the cubic nonlinearity previously used, but also for a saturable
nonlinearity more relevant to our experiment with a biased photorefractive
nonlinear crystal. We then use the discrete analysis as a guide towards
numerically identifying stable (and unstable) vortex solutions in a more
realistic continuum model with a periodic potential. Finally, we present our
experimental observation of such geometrically extended S=2 vortex solitons in
optically induced lattices under both self-focusing and self-defocusing
nonlinearities, and show clearly that the S=2 vortex singularities are
preserved during nonlinear propagation.
