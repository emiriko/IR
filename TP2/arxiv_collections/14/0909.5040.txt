We use XMM-Newton data of the merging cluster Abell 3667 to analyze its
metallicity distribution. A detailed abundance map of the central 1.1x1.1 Mpc
region indicates that metals are inhomogeneously distributed in the cluster
showing a non-uniform and very complex metal pattern. The highest peak in the
map corresponds to a cold region, slightly offset South of the X-ray center.
This could be interpreted as stripped gas due to a merger between a group
moving from NW towards the SE and the main cluster. We note several clumps of
high metallicity also in the opposite direction with respect to the X-ray peak.
Furthermore we determined abundances for 5 elements (O, Si, S, Ar, Fe) in four
different regions of the cluster. Comparisons between these observed abundances
and theoretical supernovae yields allow to get constraints on the relative
number of SN Ia and II contributing to the enrichment of the intra-cluster
medium. To reproduce the observed abundances of the best determined elements
(Fe, O and Si) in a region of 7 arcmin around the X-ray center, 65-80% of SN II
are needed. The comparison between the metal map, a galaxy density map obtained
using 550 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members and our simulations
suggest a recent merger between the main cluster and the group in the SE.
