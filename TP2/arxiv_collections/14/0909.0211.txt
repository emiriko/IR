A total position operator $X$ in the position representation is derived for
lattice fermionic systems with periodic boundary conditions. The operator is
shown to be Hermitian, the generator of translations in momentum space, and its
time derivative is shown to correspond to the total current operator in a
periodic system. The operator is such that its moments can be calculated up to
any order. To demonstrate its utility finite size scaling is applied to the
Brinkman-Rice transition as well as metallic and insulating Gutzwiller
wavefunctions.
