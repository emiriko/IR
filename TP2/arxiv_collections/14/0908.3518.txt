Luminous X-ray stars are very often found in visual double or multiple stars.
Binaries with periods of a few days possess the highest degree of coronal X-ray
activity among regular, non-relativistic stars because of their fast, tidally
driven rotation. But the orbital periods in visual double stars are too large
for any direct interaction between the companions to take place. We suggest
that most of the strongest X-ray components in resolved binaries are
yet-undiscovered short-period binaries, and that a few are merged remnants of
such binaries. The omnipresence of short-period active stars, e.g. of
BY-Dra-type binaries, in multiple systems is explained via the dynamical
evolution of triple stars with large mutual inclinations. The dynamical
perturbation on the inner pair pumps up the eccentricity in a cyclic manner, a
phenomenon known as Kozai cycling. At times of close periapsis, tidal friction
reduces the angular momentum of the binary, causing it to shrink. When the
orbital period of the inner pair drops to a few days, fast surface rotation of
the companions is driven by tidal forces, boosting activity by a few orders of
magnitude. If the period drops still further, a merger may take place leaving a
rapidly-rotating active dwarf with only a distant companion.
