Using CARMA, we imaged the 87 GHz SiO v=0 J=2-1 line toward Orion-KL with
0.45 arcsec angular resolution. The maps indicate that radio source I drives a
bipolar outflow into the surrounding molecular cloud along a NE--SW axis, in
agreement with the model of Greenhill et al. (2004). The extended high velocity
outflow from Orion-KL appears to be a continuation of this compact outflow.
High velocity gas extends farthest along a NW--SE axis, suggesting that the
outflow direction changes on time scales of a few hundred years.
