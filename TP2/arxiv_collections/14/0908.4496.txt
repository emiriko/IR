Grids of stellar atmosphere models and associated synthetic spectra are
numerical products which have a large impact in astronomy due to their
ubiquitous application in the interpretation of radiation from individual stars
and stellar populations. 3D model atmospheres are now on the verge of becoming
generally available for a wide range of stellar atmospheric parameters. We
report on efforts to develop a grid of 3D model atmospheres for late-type stars
within the CIFIST Team at Paris Observatory. The substantial demands in
computational and human labor for the model production and post-processing
render this apparently mundane task a challenging logistic exercise. At the
moment the CIFIST grid comprises 77 3D model atmospheres with emphasis on
dwarfs of solar and sub-solar metallicities. While the model production is
still ongoing, first applications are already worked upon by the CIFIST Team
and collaborators.
