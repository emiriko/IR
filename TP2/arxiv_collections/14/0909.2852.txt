This paper presents a new efficient protocol for k-out-of-n oblivious
transfer which is a generalization of Parakh's 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer
protocol based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange. In the proposed protocol, the
parties involved generate Diffie-Hellman keys obliviously and then use them for
oblivious transfer of secrets.
