The application of random matrix theory to scattering requires introduction
of system-specific information. This paper shows that the average impedance
matrix, which characterizes such system-specific properties, can be
semiclassically calculated in terms of ray trajectories between ports.
Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results for a microwave
billiard, demonstrating that the theory successfully uncovered universal
statistics of wave-chaotic scattering systems.
