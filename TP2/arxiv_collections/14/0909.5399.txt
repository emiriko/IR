There is a formal correspondence between the isotropic 3-wave kinetic
equation and the rate equations for a non-linear fragmentation--aggregation
process. We exploit this correspondence to study analytically the time
evolution of the wave frequency power spectrum. Specifically, we analyzed a
3-wave turbulence in which the wave interaction kernel is a constant. We
consider both forced and decaying turbulence. In the forced case, the scaling
function diverges as $x^{-3/2}$ as expected from Kolmogorov-Zakharov theory. In
the decaying case, the scaling function exhibits non-trivial, and hitherto
unexpected, divergence with both algebraic and logarithmic spectral exponents
which we calculate. This divergence leads to non-trivial decay laws for the
total wave action and the number of primary waves. All theoretical predictions
are verified with high quality numerical simulations of the 3-wave kinetic
equation.
