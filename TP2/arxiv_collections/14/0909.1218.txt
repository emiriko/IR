The Schrodinger equation for the rotational-vibrational (ro-vibrational)
motion of a diatomic molecule with empirical potential functions is solved
approximately by means of the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The approximate
ro-vibratinal energy spectra and the corresponding normalized total
wavefunctions are calculated in closed form and expressed in terms of the
hypergeometric functions or Jacobi polynomials P_{n}^{(\mu,\nu)}(x), where
\mu>-1, \nu>-1 and x included in [-1,+1]. The s-waves analytic solution is
obtained. The numerical energy eigenvalues for selected H_{2} and Ar_{2}
molecules are also calculated and compared with the previous models and
experiments.
