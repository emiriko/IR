The quantum Lifshitz model provides an effective description of a quantum
critical point. It has been shown that even though non--Lorentz invariant, the
action admits a natural supersymmetrization. In this note we introduce a
perturbative framework and show how the supersymmetric structure can be used to
greatly simplify the Feynman rules and thus the study of the model.
