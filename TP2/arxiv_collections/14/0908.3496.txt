We predict that simple metals and early transition metals that become
superconducting under high pressures will show a change in sign of their Hall
coefficient from negative to positive under pressure. If verified, this will
strongly suggest that hole carriers play a fundamental role in `conventional'
superconductivity, as predicted by the theory of hole superconductivity.
