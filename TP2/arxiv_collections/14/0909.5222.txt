The Landauer approach to diffusive transport is mathematically related to the
solution of the Boltzmann transport equation, and expressions for the
thermoelectric parameters in both formalisms are presented. Quantum mechanical
and semiclassical techniques to obtain from a full description of the
bandstructure, E(k), the number of conducting channels in the Landauer approach
or the transport distribution in the Boltzmann solution are developed and
compared. Thermoelectric transport coefficients are evaluated from an atomistic
level, full band description of a crystal. Several example calculations for
representative bulk materials are presented, and the full band results are
related to the more common effective mass formalism. Finally, given a full E(k)
for a crystal, a procedure to extract an accurate, effective mass level
description is presented.
