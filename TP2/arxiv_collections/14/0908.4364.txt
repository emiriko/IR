We report on Raman scattering experiments of the undoped SrFe2As2 and
superconducting Sr0.85K0.15Fe2As2 (Tc=28K) and Ba0.72K0.28Fe2As2 (Tc=32K)
single crystals. The frequency and linewidth of the B1g mode at 210 cm-1
exhibits an appreciable temperature dependence induced by the superconducting
and spin density wave transitions. We give estimates of the electron-phonon
coupling related to this renormalization. In addition, we observe a pronounced
quasi-elastic Raman response for the undoped compound, suggesting persisting
magnetic fluctuations to low temperatures. In the superconducting state the
renormalization of an electronic continuum is observed with a threshold energy
of 61cm-1.
