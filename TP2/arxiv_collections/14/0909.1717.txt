Parity-odd domains, corresponding to non-trivial topological solutions of the
QCD vacuum, might be created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These
domains are predicted to lead to charge separation of quarks along the orbital
momentum of the system created in non-central collisions. To study this effect,
we investigate a three particle mixed harmonics azimuthal correlator which is a
\P-even observable, but directly sensitive to the charge separation effect. We
report measurements of this observable using the STAR detector in Au+Au and
Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 and 62~GeV. The results are presented
as a function of collision centrality, particle separation in rapidity, and
particle transverse momentum. A signal consistent with several of the
theoretical expectations is detected in all four data sets. We compare our
results to the predictions of existing event generators, and discuss in detail
possible contributions from other effects that are not related to parity
violation.
