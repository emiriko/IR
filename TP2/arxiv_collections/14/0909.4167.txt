We present a systematic study of stellar feedback processes in simulations of
disk galaxy formation. Using a dark matter halo with properties similar to the
ones for the Milky Way's stellar halo, we perform a comparison of different
methods of distributing energy related to feedback processes to the surrounding
gas. A most promising standard model is applied to halos spanning a range of
masses in order to compare the results to disk galaxy scaling relations. With
few exceptions we find little or no angular momentum deficiency for our
galaxies and a good agreement with the angular momentum-size relation. Our
galaxies are in good agreement with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and the
slope of the photometric Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced. We find a
zero-point offset of 0.7 to 1 magnitudes, depending on the employed IMF. We
also study our standard feedback model in combination with additional physical
processes like a UV background, kinetic feedback, a delayed energy deposition
as expected for type Ia supernovae, mass return and metal-dependent cooling.
Only a combination of effects yields a real improvement of the resulting galaxy
by reducing the bulge, while including metal-dependent cooling increases the
bulge again. We find that in general the stellar mass fraction of our galaxies
is too high. In an ad-hoc experiment we show that an removal of the bulge could
reconcile this. However, the fit of the Tully-Fisher relation can only be
improved by delaying the star formation, but not suppressing it completely. Our
models do not seem to be efficient enough to achieve either effect. We conclude
that disk formation is a complex, highly interconnected problem and we expect a
solution to come from a combination of small effects.
