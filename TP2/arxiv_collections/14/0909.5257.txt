We use a graphics processing unit (GPU) for fast calculations of helicity
amplitudes of quark and gluon scattering processes in massless QCD. New HEGET
({\bf H}ELAS {\bf E}valuation with {\bf G}PU {\bf E}nhanced {\bf T}echnology)
codes for gluon self-interactions are introduced, and a C++ program to convert
the MadGraph generated FORTRAN codes into HEGET codes in CUDA (a C-platform for
general purpose computing on GPU) is created. Because of the proliferation of
the number of Feynman diagrams and the number of independent color amplitudes,
the maximum number of final state jets we can evaluate on a GPU is limited to 4
for pure gluon processes ($gg\to 4g$), or 5 for processes with one or more
quark lines such as $q\bar{q}\to 5g$ and $qq\to qq+3g$. Compared with the usual
CPU-based programs, we obtain 60-100 times better performance on the GPU,
except for 5-jet production processes and the $gg\to 4g$ processes for which
the GPU gain over the CPU is about 20.
