We calculate the spatial entanglement between two electrons trapped in a
nanostructure for a broad class of confinement potentials, including single and
double quantum dots, and core-shell quantum dot structures.
  By using a parametrized confinement potential, we are able to switch from one
structure to the others with continuity and to analyze how the entanglement is
influenced by the changes in the confinement geometry. We calculate the
many-body wave function by `exact' diagonalization of the time independent
Schr\"odinger equation. We discuss the relationship between the entanglement
and specific cuts of the wave function, and show that the wave function at a
single highly symmetric point could be a good indicator for the entanglement
content of the system. We analyze the counterintuitive relationship between
spatial entanglement and Coulomb interaction, which connects maxima (minima) of
the first to minima (maxima) of the latter. We introduce a potential quantum
phase transition which relates quantum states characterized by different
spatial topology. Finally we show that by varying shape, range and strength of
the confinement potential, it is possible to induce strong and rapid variations
of the entanglement between the two electrons. This property may be used to
tailor nanostructures according to the level of entanglement required by a
specific application.
