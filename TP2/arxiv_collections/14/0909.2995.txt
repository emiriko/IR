It is well known that Schr\"{o}dinger's equation is only suitable for the
particle in conservative force field. In atomic and molecular field, a particle
can suffer the action of non-conservative force. In this paper, a new quantum
wave equation is proposed, which can describe the particle in non-conservative
force field. We think the new quantum wave equation can be used in many fields.
