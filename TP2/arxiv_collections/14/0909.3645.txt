We present results from a new 100-ks Suzaku observation of the nearby radio
galaxy 3C 33, and investigate the nature of absorption, reflection, and jet
production in this source. We model the 2-70 keV nuclear continuum with a power
law that is absorbed either through one or more layers of pc-scale neutral
material, or through a modestly ionized pc-scale obscurer. The expected
signatures of reflection from a neutral accretion disk are absent in 3C 33:
there is no evidence of a relativistically blurred Fe K$\alpha$ emission line,
and no Compton reflection hump above 10 keV. We discuss the implications of
this for the nature of jet production in 3C 33.
