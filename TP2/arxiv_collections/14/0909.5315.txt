For scalar reaction-diffusion in one space dimension, it is known for a long
time that fronts move with an exponentially small speed for potentials with
several distinct mini- mizers. The purpose of this paper is to provide a
similar result in the case of systems. Our method relies on a careful study of
the evolution of localized energy. This approach has the advantage to relax the
preparedness assumptions on the initial datum.
