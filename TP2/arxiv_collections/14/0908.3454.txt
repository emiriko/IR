This note presents two ideas. The first one is that quantum theory has a
fundamentally perturbative basis but leads to nonperturbative states which it
would seem natural to take into account in the foundation of a theory of
quantum phenomena. The second one consists in questioning the validity of the
present notion of time. Both matters are related to the fact that atomic levels
have a certain width. This note is presented qualitatively so as to evidence
its main points, independently of the models on which these have been tested.
