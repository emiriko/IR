By combining data from the text, citation, and reference databases with data
from the ADS readership logs we have been able to create Second Order
Bibliometric Operators, a customizable class of collaborative filters which
permits substantially improved accuracy in literature queries.
  Using the ADS usage logs along with membership statistics from the
International Astronomical Union and data on the population and gross domestic
product (GDP) we develop an accurate model for world-wide basic research where
the number of scientists in a country is proportional to the GDP of that
country, and the amount of basic research done by a country is proportional to
the number of scientists in that country times that country's per capita GDP.
  We introduce the concept of utility time to measure the impact of the
ADS/URANIA and the electronic astronomical library on astronomical research. We
find that in 2002 it amounted to the equivalent of 736 FTE researchers, or $250
Million, or the astronomical research done in France.
