We show how coupling techniques can be used in some metastable systems to
prove that mean metastable exit times are almost constant as functions of the
starting microscopic configuration within a "meta-stable set." In the example
of the Random Field Curie Weiss model, we show that these ideas can also be
used to prove asymptotic exponentiallity of normalized metastable escape times.
