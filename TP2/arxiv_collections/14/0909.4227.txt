An exact solution of the Einstein equations for a Bianchi-I universe in the
presence of dust, stiff matter and a negative cosmological constant,
generalising the well-known Heckmann-Schucking solution is presented. This
solution describes a universe existing during a finite period of cosmic time,
where the beginning and the end of its evolution are characterized by the
presence of Kasner type cosmological singularities.
