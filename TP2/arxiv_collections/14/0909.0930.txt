A spectroscopic analysis of SDSS J160043.6+074802.9, a binary system
containing a pulsating subdwarf-O (sdO) star with a late-type companion, yields
Teff = 70 000 +/- 5000 K and log g = 5.25 +/- 0.30, together with a most likely
type of K3V for the secondary star. We compare our results with atmospheric
parameters derived by Fontaine et al. (2008) and in the context of existing
evolution models for sdO stars. New and more extensive photometry is also
presented which recovers most, but not all, frequencies found in an earlier
paper. It therefore seems probable that some pulsation modes have variable
amplitudes. A non-adiabatic pulsation analysis of uniform metallicity sdO
models show those having log g > 5.3 to be more likely to be unstable and
capable of driving pulsation in the observed frequency range.
