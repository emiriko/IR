A monochromatic laser pumping a parametric down conversion crystal generates
frequency entangled photon pairs. We study this experimentally by addressing
such frequency entangled photons at telecommunication wavelengths (around 1550
nm) with fiber optics components such as electro-optic phase modulators and
narrow band frequency filters. The theory underlying our approach is developed
by introducing the notion of frequency bin entanglement. Our results show that
the phase modulators address coherently up to eleven frequency bins, leading to
an interference pattern which can violate a Bell inequality adapted to our
setup by more than five standard deviations.
