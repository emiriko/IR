With toy modelling of conceptual aspects of quantum cosmology and the problem
of time in quantum gravity in mind, I study the classical and quantum dynamics
of the pure-shape (i.e. scale-free) triangle formed by 3 particles in 2-d. I do
so by importing techniques to the triangle model from the corresponding 4
particles in 1-d model, using the fact that both have 2-spheres for shape
spaces, though the latter has a trivial realization whilst the former has a
more involved Hopf (or Dragt) type realization. I furthermore interpret the
ensuing Dragt-type coordinates as shape quantities: a measure of
anisoscelesness, the ellipticity of the base and apex's moments of inertia, and
a quantity proportional to the area of the triangle. I promote these quantities
at the quantum level to operators whose expectation and spread are then useful
in understanding the quantum states of the system. Additionally, I tessellate
the 2-sphere by its physical interpretation as the shape space of triangles,
and then use this as a back-cloth from which to read off the interpretation of
dynamical trajectories, potentials and wavefunctions. I include applications to
timeless approaches to the problem of time and to the role of uniform states in
quantum cosmological modelling.
