One can describe cosmological relic neutrinos by adding Lagrange multipliers
to the Standard Model Lagrangian for them. The two possible Lagrange
multipliers are a chemical potential, which fixes the mean
neutrino/anti-neutrino asymmetry, and a Majorana mass, which fixes the mean
spin-entropy. Because these neutrinos originated from a thermal bath, their
entropy should be maximal, implying that each state in the background is a
symmetric superposition of a neutrino and anti-neutrino. Therefore the Standard
Model must be augmented by a flavor-diagonal Majorana neutrino mass matrix.
This impacts the propagator via tadpole diagrams due to self-interactions. In
the low-energy limit, neutrino self-interactions are entirely off-diagonal
because same-flavor four-fermion operators vanish by Pauli exclusion. These
interactions must be diagonalized when propagating through a bath of neutrinos,
using the U(3) global flavor symmetry. U(3) gets broken broken down to SO(3) by
Majorana masses, and down to $A_4$ if the three masses are different. Thus our
universe today contains tri-bimaximal mixing and Majorana neutrinos. Neutrino
mixing is due to the mismatch between the flavor-diagonal Majorana mass matrix
arising at finite density and the self-interaction diagonal finite density
propagator. The mass hierarchy is inverted and Majorana phases are absent.
Lepton number is conserved and the neutrino-less double beta decay experiment
absorbs a pair of neutrinos from the relic background and will prove their
Majorana nature.
