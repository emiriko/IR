Symbiotic X-ray Binaries (SyXBs) are a recently discovered subclass of Low
Mass X-ray Binaries. Their growing number makes them an important evolutionary
channel of X-ray Binaries. Our goal is to perform spectral analysis and
classification of the proposed counterparts to IGR J16358-4726 and IGR
J16393-4643 and to establish their nature as X-ray systems. We used the ESO/UT1
ISAAC spectrograph to observe the proposed counterparts to the two sources,
obtaining K-band medium resolution spectra (R = 500) with a S/N > 140. Data
reduction was performed with the standard procedure. We classified them by
means of comparison with published atlases. We performed SED fitting in order
to refine the spectral classification. The two counterparts clearly exhibit the
typical features of late-type stars, notably strong CO absorption bands in the
red part of the spectrum. With information from previous X-ray studies, we
classify the two systems as two new members of the SyXB class. For IGR
J16393-4643, we considered the most probable counterpart to the system,
although three other objects cannot be completely discarded. For this system,
we compared our findings with available orbital solutions, constraining the
orbital parameters and the mass of the companion star. By including two more
systems, we increased to eight the number of known SyXBs, which emerges as a
non-negligible category of galactic X-ray binaries.
