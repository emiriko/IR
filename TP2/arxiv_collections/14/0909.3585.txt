We aimed at finding a physical explanation for the occurrence of
macroturbulence in the atmospheres of hot massive stars, a phenomenon found in
observations since more than a decade but yet unexplained. We computed time
series of line profiles for evolved massive stars broadened by rotation and by
hundreds of low-amplitude nonradial gravity-mode pulsations which are predicted
to be excited for evolved massive stars. In general, line profiles based on
macrotubulent broadening can mimic those subject to pulsational broadening. In
several cases, though, good fits require macroturbulent velocities that pass
the speed of sound for realistic pulsation amplitudes. Moreover, we find that
the rotation velocity can be seriously underestimated by using a simple
parameter description for macroturbulence rather than an appropriate
pulsational model description to fit the line profiles. We conclude that
macroturbulence is a likely signature of the collective effect of pulsations.
We provide line diagnostics and their typical values to decide whether or not
pulsational broadening is present in observed line profiles, as well as a
procedure to avoid an inaccurate estimation of the rotation velocity.
