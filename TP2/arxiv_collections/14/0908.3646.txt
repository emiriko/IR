The light distribution on the focal surface of spheric mirrors designed for
telescopes in the lens-less Schmidt configuration is calculated analytically
using geometrical optics. This analysis was motivated by considerations of the
design the design of the AUGER fluorescence detector. Its geometrical
parameters are used in the examples.
