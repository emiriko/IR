Dynamical supersymmetry breaking is an important issue for applications of
supersymmetry in particle physics. The functional renormalization group
equations allow for a nonperturbative approach that leaves supersymmetry
intact. Therefore they offer a promising tool to investigate dynamical
supersymmetry breaking. Here we will employ this method to derive the phase
diagram and a surprisingly rich RG fixed-point structure with corresponding
critical exponents for the $\mathcal N=1$ Wess-Zumino model in two dimensions.
