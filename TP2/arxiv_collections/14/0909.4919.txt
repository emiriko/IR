We examine decays of a spin-1 bottomonium into a pair of light scalar Dark
Matter (DM) particles, assuming that Dark Matter is produced due to exchange of
heavy degrees of freedom. We perform a model-independent analysis and derive
formulae for the branching ratios of these decays. We confront our calculation
results with the experimental data. We show that the considered branching
ratios are within the reach of the present BaBaR experimental sensitivity.
Thus, Dark Matter production in Upsilon decays leads to constraints on
parameters of various models containing a light spin-0 DM particle. We
illustrate this for the models with a "WIMPless miracle", in particular for a
Gauge Mediated SUSY breaking scenario, with a spin-0 DM particle in the hidden
sector. Another example considered is the type II 2HDM with a scalar DM
particle.
