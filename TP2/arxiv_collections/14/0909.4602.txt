We investigate the thermal response of the atmosphere of a solar-type star to
an electron beam injected from a hot Jupiter by performing a 1-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic numerical experiment with non-linear wave dissipation,
radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. In our experiment, the stellar
atmosphere is non-rotating and is modelled as a 1-D open flux tube expanding
super-radially from the stellar photosphere to the planet. An electron beam is
assumed to be generated from the reconnection site of the planet's
magnetosphere. The effects of the electron beam are then implemented in our
simulation as dissipation of the beam momentum and energy at the base of the
corona where the Coulomb collisions become effective. When the sufficient
energy is supplied by the electron beam, a warm region forms in the
chromosphere. This warm region greatly enhances the radiative fluxes
corresponding to the temperature of the chromosphere and transition region. The
warm region can also intermittently contribute to the radiative flux associated
with the coronal temperature due to the thermal instability. However, owing to
the small area of the heating spot, the total luminosity of the beam-induced
chromospheric radiation is several orders of magnitude smaller than the
observed Ca II emissions from HD 179949.
