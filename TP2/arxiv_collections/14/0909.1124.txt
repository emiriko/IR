Low temperature magnetotransport measurements and far infrared transmission
spectroscopy are reported in molecular beam epitaxial grown two-dimensional
hole systems confined in strained InAs quantum wells with magnetic impurities
in the channel. The interactions of the free holes spin with the magnetic
moment of 5/2 provided by manganese features intriguing localization phenomena
and anomalies in the Hall and the quantum Hall resistance. In magnetic field
dependent far infrared spectroscopy measurements well pronounced cyclotron
resonance and an additional resonance are found that indicates an anticrossing
with the cyclotron resonance.
