Littlest Higgs model with T-parity and Minimal Supersymmtric standard Model
with R-parity both give similar signatures in collider experiment with a huge
amount of missing energy depending upon mass of the lightest T-odd/R-odd
particle. In this talk, I will discuss possibility of distinguishing the two
models at the LHC in hadronically quiet signal where masses of R-odd particles
are identical to masses of T-odd particles.
