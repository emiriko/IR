Links in a practical network may have different functions, which makes the
original network a combination of some functional subnetworks. Here, by a model
of coupled oscillators, we investigate how such functional subnetworks are
evolved and developed according to the network structure and dynamics. In
particular, we study the case of evolutionary clustered networks in which the
function of each link (either attractive or repulsive coupling) is updated by
the local dynamics. It is found that, during the process of system evolution,
the network is gradually stabilized into a particular form in which the
attractive (repulsive) subnetwork consists only the intralinks (interlinks).
Based on the properties of subnetwork evolution, we also propose a new
algorithm for network partition which is distinguished by the convenient
operation and fast computing speed.
