The recent confirmation of closed Fermi surface in the high temperature
cuprates via de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de haas oscillations calls for a
theoretical investigation of the origin of such oscillations. We study de
Haas-van Alphen oscillations and magnetic breakdown in the context of ortho-II
high temperature cuprates to understand the origin of the multiple frequencies.
We find that the magnetic breakdown is highly sensitive not only to the
ortho-II potential, but also to the Fermi surface topology, and is thus useful
to distinguish between various theoretical proposals related to quantum
oscillations.
