Relativistic models developed for the exclusive and inclusive quasielastic
(QE) electron scattering have been extended to charged-current (CC) and
neutral-current (NC) neutrino-nucleus scattering. Different descriptions of
final-state interactions (FSI) are compared. For the inclusive electron
scattering the relativistic Green's function approach is compared with
calculations based on the use of relativistic purely real mean field potentials
in the final state. Both approaches lead to a redistribution of the strength
but conserving the total flux. Results for the differential cross section at
different energies are presented. Scaling properties are also analyzed and
discussed
