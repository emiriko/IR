The time evolution of vector-meson spectral-functions is studied within a
kinetic theory approach. We implement this formalism in a BUU type transport
model. Applications focus on rho and omega mesons being important pieces for
the interpretation of the di-electron invariant mass spectrum measured by the
HADES collaboration for the reaction C + C at 2 AGeV bombarding energy. Since
the evolution of the spectral functions is driven by the local density, the
in-medium modifications are tiny for small collision systems within this
approach.
