Hopping transport in a one-dimensional system is studied numerically. A fast
algorithm is devised to find the lowest-resistance path at arbitrary electric
field. Probability distribution functions of individual resistances on the path
and the net resistance are calculated and fitted to compact analytic formulas.
Qualitative differences between statistics of resistance fluctuations in Ohmic
and non-Ohmic regimes are elucidated. The results are compared with prior
theoretical and experimental work on the subject.
