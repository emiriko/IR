Relic density calculations are often used to constrain particle physics
models, and in particular supersymmetry. We will show that the presence of
additional energy or entropy before the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis can however
completely change the relic density constraints on the SUSY parameter space.
Therefore one should be extremely careful when using the relic density to
constrain supersymmetry as it could give misleading results, especially if
combined with the future collider data. Alternatively, we will also show that
combining the discoveries of the future colliders with relic density
calculations can shed light on the inaccessible pre-BBN dark time physics.
Finally we will present SuperIso Relic, a new relic density calculator code in
Supersymmetry, which incorporates alternative cosmological models, and is
publicly available.
