J\"urgen Ehlers developed \emph{frame theory} to better understand the
relationship between general relativity and Newtonian gravity. Frame theory
contains a parameter $\lambda$, which can be thought of as $1/c^2$, where $c$
is the speed of light. By construction, frame theory is equivalent to general
relativity for $\lambda >0$, and reduces to Newtonian gravity for $\lambda =0$.
Moreover, by setting $\ep=\sqrt{\lambda}$, frame theory provides a framework to
study the Newtonian limit $\ep \searrow 0$ (i.e. $c\to \infty$). A number of
ideas relating to frame theory that were introduced by J\"urgen have
subsequently found important applications to the rigorous study of both the
Newtonian limit and post-Newtonian expansions. In this article, we review frame
theory and discuss, in a non-technical fashion, some of the rigorous results on
the Newtonian limit and post-Newtonian expansions that have followed from
J\"urgen's work.
