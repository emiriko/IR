We have been analyzing a large sample of solar-like stars with and without
planets in order to homogeneously measure their photospheric parameters and
Carbon abundances. Our sample contains around 200 stars in the solar
neighborhood observed with the ELODIE spectrograph, for which the observational
data are publicly available. We performed spectral synthesis of prominent bands
of C$_{2}$ and C I lines, aiming to accurately obtain the C abundances. We
intend to contribute homogeneous results to studies that compare elemental
abundances in stars with and without known planets. New arguments will be
brought forward to the discussion of possible chemical anomalies that have been
suggested in the literature, leading us to a better understanding of the
planetary formation process. In this work we focus on the C abundances in both
stellar groups of our sample.
