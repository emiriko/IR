We study an extra flavor in the cascading SU((k+1)M)xSU(k M) gauge theory by
adding probe D7-brane to the geometry. By finding a solution to the
kappa-symmetry equation we establish that the D7-brane is mutually
supersymmetric with the background everywhere on the baryonic branch of moduli
space. We also discuss possible applications of this result.
