We study the quantum Hall effect in the surface states of topological
insulator in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field in the framework of
edge states. Motion of Dirac fermions will form descrete Landau levels, among
which a fully saturated zero mode will have different behaviors near the
boundary according to the sign of the effective mass for Dirac fermions. The
Hall conductance is quantized to be n (n is an integer) in the unit of e^2/h
for a positive mass, n+1 for a negative mass, and n+1/2 for massless fermions.
In topological insulator the massive term to the Dirac fermions can be the
Zeeman coupling in a magnetic field or be induced by the finite-size effect in
an ultrathin film. For example the g-factor of Bi_2Se_3 is positive and give
rise to a positive mass term for Dirac fermions. We address experimental
realization of the quantum Hall effect in topological insulators.
