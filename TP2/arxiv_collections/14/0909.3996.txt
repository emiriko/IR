We study supersymmetric (SUSY) responses to a photoassociation process in a
mixture of Bose molecules $b$ and Fermi atoms $f$ which turn to mutual
superpartners for a set of proper parameters. We consider the molecule $b$ to
be a bound state of the atom $f$ and another Fermi atom $F$ with different
species. The $b$-$f$ mixture and a free $F$ atom gas are loaded in an optical
lattice. The SUSY nature of the mixture can be signaled in the response to a
photon induced atom-molecule transition: While two new types of fermionic
excitations, an individual $b$ particle-$f$ hole pair continuum and the
Goldstino-like collective mode, are concomitant for a generic $b$-$f$ mixture,
the former is completely suppressed in the SUSY $b$-$f$ mixture and the
zero-momentum mode of the latter approaches to an exact eigenstate. This SUSY
response can be detected by means of the spectroscopy method, e.g., the
photoassociation spectrum which displays the molecular formation rate of $%
Ff\to b$.
