In a old paper by G. Lochak, it is claimed that the Bell definition of a
hidden variable is in conflict with the formalism of quantum mechanics. This
result implies that it is not necessary to invoke non locality to explain the
violation of the Bell inequality. A careful analysis of the concept of
probability for hidden variables, as defined differently by Bell and Lochak,
show that the reasoning and main conclusions of are not correct.
