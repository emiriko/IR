We report the evolution effects on jet energy loss with detailed balance. The
initial conditions and parton evolution based on perturbative QCD in the
chemical non-equilibrated medium and Bjorken expanding medium at RHIC are
determined. The parton evolution affect the jet energy loss evidently. This
will increase the energy and propagating distance dependence of the parton
energy loss and will affect the shape of suppression of moderately high P_{T}
hadron spectra.
