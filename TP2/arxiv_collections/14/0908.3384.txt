We argue that the most conservative geometric extension of Einstein gravity
describing both positive and negative mass sources and observers is bimetric
gravity and contains two copies of standard model matter which interact only
gravitationally. Matter fields related to one of the metrics then appear dark
from the point of view of an observer defined by the other metric, and so may
provide a potential explanation for the dark universe. In this framework we
consider the most general form of linearized field equations compatible with
physically and mathematically well-motivated assumptions. Using gauge-invariant
linear perturbation theory, we prove a no-go theorem ruling out all bimetric
gravity theories that, in the Newtonian limit, lead to precisely opposite
forces on positive and negative test masses.
