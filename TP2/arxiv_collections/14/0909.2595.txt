The exchange of electroweak gauginos in the $t-$ or $u-$channel allows squark
pair production at hadron colliders without color exchange between the squarks.
This can give rise to events where little or no energy is deposited in the
detector between the squark decay products. We discuss the potential for
detection of such rapidity gap events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our
numerical analysis is divided into two parts. First, we evaluate in a
simplified framework the rapidity gap signal at the parton level. The second
part covers an analysis with full event simulation using PYTHIA as well as
Herwig++, but without detector simulation. We analyze the transverse energy
deposited between the jets from squark decay, as well as the probability of
finding a third jet in between the two hardest jets. For the mSUGRA benchmark
point SPS1a we find statistically significant evidence for a color singlet
exchange contribution. The systematical differences between current versions of
PYTHIA and HERWIG++ are larger than the physical effect from color singlet
exchange; however, these systematic differences could be reduced by tuning both
Monte Carlo generators on normal QCD di--jet data.
