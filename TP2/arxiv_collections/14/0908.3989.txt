In order to discover new X-ray transients, the data taken by XMM-Newton as it
slews between targets are being processed and cross-correlated with other X-ray
observations.
  A bright source, XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933, was detected on 18 July 2006 at a
position where no previous X-ray source had been seen. The XMM-Newton slew
data, plus follow-up dedicated XMM-Newton and Swift observations, plus optical
data acquired with the Magellan Clay telescope, and archival All-Sky Automated
Survey (ASAS) data were used to classify the new object, and to investigate its
properties.
  No XMM-Newton slew X-ray counts are detected above 1 keV and the source is
seen to be over five hundred times brighter than the ROSAT All-Sky Survey upper
limit at that position. The line-rich optical spectrum acquired with the
Magellan telescope allows the object to be classified as an Ao auroral phase
nova, and the soft X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was in a super-soft
source state in the X-ray decline seen in the follow-up X-ray observations. The
archival ASAS data suggests that the nova at onset (Oct 2005) was a 'very fast'
nova, and an estimate of its distance is consistent with the nova being
situated within the LMC.
  With the discovery presented here of a new classical nova in the LMC, it is
clear that XMM-Newton slew data are continuing to offer a powerful opportunity
to find new X-ray transient objects.
