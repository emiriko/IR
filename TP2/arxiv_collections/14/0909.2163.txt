The correlated Kondo insulator state of the plutonium monochalcogenides is
investigated using the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and the local density
approximation +U (LDA+U). The DMFT-dynamical fluctuations lead to a correlated
insulator state at elevated temperature, in sharp contrast to the static LDA+U
approach that fails to reproduce both the insulating behavior and anomalous
lattice constant. The DMFT conversely predicts the experimentally observed
anomalous increase of the gap with pressure and explains the lattice constant
very well.
