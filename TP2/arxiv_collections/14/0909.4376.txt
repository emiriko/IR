The Fourier analysis of the CME occurrence data observed by the SOHO
satellite shows significant power around 1.9 yr., 1.2 yr., 265 day, 39 day and
26 day periodicities which are almost similar to the periodicities detected in
the Fourier analysis of underlying activities of the photosphere. The wavelet
analysis of CME occurrences also shows significant power around such periods
which occur near the peak of solar activity. For the sake of comparison, the
occurrences of H-alpha flares are subjected to Fourier and wavelet analyses.
The well-known periods (1.3 yr., 152 day, 27 day) in the flare occurrences are
detected. The wavelet analyses of both the occurrences yield the following
results : (i) in the both CME and Flare activities, long period (~ 1.3 yr)
activity occurs around solar maximum only and, (ii) flare activity of long
period, especially for the period 1.3 year, lags behind the long period CME
activity nearly by six months. Possible physical explanation for the 1.2 yr CME
quasi-periodicity is briefly discussed.
