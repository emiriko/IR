The electroweak structures of the FCNC-induced rare and radiative K decays
are presented. While the former decays are sensitive to short-distance physics
and offer exceptional probes for new physics, the latter are dominated by
long-distance physics. Even so, they should not be set aside since they
constitute essential ingredients to control the hadronic uncertainties
occurring for the rare decays. This is illustrated by systematically reviewing
the phenomenological strategies currently in use to cleanly predict the rare K
decay rates in the Standard Model.
