In this study, we investigate the appeared complexity of two-phase flow
(air/water) in a heterogeneous soil where the supposed porous media is
non-deformable media which is under the timedependent gas pressure. After
obtaining of governing equations and considering the capillary
pressuresaturation and permeability functions, the evolution of the model
unknown parameters were obtained. In this way, using COMSOL (FEMLAB) and fluid
flow/script Module, the role of heterogeneity in intrinsic permeability was
analysed. Also, the evolution of relative permeability of wetting and
non-wetting fluid, capillary pressure and other parameters were elicited. In
the last part, a complex network approach to analysis of emerged patterns will
be employed.
