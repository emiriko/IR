We present the stellar and substellar mass function of the open cluster
IC2391, plus its radial dependence, and use this to put constraints on the
formation mechanism of brown dwarfs. Our multiband optical and infrared
photometric survey with spectroscopic follow-up covers 11 square degrees,
making it the largest survey of this cluster to date. We observe a radial
variation in the mass function over the range 0.072 to 0.3Msol, but no
significant variation in the mass function below the substellar boundary at the
three cluster radius intervals analyzed. This lack of radial variation for low
masses is what we would expect with the ejection scenario for brown dwarf
formation, although considering that IC2391 has an age about three times older
than its crossing time, we expect that brown dwarfs with a velocity greater
than the escape velocity have already escaped the cluster. Alternatively, the
variation in the mass function of the stellar objects could be an indication
that they have undergone mass segregation via dynamical evolution. We also
observe a significant variation across the cluster in the colour of the
(background) field star locus in colour-magnitude diagrams and conclude that
this is due to variable background extinction in the Galactic plane. From our
preliminary spectroscopic follow-up to confirm brown dwarf status and cluster
membership, we find that all candidates are M dwarfs (in either the field or
the cluster), demonstrating the efficiency of our photometric selection method
in avoiding contaminants (e.g. red giants). About half of our photometric
candidates for which we have spectra are spectroscopically-confirmed as cluster
members; two are new spectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarf members of IC2391.
