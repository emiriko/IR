In this paper we will define a qc fundamental group for an arithmetic scheme
by quasi-galois closed covers. Then we will give a computation for such a group
and will prove that the etale fundamental group of an arithmetic scheme is a
normal subgroup in our qc fundamental group, which make up the main theorem of
the paper. Hence, our group gives us a prior estimate of the etale fundamental
group. The quotient group reflects the topological properties of the scheme.
