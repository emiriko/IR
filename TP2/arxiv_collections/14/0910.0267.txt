In this paper, we give some necessary and sufficient conditions for a normal
subgroup of an amalgamated product of groups to be finitely generated. We apply
these conditions together with Stallings' fibering theorem to prove that an
irreducible multilink in a homology 3-sphere fibers if and only if each of its
multilink splice components fibers.
