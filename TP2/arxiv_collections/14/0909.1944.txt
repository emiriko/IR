We use neutron scattering to investigate the doping evolution of the magnetic
correlations in the single-layer manganite $\rm Pr_{\it 1-x}Ca_{\it 1+x}MnO_4$,
away from the $x=0.5$ composition where the CE-type commensurate
antiferromagnetic (AF) structure is stable. We find that short-range
incommensurate spin correlations develop as the system is electron doped
($x<0.5$), which coexist with the CE-type AF order. This suggests that electron
doping in this system induces an inhomogeneous electronic self-organization,
where commensurate AF patches with $x=0.5$ are separated by electron-rich
domain walls with short range magnetic correlations. This behavior is
strikingly different than for the perovksite $\rm Pr_{\it 1-x}Ca_{\it x}MnO_3$,
where the long-range CE-type commensurate AF structure is stable over a wide
range of electron or hole doping around $x=0.5$.
