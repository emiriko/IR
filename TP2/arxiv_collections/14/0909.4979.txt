We calculate the effect of epitaxial strain on the structure and properties
of multiferroic bismuth ferrite, BiFeO3, using first-principles density
functional theory. We find that, while small strains cause only quantitative
changes in behavior from the bulk material, compressive strains of greater than
4% induce an isosymmetric phase transition accompanied by a dramatic change in
structure. In striking contrast to the bulk rhombohedral perovskite, the highly
strained structure has a c/a ratio of ~1.3 and five-coordinated Fe atoms. We
predict a rotation of polarization from [111] (bulk) to nearly [001],
accompanied by an increase in magnitude of ~50%, and a suppression of the
magnetic ordering temperature. Intriguingly, our calculations indicate critical
strain values at which the two phases might be expected to coexist.
