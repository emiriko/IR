Reconstruction of equations of motion from incomplete or noisy data and
dimension reduction are two fundamental problems in the study of dynamical
systems with many degrees of freedom. For the latter extensive efforts have
been made but with limited success to generalize the Zwanzig-Mori projection
formalism, originally developed for Hamiltonian systems close to thermodynamic
equilibrium, to general non-Hamiltonian systems lacking detailed-balance. One
difficulty introduced by such systems is the lack of an invariant measure,
needed to define a statistical distribution. Based on a recent discovery that a
non-Hamiltonian system defined by a set of stochastic differential equations
can be mapped to a Hamiltonian system, we develop such general projection
formalism. In the resulting generalized Langevin equations, a set of
generalized fluctuation-dissipation relations connect the memory kernel and the
random noise terms, analogous to Hamiltonian systems obeying detailed balance.
Lacking of these relations restricts previous application of the generalized
Langevin formalism. Result of this work may serve as the theoretical basis for
further technical developments on model reconstruction with reduced degrees of
freedom. We first use an analytically solvable example to illustrate the
formalism and the fluctuation-dissipation relation. Our numerical test on a
chemical network with end-product inhibition further demonstrates the validity
of the formalism. We suggest that the formalism can find wide applications in
scientific modeling. Specifically, we discuss potential applications to
biological networks. In particular, the method provides a suitable framework
for gaining insights into network properties such as robustness and parameter
transferability.
