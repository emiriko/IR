We achieved for the first time a direct measurement of the thermal
fluctuation of a pendulum in an off-resonant region using a laser
interferometric gravitational wave detector. These measurements have been well
identified for over one decade by an agreement with a theoretical prediction,
which was derived by a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Thermal fluctuation is
dominated by the contribution of resistances in coil-magnet actuator circuits.
When we tuned these resistances, the noise spectrum also changed according to a
theoretical prediction. The measured thermal noise level corresponds to a high
quality factor on the order of 10^5 of the pendulum.
