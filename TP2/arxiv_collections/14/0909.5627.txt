Searches at the LHC of lepton flavour violation (LFV) in slepton decays can
indirectly test both type-I and II seesaw mechanisms. Assuming universal
flavour-blind boundary conditions, LFV in the neutrino sector is related to LFV
in the slepton sector by means of the renormalization group equations. Ratios
of LFV slepton decay rates result to be a very effective way to extract the
imprint left by the neutrino sector. Some neutrino scenarios within the type-I
seesaw mechanism are studied. Moreover, for both type-I and II seesaw
mechanisms, a scan over the minimal supergravity parameter space is performed
to estimate how large LFV slepton decay rates can be, while respecting current
low-energy constraints.
