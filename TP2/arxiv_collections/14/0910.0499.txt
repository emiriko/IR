Random key graphs are random graphs induced by the random key predistribution
scheme of Eschenauer and Gligor under the assumption of full visibility. For
this class of random graphs we show the existence of a zero-one law for the
appearance of triangles, and identify the corresponding critical scaling. This
is done by applying the method of first and second moments to the number of
triangles in the graph.
