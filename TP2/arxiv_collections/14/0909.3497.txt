Using a semiclassical Boltzmann equation, we calculate corrections to the
Sharvin conductance of a wide 2DEG ballistic contact that result from an
electron--electron scattering in the leads. These corrections are dominated by
collisions of electrons with nearly opposite momenta that come from different
reservoirs. They are positive, increase with temperature, and are strongly
suppressed by a magnetic field. We argue that this suppression may be
responsible for an anomalous positive magnetoresistance observed in a recent
experiment.
