Two recent investigations are reviewed: quantum effects for DNA aggregates
and scars formation on virus capsids. The possibility that scars could explain
certain data recently obtained by Sundquist's group in electron cryotomography
of immature HIV-1 virions is also briefly addressed. Furthermore, a bottom-up
reflection is presented on the need to invent new physics to pave the way to a
rigorous physical theory of biological phenomena. Our experience in the two
researches presented here and our personal interpretation of Schroedinger's
vision are behind the latter request.
