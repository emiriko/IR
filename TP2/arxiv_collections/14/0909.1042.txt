We show simultaneous p and n type carrier injection in bilayer graphene
channel by varying the longitudinal bias across the channel and the top gate
voltage. The top gate is applied electrochemically using solid polymer
electrolyte and the gate capacitance is measured to be 1.5 $\mu F/cm^2$, a
value about 125 times higher than the conventional SiO$_2$ back gate
capacitance. Unlike the single layer graphene, the drain-source current does
not saturate on varying the drain-source bias voltage. The energy gap opened
between the valence and conduction bands using top and back gate geometry is
estimated.
