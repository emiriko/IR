We exhibit a pseudogroup of smooth local transformations of the real line
which is compactly generated, but not realizable as the holonomy pseudogroup of
a foliation of codimension 1 on a compact manifold. The proof relies on a
description of all foliations with the same dynamic as the Reeb component.
