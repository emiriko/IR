In a recent work, Wyss, {\it et.al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett., {\bf 98}, 238303
(2007)] have noted a property of `soft solids' under oscillatory shear, the
so-called strain-rate frequency superposition (SRFS). We extend this study to
the case of soft solids under large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS). We show
results from LAOS studies in a monodisperse hydrogel suspension, an aqueous
gel, and a biopolymer suspension, and show that constant strain-rate frequency
sweep measurements with soft solids can be superimposed onto master curves for
higher harmonic moduli, with the {\it same} shift factors as for the linear
viscoelastic moduli. We show that the behavior of higher harmonic moduli at low
frequencies in constant strain-rate frequency sweep measurements is similar to
that at large strain amplitudes in strain-amplitude sweep tests. We show
surface plots of the harmonic moduli and the energy dissipation rate per unit
volume in LAOS for soft solids, and show experimentally that the energy
dissipated per unit volume depends on the first harmonic loss modulus alone, in
both the linear and the nonlinear viscoelastic regime.
