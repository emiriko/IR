When a system is perturbed by the variation of external parameters, a lag
generally develops between the actual state of the system and the equilibrium
state corresponding to the current parameter values. We establish a
microscopic, quantitative relation between this lag and the dissipated work
that accompanies the process. We illustrate this relation using a model system.
