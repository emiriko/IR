The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) causes attenuation of the VHE
spectra of extragalactic sources, via pair-production. The amount of
attenuation depends on the distance of the source, i.e. on the integration over
the line of sight path taken by the VHE photons. The line of sight path
calculation, depends on the values of the cosmological parameters and the
evolution of these parameters. With the recent indications of a lower EBL level
from observations and the greater sensitivity of the proposed future Cherenkov
experiments it will be possible to detect higher redshift sources. We study
whether the EBL attenuation of extragalactic sources is sensitive enough to put
constrains on the cosmological parameters.
