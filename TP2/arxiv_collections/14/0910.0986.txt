Tensor rank refers to the number of product states needed to express a given
multipartite quantum state. Its non-additivity as an entanglement measure has
recently been observed. In this note, we estimate the tensor rank of multiple
copies of the tripartite state
$\ket{W}=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(\ket{100}+\ket{010}+\ket{001})$. Both an upper
bound and a lower bound of this rank are derived. In particular, it is proven
that the tensor rank of $\ket{W}^{\otimes 2}$ is seven, thus resolving a
previously open problem. Some implications of this result are discussed in
terms of transformation rates between $\ket{W}^{\otimes n}$ and multiple copies
of the state $\ket{GHZ}=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{000}+\ket{111})$.
