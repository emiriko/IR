We present three measurements of the top-quark mass in the lepton plus jets
channel with approximately 1.9 fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the
CDF II detector using quantities with minimal dependence on the jet energy
scale. One measurement exploits the transverse decay length of b-tagged jets to
determine a top-quark mass of 166.9+9.5-8.5 (stat) +/- 2.9 (syst) GeV/c2, and
another the transverse momentum of electrons and muons from W-boson decays to
determine a top-quark mass of 173.5+8.8-8.9 (stat) +/- 3.8 (syst) GeV/c2. These
quantities are combined in a third, simultaneous mass measurement to determine
a top-quark mass of 170.7 +/- 6.3 (stat) +/- 2.6 (syst) GeV/c2.
