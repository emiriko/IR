A manifestation of the many-body Aharonov-Bohm effect in the
magnetic-flux-tuned Mott insulators with three-spin and four-spin ring
exchanges, presents as an effective tool to manipulate the ground-state spin
chirality, such as, tune the magnitude continuously, switch an abrupt jump, or
even reverse its sign. Such a mechanism is demonstrated explicitly in both
quasi-one-dimensional ladders and two-dimensional lattices with triangles as
elementary plaquettes.
