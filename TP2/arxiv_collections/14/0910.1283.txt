The low temperature universal properties in disordered and amorphous solids
are considered. We introduce a model that includes two types of two level
systems (TLSs), which, based on their local symmetry, interact weakly or
strongly with the phonon field. This accounts well for the experimental
results, and addresses some long-standing questions: the nature of the TLSs;
the smallness and universality of the phonon attenuation, and the energy scale
of $3$K below which universality is observed. Our model describes disordered
lattices; we also discuss its application to amorphous solids.
