We present a summary of our recent analysis update of flavour changing
neutral current (FCNC) processes in the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity
(LHT). The essential novelties of our update are: the removal of the
logarithmic UV cutoff dependence by the inclusion of the new contribution to
the Z^0-penguin diagrams identified by Goto et al. and by del Aguila et al.,
the study of the decay K_L -> mu^+ mu^-, a discussion of fine-tuning in
epsilon_K and Br(mu -> e gamma).
