We describe the scenario of WIMPless dark matter. In this scenario of
gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, a dark matter candidate in the hidden
sector is found to naturally have approximately the right relic density to
explain astronomical dark matter observations, but with a wide range of
possible masses.
