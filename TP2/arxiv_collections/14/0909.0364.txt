We extend the Becke-Johnson approximation [J. Chem. Phys. 124, 221101 (2006)]
of the exchange potential to two dimensions. We prove and demonstrate that a
direct extension of the underlying formalism may lead to divergent behavior of
the potential. We derive a cure to the approach by enforcing the gauge
invariance and correct asymptotic behavior of the exchange potential. The
procedure leads to an approximation which is shown, in various
quasi-two-dimensional test systems, to be very accurate in comparison with the
exact exchange potential, and thus a considerable improvement over the commonly
applied local-density approximation.
