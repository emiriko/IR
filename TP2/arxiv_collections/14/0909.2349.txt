We present results on the electroexcitation of the low mass resonances
Delta(1232)P33, N(1440)P11, N(1520)D13, and N(1535)S11 in a wide range of Q2.
The results were obtained in the comprehensive analysis of JLab-CLAS data on
differential cross sections, longitudinally polarized beam asymmetries, and
longitudinal target and beam-target asymmetries for pion electroproduction off
the proton. The data were analysed using two conceptually different approaches,
fixed-t dispersion relations and a unitary isobar model, allowing us to draw
conclusions on the model sensitivity of the obtained electrocoupling
amplitudes. The amplitudes for the Delta(1232)P33} show the importance of a
meson-cloud contribution to quantitatively explain the magnetic dipole
strength, as well as the electric and scalar quadrupole transitions. They do
not show any tendency of approaching the pQCD regime for Q2<6 GeV2. For the
Roper resonance, N(1440)P11, the data provide strong evidence for this state as
a predominantly radial excitation of a 3-quark ground state. Measured in pion
electroproduction, the transverse helicity amplitude for the N(1535)S11 allowed
us to obtain the branching ratios of this state to the piN and etaN channels
via comparison to the results extracted from eta electroproduction. The
extensive CLAS data also enabled the extraction of the gamma*p -> N(1520)D13
and N(1535)S11 longitudinal helicity amplitudes with good precision.
