We use magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and scanning SQUID susceptometry to
measure the local superfluid density $\rho_{s}$ in
Ba(Fe$_{0.95}$Co$_{0.05}$)$_2$As$_2$ single crystals from 0.4 K to the critical
temperature $T_c=18.5$ K. We observe that the penetration depth $\lambda$
varies about ten times more slowly with temperature than previously published,
with a dependence that can be well described by a clean two-band fully gapped
model. We demonstrate that MFM can measure the important and hard-to-determine
absolute value of $\lambda$, as well as obtain its temperature dependence and
spatial homogeneity. We find $\rho_{s}$ to be uniform despite the highly
disordered vortex pinning.
