We perform formal verification of quantum circuits by integrating several
techniques specialized to particular classes of circuits. Our verification
methodology is based on the new notion of a reversible miter that allows one to
leverage existing techniques for circuit simplification of quantum circuits.
For reversible circuits which arise as runtime bottlenecks of key quantum
algorithms, we develop several verification techniques and empirically compare
them.
  We also combine existing quantum verification tools with the use of
SAT-solvers. Experiments with circuits for Shor's number-factoring algorithm,
containing thousands of gates, show improvements in efficiency by 3-4 orders of
magnitude.
