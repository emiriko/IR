We present an update of the Unitarity Triangle (UT) analysis, within the
Standard Model (SM) and beyond. Within the SM the main novelties are the
inclusion in epsilon_K of the contributions of xi and phi_epsilon \neq \pi/4
pointed out by A.J. Buras and D. Guadagnoli, and an accurate prediction of BR(B
-> tau nu), by using the indirect determination of |V_ub| from the UT fit,
which can be compared to the present experimental result. In the generalization
of the UT analysis to investigate New Physics (NP) effects, the estimate of xi
is more delicate and only the effect of phi_epsilon \neq \pi/4 has been
included. We confirm an hint of NP in the B_s-\bar B_s mixing at the 2.9 sigma
level, which makes a comparison with new experimental data certainly desired.
