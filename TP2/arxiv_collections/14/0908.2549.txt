Photoassociation (PA) spectrum in the presence of a magnetic Feshbach
resonance is analyzed. Nonperturbative solution of the problem yields
analytical expressions for PA linewidth and shift which are applicable for
arbitrary PA laser intensity and magnetic field tuning of Feshbach Resonance.
We show that by tuning magnetic field close to Fano minimum, it is possible to
suppress power broadening at increased laser intensities. This occurs due to
quantum interference of PA transitions from unperturbed and perturbed
continuum. Line narrowing at high laser intensities is accompanied by large
spectral shifts. We briefly discuss important consequences of line narrowing in
cold collisions.
