Two optical fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometers were constructed in an
environment with a temperature stabilization of better than 1 mK per day. One
interferometer with a length of 2 m optical fiber in each arm with the main
direction of the arms parallel to each other. A path (length 175 mm) filled
with atmospheric air is inserted in one arm. Another interferometer with a
length of 2 m optical fiber in each parallel arm acts as a control. In each arm
1 m of fiber was wound around a ring made of piezo material enabling the
control of the length of the arms by means of a voltage. The influence of
rotation of the interferometers at the Earth surface on the observed phase
differences was determined. For one interferometer (with the air path) it was
found that the phase difference depends on the azimuth of the interferometer.
For the other one no relevant dependence on the azimuth has been measured.
