We study the L\'evy spin-glass model with the replica and the cavity method.
In this model each spin interacts through a finite number of strong bonds and
an infinite number of weak bonds. This hybrid behaviour of L\'evy spin glasses
becomes transparent in our solution: the local field contains a part
propagating along a backbone of strong bonds and a Gaussian noise term due to
weak bonds. Our method allows to determine the complete replica symmetric phase
diagram, the replica symmetry breaking line and the entropy. The results are
compared with simulations and previous calculations using a Gaussian ansatz for
the distribution of fields.
