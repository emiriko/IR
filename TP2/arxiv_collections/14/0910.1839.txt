In this paper we discuss two mechanisms by which high energy electrons
resulting from dark matter annihilations in or near the Sun can arrive at the
Earth. Specifically, electrons can escape the sun if DM annihilates into
long-lived states, or if dark matter scatters inelastically, which would leave
a halo of dark matter outside of the sun. Such a localized source of electrons
may affect the spectra observed by experiments with narrower fields of view
oriented towards the sun, such as ATIC, differently from those with larger
fields of view such as Fermi. We suggest a simple test of these possibilities
with existing Fermi data that is more sensitive than limits from final state
radiation. If observed, such a signal will constitute an unequivocal signature
of dark matter.
