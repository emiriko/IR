We review galaxy formation and dynamics under the MOND hypothesis of modified
gravity, and compare to similar galaxies in Newtonian dynamics with dark
matter. The aim is to find peculiar predictions both to discriminate between
various hypotheses, and to make the theory progress through different
constraints, touching the interpolation function, or the fundamental
acceleration scale. Galaxy instabilities, forming bars and bulges at longer
term, evolve differently in the various theories, and help to bring
constraints, together with the observations of bar frequency. Dynamical
friction and the predicted merger rate could be a sensitive test of theories.
The different scenarios of galaxy formation are compared within the various
theories and observations.
