This paper proposes an adaptation of two network size estimation methods:
random tour and gossip-based aggregation to suit master/slave mobile ad hoc
networks. We show that it is feasible to accurately estimate the size of ad hoc
networks when topology changes due to mobility using both methods. The
algorithms were modified to account for the specific constraints of
master/slave ad hoc networks and the results show that the proposed
modifications perform better on these networks than the original protocols.
Each of the two algorithms presents strengths and weaknesses and these are
outlined in this paper.
