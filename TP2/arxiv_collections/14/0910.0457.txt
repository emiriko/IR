Although various limits on the predicability of physical phenomena as well as
on physical knowables are commonly established and accepted, we challenge their
ultimate validity. More precisely, we claim that fundamental limits arise only
from our limited imagination and fantasy. To illustrate this thesis we give
evidence that the well-known Turing incomputability barrier can be trespassed
via quantum indeterminacy. From this algorithmic viewpoint, the "fine tuning"
of physical phenomena amounts to a "(re)programming" of the universe.
