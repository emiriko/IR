We analyse the design and optimisation of quantum logic circuits suitable for
the experimental demonstration of a three-qubit quantum computation prototype
based on optically-controlled, solid-state quantum logic gates. In these gates,
the interaction between two qubits carried by the electron-spin of donors is
mediated by the optical excitation of a control particle placed in their
proximity. First, we use a geometrical approach for analysing the entangling
characteristics of these quantum gates. Then, using a genetic programming
algorithm, we develop circuits for the refined Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
investigating different strategies for obtaining short total computational
times. We test two separate approaches based on using different sets of
entangling gates with the shortest possible gate computation time which,
however, does not introduce leakage of quantum information to the control
particles. The first set exploits fast approximations of controlled-phase gates
as entangling gates, while the other one arbitrary entangling gates with a
shorter gate computation time compared to the first set. We have identified
circuits with consistently shorter total computation times when using
controlled-phase gates.
