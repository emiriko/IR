Given independent random points $\mathcal{X}_n=\{X_1,...,X_n\}$ in
$\mathbb{R}^2$, drawn according to some probability density function $f$ on
$\mathbb{R}^2$, and a cutoff $r_n>0$ we construct a random geometric digraph
$G(\mathcal{X}_n,\mathcal{Y}_n,r_n)$ with vertex set $\mathcal{X}_n$. Each
vertex $X_i$ is assigned uniformly at random a sector $S_i$, of central angle
$\alpha$ with inclination $Y_i$, in a circle of radius $r_n$ (with vertex $X_i$
as the origin). An arc is present from $X_i$ to $X_j$, if $X_j$ falls in $S_i$.
We also introduce another random geometric digraph
$G(\mathcal{X}_n,\mathcal{R}_n)$ with vertex set
$\mathcal{X}_n=\{X_1,...,X_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge1$ and an arc present
from $X_i$ to $X_j$ if $||X_i-X_j||<R_{n,i}$. Here $\{R_{n,i}\}_{i\ge1}$ are
i.i.d. random variables and we may take an arbitrary norm $||\cdot||$. In this
paper we investigate two kinds of small subgraphs--induced and isolated--in the
above two directed networks, which contribute to understanding the local
topology of many spatial networks, such as wireless communication networks. We
give some strong laws of large numbers of subgraph counts thus extending those
results of Penrose [Random Geometric Graphs, Oxford University Press, 2003].
