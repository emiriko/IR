We explore the possibility of a new dark matter candidate in the
supersymmetric type III seesaw mechanism where a neutral scalar component of
the Y=0 triplet can be the lightest supersymmetric particle. Its thermal
abundance can be in the right range if non-standard cosmology such as kination
domination is assumed. The enhanced cross-section of the dark matter
annihilation to W+W- can leave detectable astrophysical and cosmological
signals whose current observational data puts a lower bound on the dark matter
mass. The model predicts the existence of a charged scalar almost degenerate
with the dark matter scalar and its lifetime lies between 5.5 cm and 6.3 m. It
provides a novel opportunity of the dark mater mass measurement by identifying
slowly-moving and highly-ionizing tracks in the LHC experiments. If the
ordinary lightest supersymmetric particle is the usual Bino, its decay leads to
clean signatures of same-sign di-lepton and di-charged-scalar associated with
observable displaced vertices which are essentially background-free and can be
fully reconstructed.
