The short distance potentials between heavy SU(3) and SU(4) sources are
calculated by increasing the role of vortex fluxes piercing Wilson loops with
contributions close to the trivial center element and by fluctuating the vortex
core size in the model of thick center vortices. By this method, a Coulombic
potential consistent with Casimir scaling is obtained. In addition, all other
features of the potential including a linear intermediate potential in
agreement with Casimir scaling and a large distance potential proportional to
the $N$-ality of the representation are restored. Therefore, the model of thick
center vortices may be used as a phenomenological model, which is able to
describe the potential for all regimes.
