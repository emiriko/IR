The possibility that the apparent room temperature ferromagnetism, often
measured in Co-doped ZnO, is due to uncompensated spins at the surface of
wurtzite CoO nanoclusters is investigated by means of a combination of density
functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the critical
temperature extracted from the specific heat systematically drops as the
cluster size is reduced, regardless of the particular cluster shape.
Furthermore the presence of defects, in the form of missing magnetic sites,
further reduces $T_\mathrm{C}$. This suggests that even a spinodal decomposed
phase is unlikely to sustain room temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO:Co.
