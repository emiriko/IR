Globular star clusters are among the first stellar populations to have formed
in the Milky Way, and thus only a small sliver of their initial spectrum of
stellar types are still burning hydrogen on the main-sequence today. Almost all
of the stars born with more mass than 0.8 M_sun have evolved to form the white
dwarf cooling sequence of these systems, and the distribution and properties of
these remnants uniquely holds clues related to the nature of the now evolved
progenitor stars. With ultra-deep HST imaging observations, rich white dwarf
populations of four nearby Milky Way globular clusters have recently been
uncovered, and are found to extend an impressive 5 - 8 magnitudes in the
faint-blue region of the H-R diagram. In this paper, we characterize the
properties of these population II remnants by presenting the first direct mass
measurements of individual white dwarfs near the tip of the cooling sequence in
the nearest of the Milky Way globulars, M4. Based on Gemini/GMOS and Keck/LRIS
multiobject spectroscopic observations, our results indicate that 0.8 M_sun
population II main-sequence stars evolving today form 0.53 +/- 0.01 M_sun white
dwarfs. We discuss the implications of this result as it relates to our
understanding of stellar structure and evolution of population II stars and for
the age of the Galactic halo, as measured with white dwarf cooling theory.
