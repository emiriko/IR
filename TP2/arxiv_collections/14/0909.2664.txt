We provide predictions for the nuclear modification factor R_{pA} for pions
and direct photon production in p+A collisions at LHC energy at midrapidity
within different saturation models fitted to HERA data. In our approach we have
no free parameters to adjust and all model parameters are fitted to other
reactions. Our approach gives a rather good description of PHENIX data for
R_{pA} for pions. We show that, in various saturation models, the pion Cronin
enhancement is replaced by a moderate suppression at LHC energy at midrapidity
due to gluon shadowing effects. However, Cronin enhancement of direct photons
can survive at LHC energy in models with a larger saturation scale. We show
that both shadowing and saturation effects are important at LHC in p+A
collisions and give rise to a rather sizable effect in the nuclear modification
factor R_{pA}. Therefore, a precise measurement of p+A collisions at LHC is
crucial in order to understand the underlying dynamics of heavy ion collisions.
