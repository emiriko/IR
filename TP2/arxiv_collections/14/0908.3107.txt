We have performed a deep multi-band photometric analysis of the star cluster
population of Haro 11. This starburst galaxy (log L_FUV = 10.3 L_sun) is
considered a nearby analogue of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at high redshift.
The study of the numerous star clusters in the systems is an effective way to
investigate the formation and evolution of the starburst phase. In fact, the
SED fitting models have revealed a surprisingly young star cluster population,
with ages between 0.5 and 40 Myr, and estimated masses between 10^3 and 10^7
solar masses. An independent age estimation has been done with the EW(Halpha)
analysis of each cluster. This last analysis has confirmed the young ages of
the clusters. We noticed that the clusters with ages between 1 and 10 Myr show
a flux excess in H (NIC3/F160W) and/or I (WFPC2/F814W) bands with respect to
the evolutionary models. Once more Haro 11 represents a challenge to our
understanding.
