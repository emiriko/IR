The growth dynamics of submonolayer coverages of Cobalt during buffer layer
assisted growth on Ag(111) and Pt(111) substrates is investigated by variable
temperature scanning tunneling microscopy in the temperature range between 80
and 150 Kelvin. It is found that attractive cluster-substrate interactions can
govern the cluster formation on the Xe buffer layer, if the Xe layer is
sufficiently thin. The interpretation of the microscopy results are supported
by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism which monitors the effect of
cluster-substrate interactions on the formation of magnetic moments and
magnetic anisotropy of Co nanocluster during the different stages of growth.
{\it Ab-initio} calculations show that the cluster magnetism is controlled by
the interface anisotropy, leading to perpendicular magnetization for Co on
Pt(111). Limits of and new potential for nanocluster fabrication by buffer
layer assisted growth are discussed.
