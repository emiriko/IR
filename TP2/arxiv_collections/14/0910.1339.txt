We present an experimental procedure to perform broadband microrheological
measurements with optical tweezers. A generalised Langevin equation is adopted
to relate the time-dependent trajectory of a particle in an imposed flow to the
frequency-dependent moduli of the complex fluid. This procedure allows us to
measure the material linear viscoelastic properties across the widest frequency
range achievable with optical tweezers.
