dc magnetization and 31^P spin lattice relaxation rate in the polycrystalline
sample of LaCoPO suggest a spin fluctuation dominated ferromagnetically ordered
state. Moreover, NMR data clearly indicate a crossover from 2D to 3D spin
fluctuations across T_C. In contrast to isotropic hyperfine field, H_hf at the
31^P site in LaFePO, H_hf is anisotropic in LaCoPO. The data of spin lattice
relaxation rate also exhibit anisotropic spin fluctuation. The anisotropy
vanishes near T_C.
