We study the possibility of using W pair production and leptonic decay of one
of the W's at the ILC with polarized beams as a probe of the Littlest Higgs
Model. We consider cross-sections, polarization fractions of the W's, leptonic
decay energy and angular distributions, and left-right polarization asymmetry
as probes of the model. With parameter values allowed by present experimental
constraints detectable effects on these observables at typical ILC energies of
500 GeV and 800 GeV will be present. Beam polarization is further found to
enhance the sensitivity.
