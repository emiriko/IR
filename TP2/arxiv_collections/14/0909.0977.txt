In this paper, dedicated to the career of Tom Erber, we consider the Casimir
interaction between weakly coupled bodies at nonzero temperature. For the case
of semitransparent bodies, that is, ones described by delta-function
potentials, we first examine the interaction between an infinite plane and an
arbitrary curved surface. In weak coupling, such an interaction energy
coincides with the exact form of the proximity force approximation obtained by
summing the interaction between opposite surface elements at arbitrary
temperature. This result generalizes a theorem proved recently by Decca et al.
We also obtain exact closed-form results for the Casimir energy at arbitrary
temperature for weakly coupled semitransparent spheres.
