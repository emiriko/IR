It is well known that the Schr\"odinger equation is only suitable for the
particle in common potential $V(\vec{r},t)$. In this paper, a general Quantum
Mechanics is proposed, where the Lagrangian is the general form. The new
quantum wave equation can describe the particle which is in general potential
$V(\vec{r}, \dot{\vec{r}}, t)$. We think these new quantum wave equations can
be applied in many fields.
