We present Spitzer IRAC photometry of white dwarf remnants of 14 stars with M
= 3-5 Msol. We do not detect mid-infrared excess around any of our targets. By
demanding a 3 sigma photometric excess at 4.5 micron for unresolved companions,
we rule out planetary mass companions down to 5, 7, or 10 M_J for 13 of our
targets based on the Burrows et al. (2003) substellar cooling models. Combined
with previous IRAC observations of white dwarf remnants of intermediate-mass
stars, we rule out \geq 10 M_J companions around 40 white dwarfs and \geq 5 M_J
companions around 10 white dwarfs.
