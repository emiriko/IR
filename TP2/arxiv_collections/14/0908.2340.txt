Fully differential cross sections are calculated for the ionization of H$_2$
by fast charged projectiles using a semiclassical model developed previously
for the ionization of atoms. The method is tested in case of 4 keV electron and
6 MeV proton projectiles. The obtained results show good agreement with the
available experimental data. Interference effects due to the two-center
character of the target are also observed and analyzed.
