We study the spin-dependent quark distributions at large transverse momentum.
We derive their transverse momentum behaviors in the collinear factorization
approach in this region. We further calculate the angular distribution of the
Drell-Yan lepton pair production with polarized beams and present the results
in terms of the collinear twist-three quark-gluon correlation functions. In the
intermediate transverse momentum region, we find that the two pproaches: the
collinear factorization and the transverse momentum dependent factorization
approaches are consistent in the description of the lepton pair angular
distributions.
