The first step in a science project is the acquisition and understanding of
the relevant data. This paper outlines the results of a project to design and
test network tools specifically oriented at retrieving astronomical data. The
tools range from simple data transfer methods to more complex browser-emulating
scripts. When integrated with a defined sample or catalog, these scripts
provide seamless techniques to retrieve and store data of varying types.
Examples are given on how these tools can be used to leapfrog from website to
website to acquire multi-wavelength datasets. This project demonstrates the
capability to use multiple data websites, in conjunction, to perform the type
of calculations once reserved for on-site datasets.
