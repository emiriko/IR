We consider DC supercurrents in SNS junctions. Spin-orbit coupling in
combination with Zeeman fields can induce an effective vector potential in the
normal conductor. As a consequence, an out-of-plane spin-density varying along
the transverse direction causes a longitudinal phase difference between the
superconducting terminals. The resulting equilibrium phase coherent
supercurrent is analogue to the non-equilibrium inverse spin Hall effect in
normal conductors. We explicitly compute the effect for the Rashba spin orbit
coupling in a disordered two-dimensional electron gas with an inhomogeneous
perpendicular Zeeman field.
