We report the redshift of a distant, highly obscured submm galaxy (SMG),
based entirely on the detection of its CO line emission. We have used the newly
commissioned Eight-MIxer Receiver (EMIR) at the IRAM 30m telescope, with its 8
GHz of instantaneous dual-polarization bandwidth, to search the 3-mm
atmospheric window for CO emission from SMMJ14009+0252, a bright SMG detected
in the SCUBA Lens Survey. A detection of the CO(3--2) line in the 3-mm window
was confirmed via observations of CO(5--4) in the 2-mm window. Both lines
constrain the redshift of SMMJ14009+0252 to z=2.9344, with high precision (dz=2
10^{-4}). Such observations will become routine in determining redshifts in the
era of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
