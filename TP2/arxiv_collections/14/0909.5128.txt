We present predictions for the pion-photon transition form factor, derived
with the help of light-cone sum rules and including the main part of the NNLO
radiative corrections. We show that, when the Bakulev-Mikhailov-Stefanis (BMS)
pion distribution amplitude is used, the obtained predictions agree well with
the CELLO and the CLEO data. We found that no model distribution amplitude can
reproduce the observed $Q^2$ growth of the new BaBar data, though the BMS model
complies with several BaBar data points.
