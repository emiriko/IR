The two-Higgs-doublet model provides a simple, yet interesting,
generalization of the SM Higgs sector. We study the CP-conserving version of
this model with general, flavor-diagonal, Yukawa couplings. Indirect
constraints are obtained from flavor physics on the charged Higgs boson mass
and couplings. The relation of these bounds to those for the more specialized
two-Higgs-doublet model types with a $Z_2$ symmetry is discussed.
