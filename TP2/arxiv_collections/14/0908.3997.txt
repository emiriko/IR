The thermodynamic influence of quantum probing on an object is studied. Here,
quantum probing is understood as a pre-measurement based on a non-demolition
interaction, which records some information of the probed object, but does not
change its energy state when both the probing apparatus and the probed object
are isolated from the environment. It is argued that when the probing apparatus
and the probed object are immersed in a same equilibrium environment, the
probing can affect the effective temperature of the object or induce a quantum
isothermal process for the object to transfer its energy. This thermodynamic
feature can be regarded as a witness of the existence of quantum probing even
if the quantum probing would not disturb the object if the environment were not
present.
