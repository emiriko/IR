In this paper, we propose Multi-Rate Bandwidth Available in Real Time
(MR-BART) to estimate the end-to-end Available Bandwidth (AB) of a network
path. The proposed scheme is an extension of the Bandwidth Available in Real
Time (BART) which employs multi-rate (MR) probe packet sequences with Kalman
filtering. Comparing to BART, we show that the proposed method is more robust
and converges faster than that of BART and achieves a more AB accurate
estimation. Furthermore, we analyze the estimation error in MR-BART and obtain
analytical formula and empirical expression for the AB estimation error based
on the system parameters.
