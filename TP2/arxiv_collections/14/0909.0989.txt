We report on the first search for extra-terrestrial neutrino-induced cascades
in IceCube. The analyzed data were collected in the year 2007 when 22 detector
strings were installed and operated. We will discuss the analysis methods used
to reconstruct cascades and to suppress backgrounds. Simulated neutrino signal
events with a E-2 energy spectrum, which pass the background rejection
criteria, are reconstructed with a resolution dlogE ~ 0.27 in the energy range
from ~20 TeV to a few PeV. We present the range of the diffuse flux of
extra-terrestrial neutrinos in the cascade channel in IceCube within which we
expect to be able to put a limit.
