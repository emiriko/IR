The problem of reconstruction of digital images from their degraded
measurements is regarded as a problem of central importance in various fields
of engineering and imaging sciences. In such cases, the degradation is
typically caused by the resolution limitations of an imaging device in use
and/or by the destructive influence of measurement noise. Specifically, when
the noise obeys a Poisson probability law, standard approaches to the problem
of image reconstruction are based on using fixed-point algorithms which follow
the methodology first proposed by Richardson and Lucy. The practice of using
these methods, however, shows that their convergence properties tend to
deteriorate at relatively high noise levels. Accordingly, in the present paper,
a novel method for de-noising and/or de-blurring of digital images corrupted by
Poisson noise is introduced. The proposed method is derived under the
assumption that the image of interest can be sparsely represented in the domain
of a linear transform. Consequently, a shrinkage-based iterative procedure is
proposed, which guarantees the solution to converge to the global maximizer of
an associated maximum-a-posteriori criterion. It is shown in a series of both
computer-simulated and real-life experiments that the proposed method
outperforms a number of existing alternatives in terms of stability, precision,
and computational efficiency.
