Recent data from cosmic ray experiments may be explained by a new GeV scale
of physics. In addition the fine-tuning of supersymmetric models may be
alleviated by new O(GeV) states into which the Higgs boson could decay. The
presence of these new, light states can affect early universe cosmology. We
explore the consequences of a light (~ GeV) scalar on the electroweak phase
transition. We find that trilinear interactions between the light state and the
Higgs can allow a first order electroweak phase transition and a Higgs mass
consistent with experimental bounds, which may allow electroweak baryogenesis
to explain the cosmological baryon asymmetry. We show, within the context of a
specific supersymmetric model, how the physics responsible for the first order
phase transition may also be responsible for the recent cosmic ray excesses of
PAMELA, FERMI etc. We consider the production of gravity waves from this
transition and the possible detectability at LISA and BBO.
