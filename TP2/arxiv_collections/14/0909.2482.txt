A user friendly scheme based on the quantum kinetic equation is developed for
studying thermal transport phenomena in the presence of interactions and
disorder. We demonstrate that this scheme is suitable for both a systematic
perturbative calculation as well as a general analysis. We believe that we
present an adequate alternative to the Kubo formula, which for the thermal
transport is rather cumbersome.
