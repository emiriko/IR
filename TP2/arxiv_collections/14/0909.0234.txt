We present theoretical description of the precessional switching processes
induced by simultaneous application of spin-polarized current and external
magnetic field to antiferromagnetic component of the "pinned" layer. We found
stability ranges of different static and dynamic regimes. We showed the
possibility of steady current-induced precession of antiferromagnetic vector
with frequency that linearly depends on the bias current. Furthermore, we found
an optimal duration of current pulse required for switching between different
orientations of antiferromagnetic vector and current and field dependence of
switching time. Our results reveal the difference between dynamics of ferro-
and antiferromagnets subjected to spin transfer torques.
