We have performed magnetization and $^{31}$P-NMR measurements on the
itinerant ferromagnet LaCoPO (Curie temperature $T_{\rm Curie}\sim 44$ K) with
a layered structure in order to investigate spin dynamics in the paramagnetic
state. The linear scaling between the Knight shift $K$ at the P site and the
bulk susceptibility $\chi$ above $T_{\rm Curie}$ indicates that the P nucleus
is suitable for investigating magnetic properties. The temperature and magnetic
field dependences of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by the
temperature $1/T_1T$ at the P site show characteristic features of itinerant
ferromagnets, such as ZrZn$_2$ and Y(Co$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_2$. In addition, the
relationship between $1/T_1T$ and $\chi$ above $T_{\rm Curie}$ suggests that
ferromagnetic fluctuations possess a two-dimensional (2D) characteristic. The
present data show that LaCoPO is a unique ferromagnet, where the 2D
fluctuations anticipated from the crystal structure are predominant down to
almost $T_{\rm Curie}$.
