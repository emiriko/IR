We extend the notion of a Thomas projective connection (a projective
equivalence class of linear connections) for supermanifolds. As a by-product,
we arrive at a generalisation of the multidimensional Schwarzian derivative for
the super case which was previously unknown.
  This is combined with our previous construction of a Laplacian on the algebra
of densities for a projectively connected manifold and allows us to study
Batalin-Vilkovisky type operators and the relation between projective
connections and odd Poisson structures.
