We replace the Higgs sector of the Standard electroweak gauge model of three
fermion families by a horizontal non-vector-like gauge SU(3) quantum flavor
dynamics with one parameter. With plausible physical assumptions we suggest
that the new dynamics generates spontaneously the masses of its eight flavor
gluons, of leptons and quarks, and of the intermediate W and Z bosons. Absence
of axial anomalies requires neutrino right-handed electroweak singlets and the
dynamics then suggests the existence of massive Majorana neutrinos.
