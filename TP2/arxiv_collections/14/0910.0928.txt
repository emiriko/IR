In this paper a novel tool BioDiVinEfor parallel analysis of biological
models is presented. The tool allows analysis of biological models specified in
terms of a set of chemical reactions. Chemical reactions are transformed into a
system of multi-affine differential equations. BioDiVinE employs techniques for
finite discrete abstraction of the continuous state space. At that level,
parallel analysis algorithms based on model checking are provided. In the
paper, the key tool features are described and their application is
demonstrated by means of a case study.
