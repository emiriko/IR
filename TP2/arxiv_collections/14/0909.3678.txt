A random geometric graph $G_n$ is given by picking $n$ vertices in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ independently under a common bounded probability distribution,
with two vertices adjacent if and only if their $l^p$-distance is at most
$r_n$. We investigate the distant-$l$ chromatic number $\chi_l(G_n)$ of $G_n$
for $l\ge1$. Complete picture of the ratios of $\chi_l(G_n)$ to the chromatic
number $\chi(G_n)$ are given in the sense of almost sure convergence.
