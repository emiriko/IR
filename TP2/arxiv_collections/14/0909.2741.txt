The thick brane model supported by a nonlinear spinor field is constructed.
The different cases with the various values of the cosmological constant
$\Lambda (< = >) 0$ are investigated. It is shown that regular analytical
spinor thick brane solutions with asymptotically Minkowski (at $\Lambda=0$) or
anti-de Sitter spacetimes (at $\Lambda<0$) do exist.
