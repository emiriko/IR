XML data warehouses form an interesting basis for decision-support
applications that exploit heterogeneous data from multiple sources. However,
XML-native database systems currently suffer from limited performances in terms
of manageable data volume and response time for complex analytical queries.
Fragmenting and distributing XML data warehouses (e.g., on data grids) allow to
address both these issues. In this paper, we work on XML warehouse
fragmentation. In relational data warehouses, several studies recommend the use
of derived horizontal fragmentation. Hence, we propose to adapt it to the XML
context. We particularly focus on the initial horizontal fragmentation of
dimensions' XML documents and exploit two alternative algorithms. We
experimentally validate our proposal and compare these alternatives with
respect to a unified XML warehouse model we advocate for.
