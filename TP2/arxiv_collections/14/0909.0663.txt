The proposed SCORE detector consists of a large array of light collecting
modules designed to sample the Cherenkov light front of extensive air showers
in order to detect high energy gamma-rays. A large spacing of the detector
stations makes it possible to cover a huge area with a reasonable effort, thus
achieving a good sensitivity up to energies of about a few 10 PeV. In this
paper the event reconstruction algorithm for SCORE is presented and used to
obtain the anticipated performance of the detector in terms of angular
resolution, energy resolution, shower depth resolution and gamma / hadron
separation.
