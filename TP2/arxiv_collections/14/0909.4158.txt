Proteomics can be defined as the large-scale analysis of proteins. Due to the
complexity of biological systems, it is required to concatenate various
separation techniques prior to mass spectrometry. These techniques, dealing
with proteins or peptides, can rely on chromatography or electrophoresis. In
this review, the electrophoretic techniques are under scrutiny. Their
principles are recalled, and their applications for peptide and protein
separations are presented and critically discussed. In addition, the features
that are specific to gel electrophoresis and that interplay with mass
spectrometry (i.e., protein detection after electrophoresis, and the process
leading from a gel piece to a solution of peptides) are also discussed.
