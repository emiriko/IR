Although optical metamaterials that show artificial magnetism are mesoscopic
systems, they are frequently described in terms of effective material
parameters. But due to intrinsic nonlocal (or spatially dispersive) effects it
may be anticipated that this approach is usually only a crude approximation and
is physically meaningless. In order to study the limitations regarding the
assignment of effective material parameters, we present a technique to retrieve
the frequency-dependent elements of the effective permittivity and permeability
tensors for arbitrary angles of incidence and apply the method exemplarily to
the fishnet metamaterial. It turns out that for the fishnet metamaterial,
genuine effective material parameters can only be introduced if quite stringent
constraints are imposed on the wavelength/unit cell size ratio. Unfortunately
they are only met far away from the resonances that induce a magnetic response
required for many envisioned applications of such a fishnet metamaterial. Our
work clearly indicates that the mesoscopic nature and the related spatial
dispersion of contemporary optical metamaterials that show artificial magnetism
prohibits the meaningful introduction of conventional effective material
parameters.
