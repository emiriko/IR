We present the first of a sample of fossil galaxy groups with pre-existing
Chandra and/or XMM-Newton X-ray observations and new or forthcoming low
frequency GMRT data -- RXJ1416.4+2315 (z=0.137). Fossil galaxy groups are ideal
laboratories for studying feedback mechanisms and how energy injection affects
the IGM, since due to the lack of recent merging activity, we expect the IGM to
be relatively pristine and affected only by any AGN activity that has occurred
in the group. Our Chandra X-ray observations reveal features resembling
AGN-inflated bubbles, whilst our GMRT radio data show evidence of extended
emission from the central AGN that may be filling the bubble. This has enabled
us to estimate the work done by the central AGN, place limits on the rates of
energy injection and discuss the nature of the plasma filling the bubble.
