Through a systematic high resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of
the iron pnictide compounds (Ba,Sr)Fe$_2$As$_2$, we show that the electronic
structures of these compounds are significantly reconstructed across the spin
density wave ordering, which cannot be described by a simple folding scenario
of conventional density wave ordering. Moreover, we find that LDA calculations
with an incorporated suppressed magnetic moment of 0.5$\mu_{\tiny{\textrm{B}}}$
can match well the details in the reconstructed electronic structure,
suggesting that the nature of magnetism in the pnictides is more itinerant than
local, while the origin of suppressed magnetic moment remains an important
issue for future investigations.
