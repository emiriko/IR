The first stage of the hybrid quantum repeaters is entanglement generation
based on transmission of pulses in coherent states over a lossy channel.
Protocols to make entanglement with only one type of error are favorable for
rendering subsequent entanglement distillation efficient. Here we provide the
tight upper bound on performances of these protocols that is determined only by
the channel loss. In addition, we show that this bound is achievable by
utilizing a proposed protocol [arXiv:0811.3100] composed of a simple
combination of linear optical elements and photon-number-resolving detectors.
