Penning trap mass measurements on neutron-deficient Cd isotopes (99-109)Cd
have been performed with the ISOLTRAP mass spectrometer at ISOLDE/CERN, all
with relative mass uncertainties below 3*10^8. A new mass evaluation has been
performed. The mass of 99Cd has been determined for the first time which
extends the region of accurately known mass values towards the doubly magic
nucleus 100Sn. The implication of the results on the reaction path of the rp
process in stellar X-ray bursts is discussed. In particular, the uncertainty of
the abundance and the overproduction created by the rp-process for the mass A =
99 is demonstrated by reducing the uncertainty of the proton-separation energy
of 100In Sp(100In) by a factor of 2.5.
