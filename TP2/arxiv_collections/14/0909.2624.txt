This paper adresses the general issue of estimating the sensitivity of the
expectation of a random variable with respect to a parameter characterizing its
evolution. In finance for example, the sensitivities of the price of a
contingent claim are called the Greeks. A new way of estimating the Greeks has
been recently introduced by Elie, Fermanian and Touzi through a randomization
of the parameter of interest combined with non parametric estimation
techniques. This paper studies another type of those estimators whose interest
is to be closely related to the score function, which is well known to be the
optimal Greek weight. This estimator relies on the use of two distinct kernel
functions and the main interest of this paper is to provide its asymptotic
properties. Under a little more stringent condition, its rate of convergence
equals the one of those introduced by Elie, Fermanian and Touzi and outperforms
the finite differences estimator. In addition to the technical interest of the
proofs, this result is very encouraging in the dynamic of creating new type of
estimators for sensitivities.
