We formulate a conjecture for the local parts of Weyl group multiple
Dirichlet series attached to root systems of type D. Our conjecture is
analogous to the description of the local parts of type A series given by
Brubaker, Bump, Friedberg, and Hoffstein in terms of Gelfand--Tsetlin patterns.
Our conjecture is given in terms of patterns for irreducible representations of
even orthogonal Lie algebras developed by Littelmann.
