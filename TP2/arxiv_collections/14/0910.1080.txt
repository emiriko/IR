We report on D0 searches for leptoquarks (LQ) predicted in extended gauge
theories and composite models to explain the symmetry between quarks and
leptons. Data samples obtained with the D0 detector from proton-antiproton
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV corresponding to intergrated
luminosities of 1--4 inverse-fb were analyzed. No evidence for the production
of such particles were observed and lower limits on leptoquark masses are set.
