We present the discovery prospects for a Z' resonance and some expected
results for Z' diagnostic measurements at the LHC. The discovery reach is
highly dependent on the energy and luminosities that may be attained at the
LHC, and a number of energy and integrated luminosity scenarios are presented.
In addition, the use of third generation quark final states for distinguishing
between models and for measuring a forward-backward asymmetry is explored.
