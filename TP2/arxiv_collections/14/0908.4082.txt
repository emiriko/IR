Ultracompact minihalos have recently been proposed as a new class of dark
matter structure. These minihalos would be produced by phase transitions in the
early Universe or features in the inflaton potential, and constitute
non-baryonic massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) today. We examine the
prospect of detecting ultracompact minihalos in gamma-rays if dark matter
consists of self-annihilating particles. We compute present-day fluxes from
minihalos produced in the electron-positron annihilation epoch, and the QCD and
electroweak phase transitions in the early Universe. Even at a distance of 100
pc, minihalos produced during the electron-positron annihilation epoch should
be eminently detectable today, either by the Fermi satellite, current Air
Cherenkov telescopes, or even in archival EGRET data. Within ~1 pc, minihalos
formed in the QCD phase transition would have similar predicted fluxes to the
dwarf spheroidal galaxies targeted by current indirect dark matter searches, so
might also be detectable by present or upcoming experiments.
