A novel angle-swept high-frequency EPR (HFEPR) technique is described that
enables in-situ alignment of single-crystal samples containing low-symmetry
magnetic species such as single-molecule magnets (SMMs). This cavity-based
method involves recording spectra at fixed frequency and field, while sweeping
the field orientation. The method is applied to the study of a low-symmetry
Jahn-Teller variant of the spin S = 10 Mn12 SMMs (e.g. Mn12-acetate). The
low-symmetry complex is also an SMM, but with a significantly reduced barrier
to magnetization reversal (Ueff ~ 43 K) and, hence, faster relaxation at low
temperature in comparison with the high-symmetry species. Mn12 complexes that
crystallize in lower symmetry structures exhibit a tendency for one or more of
the Mn(III) Jahn-Teller axes to be abnormally oriented, which is believed to be
the cause of the faster relaxation. An extensive HFEPR study of
[Mn12O12(O2CCH2But)16(H2O)4].CH2Cl2.MeNO2 is presented in order to examine the
influence of the abnormally oriented Jahn-Teller axis on the effective barrier.
The reduction in the axial anisotropy, D, is found to be insufficient to
account for the nearly 40% reduction in Ueff. However, the reduced symmetry of
the Mn12 core gives rise to a very significant 2nd order transverse anisotropy,
E ~ D/6. This, in turn, causes a significant mixing of spin projection states
well below the top of the classical barrier. Thus, magnetic quantum tunneling
is the dominant factor contributing to the barrier reduction in fast relaxing
Mn12 SMMs.
