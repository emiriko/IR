We analyze the effects of noise and parameter deviations in a bichromatic
Raman type white light cavity, with potential applications in precision
measurements such as gravitational wave detection. The results show that the
dispersion variation induced by parameter deviation can be controlled within
$10^{-4}$. The laser phase noise decreases the dispersion magnitude while the
amplitude noise increases it. Although we can always adjust the parameters to
satisfy the white light condition, both noises make the cavity transmission
curve uneven.
