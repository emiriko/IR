The entanglement of graph states up to eight qubits is calculated in the
regime of iteration calculation. The entanglement measures could be the
relative entropy of entanglement, the logarithmic robustness or the geometric
measure. All 146 local inequivalent graphs are classified as two categories:
graphs with identical upper LOCC entanglement bound and lower bipartite
entanglement bound, graphs with unequal bounds. The late may displays
non-integer entanglement. The precision of iteration calculation of the
entanglement is less than $10^{-14}$.
