We compute the properties of singlet and triplet bipolarons on
two-dimensional lattices using the continuous time quantum Monte Carlo
algorithm. Properties of the bipolaron including the total energy, inverse
mass, bipolaron radius and number of phonons associated with the bipolaron
demonstrate the qualitative difference between models of electron phonon
interaction with long-range interaction (screened Fr\"ohlich) and those with
purely local (Holstein) interaction. A major result of our survey of the
parameter space is the existence of extra-light hybrid singlet bipolarons
consisting of an on-site and an off-site component on both square and
triangular lattices. We also compute triplet properties of the bipolarons and
the pair dispersion. For pair momenta on the edge of the Brillouin zone of the
triangular lattice, we find that triplet states are more stable than singlets.
