Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) probes the momentum-space
electronic structure of materials, and provides invaluable information about
the high-temperature superconducting cuprates. Likewise, the cuprate
real-space, inhomogeneous electronic structure is elucidated by Scanning
Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS). Recently, STS has exploited quasiparticle
interference (QPI) - wave-like electrons scattering off impurities to produce
periodic interference patterns - to infer properties of the QP in
momentum-space. Surprisingly, some interference peaks in
Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} (Bi-2212) are absent beyond the
antiferromagnetic (AF) zone boundary, implying the dominance of particular
scattering process. Here, we show that ARPES sees no evidence of quasiparticle
(QP) extinction: QP-like peaks are measured everywhere on the Fermi surface,
evolving smoothly across the AF zone boundary. This apparent contradiction
stems from different natures of single-particle (ARPES) and two-particle (STS)
processes underlying these probes. Using a simple model, we demonstrate
extinction of QPI without implying the loss of QP beyond the AF zone boundary.
