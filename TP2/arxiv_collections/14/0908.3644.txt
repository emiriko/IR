The random key graph is a random graph naturally associated with the random
key predistribution scheme of Eschenauer and Gligor for wireless sensor
networks. For this class of random graphs we establish a new version of a
conjectured zero-one law for graph connectivity as the number of nodes becomes
unboundedly large. The results reported here complement and strengthen recent
work on this conjecture by Blackburn and Gerke. In particular, the results are
given under conditions which are more realistic for applications to wireless
sensor networks.
