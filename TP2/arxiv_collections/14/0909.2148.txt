The correlation buildup and the formation dynamics of the shell structure in
a spherically confined one-component plasma are studied. Using Langevin
dynamics simulations the relaxation processes and characteristic time scales
and their dependence on the pair interaction and dissipation in the plasma are
investigated. While in systems with Coulomb interaction (e.g. trapped ions) in
a harmonic confinement shell formation starts at the plasma edge and proceeds
inward, this trend is significantly weakened for dusty plasmas with Yukawa
interaction. With a suitable change of the confinement conditions the
crystallization scenario can be externally controlled.
