In this manuscript we introduce a generalisation of the log-Normal
distribution that is inspired by a modification of the Kaypten multiplicative
process using the $q$-product of Borges [Physica A \textbf{340}, 95 (2004)].
Depending on the value of q the distribution increases the tail for small (when
$q<1$) or large (when $q>1$) values of the variable upon analysis. The usual
log-Normal distribution is retrieved when $q=1$. The main statistical features
of this distribution are presented as well as a related random number
generators and tables of quantiles of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Lastly, we
illustrate the application of this distribution studying the adjustment of a
set of variables of biological and financial origin.
