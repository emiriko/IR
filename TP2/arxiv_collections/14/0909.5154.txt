We investigate dust production and stellar mass loss in the Galactic globular
cluster NGC 362. Due to its close proximity to the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), NGC 362 was imaged with the IRAC and MIPS cameras onboard the Spitzer
Space Telescope as part of the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution
(SAGE-SMC) Spitzer Legacy program. We detect several cluster members near the
tip of the Red Giant Branch that exhibit infrared excesses indicative of
circumstellar dust and find that dust is not present in measurable quantities
in stars below the tip of the Red Giant Branch. We modeled the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the stars with the strongest IR excess and find a total
cluster dust mass-loss rate of 3.0(+2.0/-1.2) x 10^-9 solar masses per year,
corresponding to a gas mass-loss rate of 8.6(+5.6/-3.4) x 10^-6 solar masses
per year, assuming [Fe/H] = -1.16. This mass loss is in addition to any
dust-less mass loss that is certainly occurring within the cluster. The two
most extreme stars, variables V2 and V16, contribute up to 45% of the total
cluster dust-traced mass loss. The SEDs of the more moderate stars indicate the
presence of silicate dust, as expected for low-mass, low-metallicity stars.
Surprisingly, the SED shapes of the stars with the strongest mass-loss rates
appear to require the presence of amorphous carbon dust, possibly in
combination with silicate dust, despite their oxygen-rich nature. These results
corroborate our previous findings in omega Centauri.
