We investigate the chiral phase transition in the strong coupling lattice QCD
(SC-LQCD) at finite temperature and density with finite coupling effects. We
adopt one species of staggered fermion, and develop an analytic formulation
based on strong coupling and cluster expansions. We derive the effective
potential as a function of two order parameters, the chiral condensate sigma
and the vector potential \omega_\tau, in a self-consistent treatment of the
next-to-leading order (NLO) and the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
effective action terms. Finite coupling effects lead to modifications of quark
mass, chemical potential and the quark wave function renormalization factor.
Finite coupling effects suppress the critical temperature at mu=0 (T_{c,mu=0}),
while critical temperature at T=0 (mu_{c,T=0}) is not affected much. NNLO
corrections does not significantly affect T_{c,mu=0} and mu_{c,T=0}, but the
phase diagram shape including the position of the critical point is sensitive
to the NNLO effects. Partially chiral restored matter is found to exist in NLO
and NNLO SC-LQCD.
