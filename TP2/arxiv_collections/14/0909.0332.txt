In this Letter, we give new constraints on planet migration. They were
obtained under the assumption that Saturn's current obliquity is due to a
capture in resonance with Neptune's ascending node. If planet migration is too
fast, then Saturn crosses the resonance without being captured and it keeps a
small obliquity. This scenario thus gives a lower limit on the migration time
scale tau. We found that this boundary depends strongly on Neptune's initial
inclination. For two different migration types, we found that tau should be at
least greater than 7 Myr. This limit increases rapidly as Neptune's initial
inclination decreases from 10 to 1 degree. We also give an algorithm to know if
Saturn can be tilted for any migration law.
