We construct a set of instances of 3SAT which are not solved efficiently
using the simplest quantum adiabatic algorithm. These instances are obtained by
picking random clauses all consistent with two disparate planted solutions and
then penalizing one of them with a single additional clause. We argue that by
randomly modifying the beginning Hamiltonian, one obtains (with substantial
probability) an adiabatic path that removes this difficulty. This suggests that
the quantum adiabatic algorithm should in general be run on each instance with
many different random paths leading to the problem Hamiltonian. We do not know
whether this trick will help for a random instance of 3SAT (as opposed to an
instance from the particular set we consider), especially if the instance has
an exponential number of disparate assignments that violate few clauses. We use
a continuous imaginary time Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in a novel way to
numerically investigate the ground state as well as the first excited state of
our system. Our arguments are supplemented by Quantum Monte Carlo data from
simulations with up to 150 spins.
