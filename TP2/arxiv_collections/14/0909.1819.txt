Acyclic digraphs arise in many natural and artificial processes. Among the
broader set, dynamic citation networks represent a substantively important form
of acyclic digraphs. For example, the study of such networks includes the
spread of ideas through academic citations, the spread of innovation through
patent citations, and the development of precedent in common law systems. The
specific dynamics that produce such acyclic digraphs not only differentiate
them from other classes of graphs, but also provide guidance for the
development of meaningful distance measures. In this article, we develop and
apply our sink distance measure together with the single-linkage hierarchical
clustering algorithm to both a two-dimensional directed preferential attachment
model as well as empirical data drawn from the first quarter century of
decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Despite applying the simplest
combination of distance measures and clustering algorithms, analysis reveals
that more accurate and more interpretable clusterings are produced by this
scheme.
