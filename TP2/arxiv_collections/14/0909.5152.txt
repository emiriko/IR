Necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of arbitrary n-qubit
pure quantum states under Local Unitary (LU) operations are derived. First, an
easily computable standard form for multipartite states is introduced. Two
generic states are shown to be LU-equivalent iff their standard forms coincide.
The LU-equivalence problem for non--generic states is solved by presenting a
systematic method to determine the LU operators (if they exist) which
interconvert the two states.
