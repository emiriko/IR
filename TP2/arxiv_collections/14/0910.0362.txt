This article provides a review of recent developments in the formulation and
execution of optimal control strategies for the dynamics of quantum systems. A
brief introduction to the concept of optimal control, the dynamics of of open
quantum systems, and quantum information processing is followed by a
presentation of recent developments regarding the two main tasks in this
context: state-specific and state-independent optimal control. For the former,
we present an extension of conventional theory (Pontryagin's principle) to
quantum systems which undergo a non-Markovian time-evolution. Owing to its
importance for the realization of quantum information processing, the main body
of the review, however, is devoted to state-independent optimal control. Here,
we address three different approaches: an approach which treats dissipative
effects from the environment in lowest-order perturbation theory, a general
method based on the time--evolution superoperator concept, as well as one based
on the Kraus representation of the time-evolution superoperator. Applications
which illustrate these new methods focus on single and double qubits (quantum
gates) whereby the environment is modeled either within the Lindblad equation
or a bath of bosons (spin-boson model). While these approaches are widely
applicable, we shall focus our attention to solid-state based physical
realizations, such as semiconductor- and superconductor-based systems. While an
attempt is made to reference relevant and representative work throughout the
community, the exposition will focus mainly on work which has emerged from our
own group.
