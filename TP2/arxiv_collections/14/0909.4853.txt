We discuss the M_T2-kink method to determine the masses of both the dark
matter WIMP and its mother particle produced at the LHC. We then introduce a
new kinematic variable, the M_T2-Assisted-On-Shell (MAOS) momentum, that
provides a systematic approximation to the invisible particle momenta in hadron
collider events producing a pair of invisible particles, and apply it to
certain SUSY processes and their UED equivalents to determine the spin of
gluino/KK-gluon and of slepton/KK-lepton. An application of the MAOS momentum
to the SM Higgs mass measurement is briefly discussed also.
