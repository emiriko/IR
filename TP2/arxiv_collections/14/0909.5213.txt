We investigate what new physics signatures the LHC can discover in the
2009-2010 run, beyond the expected sensitivity of the Tevatron data by 2010. We
construct "supermodels", for which the LHC sensitivity even with only 10
inverse picobarn is greater than that of the Tevatron with 10 inverse
femtobarn. The simplest supermodels involve s-channel resonances in the
quark-antiquark and especially in the quark-quark channels. We concentrate on
easily visible final states with small standard model backgrounds, and find
that there are simple searches, besides those for Z' states, which could
discover new physics in early LHC data. Many of these are well-suited to test
searches for "more conventional" models, often discussed for multi-inverse
femtobarn data sets.
