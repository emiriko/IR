We review recent developments related to jet clustering algorithms and jet
reconstruction, with particular emphasis on their implications in heavy ion
collisions. These developments include fast implementations of sequential
recombination algorithms, new IRC safe algorithms, quantitative determination
of jet areas and quality measures for jet finding, among many others. We also
show how jet reconstruction provides a useful tool to probe the characteristics
of the hot and dense medium created in heavy ion collisions, which allows one
to distinguish between different models of parton-medium interaction.
