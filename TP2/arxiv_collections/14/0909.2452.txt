Within Lloyds Banking Group the heritage HBOS Corporate division deals with
Corporate loans, and is required to assess these loans for risk in accordance
with the Basle Accord regulations. Statistical Risk Rating models are developed
by the risk analysts to assess the obligors credit worthiness. It is necessary
then to provide the bankers who originated the loan ('Relationship Managers' or
RMs) with an assessment tool to generate the loan rating upon which they base
their lending decisions. Heritage HBoS Corporate required a new model build
system for holding its Risk Rating models in 2006 as a result of more complex
models being created to comply with the Basle Accord. The use of Excel was
promoted by the IT department for a number of reasons; the Excel solution now
in use is reviewed in this paper.
