We consider the problem of search of an unstructured list for a marked
element, when one is given advice as to where this element might be located, in
the form of a probability distribution. The goal is to minimise the expected
number of queries to the list made to find the marked element, with respect to
this distribution. We present a quantum algorithm which solves this problem
using an optimal number of queries, up to a constant factor. For some
distributions on the input, such as certain power law distributions, the
algorithm can achieve exponential speed-ups over the best possible classical
algorithm. We also give an efficient quantum algorithm for a variant of this
task where the distribution is not known in advance, but must be queried at an
additional cost. The algorithms are based on the use of Grover's quantum search
algorithm and amplitude amplification as subroutines.
