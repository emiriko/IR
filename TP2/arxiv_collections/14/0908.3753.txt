In this paper we consider the effect of different time parameterizations on
the stationary velocity distribution function for a relativistic gas. We
clarify the distinction between two such distributions, namely the J\"{u}ttner
and the modified J\"{u}ttner distributions. Using a recently proposed model of
a relativistic gas, we show that the obtained results for the proper-time
averaging does not lead to modified J\"{u}ttner distribution (as recently
conjectured), but introduces only a Lorentz factor $\gamma$ to the well-known
J\"{u}ttner function which results from observer-time averaging. We obtain
results for rest frame as well as moving frame in order to support our claim.
