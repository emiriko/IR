This paper verifies a conjecture posed in a pair of papers on the fixed point
sets for a class of quantum operations. Specifically, it is proved that if a
quantum operation has mutually commuting operation elements that are effects
forming a resolution of the identity, then the fixed points set of the quantum
operation is exactly the commutant of the operation elements.
