We comment on the assertion made by Caselle et al., J. Stat. Mech. 0603, P008
(2006), that the confining (string) potential for three quarks "makes a smooth
cross-over transition from the Delta-string to the Y-string configuration at
interquark distances of around 0.8 fm". We study the functional dependence of
the three-quark confining potentials due to a Y-string, and the Delta-string
and show that they have different symmetries, which lead to different constants
of the motion (i.e. they belong to different "universality classes" in the
parlance of the theory of phase transitions). This means that there is no
"smooth cross-over" between the two, when their string tensions are identical,
except at the vanishing hyper-radius. We also comment on a certain two-body
potential approximation to the Y-string potential.
