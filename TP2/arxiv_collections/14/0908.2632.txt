Quantum telecloning is a multiparty quantum communication protocol which
allows quantum information broadcasting. It can be, therefore, seen as a
generalization of quantum teleportation. However, in contrast to quantum
teleportation, it requires the resource of multipartite entanglement. Here we
present an experimental demonstration of universal symmetric 1->2 quantum
telecloning of qubits via four-photon polarisation entanglement.
