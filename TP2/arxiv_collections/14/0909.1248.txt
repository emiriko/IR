Total and differential cross sections for $\eta$ and $\eta ^\prime$
photoproduction off the proton have been determined with the CBELSA/TAPS
detector for photon energies between 0.85 and 2.55 GeV. The $\eta$ mesons are
detected in their two neutral decay modes, $\eta\to\gamma\gamma$ and $\eta\to
3\pi^0\to 6\gamma$, and for the first time, cover the full angular range in
$\rm cos \theta_{cm}$ of the $\eta$ meson. These new $\eta$ photoproduction
data are consistent with the earlier CB-ELSA results. The $\eta ^\prime$ mesons
are observed in their neutral decay to $\pi^0\pi^0\eta\to 6\gamma$ and also
extend the coverage in angular range.
