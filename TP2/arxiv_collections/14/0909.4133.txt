After a review of a traditional analysis, it is shown a variation of a more
recent treatment on the spectrum of relic gravitational waves (GWs). Then, a
connection between the two different treatments will be analysed. Such a
connection permits to obtain an interesting equation for the inflaton field.
This equation gives a value that agrees with the slow roll condition on
inflation.
