We present results from a series of observational tests to 3D and 1D solar
models. In particular, emphasis is given to the line formation of atomic oxygen
lines, used to derive the much debated solar oxygen photospheric abundance.
Using high-quality observations obtained with the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST)
we study the centre-to-limb variation of the O I lines, testing the models and
line formation (LTE and non-LTE). For the O I 777 nm triplet, the
centre-to-limb variation sets strong constraints in the non-LTE line formation,
and is used to derive an empirical correction factor (S_H) to the classical
Drawin recipe for neutral hydrogen collisions. Taking advantage of the
spatially-resolved character of the SST data, an additional framework for
testing the 3D model and line formation is also studied. From the tests we
confirm that the employed 3D model is realistic and its predictions agree very
well with the observations.
