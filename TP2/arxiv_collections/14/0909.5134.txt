We report on results of computer micromodelling of anti-vortex states in
asymmetrical cross-like ferromagnetic nanostructures and their practical
realization. The arrays of cobalt crosses with 1 mkm branches, 100 nm widths of
the branches and 40 nm thicknesses were fabricated using e-beam lithography and
ion etching. Each branch of the cross was tapered at one end and bulbous at the
other. The stable formation of anti-vortex magnetic states in these
nanostructures during magnetization reversal was demonstrated experimentally
using magnetic force microscopy.
