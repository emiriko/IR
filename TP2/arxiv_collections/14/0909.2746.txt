Using tomographic-probability representation of spin states, quantum behavior
of qudits is examined. For a general j-qudit state we propose an explicit
formula of quantumness witnetness whose negative average value is incompatible
with classical statistical model. Probability representations of quantum and
classical (2j+1)-level systems are compared within the framework of quantumness
tests. Trough employing Jordan-Schwinger map the method is extended to check
quantumness of two-mode light states.
