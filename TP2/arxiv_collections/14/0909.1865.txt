Motivated by the observations on the intra-cluster light (ICL) and
inter-galactic stellar populations, n-body simulations are used to model the
galactic merging events as a goal to investigate the production and
distribution of gravitational unbound populations (GUPs). Both the parabolic
and hyperbolic mergers are considered and each category includes six models
with different relative orientations between two galaxies. Our results show
that there are more (about a factor of two) GUP after a hyperbolic merging
event than after a parabolic one. In general, depending on the relative
orientation and also the relative velocity of the two galaxies in a merging
pair, a head-on collision of a galaxy pair would only make a tiny fraction
(less than one percent) of the initial stellar mass become luminous GUP but a
considerable fraction (eight to fourteen percent) of the dark matter become
dark GUP.
