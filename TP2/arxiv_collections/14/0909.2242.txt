Recently Fayers introduced a large family of combinatorial realizations of
the fundamental crystal for affine sl(n), where the vertices are indexed by
certain partitions. He showed that special cases of this construction agree
with the Misra-Miwa realization and with Berg's ladder crystal. Here we show
that another special case is naturally isomorphic to a realization using
Nakajima's monomial crystal.
