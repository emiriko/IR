We show that the low-frequency modes of a sub-Ohmic bosonic heat bath
generate an effective dynamical asymmetry for an intrinsically symmetric
quantum spin -1/2. An initially fully polarized spin first decays towards a
quasiequilibrium determined by the dynamical asymmetry, thereby showing
coherent damped oscillations on the (fast) time scale of the spin splitting. On
top of this, the dynamical asymmetry itself decays on an ultraslow time scale
and vanishes asymptotically since the global equilibrium phase is symmetric. We
quantitatively study the nature of the initial fast decay to the
quasiequilibrium and discuss the features of ultraslow dynamics of the
quasiequilibrium itself. The dynamical asymmetry is more pronounced for smaller
values of the sub-Ohmic exponent and for lower temperatures, which emphasizes
the quantum many-body nature of the effect. The symmetry breaking is related to
the dynamic crossover between coherent and overdamped relaxation of the spin
polarization and is not connected to the localization quantum phase transition.
In addition to this delocalized phase, we identify a novel phase which is
characterized by damped coherent oscillations in the localized phase. This
allows for a sketch of the zero-temperature phase diagram of the sub-Ohmic
spin-boson model with four distinct phases.
