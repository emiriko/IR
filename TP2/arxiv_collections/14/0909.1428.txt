We show that there are quantum devices that accept all regular languages and
that are exponentially more concise than deterministic finite automata (DFA).
For this purpose, we introduce a new computing model of {\it one-way quantum
finite automata} (1QFA), namely, {\it one-way quantum finite automata together
with classical states} (1QFAC), which extends naturally both measure-only 1QFA
and DFA and whose state complexity is upper-bounded by both. The original
contributions of the paper are the following. First, we show that the set of
languages accepted by 1QFAC with bounded error consists precisely of all
regular languages. Second, we prove that 1QFAC are at most exponentially more
concise than DFA. Third, we show that the previous bound is tight for families
of regular languages that are not recognized by measure-once (RMO),
measure-many (RMM) and multi-letter 1QFA. % More concretely we exhibit regular
languages $L^0(m)$ for $m$ prime such that: (i) $L^0(m)$ cannot be recognized
by measure-once, measure-many and multi-letter 1QFA; (ii) the minimal DFA that
accepts $L^0(m)$ has $O(m)$ states; (iii) there is a 1QFAC with constant
classical states and $O(\log(m))$ quantum basis that accepts $L^0(m)$. Fourth,
we give a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether any two 1QFAC are
equivalent. Finally, we show that state minimization of 1QFAC is decidable
within EXPSPACE. We conclude the paper by posing some open problems.
