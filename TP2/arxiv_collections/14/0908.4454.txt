We prove the existence of a large class of one-parameter families of
cosmological solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations that have a Newtonian
limit. This class includes solutions that represent a finite, but otherwise
arbitrary, number of compact fluid bodies. These solutions provide exact
cosmological models that admit Newtonian limits but, are not, either implicitly
or explicitly, averaged.
