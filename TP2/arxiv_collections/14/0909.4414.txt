We study the effects of the perturbation which violates the permutation
symmetry of three Majorana neutrinos but preserves the well known (23)
interchange symmetry. This is done in the presence of an arbitrary Majorana
phase which serves to insure the degeneracy of the three neutrinos at the
unperturbed level.
