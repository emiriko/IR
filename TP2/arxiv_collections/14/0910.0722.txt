Oracle inequalities and variable selection properties for the Lasso in linear
models have been established under a variety of different assumptions on the
design matrix. We show in this paper how the different conditions and concepts
relate to each other. The restricted eigenvalue condition (Bickel et al., 2009)
or the slightly weaker compatibility condition (van de Geer, 2007) are
sufficient for oracle results. We argue that both these conditions allow for a
fairly general class of design matrices. Hence, optimality of the Lasso for
prediction and estimation holds for more general situations than what it
appears from coherence (Bunea et al, 2007b,c) or restricted isometry (Candes
and Tao, 2005) assumptions.
