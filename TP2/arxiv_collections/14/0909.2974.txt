We establish large deviation formulas for linear statistics on the $N$
transmission eigenvalues $\{T_i\}$ of a chaotic cavity, in the framework of
Random Matrix Theory. Given any linear statistics of interest $A=\sum_{i=1}^N
a(T_i)$, the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}_A(A,N)$ of $A$ generically
satisfies the large deviation formula
$\lim_{N\to\infty}[-2\log\mathcal{P}_A(Nx,N)/\beta N^2]=\Psi_A(x)$, where
$\Psi_A(x)$ is a rate function that we compute explicitly in many cases
(conductance, shot noise, moments) and $\beta$ corresponds to different
symmetry classes. Using these large deviation expressions, it is possible to
recover easily known results and to produce new formulas, such as a closed form
expression for $v(n)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\mathrm{var}(\mathcal{T}_n)$ (where
$\mathcal{T}_n=\sum_{i}T_i^n$) for arbitrary integer $n$. The universal limit
$v^\star=\lim_{n\to\infty} v(n)=1/2\pi\beta$ is also computed exactly. The
distributions display a central Gaussian region flanked on both sides by
non-Gaussian tails. At the junction of the two regimes, weakly non-analytical
points appear, a direct consequence of phase transitions in an associated
Coulomb gas problem. Numerical checks are also provided, which are in full
agreement with our asymptotic results in both real and Laplace space even for
moderately small $N$. Part of the results have been announced in [P. Vivo, S.N.
