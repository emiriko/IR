We review an evolution equation for quantum entanglement for 2x2 dimensional
quantum systems, the smallest system that can exhibit entanglement, and extend
it to higher dimensional systems. Furthermore, we provide statistical evidence
for the equation's applicability to the experimentally relevant domain of
weakly mixed states.
