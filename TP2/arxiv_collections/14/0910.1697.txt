Particle production in high-energy collisions is often addressed within the
framework of the thermal (statistical) model. We present a method to calculate
the canonical partition function for the hadron resonance gas with exact
conservation of the baryon number, strangeness, electric charge, charmness and
bottomness. We derive an analytical expression for the partition function which
is represented as series of Bessel functions. Our results can be used directly
to analyze particle production yields in elementary and in heavy ion
collisions. We also quantify the importance of quantum statistics in the
calculations of the light particle multiplicities in the canonical thermal
model of the hadron resonance gas.
