We have made an attempt to reformulate the generalized field equation of
dyons in terms of octonion variables. Octonion forms of generalized potential
and current equations are discussed in consistent manner. It has been shown
that due to the non associativity of octonion variables it is necessary to
impose certain constraints to describe generalized octonion electrodynamics in
manifestly covariant and consistent manner.
