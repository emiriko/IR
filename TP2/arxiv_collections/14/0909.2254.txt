We present the spectra of 24 white dwarfs in the direction of the globular
cluster Messier 4 obtained with the Keck/LRIS and Gemini/GMOS spectrographs.
Determining the spectral types of the stars in this sample, we find 24 type DA
and 0 type DB (i.e., atmospheres dominated by hydrogen and helium
respectively). Assuming the ratio of DA/DB observed in the field with effective
temperature between 15,000 - 25,000 K, i.e., 4.2:1, holds for the cluster
environment, the chance of finding no DBs in our sample due simply to
statistical fluctuations is only 6 X 10^(-3). The spectral types of the ~100
white dwarfs previously identified in open clusters indicate that DB formation
is strongly suppressed in that environment. Furthermore, all the ~10 white
dwarfs previously identified in other globular clusters are exclusively type
DA. In the context of these two facts, this finding suggests that DB formation
is suppressed in the cluster environment in general. Though no satisfactory
explanation for this phenomenon exists, we discuss several possibilities.
