A simple construction is presented which allows computing the transition
amplitude of a quantum circuit to be encoded as computing the permanent of a
matrix which is of size proportional to the number of quantum gates in the
circuit. This opens up some interesting classical monte-carlo algorithms for
approximating quantum circuits.
