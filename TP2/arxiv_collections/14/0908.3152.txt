We discuss a possible implementation of high-pressure gas-filled RF (HPRF)
cavities in a linear cooling channel for muons and some of the technical issues
that must be dealt with. The approach we describe is a hybrid approach that
uses high-pressure hydrogen gas to avoid cavity breakdown, along with discrete
LiH absorbers to provide the majority of the energy loss. Initial simulations
show that the channel performs as well as the original vacuum RF channel while
potentially avoiding the degradation in RF gradient associated with the strong
magnetic field in the cooling channel.
