We propose geometrical methods for constructing square 01-matrices with the
same number n of units in every row and column, and such that any two rows of
the matrix contain at most one unit in common. These matrices are equivalent to
n-regular bipartite graphs without 4-cycles, and therefore can be used for the
construction of efficient bipartite-graph codes such that both the classes of
its vertices are associated with local constraints. We significantly extend the
region of parameters m,n for which there exist an n-regular bipartite graph
with 2m vertices and without 4-cycles. In that way we essentially increase the
region of lengths and rates of the corresponding bipartite-graph codes. Many
new matrices are either circulant or consist of circulant submatrices: this
provides code parity-check matrices consisting of circulant submatrices, and
hence quasi-cyclic bipartite-graph codes with simple implementation.
