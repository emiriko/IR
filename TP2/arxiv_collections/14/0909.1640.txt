We propose a certificate-based single sign-on mechanism in distributed
systems. The proposed security protocols and authentication mechanisms are
integrated in a middleware. The novelty of our middleware lies on the use of
XPCOM components, this way we provide a different services that can be used on
every platform where Mozilla is available. The componen based architecture of
the implemented services allows using the authentication components separately.
