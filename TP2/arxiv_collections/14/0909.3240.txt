Discoveries at the LHC will soon set the physics agenda for future colliders.
This report of a CERN Theory Institute includes the summaries of Working Groups
that reviewed the physics goals and prospects of LHC running with 10 to 300/fb
of integrated luminosity, of the proposed sLHC luminosity upgrade, of the ILC,
of CLIC, of the LHeC and of a muon collider. The four Working Groups considered
possible scenarios for the first 10/fb of data at the LHC in which (i) a state
with properties that are compatible with a Higgs boson is discovered, (ii) no
such state is discovered either because the Higgs properties are such that it
is difficult to detect or because no Higgs boson exists, (iii) a missing-energy
signal beyond the Standard Model is discovered as in some supersymmetric
models, and (iv) some other exotic signature of new physics is discovered. In
the contexts of these scenarios, the Working Groups reviewed the capabilities
of the future colliders to study in more detail whatever new physics may be
discovered by the LHC. Their reports provide the particle physics community
with some tools for reviewing the scientific priorities for future colliders
after the LHC produces its first harvest of new physics from multi-TeV
collisions.
