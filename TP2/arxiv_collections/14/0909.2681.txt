Despite an already long and fruitful history, gaseous elementary-particle
detectors remain today an important mainstay of high-energy and nuclear physics
experiments and of radiation detection in general. In here we briefly describe
some of the gaseous detector's main technologies and applications, along with
some unsolved gas-discharge physics aspects of practical relevance.
