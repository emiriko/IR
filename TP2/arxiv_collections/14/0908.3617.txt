The behaviour of the cross-sectional polarization field is explored for thin
nanowires of barium titanate from first-principles calculations. Topological
defects of different winding numbers have been obtained, beyond the known
textures in ferroelectric nanostructures. They result from the inward
accommodation of the polarization patterns imposed at the surface of the wire
by surface and edge effects. Close to a topological defect the polarization
field orients out of the basal plane in some cases, maintaining a close to
constant magnitude, whereas it virtually vanishes in other cases.
