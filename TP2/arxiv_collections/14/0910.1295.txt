We present a new modular traffic signs recognition system, successfully
applied to both American and European speed limit signs. Our sign detection
step is based only on shape-detection (rectangles or circles). This enables it
to work on grayscale images, contrary to most European competitors, which eases
robustness to illumination conditions (notably night operation). Speed sign
candidates are classified (or rejected) by segmenting potential digits inside
them (which is rather original and has several advantages), and then applying a
neural digit recognition. The global detection rate is ~90% for both (standard)
U.S. and E.U. speed signs, with a misclassification rate <1%, and no validated
false alarm in >150 minutes of video. The system processes in real-time ~20
frames/s on a standard high-end laptop.
