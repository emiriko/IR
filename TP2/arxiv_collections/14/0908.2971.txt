We find evidence for accelerated evolution in compact group galaxies from the
distribution in mid-infrared colorspace of 42 galaxies from 12 Hickson Compact
Groups (HCGs) compared to the the distributions of several other samples
including the LVL+SINGS galaxies, interacting galaxies, and galaxies from the
Coma Cluster. We find that the HCG galaxies are not uniformly distributed in
colorspace, as well as quantitative evidence for a gap. Galaxies in the infall
region of the Coma cluster also exhibit a non-uniform distribution and a less
well defined gap, which may reflect a similarity with the compact group
environment. Neither the Coma Center or interacting samples show evidence of a
gap, leading us to speculate that the gap is unique to the environment of high
galaxy density where gas has not been fully processed or stripped.
