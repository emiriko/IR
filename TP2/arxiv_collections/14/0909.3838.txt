A complete parton level analysis of ll + four jets l = e,mu and 3lv + two
jets production at the LHC is presented, including all processes at order
$\ordEW$, $\ordQCD$ and $\ordQCDsq$ when appropriate. The infinite Higgs mass
scenario, which is considered as a benchmark for strong scattering theories and
is the limiting case for composite Higgs models, and one example of a model
incorporating a Strongly Interacting Light Higgs are confronted with the
Standard Model light Higgs predictions. This analysis is combined with the
results in the lv + four jets channel presented in a previous paper, in order
to determine whether a composite Higgs signal can be detected as an excess of
events in boson--boson scattering.
