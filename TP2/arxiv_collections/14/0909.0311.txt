For multiphoton intensity-dependent Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), which is
described by two-level atom interacting with a radiation field, we prove that
there is a relationship between the atomic inversion and the quadrature
squeezing. We give the required condition to obtain best information from this
relation. Also we show that this relation is only sensitive to large values of
the detuning parameter. Furthermore, we discuss briefly such relation for the
off-resonance standard JCM.
