Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study contact between a rigid,
nonadhesive, spherical tip with radius of order 30nm and a flat elastic
substrate covered with a fluid monolayer of adsorbed chain molecules. Previous
studies of bare surfaces showed that the atomic scale deviations from a sphere
that are present on any tip constructed from discrete atoms lead to significant
deviations from continuum theory and dramatic variability in friction forces.
Introducing an adsorbed monolayer leads to larger deviations from continuum
theory, but decreases the variations between tips with different atomic
structure. Although the film is fluid, it remains in the contact and behaves
qualitatively like a thin elastic coating except for certain tips at high
loads. Measures of the contact area based on the moments or outer limits of the
pressure distribution and on counting contacting atoms are compared. The number
of tip atoms making contact in a time interval grows as a power of the interval
when the film is present and logarithmically with the interval for bare
surfaces. Friction is measured by displacing the tip at a constant velocity or
pulling the tip with a spring. Both static and kinetic friction rise linearly
with load at small loads. Transitions in the state of the film lead to
nonlinear behavior at large loads. The friction is less clearly correlated with
contact area than load.
