We discuss the aspects of the fermions and gauge bosons in $SU(4)_L \times
U(1)_X$ models with little Higgs. We introduce a set of fermions which ensures
the cancellation of gauge anomaly, and explicitly show the cancellation of
one-loop quadratic divergence to the Higgs mass from all fermion multiplets and
all gauge bosons. We present the interactions of the standard model fermions
with the physical gauge bosons. We also discuss some phenomenological
implications of the model based on recent experimental results.
