We study the stability of the dilute Bose-Fermi and Bose-Bose mixtures with
repulsive interactions in one and two dimensions in terms of the
renormalization group. For the Bose-Fermi mixture, we show that the uniform
mixture is stable against de-mixing in the dilute limit. For the Bose-Bose
mixture, we give the stability conditions in the dilute limit. As a byproduct,
we also calculate the critical temperature for the superfluid phase of the
two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture in the extremely dilute limit.
