We present a new Suzaku observation of the obscured AGN in NGC 1365,
revealing an unexpected excess of X-rays above 20 keV of at least a factor ~2
with respect to the extrapolation of the best-fitting 3-10 keV model.
Additional Swift-BAT and Integral-IBIS observations show that the 20-100 keV is
concentrated within ~1.5 arcmin from the center of the galaxy, and is not
significantly variable on time scales from days to years. A comparison of this
component with the 3-10 keV emission, which is characterized by a rapidly
variable absorption, suggests a complex structure of the circumnuclear medium,
consisting of at least two distinct components with rather different physical
properties, one of which covering >80% of the source with a column density
NH~3-4x10^24 cm^(-2). An alternative explanation is the presence of a double
active nucleus in the center of NGC 1365.
