ATLAS (Australia Telescope Large Area Survey) is a wide deep radio survey
which is distinguished by its comprehensive multi-wavelength approach. ATLAS is
creating a large dataset of radio-selected galaxies for studying the evolution
and inter-relationship of star-forming and active galaxies. Although the
project is far from complete, we are already starting to answer some of these
questions, and have stumbled across three surprises along the way: * FRI/FRII
radio-loud AGN embedded within spiral galaxies, * radio-bright AGN which are
unexpectedly faint in the infrared, and which may be at high redshift *
IR-luminous radio-quiet AGN which are partly responsible for the wide
variations in reported values of the radio-infrared ratio These and other
observations suggest that the AGN activity and star formation become
increasingly inter-dependent at high redshifts.
