Spectroscopic long-slit observations of the dwarf Irr galaxy IC 10 were
conducted at the 6-m Special Astrophysical Observatory telescope with the
SCORPIO focal reducer. The ionized-gas emission spectra in the regions of
intense current star formation were obtained for a large number of regions in
IC 10. The relative abundances of oxygen, N+, and S+ in about twenty HII
regions and in the synchrotron superbubble were estimated. We found that the
galaxy-averaged oxygen abundance is 12 + log(O/H) = 8.17 +- 0.35 and the
metallicity is Z = 0.18 +- 0.14 Z_sun. Our abundances estimated from the strong
emission lines are found to be more reliable than those obtained by comparing
diagnostic diagrams with photoionization models.
