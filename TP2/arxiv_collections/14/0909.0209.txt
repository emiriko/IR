We have investigated spin and orbital magnetic moments of the Re 5d ion in
the double perovskites A2FeReO6 (A = Ba, Sr, Ca) by X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD) at the Re L(2,3) edges. In these ferrimagnetic compounds an
unusually large negative spin and positive orbital magnetic moment at the Re
atoms was detected. The presence of a finite spin magnetic moment in a
'non-magnetic' double perovskite as observed in the double perovskite Sr2ScReO6
proves that Re has also a small, but finite intrinsic magnetic moment. We
further show for the examples of Ba and Ca that the usually neglected alkaline
earth ions undoubtedly also contribute to the magnetism in the ferrimagnetic
double perovskites.
