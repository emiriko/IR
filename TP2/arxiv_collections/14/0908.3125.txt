Dynamics of systems of structured particles consisting of potentially
interacting material points is considered in the framework of classical
mechanics. Equations of interaction and motion of structured particles have
been derived. The expression for friction force has been obtained. It has been
shown that irreversibility of dynamics of structured particles is caused by
increase of their internal energy due to the energy of motion. Possibility of
theoretical substantiation of the laws of thermodynamics has been considered.
