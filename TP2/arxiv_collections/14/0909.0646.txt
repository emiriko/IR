We demonstrate a method for time gating the standard heralded continuous-
wave (cw) spontaneous parametric down-converted (SPDC) single photon source by
using pulsed pumping of the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) below
threshold. The narrow bandwidth, high purity, high spectral brightness and the
pseudo-deterministic character make the source highly suitable for light-atom
interfaces with atomic memories.
