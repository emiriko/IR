There are significant advantages in combining Hinode observations with
ground-based instruments that can observe additional spectral diagnostics at
higher data rates and with greater flexibility. However, ground-based
observations, because of the random effects of weather and seeing as well as
the complexities data analysis due to changing instrumental configurations,
have traditionally been less efficient than satellite observations in producing
useful datasets. Future large ground-based telescopes will need to find new
ways to optimize both their operational efficiency and scientific output.
  We have begun experimenting with service-mode or queue-mode observations at
the Dunn Solar Telescope using the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer
(IBIS) as part of joint Hinode campaigns. We describe our experiences and the
advantages of such an observing mode for solar physics.
