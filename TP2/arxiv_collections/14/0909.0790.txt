We report on the kinetics of the inner ring in the exciton emission pattern.
The formation time of the inner ring following the onset of the laser
excitation is found to be about 30 ns. The inner ring was also found to
disappear within 4 ns after the laser termination. The latter process is
accompanied by a jump in the photoluminescence (PL) intensity. The spatial
dependence of the PL-jump indicates that the excitons outside of the region of
laser excitation, including the inner ring region, are efficiently cooled to
the lattice temperature even during the laser excitation. The ring formation
and disappearance are explained in terms of exciton transport and cooling.
