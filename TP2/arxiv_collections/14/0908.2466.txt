SU(3) gauge theory with overlap fermions in the 2-index symmetric (sextet)
and fundamental representations is considered. A priori it is not known what
the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is in a higher dimensional
representation although the general expectation is that if two representations
are both complex, the breaking pattern will be the same. This expectation is
verified for the sextet at N_f = 0 in several exact zero mode sectors. It is
shown that if the volume is large enough the same random matrix ensemble
describes both the sextet and fundamental Dirac eigenvalues. The number of zero
modes for the sextet increases approximately 5-fold relative to the fundamental
in accordance with the index theorem for small lattice spacing but zero modes
which do not correspond to integer topological charge do exist at larger
lattice spacings. The zero mode number dependence of the random matrix model
predictions correctly match the simulations in each sector and each
representation.
