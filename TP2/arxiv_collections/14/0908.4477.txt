The pressure-induced structural phase transition from diamond to beta-tin in
silicon is an excellent test for theoretical total energy methods. The
transition pressure provides a sensitive measure of small relative energy
changes between the two phases (one a semiconductor and the other a semimetal).
Experimentally, the transition pressure is well characterized.
Density-functional results have been unsatisfactory. Even the generally much
more accurate diffusion Monte Carlo method has shown a noticeable fixed-node
error. We use the recently developed phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte
Carlo (AFQMC) method to calculate the relative energy differences in the two
phases. In this method, all but the error due to the phaseless constraint can
be controlled systematically and driven to zero. In both structural phases we
were able to benchmark the error of the phaseless constraint by carrying out
exact unconstrained AFQMC calculations for small supercells. Comparison between
the two shows that the systematic error in the absolute total energies due to
the phaseless constraint is well within 0.5 mHa/atom. Consistent with these
internal benchmarks, the transition pressure obtained by the phaseless AFQMC
from large supercells is in very good agreement with experiment.
