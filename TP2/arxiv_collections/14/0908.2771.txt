In more than four spacetime dimensions, a multiple Weyl-aligned null
direction (WAND) need not be geodesic. It is proved that any higher-dimensional
Einstein spacetime admitting a non-geodesic multiple WAND also admits a
geodesic multiple WAND. All five-dimensional Einstein spacetimes admitting a
non-geodesic multiple WAND are determined.
