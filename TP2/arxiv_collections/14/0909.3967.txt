We analyse the internal dynamics of star-forming HII regions and their
efficiency in interacting with the ISM. We use GHaFaS (Fabry-Perot) data of the
nearby spiral galaxy M83 to perform multiple-Gaussian fitting to the integrated
Halpha emission line for 136 HII regions, advanced instrumental response
subtraction and to study the Luminosity-velocity dispersion relation. We find
that the best way of dealing with instrumental response effects is convolving
its actual shape with the Gaussian before fitting and that in our data almost
none of the regions need a secondary Gaussian.
