The neutron capture cross section of 14C is of relevance for several
nucleosynthesis scenarios such as inhomogeneous Big Bang models, neutron
induced CNO cycles, and neutrino driven wind models for the r process. The
14C(n,g) reaction is also important for the validation of the Coulomb
dissociation method, where the (n,g) cross section can be indirectly obtained
via the time-reversed process. So far, the example of 14C is the only case with
neutrons where both, direct measurement and indirect Coulomb dissociation, have
been applied. Unfortunately, the interpretation is obscured by discrepancies
between several experiments and theory. Therefore, we report on new direct
measurements of the 14C(n,g) reaction with neutron energies ranging from 20 to
800 keV.
