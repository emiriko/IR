We study a hydrodynamic limit approach to move-to-front rules, namely, a
scaling limit as the number of items tends to infinity, of the joint
distribution of jump rate and position of items. As an application of the limit
formula, we present asymptotic formulas on search cost probability
distributions, applicable for general jump rate distributions.
