Within the framework of QCD factorization (QCDF), power corrections due to
penguin annihilation can account for the observed rates of penguin-dominated
two-body decays of $B$ mesons and direct CP asymmetries $A_{CP}(K^-\pi^+)$,
$A_{CP}(K^{*-}\pi^+)$, $A_{CP}(K^-\rho^0)$ and $A_{CP}(\pi^+\pi^-)$. However,
the predicted direct CP-violating effects in QCDF for $B^-\to
K^-\pi^0,K^-\eta,\pi^-\eta$ and $\bar B^0\to\pi^0\pi^0$ are wrong in signs when
confronted with experiment. We show that subleading $1/m_b$ power corrections
to the color-suppressed tree amplitude due to spectator scattering or
final-state interactions will yield correct signs for aforementioned CP
asymmetries and accommodate the observed $\pi^0\pi^0$ and $\rho^0\pi^0$ rates
simultaneously. Implications are discussed.
