Two-dimensional spin-uncompensated momentum density distributions, $\rho_{\rm
s}^{2D}({\bf p})$s, were reconstructed in magnetite at 12K and 300K from
several measured directional magnetic Compton profiles. Mechanical de-twinning
was used to overcome severe twinning in the single crystal sample below the
Verwey transition. The reconstructed $\rho_{\rm s}^{2D}({\bf p})$ in the first
Brillouin zone changes from being negative at 300 K to positive at 12 K. This
result provides the first clear evidence that electrons with low momenta in the
minority spin bands in magnetite are localized below the Verwey transition
temperature.
