According to the locality postulate of special relativity, the measurements
of physical fields by accelerated observers at a given event in Minkowski
spacetime are related to each other by the representations of the Lorentz
group. Nonlocal extensions of these representations are necessary, however,
once acceleration-induced nonlocality is taken into account. The particular
case of Dirac spinors is treated in detail and the corresponding nonlocal
transformation group is studied.
