For a compact Kahler manifold X and a strongly primitive automorphism g of
positive entropy, it is shown that X has at most rank NS(X) of g-periodic prime
divisors B_i (i.e., g^s(B_i) = B_i for some s > 0). When X is a projective
threefold, every prime divisor containing infinitely many g-periodic curves, is
shown to be g-periodic itself (a result in the spirit of the Dynamic
Manin-Mumford conjecture).
