We provide a simple, unified proof of Birkhoff's theorem for the vacuum and
cosmological constant case, emphasizing its local nature. We discuss its
implications for the maximal analytic extensions of Schwarzschild,
Schwarzschild(-anti)-de Sitter and Nariai spacetimes. In particular, we note
that the maximal analytic extensions of extremal and over-extremal
Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes exhibit no static region. Hence the common
belief that Birkhoff's theorem implies staticity is false for the case of
positive cosmological constant. Instead, the correct point of view is that
generalized Birkhoff's theorems are local uniqueness theorems whose corollary
is that locally spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's equations exhibit
an additional local killing vector field.
