It is known that unstable periodic orbits of a given map give information
about the natural measure of a chaotic attractor. In this work we show how
these orbits can be used to calculate the density function of the first
Poincar\'e returns. The close relation between periodic orbits and the
Poincar\'e returns allows for estimates of relevant quantities in dynamical
systems, as the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, in terms of this density function.
Since return times can be trivially observed and measured, our approach to
calculate this entropy is highly oriented to the treatment of experimental
systems. We also develop a method for the numerical computation of unstable
periodic orbits.
