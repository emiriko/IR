We study the low-energy two-body scattering in optical lattices with all
higher-band effects included in an effective potential, using a renormalization
group approach. As the potential depth reaches a certain value, a resonance of
low energy scattering occurs even when the negative s-wave scattering length
$(a_s)$ is much shorter than the lattice constant. These resonances can be
mainly driven either by interband or intraband effects or by both, depending on
the magnitude of $a_s$. Furthermore the low-energy scattering matrix in optical
lattices has a much stronger energy-dependence than that in free space. We also
investigate the momentum distribution for molecules when released from optical
lattices.
