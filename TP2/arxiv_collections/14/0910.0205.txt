We derive an effective action for the vortex position degree-of-freedom in a
superfluid by integrating out condensate phase and density fluctuation
environmental modes. When the quantum dynamics of environmental fluctuations is
neglected, we confirm the occurrence of the vortex Magnus force and obtain an
expression for the vortex mass. We find that this adiabatic approximation is
valid only when the superfluid droplet radius $R$, or the typical distance
between vortices, is very much larger than the coherence length $\xi$. We go
beyond the adiabatic approximation numerically, accounting for the quantum
dynamics of environmental modes and capturing their dissipative coupling to
condensate dynamics. For the case of an optical-lattice superfluid we
demonstrate that vortex motion damping can be adjusted by tuning the ratio
between the tunneling energy $J$ and the on-site interaction energy $U$. We
comment on the possibility of realizing vortex Landau level physics.
