It is shown that the $n$-point functions of scalar massive free fields on the
noncommutative Minkowski space are distributions which are boundary values of
analytic functions. Contrary to what one might expect, this construction does
not provide a connection to the popular traditional Euclidean approach to
noncommutative field theory (unless the time variable is assumed to commute).
Instead, one finds Schwinger functions with twistings involving only momenta
that are on the mass-shell. This explains why renormalization in the
traditional Euclidean noncommutative framework crudely differs from
renormalization in the Minkowskian regime.
