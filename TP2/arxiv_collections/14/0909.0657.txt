We present a general framework, applicable to a broad class of random walks
on complex networks, which provides a rigorous lower bound for the mean
first-passage time of a random walker to a target site averaged over its
starting position, the so-called global mean first-passage time (GMFPT). This
bound is simply expressed in terms of the equilibrium distribution at the
target, and implies a minimal scaling of the GMFPT with the network size. We
show that this minimal scaling, which can be arbitrarily slow for a proper
choice of highly connected target, is realized under the simple condition that
the random walk is transient at the target site, and independently of the
small-world, scale free or fractal properties of the network. Last, we put
forward that the GMFPT to a specific target is not a representative property of
the network, since the target averaged GMFPT satisfies much more restrictive
bounds, which forbid any sublinear scaling with the network size.
