Magnetic properties of iron chalcogenide superconducting materials are
investigated using density functional calculations. We find the stability of
magnetic phases is very sensitive to the height of chalcogen species from the
Fe plane: while FeTe with optimized Te height has the double-stripe-type
$(\pi,0)$ magnetic ordering, the single-stripe-type $(\pi,\pi)$ ordering
becomes the ground state phase when Te height is lowered below a critical value
by, e.g., Se doping. This behavior is understood by opposite Te-height
dependences of the superexchange interaction and a longer-range magnetic
interaction mediated by itinerant electrons. We also demonstrate a linear
temperature dependence of the macroscopic magnetic susceptibility in the
single-stripe phase in contrast to a constant behavior in the double-stripe
phase. Our findings provide a comprehensive and unified view to understand the
magnetism in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ and iron pnictide superconductors.
