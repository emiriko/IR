We investigate the power-dependent photoluminescence spectra from a strongly
coupled quantum dot-cavity system using a quantum master equation technique
that accounts for incoherent pumping, pure dephasing, and fermion or boson
statistics. Analytical spectra at the one-photon correlation level and the
numerically exact multi-photon spectra for fermions are presented. We compare
to recent experiments on a quantum dot-micropiller cavity system and show that
an excellent fit to the data can be obtained by varying only the incoherent
pump rates in direct correspondence with the experiments. Our theory and
experiments together show a clear and systematic way of studying
stimulated-emission induced broadening and anharmonic cavity-QED.
