In this study, a possible non-quasiparticle glue for superconductivity of
both conventional and unconventional superconductors is explored in a pure
electron picture. It is shown clearly that the moving electrons due to the
electromagnetic interaction can self-organize into some quasi-one-dimensional
real-space charge stripes, which can further form some thermodynamically stable
vortex lattices with trigonal or tetragonal symmetry. The relationships among
the charge stripes, the Cooper pairs and the Peierls phase transition are
discussed. The suggested mechanism (glue) of the superconductivity may be valid
for the one- and two-dimensional superconductors. We also argue that the
highest critical temperature of the doped superconductors is most likely to be
achieved around the Mott metal-insulator transition.
