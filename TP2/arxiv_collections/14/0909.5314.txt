Within a covariant parton cascade, we discuss the impact of both finite shear
viscosity $\eta$ and freeze-out dynamics on the elliptic flow generated at
RHIC. We find that the enhancement of $\eta/s$ in the cross-over region of the
QGP phase transition cannot be neglected in order to extract the information
from the QGP phase. We also point out that the elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ for a
fluid at $\eta/s \sim 0.1-0.2$ is consistent with the one needed by quark
number scaling drawing a nice consistency between the nearly perfect fluid
property of QGP and the coalescence process.
