We study how many riffle shuffles are required to mix n cards if only certain
features of the deck are of interest, e.g. suits disregarded or only the colors
of interest. For these features, the number of shuffles drops from 3/2 log_2(n)
to log_2(n). We derive closed formulae and an asymptotic `rule of thumb'
formula which is remarkably accurate.
