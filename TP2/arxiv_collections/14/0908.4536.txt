Current status of (the lack of) understanding Blazhko effect is reviewed. We
focus mostly on the various components of the failure of the models and touch
upon the observational issues only at a degree needed for the theoretical
background. Attention is to be paid to models based on radial mode resonances,
since they seem to be not fully explored yet, especially if we consider
possible non-standard effects (e.g., heavy element enhancement). To aid further
modeling efforts, we stress the need for accurate time-series spectral line
analysis to reveal any possible non-radial component(s) and thereby let to
include (or exclude) non-radial modes in explaining the Blazhko phenomenon.
