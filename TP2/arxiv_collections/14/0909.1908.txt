Optical response of finite-length metallic carbon nanotubes is calculated
including effects of induced edge charges in a self-consistent manner. The
results show that the main resonance corresponding to excitation of the
fundamental plasmon mode with wave vector $\pi/l$ with $l$ being the tube
length is quite robust and unaffected. This arises because the strong electric
field associated with edge charges is screened and decays rapidly inside the
nanotube. For higher-frequency resonances, the field starts to be mixed and
tends to shift resonances to higher frequencies.
