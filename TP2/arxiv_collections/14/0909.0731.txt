Here I give some strong arguments that the central issues for theoretical
studies of the (tri)critical endpoint of the QCD phase diagram are the surface
tension of large/heavy QGP bags and their medium dependent width. Then I
discuss three major directions to further develop the realistic exactly
solvable statistical models which simultaneously are able to describe the 1-st
order deconfinement phase transition, the 2-nd order one and the cross-over.
Also I analyze the most necessary projects that have to be studied in order to
formulate the reliable and convincing signals of the mixed phase formation at
NICA energies.
