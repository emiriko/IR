We introduce the Richelot class of superintegrable systems in N-dimensions
whose n<=N equations of motion coincide with the Abel equations on n-1 genus
hyperellipic curve. The corresponding additional integrals of motion are the
second order polynomials of momenta and multiseparability of the Richelot
superintegrable systems is related with classical theory of covers of the
hyperelliptic curves.
