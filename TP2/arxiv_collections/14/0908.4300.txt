Using recently published, high-precision pi+pi- cross section data by the
BABAR experiment from the analysis of e+e- events with high-energy photon
radiation in the initial state, we reevaluate the lowest order hadronic
contribution a_mu[had,LO] to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We
employ newly developed software featuring improved data interpolation and
averaging, more accurate error propagation and systematic validation. With the
new data, the discrepancy between the e+e- and tau-based results for the
dominant two-pion mode reduces from previously 2.4 sigma to 1.5 sigma in the
dispersion integral, though significant local discrepancies in the spectra
persist. We obtain for the e+e- based evaluation amu[had,LO] = (695.5 +- 4.1)
10^-10, where the error accounts for all sources. The full Standard Model
prediction of a_mu differs from the experimental value by 3.2 sigma.
