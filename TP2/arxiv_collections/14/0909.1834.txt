We demonstrate serrodyne frequency shifting of light from 200 MHz to 1.2 GHz
with an efficiency of better than 60 percent. The frequency shift is imparted
by an electro-optic phase modulator driven by a high-frequency, high-fidelity
sawtooth waveform that is passively generated by a commercially available
Non-Linear Transmission Line (NLTL). We also implement a push-pull
configuration using two serrodyne-driven phase modulators allowing for
continuous tuning between -1.6 GHz and +1.6 GHz. Compared to competing
technologies, this technique is simple and robust, and offers the largest
available tuning range in this frequency band.
