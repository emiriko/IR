We present a realization of a quantum field theory, envisaged many years ago
by Gelfand, Tsetlin, Sokolik and Bilenky. Considering the special case of the
(1/2,0)+(0,1/2) field and developing the Majorana construct for neutrino we
show that a fermion and its antifermion can have the same properties with
respect to the intrinsic parity (P-) operation. The transformation laws for C-
and T- operations have also been given. The construct can be applied to
explanation of the present situation in neutrino physics. The case of the
(1,0)+ (0,1) field is also considered.
