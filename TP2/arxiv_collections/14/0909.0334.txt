In loop quantum cosmology there may be a super-inflation phase in the very
early universe, in which a single scalar field with a negative power-law
potential $V= -M^4(\phi/M)^\beta$ plays important roles. Since the effective
horizon $\sqrt{SD}/H$ controls the behavior of quantum fluctuation instead of
the usual Hubble horizon, we assume the following inflation scenario; the
super-inflation starts when the quantum state of the scalar field emerges into
the classical regime,and ends when the effective horizon becomes the Hubble
horizon, and the effective horizon scale never gets shorter than the Planck
length. From consistency with the WMAP 5-year data, we place a constraint on
the parameters of the potential ($\beta$ and $M$) and the energy density at the
end of the super-inflation, depending on the volume correction parameter $n$.
