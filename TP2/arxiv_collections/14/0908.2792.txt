We study dynamics of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate where the two
components are coupled via an optical lattice. In particular, we focus on the
dynamics as one drives the system through a critical point of a first order
phase transition characterized by a jump in the internal populations. Solving
the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we analyze; breakdown of
adiabaticity, impact of non-linear atom-atom scattering, and the role of a
harmonic trapping potential. Our findings demonstrate that the phase transition
is resilient to both contact interaction between atoms and external trapping
confinement.
