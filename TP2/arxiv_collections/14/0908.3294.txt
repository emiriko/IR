Structures were calculated for Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon, and Mars,
using a core-mantle model and adjusting the core radius to reproduce the
observed mass and diameter of each body. Structures were calculated using Fe
and basalt equations of state of different degrees of sophistication for the
core and mantle. The choice of equation of state had a significant effect on
the inferred structure. For each structure, the moment of inertia ratio was
calculated and compared with observed values. Linear Grueneisen equations of
state fitted to limited portions of shock data reproduced the observed moments
of inertia significantly better than did more detailed equations of state
incorporating phase transitions, presumably reflecting the actual compositions
of the bodies. The linear Grueneisen equations of state and corresponding
structures seem however to be a reasonable starting point for comparative
simulations of large-scale astrophysical impacts.
