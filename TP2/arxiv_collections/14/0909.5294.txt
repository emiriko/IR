We present a first-principles density functional study of the structural,
electronic and magnetic properties of the ferroelectric domain walls in
multiferroic BiFeO3. We find that domain walls in which the rotations of the
oxygen octahedra do not change their phase when the polarization reorients are
the most favorable, and of these the 109 degree domain wall centered around the
BiO plane has the lowest energy. The 109 degree and 180 degree walls have a
significant change in the component of their polarization perpendicular to the
wall; the corresponding step in the electrostatic potential is consistent with
a recent report of electrical conductivity at the domain walls. Finally, we
show that changes in the Fe-O-Fe bond angles at the domain walls cause changes
in the canting of the Fe magnetic moments which can enhance the local
magnetization at the domain walls.
