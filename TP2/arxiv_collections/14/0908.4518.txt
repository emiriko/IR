The rates at which the mass and angular momentum of a small black hole change
as a result of a tidal interaction with a much larger black hole are calculated
to leading order in the small mass ratio. The small black hole is either
rotating or nonrotating, and it moves on a circular orbit in the equatorial
plane of the large Kerr black hole. The orbits are fully relativistic, and the
rates are computed to all orders in the orbital velocity V < V_{isco}, which is
limited only by the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We show that
as V \to V_{isco}, the rates take on a limiting value that depends only on
V_{isco} and not on the spin parameter of the large black hole.
