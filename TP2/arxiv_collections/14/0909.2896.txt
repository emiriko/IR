We consider synchronization of coupled chaotic systems and propose an
adaptive strategy that aims at evolving the strength of the coupling to achieve
stability of the synchronized evolution. We test this idea in a simple
configuration in which two chaotic systems are unidirectionally coupled (a
sender and a receiver) and we study conditions for the receiver to adaptively
synchronize with the sender. Numerical simulations show that, under certain
conditions, our strategy is successful in dynamically evolving the coupling
strength until it converges to a value that is compatible with synchronization.
