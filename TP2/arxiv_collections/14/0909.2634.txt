Calibrated data for 143 flat-spectrum extragalactic radio sources are
presented at a wavelength of 850 microns covering a five-year period from April
2000. The data, obtained at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope using the SCUBA
camera in pointing mode, were analysed using an automated pipeline process
based on the Observatory Reduction and Acquisition Control - Data Reduction
(ORAC-DR) system. This paper describes the techniques used to analyse and
calibrate the data, and presents the database of results along with a
representative sample of the better-sampled lightcurves. A re-analysis of
previously published data from 1997 to 2000 is also presented. The combined
catalogue, comprising 10493 flux density measurements, provides a unique and
valuable resource for studies of extragalactic radio sources.
