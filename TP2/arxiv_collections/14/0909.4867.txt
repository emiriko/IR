We present the results for the pion electromagnetic quadrupole
polarizabilities, calculated within the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We obtain
the sign and magnitude in agreement with the respective experimental analysis
based on the Dispersion Sum Rules. At the same time the dipole polarizabilities
are well reproduced. Comparison is also made with the results from the Chiral
Perturbation Theory.
