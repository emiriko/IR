We consider an integrable generalization of the sine-Gordon (sG) equation
that was earlier derived by one of the authors using bi-Hamiltonian methods.
This equation is related to the sG equation in the same way that the
Camassa-Holm equation is related to the KdV equation. In this paper we: (a)
Derive a Lax pair. (b) Use the Lax pair to solve the initial value problem on
the line. (c) Analyze solitons. (d) Show that the generalized sG and sG
equations are related by a Liouville transformation. (e) Derive conservation
laws. (f) Analyze traveling-wave solutions.
