We consider complete synchronization of identical maps coupled through a
general interaction function and in a general network topology where the edges
may be directed and may carry both positive and negative weights. We define
mixed transverse exponents and derive sufficient conditions for local complete
synchronization. The general non-diffusive coupling scheme can lead to new
synchronous behavior, in networks of identical units, that cannot be produced
by single units in isolation. In particular, we show that synchronous chaos can
emerge in networks of simple units. Conversely, in networks of chaotic units
simple synchronous dynamics can emerge; that is, chaos can be suppressed
through synchrony.
