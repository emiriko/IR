Our knowledge about the chemical evolution of the more luminous dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies is constantly growing. However, little is known
about the enrichment of the ultrafaint systems recently discovered in large
numbers in large Sky Surveys. Low-resolution spectroscopy and photometric data
indicate that these galaxies are predominantly metal-poor. On the other hand,
the most recent high-resolution abundance analyses indicate that some of these
galaxies experienced highly inhomogenous chemical enrichment, where star
formation proceeds locally on the smallest scales. Furthermore, these
galaxy-contenders appear to contain very metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]<-3 dex
and could be the sites of the first stars. Here, we consider the presently
available chemical abundance information of the (ultra-) faint Milky Way
satellite dSphs. In this context, some of the most peculiar element and
inhomogeneous enrichment patterns will be discussed and related to the question
of to what extent the faintest dSph candidates and outer halo globular clusters
could have contributed to the metal-poor Galactic halo.
