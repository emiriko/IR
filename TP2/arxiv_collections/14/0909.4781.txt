Standard model of solar flares comprises a bulk expansion and rise of
abruptly heated plasma (the chromospheric evaporation). Emission from plasma
ascending along loops rooted on the visible solar disk should be often
dominated, at least temporally, by a blue-shifted emission. However, there is
only a very limited number of published observations of solar flares having
spectra in which the blue-shifted component dominates the stationary one. In
this work we compare observed X-ray spectra of three solar flares recorded
during their impulsive phases and relevant synthetic spectra calculated using
one-dimensional hydro-dynamic numerical model of these flares. The main aim of
the work was to explain why numerous flares do not show blue-shifted spectra.
The synthesized BCS spectra of the flares were compared with the relevant
observed BCS spectra. We conclude that stationary component of the spectrum
should be observed almost for all flares during their early phases of
evolution. In opposite, the blue-shifted component of the spectrum could be not
detected in flares having plasma rising along the flaring loop even with high
velocity due to the geometrical dependences only. After the start of the
up-flow motion, the blue-shifted component dominate temporally the synthetic
spectra of the investigated flares at their early phases.
