The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method for constraining the expansion
history is adversely affected by non-linear structure formation, which washes
out the correlation function peak created at decoupling. To increase the
constraining power of low z BAO experiments, it has been proposed that one use
the observed distribution of galaxies to "reconstruct'' the acoustic peak.
Recently Padmanabhan, White and Cohn provided an analytic formalism for
understanding how reconstruction works within the context of Lagrangian
perturbation theory. We extend that formalism to include the case of biased
tracers of the mass and, because the quantitative validity of LPT is
questionable, we investigate reconstruction in N-body simulations. We find that
LPT does a good job of explaining the trends seen in simulations for both the
mass and for biased tracers and comment upon the implications this has for
reconstruction.
