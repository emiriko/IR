While it is well known that neutrinos are emitted from standard core collapse
protoneutron star supernovae, less attention has been focused on neutrinos from
accretion disks. These disks occur in some supernovae (i.e. "collapsars") as
well as in compact object mergers, and they emit neutrinos with similar
properties to those from protoneutron star supernovae. These disks and their
neutrinos play an important role in our understanding of gamma ray bursts as
well as the nucleosynthesis they produce. We study a disk that forms in the
merger of a black hole and a neutron star and examine the neutrino fluxes,
luminosities and neutrino surfaces for the disk. We also estimate the number of
events that would be registered in current and proposed supernova neutrino
detectors if such an event were to occur in the Galaxy.
