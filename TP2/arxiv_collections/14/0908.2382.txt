A brief overview of direct-photon measurements in p+p and Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV with the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) is given. Direct-photon yields for pT > 4 GeV/c and
photon-hadron azimuthal correlations were determined with the aid of an
electromagnetic calorimeter. By detecting e+e- pairs from the internal
conversion of virtual photons direct-photon yields were measured between 1 < pT
< 4 GeV/c. In Au+Au collisions thermal photons from a quark-gluon plasma (QGP)
are expected to contribute significantly to the total direct-photon yield in
this range.
