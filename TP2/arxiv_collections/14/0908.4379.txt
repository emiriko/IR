We propose two improved parameterized form for the growth index of the linear
matter perturbations: (I) $\gamma(z)=\gamma_0+(\gamma_{\infty}-\gamma_0){z\over
z+1}$ and (II) $\gamma(z)=\gamma_0+\gamma_1
\frac{z}{z+1}+(\gamma_{\infty}-\gamma_1-\gamma_0)(\frac{z}{z+1})^{\alpha}$.
With these forms of $\gamma(z)$, we analyze the accuracy of the approximation
the growth factor $f$ by $\Omega^{\gamma(z)}_m$ for both the $\omega$CDM model
and the DGP model. For the first improved parameterized form, we find that the
approximation accuracy is enhanced at the high redshifts for both kinds of
models, but it is not at the low redshifts. For the second improved
parameterized form, it is found that $\Omega^{\gamma(z)}_m$ approximates the
growth factor $f$ very well for all redshifts. For chosen $\alpha$, the
relative error is below 0.003% for the $\Lambda$CDM model and 0.028% for the
DGP model when $\Omega_{m}=0.27$. Thus, the second improved parameterized form
of $\gamma(z)$ should be useful for the high precision constraint on the growth
index of different models with the observational data. Moreover, we also show
that $\alpha$ depends on the equation of state $\omega$ and the fractional
energy density of matter $\Omega_{m0}$, which may help us learn more
information about dark energy and DGP models.
