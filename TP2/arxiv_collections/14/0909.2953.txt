Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are materials with a great potential for future
use in smart materials and structures. When heated from cold state (below the
transformation temperature, which can either be the glass transition
temperature or the melting temperature of the polymer) to hot state (above the
transformation temperature) they undergo transformation which can be compared
with martensitic transformation of shape memory alloys. This process induces
great changes of the mechanical properties and some shape memory phenomenon can
be observed. This study is an experimental evaluation of the mechanical
properties of SMP Veriflex under different test conditions. Veriflex was chosen
because of its easy accessibility. Furthermore its properties are similar to
epoxy resins which make it very suitable for usage in a wide variety of
technical applications. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to determine
evolution of the viscoelastic properties versus temperature and frequency under
cyclic harmonic loading. The glass transition temperature clearly appears in a
range from 45\degree C to 60\degree C depending on loading frequency. The glass
transition is noticeably marked by an impressive decrease in the storage
modulus of about 4 decades. The master curve of Veriflex was created and allows
the time-temperature superposition to be constructed for this material.
Thermo-mechanical working cycle of SMP with 100% elongation was also
experimentally tested. Finally results from all these experimental
investigations were used to design a demonstrator showing the possibility of
application in engineering and especially for shape control.
