We present a new joint longitudinal and survival model aimed at estimating
the association between the risk of an event and the change in and history of a
biomarker that is repeatedly measured over time. We use cubic B-splines models
for the longitudinal component that lend themselves to straight-forward
formulations of the slope and integral of the trajectory of the biomarker. The
model is applied to data collected in a long term follow-up study of HIV
infected infants in Uganda. Estimation is carried out using MCMC methods. We
also explore using the deviance information criteria, the conditional
predictive ordinate and ROC curves for model selection and evaluation.
