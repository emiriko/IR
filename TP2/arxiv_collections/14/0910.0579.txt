We present new results on X-ray properties of radio loud broad absorption
line (BAL) quasars and focus on broad-band spectral properties of a high
ionization BAL (HiBAL) compact steep spectrum (CSS) radio-loud quasar 1045+352.
This HiBAL quasar has a very complex radio morphology indicating either strong
interactions between a radio jet and the surrounding interstellar medium or a
possible re-start of the jet activity. We detected 1045+352 quasar in a short 5
ksec Chandra ACIS-S observation. We applied theoretical models to explain
spectral energy distribution (SED) of 1045+352 and argue that non-thermal,
inverse-Compton emission from the innermost parts of the radio jet can account
for a large fraction of the observed X-ray emission. In our analysis we also
consider a scenario in which the observed X-ray emission from radio-loud BAL
quasars can be a sum of inverse-Compton jet X-ray emission and optically thin
corona X-ray emission. We compiled a sample of radio-loud BAL quasars that were
observed in X-rays to date and report no correlation between their X-ray and
radio luminosity. However, the radio-loud BAL quasars show a large range of
X-ray luminosities and absorption columns. This is consistent with the results
obtained earlier for radio-quiet BAL quasars and may indicate an orientation
effect in BAL quasars or more complex dependence between X-ray emission, radio
emission and an orientation based on the radio morphology.
