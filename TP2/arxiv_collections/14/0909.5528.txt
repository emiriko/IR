Modification of large water Cherenkov detectors by addition of gadolinium has
been proposed. The large cross section for neutron capture on Gd will greatly
improve the sensitivity to antielectron neutrinos from supernovae and reactors.
A five-year project to build and develop a prototype detector based on
Super-Kamiokande (SK) has started. We are performing various studies, including
a material soak test in Gd solution, light attenuation length measurements,
purification system development, and neutron tagging efficiency measurements
using SK data and a Geant4-based simulation. We present an overview of the
project and the recent R&D results.
