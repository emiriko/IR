Density of states, dynamic (optical) conductivity and phase diagram of
paramagnetic two-dimensional Anderson-Hubbard model with strong correlations
and disorder are analyzed within the generalized dynamical mean-field theory
(DMFT+Sigma approximation). Strong correlations are accounted by DMFT, while
disorder is taken into account via the appropriate generalization of the
self-consistent theory of localization. We consider the two-dimensional system
with the rectangular "bare" density of states (DOS). The DMFT effective single
impurity problem is solved by numerical renormalization group (NRG). Phases of
"correlated metal", Mott insulator and correlated Anderson insulator are
identified from the evolution of density of states, optical conductivity and
localization length, demonstrating both Mott-Hubbard and Anderson
metal-insulator transitions in two-dimensional systems of the finite size,
allowing us to construct the complete zero-temperature phase diagram of
paramagnetic Anderson-Hubbard model. Localization length in our approximation
is practically independent of the strength of Hubbard correlations. However,
the divergence of localization length in finite size two-dimensional system at
small disorder signifies the existence of an effective Anderson transition.
