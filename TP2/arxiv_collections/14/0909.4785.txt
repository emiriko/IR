We present a detailed study of the radial distribution of the multiple
populations identified in the Galactic globular cluster omega Cen. We used both
space-based images (ACS/WFC and WFPC2) and ground-based images (FORS1@VLT and
WFI@2.2m ESO telescopes) to map the cluster from the inner core to the
outskirts (~20 arcmin). These data sets have been used to extract high-accuracy
photometry for the construction of color-magnitude diagrams and astrometric
positions of ~900 000 stars. We find that in the inner ~2 core radii the blue
main sequence (bMS) stars slightly dominate the red main sequence (rMS) in
number. At greater distances from the cluster center, the relative numbers of
bMS stars with respect to rMS drop steeply, out to ~8 arcmin, and then remain
constant out to the limit of our observations. We also find that the dispersion
of the Gaussian that best fits the color distribution within the bMS is
significantly greater than the dispersion of the Gaussian that best fits the
color distribution within the rMS. In addition, the relative number of
intermediate-metallicity red-giant-branch stars which includes the progeny of
the bMS) with respect to the metal-poor component (the progeny of the rMS)
follows a trend similar to that of the main-sequence star-count ratio
N_bMS/N_rMS. The most metal-rich component of the red-giant branch follows the
same distribution as the intermediate-metallicity component. We briefly discuss
the possible implications of the observed radial distribution of the different
stellar components in omega Cen.
