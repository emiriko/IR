Solar gravity modes (or g modes) -- oscillations of the solar interior for
which buoyancy acts as the restoring force -- have the potential to provide
unprecedented inference on the structure and dynamics of the solar core,
inference that is not possible with the well observed acoustic modes (or p
modes). The high amplitude of the g-mode eigenfunctions in the core and the
evanesence of the modes in the convection zone make the modes particularly
sensitive to the physical and dynamical conditions in the core. Owing to the
existence of the convection zone, the g modes have very low amplitudes at
photospheric levels, which makes the modes extremely hard to detect. In this
paper, we review the current state of play regarding attempts to detect g
modes. We review the theory of g modes, including theoretical estimation of the
g-mode frequencies, amplitudes and damping rates. Then we go on to discuss the
techniques that have been used to try to detect g modes. We review results in
the literature, and finish by looking to the future, and the potential advances
that can be made -- from both data and data-analysis perspectives -- to give
unambiguous detections of individual g modes. The review ends by concluding
that, at the time of writing, there is indeed a consensus amongst the authors
that there is currently no undisputed detection of solar g modes.
