This paper presents a snapshot of the field of $\gamma$-ray astrophysics in
the early summer of 2009, as it was discussed in about 200 presentations at the
International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC) held in {\L}\'{o}d\'{z}, Poland.
This is the written wrap up of a Rapporteur, one-hour talk and as such it is
thus an atypical review, a still picture in a moment of great advancement in an
observationally driven field, led by the full operation of ground-based arrays
and the launch and operations of Fermi and Agile.
