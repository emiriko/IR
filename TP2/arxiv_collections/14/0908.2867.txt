An investigation of an optimal universal unitary Controlled-NOT gate that
performs a specific operation on two unknown states of qubits taken from a
great circle of the Bloch sphere is presented. The deep analogy between the
optimal universal C-NOT gate and the `equatorial' quantum cloning machine (QCM)
is shown. In addition, possible applications of the universal C-NOT gate are
briefly discussed.
