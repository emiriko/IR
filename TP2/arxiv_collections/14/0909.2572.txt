In this chapter I will review the status of our phenomenological
understanding of the relation between accretion and outflows in accreting black
hole systems. This understanding arises primarily from observing the relation
between X-ray and longer wavelength (infrared, radio) emission. The view is
necessarily a biased one, beginning with observations of X-ray binary systems,
and attempting to see if they match with the general observational properties
of active galactic nuclei.
