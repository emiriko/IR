We present numerical simulations as well as experimental results concerning
transitions between Taylor vortices and spiral vortices in the Taylor-Couette
system with rigid, non-rotating end-walls in axial direction. As in the axial
periodic case, these transitions are performed by wavy structures appearing via
a secondary bifurcation out of Taylor vortices and spirals, respectively. But
in the presence of rigid lids, pure spiral solutions do not occur but are
substituted by primary bifurcating, stable wavy spiral structures (wSPI).
Similarly to the periodic system, we found a transition from Taylor vortices to
wSPI mediated by so called wavy Taylor vortices (wTVF) and, on the other hand,
a transition from wSPI to TVF triggered by a propagating defect. We furthermore
observed and investigated the primary bifurcation of wSPI out of basic Ekman
flow.
