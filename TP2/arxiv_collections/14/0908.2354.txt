We review some of our recent results (with collaborators) on information
processing in an ordered linear spaces framework for probabilistic theories.
These include demonstrations that many "inherently quantum" phenomena are in
reality quite general characteristics of non-classical theories, quantum or
otherwise. As an example, a set of states in such a theory is broadcastable if,
and only if, it is contained in a simplex whose vertices are cloneable, and
therefore distinguishable by a single measurement. As another example,
information that can be obtained about a system in this framework without
causing disturbance to the system state, must be inherently classical. We also
review results on teleportation protocols in the framework, and the fact that
any non-classical theory without entanglement allows exponentially secure bit
commitment in this framework. Finally, we sketch some ways of formulating our
framework in terms of categories, and in this light consider the relation of
our work to that of Abramsky, Coecke, Selinger, Baez and others on information
processing and other aspects of theories formulated categorically.
