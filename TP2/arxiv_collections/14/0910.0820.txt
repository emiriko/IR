Zoonosis refers to the transmission of infectious diseases from animal to
human. The increasing number of zoonosis incidence makes the great losses to
lives, including humans and animals, and also the impact in social economic. It
motivates development of a system that can predict the future number of
zoonosis occurrences in human. This paper analyses and presents the use of
Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) method for
developing a forecasting model that able to support and provide prediction
number of zoonosis human incidence. The dataset for model development was
collected on a time series data of human tuberculosis occurrences in United
States which comprises of fourteen years of monthly data obtained from a study
published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Several trial
models of SARIMA were compared to obtain the most appropriate model. Then,
diagnostic tests were used to determine model validity. The result showed that
the SARIMA(9,0,14)(12,1,24)12 is the fittest model. While in the measure of
accuracy, the selected model achieved 0.062 of Theils U value. It implied that
the model was highly accurate and a close fit. It was also indicated the
capability of final model to closely represent and made prediction based on the
tuberculosis historical dataset.
