Extragalactic Type II Cepheids are tentatively identified in photometric
surveys of IC 1613, M33, M101, M106, M31, NGC 4603, and the SMC. Preliminary
results suggest that Type II Cepheids may play an important role as standard
candles, in constraining the effects of metallicity on Cepheid parameters, and
in mapping extinction.
