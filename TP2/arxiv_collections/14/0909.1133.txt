We report a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of near
resonance light scattering from a high-density and ultracold atomic $^{87}$Rb
gas. The atomic sample, having a peak density $\sim 5\cdot10^{13}$
atoms/cm$^{3}$, temperature $\sim$ 65 $\mu$K and initially prepared in the F =
1 lower energy $^{87}$Rb hyperfine component, is optically pumped to the higher
energy F = 2 hyperfine level. Measurements are made of the transient hyperfine
pumping process and of the time evolution of scattering of near resonance probe
radiation on the $F = 2 \rightarrow F' = 3$ transition. Features of the
density, detuning, and temporal dependence of the signals are attributed to the
high density and consequent large optical depth of the samples.
