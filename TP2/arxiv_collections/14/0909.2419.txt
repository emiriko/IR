Equilibrium properties of non-uniform diamagnetic phase in normal metals
(Condon domains) are studied theoretically in the framework of
Lifschitz-Kosevich-Shoenberg (LKS) approximation. It is found that
characteristic diamagnetic lengths of the phase, e. g. a period of domain
structure and width of interface boundary between domains, as well as specific
surface energy of domain wall, are strongly affected by electron correlations
and depend on temperature, magnetic field and purity of the sample. The
developed theory is in a good agreement with existent experiment data.
