Penrose described a process that, in principle, could extract energy and
angular momentum from a rotating black hole. Here we examine two procedures
that were claimed to be capable of implementing the Penrose idea; both make use
of a particle moving at the horizon. In one, the particle is swallowed, and in
the other the particle and black hole gradually exchange energy and angular
momentum. We show that if the particle has negative energy and negative angular
momentum but no radial momentum both procedures violate the requirement that
the area of a black hole not decrease. For the gradual exchange method,
however, it appears that the Penrose process could proceed if the particle has
positive energy and angular momentum, but nevertheless removes energy from the
black hole. It does not, however, lead to a Schwarzschild black hole. For an
extreme Kerr black hole it's mass decreases by at most 9.7%, well short of the
theoretical limit for a reversible process of 1-1/sqrt{2} =29%.
