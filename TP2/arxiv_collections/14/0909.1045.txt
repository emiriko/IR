GSM networks are very expensive. The network design process requires too many
decisions in a combinatorial explosion. For this reason, the larger is the
network, the harder is to achieve a totally human based optimized solution. The
BSC (Base Station Control) nodes have to be geographically well allocated to
reduce the transmission costs. There are decisions of association between BTS
and BSC those impacts in the correct dimensioning of these BSC. The choice of
BSC quantity and model capable of carrying the cumulated traffic of its
affiliated BTS nodes in turn reflects on the total cost. In addition, the last
component of the total cost is due to transmission for linking BSC nodes to
MSC. These trunks have a major significance since the number of required E1
lines is larger than BTS to BSC link. This work presents an integer programming
model and a computational tool for designing GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications) networks, regarding BSS (Base Station Subsystem) with optimized
cost.
