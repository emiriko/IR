We suggest an approach to use memristors (resistors with memory) in
programmable analog circuits. Our idea consists in a circuit design in which
low voltages are applied to memristors during their operation as analog circuit
elements and high voltages are used to program the memristor's states. This
way, as it was demonstrated in recent experiments, the state of memristors does
not essentially change during analog mode operation. As an example of our
approach, we have built several programmable analog circuits demonstrating
memristor-based programming of threshold, gain and frequency.
