A one-loop effective potential of the Higgs field on the Schwarzschild
background is derived in the framework of a toy model: a SO(N) scalar multiplet
interacting with the gauge fields, the SO(N) gauge symmetry being broken by the
Higgs mechanism. As expected, the potential depends on the space point and
results in a mass shift of all massive particles near a black hole. It is shown
that the obtained potential depends on the space point through the metric
component $g_{00}$ in the adapted coordinates and has the same form for an
arbitrary static, spherically symmetric background. Some properties of this
potential are investigated. In particular, if the conformal symmetry holds
valid for massless particles on the given background, there exist only two
possible scenarios depending on a sign of an arbitrary constant arising from
the regularization procedure: the masses of all massive particles grow
infinitely when they approach the black hole horizon, or the gauge symmetry is
restored at a finite distance from the horizon and all particles become
massless. If the conformal symmetry is spoiled, an additional term in the
effective potential appears and the intermediate regime arises. Several
normalization conditions fixing the undefined constants are proposed, and
estimations for the mass shifts are given in these cases.
