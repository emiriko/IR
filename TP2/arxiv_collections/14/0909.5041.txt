When placed on rough hydrophobic surfaces, water droplets of diameter larger
than a few millimeters can easily form pearls, as they are in the Cassie-Baxter
state with air pockets trapped underneath the droplet. Intriguingly, a natural
evaporating process can drive such a Fakir drop into a completely wetting
(Wenzel) state. Our microscopic observations with simultaneous side and bottom
views of evaporating droplets upon transparent hydrophobic microstructures
elucidate the water-filling dynamics and the mechanism of this
evaporation-triggered transition. For the present material the wetting
transition occurs when the water droplet size decreases to a few hundreds of
micrometers in radius. We present a general global energy argument which
estimates the interfacial energies depending on the drop size and can account
for the critical radius for the transition.
