In this work some possible applications of negative permeability magnetic
metamaterial lenses for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are analyzed.
Metamaterials are artificial composites designed to have a given permittivity
and/or permeability, including negative values for these constants. It is shown
that using magnetic metamaterials lenses it is possible to manipulate the
spatial distribution of the radio-frequency (RF) field used in MR systems and,
under some circumstances, improve the sensitivity of surface coils. Furthermore
a collimation of the RF field, phenomenon that may find application in parallel
imaging, is presented. MR images of real tissues are shown in order to prove
the suitability of the theoretical analysis for practical applications.
