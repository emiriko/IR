Ideas about how to increase the unconscious participation in interaction
between 'a human' and 'a computer' are developed in this paper. Evidence of
impact of the unconscious functioning is presented. The unconscious is
characterised as being a responsive, contextual, and autonomous participant of
human-computer interaction. The unconscious participation occurs independently
of one's cognitive and educational levels and, if ignored, leads to learning
inefficiencies and compulsive behaviours, illustrations of which are provided.
Three practical approaches to a study of subjective user experience are
outlined as follows: (a) tracing operant conditioning effects of software, (b)
registering signs of brain activity psychological or information processing
meaning of which is well-explored and (c) exploring submodality interfaces.
Implications for improvement of current usability study methods, such as
eye-tracking, are generally considered. Conclusions consider advantages and
disadvantages of unconscious-embracing design and remind about a loss of human
evolutionary choices if unconscious participation is ignored, complicated or
blocked in interaction with computer interfaces and built environment.
