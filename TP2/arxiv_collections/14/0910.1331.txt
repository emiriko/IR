The Crystal Ball at MAMI setup offers an excellent possibility to study
decays of the eta and eta' meson. Here, recent results of the Crystal Ball at
MAMI experiment from eta meson decays are presented. Furthermore, future
perspectives of this experiment in the field of eta and eta' physics are
described.
