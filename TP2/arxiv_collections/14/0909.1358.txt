We present the results of Suzaku observation of the radio halo cluster Abell
2319. The metal abundance in the central cool region is found to be higher than
the surrounding region, which was not resolved in the former studies. We
confirm that the line-of-sight velocities of the intracluster medium in the
observed region are consistent with those of the member galaxies of entire
A2319 and A2319A subgroup for the first time, though any velocity difference
within the region is not detected. On the other hand, we do not find any signs
of gas motion relevant to A2319B subgroup. Hard X-ray emission from the cluster
is clearly detected, but its spectrum is likely thermal. Assuming a simple
single temperature model for the thermal component, we find that the upper
limit of the non-thermal inverse Compton component becomes $2.6 \times
10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 10-40 keV band, which means that the
lower limit of the magnetic field is 0.19 $\mu$G with the radio spectral index
0.92. Although the results slightly depend on the detailed spectral modeling,
it is robust that the upper limit of the power-law component flux and lower
limit of the magnetic field strength become $\sim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\sim 0.2 \mu$G, respectively. Considering the lack of a
significant amount of very hot ($\sim 20$ keV) gas and the strong bulk flow
motion, it is more likely that the relativistic non-thermal electrons
responsible for the radio halo are accelerated through the intracluster
turbulence rather than the shocks.
