We investigate the relationship between the mass of a globular cluster core
and the sizes of its various stellar populations in a sample of 56 globular
clusters. The number of core red giant branch stars is found to scale
sub-linearly with core mass at the 3-$\sigma$ confidence level, whereas the
relation is linear to within one standard deviation for main-sequence turn-off
and sub-giant branch stars. We interpret our results as evidence for a surplus
of red giant branch stars in the least massive cluster cores which is not seen
for main-sequence turn-off and sub-giant branch stars. We explore various
possibilities for the source of this discrepancy, discussing our results
primarily in terms of the interplay between the cluster dynamics and stellar
evolution.
