We investigate nuclear matter at finite temperature and density, including
the formation of light clusters up to the alpha particle The novel feature of
this work is to include the formation of clusters as well as their dissolution
due to medium effects in a systematic way using two many-body theories: a
microscopic quantum statistical (QS) approach and a generalized relativistic
mean field (RMF) model. Nucleons and clusters are modified by medium effects.
Both approaches reproduce the limiting cases of nuclear statistical equilibrium
(NSE) at low densities and cluster-free nuclear matter at high densities. The
treatment of the cluster dissociation is based on the Mott effect due to Pauli
blocking, implemented in slightly different ways in the QS and the generalized
RMF approaches. We compare the numerical results of these models for cluster
abundances and thermodynamics in the region of medium excitation energies with
temperatures T <= 20 MeV and baryon number densities from zero to a few times
saturation density. The effect of cluster formation on the liquid-gas phase
transition and on the density dependence of the symmetry energy is studied.
Comparison is made with other theoretical approaches, in particular those,
which are commonly used in astrophysical calculations. The results are relevant
for heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical applications.
