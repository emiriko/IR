Broadening of the Landau levels in graphene and the associated quantum Hall
plateau-to-plateau transition are investigated numerically. For correlated bond
disorder, the graphene-specific n=0 Landau level of the Dirac fermions becomes
anomalously sharp accompanied by the Hall transition exhibiting a
fixed-point-like criticality. Similarly anomalous behavior for the n=0 Landau
level is also shown to occur in correlated random magnetic fields, which
suggests that the anomaly is generic to disorders that preserve the chiral
symmetry.
