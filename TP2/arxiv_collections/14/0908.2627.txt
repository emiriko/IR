We identify ten -- seven for the first time -- elements of cold halo
substructure (ECHOS) in the volume within 17.5 kpc of the Sun in the inner halo
of the Milky Way. Our result is based on the observed spatial and radial
velocity distribution of metal-poor main sequence turnoff (MPMSTO) stars in 137
Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) lines of
sight. We point out that the observed radial velocity distribution is
consistent with a smooth stellar component of the Milky Way's inner halo
overall, but disagrees significantly at the radial velocities that correspond
to our detections. We show that all of our detections are statistically
significant and that we expect no false positives. We also use our detections
and completeness estimates to infer a formal upper limit of 0.34 +/- 0.02 on
the fraction of the MPMSTO population in the inner halo that belong to ECHOS.
Our detections and completeness calculations suggest that there is a
significant population of low fractional overdensity ECHOS in the inner halo,
and we predict that 1/3 of the inner halo (by volume) harbors ECHOS with MPMSTO
star number densities n ~ 15 kpc^-3. ECHOS are likely older than known surface
brightness substructure, so our detections provide us with a direct measure of
the accretion history of the Milky Way in a region and time interval that has
yet to be fully explored. In concert with previous studies, our result suggests
that the level of merger activity has been roughly constant over the past few
Gyr and that there has been no accretion of single stellar systems more massive
than a few percent of a Milky Way mass in that interval. (abridged)
