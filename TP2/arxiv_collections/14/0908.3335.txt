For two complex vector bundles admitting a homomorphism with isolated
singularities between them, we establish a Poincar\'e-Hopf type formula for the
difference of the Chern character numbers of these two vector bundles. As a
consequence, we extend the original Poincar\'e-Hopf index formula to the case
of complex vector fields (to appear in Mathematische Zeitschrift)
