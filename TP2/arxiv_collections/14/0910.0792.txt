We have applied the recently developed dual fermion technique to the spectral
properties of single-band Anderson impurity problem (SIAM). In our approach a
series expansion is constructed in vertices of the corresponding atomic
Hamiltonian problem. This expansion contains a small parameter in two limiting
cases: in the weak coupling case ($U/t \to 0$), due to the smallness of the
irreducible vertices, and near the atomic limit ($U/t \to \infty$), when bare
propagators are small. Reasonable results are obtained also for the most
interesting case of strong correlations ($U \approx t$). The atomic problem of
the Anderson impurity model has a degenerate ground state, so the application
of the perturbation theory is not straightforward. We construct a special
approach dealing with symmetry-broken ground state of the renormalized atomic
problem. Formulae for the first-order dual diagram correction are obtained
analytically in the real-time domain. Most of the Kondo-physics is reproduced:
logarithmic contributions to the self energy arise, Kondo-like peak at the
Fermi level appears, and the Friedel sum rule is fulfilled. Our approach
describes also renormalization of atomic resonances due to hybridization with a
conduction band. A generalization of the proposed scheme to a multi-orbital
case can be important for the realistic description of correlated solids.
