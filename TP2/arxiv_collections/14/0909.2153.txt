First direct experimental evidence of high frequency, high toroidal mode
number (n>20), magnetic fluctuations due to unstable resistive interchange
modes (g-modes) resonant in the edge region of a reversed field pinch (RFP)
plasma is presented. Experimental characterization of time and space
periodicities of the modes is provided by means of highly resolved in-vessel
edge and insertable magnetic diagnostics. It is found that the spectral mode
properties are in good agreement with the predictions of the theoretical linear
resistive magnetohydrodynamic stability analysis. A simple model is proposed
for the observed saturation levels of the modes.
