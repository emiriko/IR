The B^1\Pi <- X^1\Sigma^+ system of NaCs molecule is investigated
experimentally by polarization labelling spectroscopy technique. The inverted
perturbation approach method is used to construct the potential energy curve of
the B^1\Pi state, providing accurate eigenenergies for vibrational levels v = 0
- 15.
