This work presents a new plasma cooling curve that is calculated using the
SPEX package. We compare our cooling rates to those in previous works, and
implement the new cooling function in the grid-adaptive framework `AMRVAC'.
Contributions to the cooling rate by the individual elements are given, to
allow for the creation of cooling curves tailored to specific abundance
requirements. In some situations, it is important to be able to include
radiative losses in the hydrodynamics. The enhanced compression ratio can
trigger instabilities (such as the Vishniac thin-shell instability) that would
otherwise be absent. For gas with temperatures below 10,000 K, the cooling time
becomes very long and does not affect the gas on the timescales that are
generally of interest for hydrodynamical simulations of circumstellar plasmas.
However, above this temperature, a significant fraction of the elements is
ionised, and the cooling rate increases by a factor 1000 relative to lower
temperature plasmas.
