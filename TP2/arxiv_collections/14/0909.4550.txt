We develop a framework for understanding the existence of asymptotically flat
solutions to the static vacuum Einstein equations with prescribed boundary data
consisting of the induced metric and mean curvature on a 2-sphere. A partial
existence result is obtained, giving a partial resolution of a conjecture of
Bartnik on such static vacuum extensions. The existence and uniqueness of such
extensions is closely related to Bartnik's definition of quasi-local mass.
