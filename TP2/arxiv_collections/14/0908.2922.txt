In this review, we study some aspects of the non-equilibrium dynamics of
quantum systems. In particular, we consider the effect of varying a parameter
in the Hamiltonian of a quantum system which takes it across a quantum critical
point or line. We study both sudden and slow quenches in a variety of systems
including one-dimensional ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, an infinite
range ferromagnetic Ising model, and some exactly solvable spin models in one
and two dimensions (such as the Kitaev model). We show that quenching leads to
the formation of defects whose density has a power-law dependence on the
quenching rate; the power depends on the dimensionalities of the system and of
the critical surface and on some of the exponents associated with the critical
point which is being crossed. We also study the effect of non-linear quenching;
the power law of the defects then depends on the degree of non-linearity.
Finally, we study some spin-1/2 models to discuss how a qubit can be
transferred across a system.
