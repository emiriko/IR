Ca_3Co_{2-x}Mn_xO_6 (x ~ 0.96) is a multiferroic with spin-chains of
alternating Co(2+) and Mn(4+) ions. The spin state of Co(2+) remains
unresolved, due to a discrepancy between high temperature X-ray absorption
(S=3/2) and low temperature neutron (S=1/2) measurements. Using a combination
of magnetic modeling and crystal-field analysis, we show that the existing low
temperature data cannot be reconciled within a high spin scenario by invoking
spin-orbit or Jahn-Teller distortions. To unify the experimental results, we
propose a spin-state crossover with specific experimental predictions.
