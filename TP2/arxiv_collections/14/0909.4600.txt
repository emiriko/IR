The SrFe2As2-xPx and CaFe2As2-yPy materials were prepared by a solid state
reaction method. X-ray diffraction measurements indicate the single-phase
samples can be successfully obtained for SrFe2As2-xPx and CaFe2As2-yPy samples.
Clear contraction of the lattice parameters are clearly determined due to the
relatively smaller P ions substation for As. The SDW instability associated
with tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition is suppressed visibly in both
systems following with the increase of P contents. The highest superconducting
transitions are respectively observed at about 27 K in SrFe2As1.3P0.7 and at
about 13 K in CaFe2As1.7P0.3.
