The detailed optical properties of BaFe2As2 have been determined over a wide
frequency range above and below the structural and magnetic transition at T_N =
138 K. A prominent in-plane infrared-active mode is observed at 253 cm^{-1}
(31.4 meV) at 295 K. The frequency of this vibration shifts discontinuously at
T_N; for T < T_N the frequency of this mode displays almost no temperature
dependence, yet it nearly doubles in intensity. This anomalous behavior appears
to be a consequence of orbital ordering in the Fe-As layers.
