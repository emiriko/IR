We have obtained ultra-high quality spectra (R=180,000; S/N>300) with
unprecedented wavelength coverage (4400 to 7400 A) for a number of stars
covering most of the HR diagram in order to test the predictions of models of
stellar surface convection. Line bisectors and core wavelength shifts are both
measured and modeled, allowing us to validate and/or reveal the limitations of
state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model atmospheres of different stellar
parameters. We show the status of our project and preliminary results.
