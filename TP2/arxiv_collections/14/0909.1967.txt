On a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, the absolute and relative
cohomology groups appear as certain subspaces of harmonic forms. DeTurck and
Gluck showed that these concrete realizations of the cohomology groups
decompose into orthogonal subspaces corresponding to cohomology coming from the
interior and boundary of the manifold. The principal angles between these
interior subspaces are all acute and are called Poincare duality angles. This
paper determines the Poincare duality angles of a collection of interesting
manifolds with boundary derived from complex projective spaces and from
Grassmannians, providing evidence that the Poincare duality angles measure, in
some sense, how "close" a manifold is to being closed.
  This paper also elucidates a connection between the Poincare duality angles
and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for differential forms, which generalizes
the classical Dirichlet-to-Neumann map arising in the problem of Electrical
Impedance Tomography. Specifically, the Poincare duality angles are essentially
the eigenvalues of a related operator, the Hilbert transform for differential
forms. This connection is then exploited to partially resolve a question of
Belishev and Sharafutdinov about whether the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
determines the cup product structure on a manifold with boundary.
