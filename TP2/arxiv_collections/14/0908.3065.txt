In this paper we find giant magnon and single spike string solutions in a
sector of the gamma-deformed conifold. We examine the dispersion relations and
find a behavior analogous to the undeformed case. The transcendental functional
relations between the conserved charges are shifted by certain gamma-dependent
term. The latter is proportional to the total momentum and thus qualitatively
different from known cases.
