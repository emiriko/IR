We consider N particles interacting pair-wise by an inverse square potential
in one dimension (Calogero-Sutherland-Moser model). When trapped harmonically,
its classical canonical partition function for the repulsive regime is known in
the literature. We start by presenting a concise re-derivation of this result.
The equation of state is then calculated both for the trapped and the
homogeneous gas. Finally, the classical limit of Wu's distribution function for
fractional exclusion statistics is obtained and we re-derive the classical
virial expansion of the homogeneous gas using this distribution function.
