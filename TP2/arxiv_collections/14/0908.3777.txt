Intensive light pulse interaction with a dense resonant medium is considered.
The possibilities of optical switching and pulse compression at realistic
parameters of the medium are analyzed. Pulse shape transformation in different
photonic band gap structures containing a dense resonant medium is studied. In
particular the effect of dispersion compensation due to nonlinear interaction
with a medium is reported. The possibility of pulse control with another pulse
is considered in the schemes of co- and counter-propagating pulses. It is shown
that a photonic crystal makes controlling more effective, at least in the case
of co-propagating pulses.
