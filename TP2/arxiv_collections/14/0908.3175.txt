Many studies and simulations suggest gas-rich mergers do not contribute
significantly to the overall star-formation rate and total mass function of
galaxies. The velocity dispersions (sigma) of Luminous & Ultraluminous Infrared
Galaxies measured using the 1.62 or 2.29 micron CO bandheads imply they will
form m < m* ellipticals. Yet, sigma's obtained with the Calcium II triplet
(CaT) at 0.85 micron suggest all types of mergers will form m > m* ellipticals.
Presented here are recent results, based on high-resolution imaging and
multi-wavelength spectroscopy, which demonstrate the dominance of a nuclear
disk of Red Supergiants (RSG) or Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in the
near-infrared bands, where dust obscuration does not sufficiently block their
signatures. The presence of these stars severely biases the dynamical mass. At
I-band, where dust can sufficiently block RSG or AGB stars, LIRGs populate the
Fundamental Plane over a large dynamic range and are virtually
indistinguishable from elliptical galaxies.
