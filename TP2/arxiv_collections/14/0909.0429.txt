In this brief report we present a feasible scheme to split quantum
information in the realm of traveling waves. An oversimplified scheme is also
proposed for the generation of a class of W states useful for perfect
teleportation and superdense coding. The scheme employs only linear optical
elements as beam splitters and phase shifters, in addition to photon counters
and one-photon sources. It is shown that splitting of quantum information with
high fidelity is possible even including inefficiency of the detectors and
photoabsorption of the beam splitters.
