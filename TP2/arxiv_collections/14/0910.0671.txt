Flying insects execute aerial maneuvers through subtle manipulations of their
wing motions. Here, we measure the free flight kinematics of fruit flies and
determine how they modulate their wing pitching to induce sharp turns. By
analyzing the torques these insects exert to pitch their wings, we infer that
the wing hinge acts as a torsional spring that passively resists the wing's
tendency to flip in response to aerodynamic and inertial forces. To turn, the
insects asymmetrically change the spring rest angles to generate rowing motions
of their wings. Thus, insects can generate these maneuvers using only a slight
active actuation that biases their wing motion.
