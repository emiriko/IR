We use XMM-Newton data to carry out a detailed study of the Si, Fe and Ni
abundances in the cool cores of a representative sample of 26 local clusters.
We have performed a careful evaluation of the systematic uncertainties related
to the instruments, the plasma codes and the spectral modeling finding that the
major source of uncertainty is in the plasma codes. Our Si, Fe, Ni, Si/Fe and
Ni/Fe distributions feature only moderate spreads (from 20% to 30%) around
their mean values strongly suggesting similar enrichment processes at work in
all our cluster cores. Our sample averaged Si/Fe ratio is comparable to those
measured in samples of groups and high luminosity ellipticals implying that the
enrichment process in ellipticals, dominant galaxies in groups and BCGs in
clusters is quite similar. Although our Si/Fe and Ni/Fe abundance ratios are
fairly well constrained, the large uncertainties in the supernovae yields
prevent us from making a firm assessment of the relative contribution of type
Ia and core-collapsed supernovae to the enrichment process. All that can really
be said with some certainty is that both contribute to the enrichment of
cluster cores.
