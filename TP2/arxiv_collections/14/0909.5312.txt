We review recent results obtained for charge asymmetric systems at Fermi and
intermediate energies, ranging from 30 MeV/u to 1 GeV/u. Observables sensitive
to the isospin dependent part of nuclear interaction are discussed, providing
information on the symmetry energy behavior from sub- to supra-saturation
densities.
