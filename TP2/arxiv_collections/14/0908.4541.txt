The fluctuation-dissipation (F-D) theorem is a fundamental result for systems
near thermodynamic equilibrium, and justifies studies between microscopic and
macroscopic properties. It states that the nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics
is related to the spontaneous fluctuation at equilibrium. Most processes in
Nature are out of equilibrium, for which we have limited theory. Common wisdom
believes the F-D theorem is violated in general for systems far from
equilibrium. Recently we show that dynamics of a dissipative system described
by stochastic differential equations can be mapped to that of a thermostated
Hamiltonian system, with a nonequilibrium steady state of the former
corresponding to the equilibrium state of the latter. Her we derived the
corresponding F-D theorem, and tested with several examples. We suggest further
studies exploiting the analogy between a general dissipative system appearing
in various science branches and a Hamiltonian system. Especially we discussed
the implications of this work on biological network studies.
