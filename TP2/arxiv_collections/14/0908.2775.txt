Spectral properties of a fully compressible solar wind Hall
Magnetohydrodynamic plasma are investigated by means of time dependent three
dimensional Hall MHD simulations. Our simulations, in agreement with spacecraft
data, identify a spectral break in turbulence spectra at characteristic
length-scales associated with electromagnetic fluctuations that are smaller
than the ion gyroradius. In this regime, our 3D simulations show that turbulent
spectral cascades in the presence of a mean magnetic field follow an
omnidirectional anisotropic inertial range spectrum close to $k^{-7/3}$. The
onset of the spectral break in our simulations can be ascribed to the presence
of nonlinear Hall interactions that modify the spectral cascades. Our
simulations further show that the underlying charachteristic turbulent
fluctuations are spectrally anisotropic, the extent of which depends critically
on the local wavenumber. The fluctuations associated with length scales smaller
than the ion gyroradius are highly compressible and tend to exhibit a near
equipartition in the velocity and magnetic fields. Finally, we find that the
orientation of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations critically determine
the character of nonlinear interactions that predominantly govern a Hall MHD
plasma, like the solar wind.
