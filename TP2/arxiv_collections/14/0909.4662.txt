In the CMSSM we find preferences for sparticle masses that are relatively
light. In the NUHM1 the best-fit values for many sparticle masses are even
slightly smaller, but with greater uncertainties. We find that at the 95% C.L.
all colored particles are in the reach of the LHC. While the light Higgs boson
is bounded from above by M_h <= 125 GeV, the heavy Higgs bosons could well
escape the LHC searches, but might be accessible at the ILC.
