To study the solution growth of crystals composed of chiral organic
molecules, a spin-one Ising lattice gas model is proposed. The model turns out
to be equivalent to the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model, which shows an equilibrium
chiral symmetry breaking at low temperatures. The kinetic Monte Carlo
simulation of crystal growth, however, demonstrates that Ostwald ripening is a
very slow process with a characteristic time proportional to the system size:
The dynamics is nonergodic. It is then argued that by incorporating grinding
dynamics, homochirality is achieved in a short time, independent of the system
size. Grinding limits cluster sizes to a certain range independent of system
size and at the same time keeps the supersaturation so high that population
numbers of average-sized clusters grow. If numbers of clusters for two types of
enantiomers differ by chance, the difference is amplified exponentially and the
system rapidly approaches the homochiral state. Relaxation time to the final
homochiral state is determined by the average cluster size. We conclude that
the system should be driven and kept in a nonequilibrium state to achieve
homochirality.
