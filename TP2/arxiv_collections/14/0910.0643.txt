The F-GAMMA-project is the coordinated effort of several observatories to
understand the AGN phenomenon and specifically blazars via multi-frequency
monitoring in collaboration with the {\sl Fermi}-GST satellite since January
2007. The core observatories are: the Effelsberg 100-m, the IRAM 30-m and the
OVRO 40-m telescope covering the range between 2.6 and 270 GHz. Effelsberg and
IRAM stations do a monthly monitoring of the cm to sub-mm radio spectra of 60
selected blazars whereas the OVRO telescope is observing roughly 1200 objects
at 15 GHz with a dense sampling of 2 points per week. The calibration
uncertainty even at high frequencies, is of a few percent. 47% of the
Effelsberg/Pico Veleta sample is included in the LBAS list. An update of the
monitored sample is currently underway.
