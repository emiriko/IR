We use agent-based modeling to investigate the effect of conservatism and
partisanship on the efficiency with which large populations solve the density
classification task--a paradigmatic problem for information aggregation and
consensus building. We find that conservative agents enhance the populations'
ability to efficiently solve the density classification task despite large
levels of noise in the system. In contrast, we find that the presence of even a
small fraction of partisans holding the minority position will result in
deadlock or a consensus on an incorrect answer. Our results provide a possible
explanation for the emergence of conservatism and suggest that even low levels
of partisanship can lead to significant social costs.
