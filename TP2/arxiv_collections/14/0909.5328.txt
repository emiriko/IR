We have determined the resistive upper critical field Hc2 for single crystals
of the superconductor Fe1.11Te0.6Se0.4 using pulsed magnetic fields of up to
60T. A rather high zero-temperature upper critical field of mu0Hc2(0) approx
47T is obtained, in spite of the relatively low superconducting transition
temperature (Tc approx 14K). Moreover, Hc2 follows an unusual temperature
dependence, becoming almost independent of the magnetic field orientation as
the temperature T=0. We suggest that the isotropic superconductivity in
Fe1.11Te0.6Se0.4 is a consequence of its three-dimensional Fermi-surface
topology. An analogous result was obtained for (Ba,K)Fe2As2, indicating that
all layered iron-based superconductors exhibit generic behavior that is
significantly different from that of the high-Tc cuprates.
