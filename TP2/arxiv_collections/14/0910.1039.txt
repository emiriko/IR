The effects of entanglement and chain orientation on strain hardening in
glassy polymers are separated by examining mixtures of chains with different
lengths. Simulations show that the orientation of a molecule of a given chain
length is the same in monodisperse systems and bidisperse mixtures, even when
entangled and unentangled chains are mixed. In addition, the stress in mixtures
is equal to the weighted average of the stresses in monodisperse systems. These
results indicate that chains contribute independently to strain hardening, that
chain orientation is determined by local interactions with the surrounding
glass, and that entanglements play at most an indirect role in strain hardening
in the range of strains typically studied. We discuss these results in the
context of recent microscopic theories.
