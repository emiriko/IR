Setups in which a system Alice emits field quanta which a system Bob receives
are prototypical for wireless communication and have been extensively studied.
In the most basic setup, Alice and Bob are modelled as Unruh-DeWitt detectors
for scalar quanta and the only noise in their communication is due to quantum
fluctuations. For this basic setup we here construct the corresponding
information-theoretic quantum channel. We calculate the classical channel
capacity as a function of the spacetime separation and we confirm that the
classical as well as the quantum channel capacity are strictly zero for
spacelike separations. We show that this channel can be used to entangle Alice
and Bob instantaneously. Alice and Bob are shown to extract this entanglement
from the vacuum through a Casimir-Polder effect.
