Galactic weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) may scatter off solar
nuclei to orbits gravitationally bound to the Sun. Once bound, the WIMPs
continue to lose energy by repeated scatters in the Sun, eventually leading to
complete entrapment in the solar interior. While the density of the bound
population is highest at the center of the Sun, the only observable signature
of WIMP annihilations inside the Sun is neutrinos. It has been previously
suggested that although the density of WIMPs just outside the Sun is lower than
deep inside, gamma rays from WIMP annihilation just outside the surface of the
Sun, in the so called WIMP halo around the Sun, may be more easily detected. We
here revisit this problem using detailed Monte Carlo simulations and detailed
composition and structure information about the Sun to estimate the size of the
gamma-ray flux. Compared to earlier simpler estimates, we find that the
gamma-ray flux from WIMP annihilations in the solar WIMP halo would be
negligible; no current or planned detectors would be able to detect this flux.
