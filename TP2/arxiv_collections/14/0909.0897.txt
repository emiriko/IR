A campaign is described, open to participation by interested AAVSO members,
of follow-up observations for newly-discovered Cepheid variables in
undersampled and obscured regions of the Galaxy. A primary objective being to
use these supergiants to clarify the Galaxy's spiral nature. Preliminary
multiband photometric observations are presented for three Cepheids discovered
beyond the obscuring dust between the Cygnus & Aquila Rifts (40 \le l \le 50
degrees), a region reputedly tied to a segment of the Sagittarius-Carina arm
which appears to cease unexpectedly. The data confirm the existence of
exceptional extinction along the line of sight at upwards of A_V~6 magnitudes
(d~2 kpc, l~47 degrees), however, the noted paucity of optical spiral tracers
in the region does not arise solely from incompleteness owing to extinction. A
hybrid spiral map of the Galaxy comprised of classical Cepheids, young open
clusters & H II regions, and molecular clouds, presents a consistent picture of
the Milky Way and confirms that the three Cepheids do not populate the main
portion of the Sagittarius-Carina arm, which does not emanate locally from this
region. The Sagitarrius-Carina arm, along with other distinct spiral features,
are found to deviate from the canonical logarithmic spiral pattern. Revised
parameters are also issued for the Cepheid BY Cas, and it is identified on the
spiral map as lying mainly in the foreground to young associations in
Cassiopeia. A Fourier analysis of BY Cas' light-curve implies overtone
pulsation, and the Cepheid is probably unassociated with the open cluster NGC
663 since the distances, ages, and radial velocities do not match.
