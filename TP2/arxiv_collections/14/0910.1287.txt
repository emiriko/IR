The radiation pressure coupling between a low-mass moving mirror and an
incident light field has been experimentally studied in a high-finesse
Fabry-Perot cavity. Using classical intensity noise in order to mimic radiation
pressure quantum fluctuations, the physics of ponderomotive squeezing comes
into play as a result of the opto-mechanical correlations between the field
quadratures. The same scheme can be used to probe ponderomotive squeezing at
the quantum level, thus opening new routes in quantum optics and high
sensitivity measurement experiments.
