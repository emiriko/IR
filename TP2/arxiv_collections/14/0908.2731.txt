Comparisons of solar magnetic-field measurements made in different spectral
lines are very important, especially in those lines in which observations have
a long history or(and) specific diagnostic significance. The spectral lines FeI
523.3 nm and FeI525.0 nm belong to this class. Therefore, this study is devoted
to a comprehensive analysis using new high-precision Stokes-meter full-disk
observations. The disk-averaged magnetic-field strength ratio R =
B(523.3)/B(525.0) equals 1.97 +- 0.02. The center-to-limb variation (CLV) is R
= 1.74 - 2.43 mu + 3.43 mu^2, where mu is the cosine of the center-to-limb
angle. For the disk center, we find R = 2.74, and for near-limb areas with mu =
0.3, R equals 1.32. There is only a small dependence of R on the spatial
resolution. Our results are rather close to those published three decades ago,
but differ significantly from recent magnetographic observations. An
application of our results to the important SOHO/MDI magnetic data calibration
issue is discussed. We conclude that the revision of the SOHO/MDI data, based
only on the comparison of magnetic field measurements in the line pair FeI
523.3 nm and FeI 525.0 nm (increasing by a factor of 1.7 or 1.6 on average
according to recent publications) is not obvious and new investigations are
urgently needed.
