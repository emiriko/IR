Decay $\Upsilon(1s)\to\gamma f_2(1270)$ is studied by an approach in which
the tensor meson, $f_2(1270)$, is strongly coupled to gluons. Besides the
strong suppression of the amplitude $\Upsilon(1s)\to\gamma gg, gg\to f_2$ by
the mass of b-quark, d-wave dominance in $\Upsilon(1s)\to\gamma f_2(1270)$ is
revealed from this approach, which provides a large enhancement. The
combination of these two factors leads to larger $B(\Upsilon(1s)\to\gamma
f_2(1270))$. The decay rate of $\Upsilon(1s)\to\gamma f_2(1270)$ and the ratios
of the helicity amplitudes are obtained and they are in agreement with data.
