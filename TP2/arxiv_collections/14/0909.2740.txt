The iron arsenide RbFe_2As_2 with the ThCr_2Si_2-type structure is found to
be a bulk superconductor with T_c=2.6 K. The onset of diamagnetism was used to
estimate the upper critical field H_c2(T), resulting in dH_c2/dT=-1.4 T/K and
an extrapolated H_c2(0)=2.5 T. As a new representative of iron pnictide
superconductors, superconducting RbFe_2As_2 contrasts with BaFe_2As_2, where
the Fermi level is higher and a magnetic instability is observed. Thus, the
solid solution series (Rb,Ba)Fe_2As_2 is a promising system to study the
crossover from superconductivity to magnetism.
