The effective separable meson-baryon potentials are constructed to match the
equivalent chiral amplitudes up to the second order in external meson momenta.
We fit the model parameters (low energy constants) to the threshold and low
energy $K^{-}p$ data. In the process, the $K^{-}$-proton bound state problem is
solved exactly in the momentum space and the 1s level characteristics of the
kaonic hydrogen are computed simultaneously with the available low energy
$K^{-}p$ cross sections. The model is also used to describe the $\pi \Sigma$
mass spectrum and the energy dependence of the $K^{-}n$ amplitude.
