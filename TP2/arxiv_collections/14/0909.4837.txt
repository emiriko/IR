Nanoscale diffusion at the interfaces in multilayers plays a vital role in
controlling their physical properties for a variety of applications. In the
present work depth-dependent interdiffusion in a Si/Fe/Si trilayer has been
studied with sub-nanometer depth resolution, using x ray standing waves. High
depth-selectivity of the present technique allows one to measure diffusion at
the two interfaces of Fe namely, Fe-on-Si and Si-on-Fe, independently, yielding
an intriguing result that Fe diffusivity at the two interfaces is not
symmetric. It is faster at the Fe-on-Si interface. While the values of
activation energy at the two interfaces are comparable, the main difference is
found in the pre-exponent factor suggesting different mechanisms of diffusion
at the two interfaces. This apparently counter-intuitive result has been
understood in terms of an asymmetric structure of the interfaces as revealed by
depth selective conversion electron Mossbauer spectroscopy. A difference in the
surface free energies of Fe and Si can lead to such differences in the
structure of the two interfaces.
