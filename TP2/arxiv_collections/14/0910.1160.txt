With the renewed distribution amplitudes of $\Lambda$, we present a
reanalysis on the semi-leptonic decay $\Lambda_c\to\Lambda\ell^+\nu$ by use of
the light-cone sum rule approach with two kinds of interpolating currents. The
form factors describing the decay process are obtained and used to predict the
decay width. With the inclusion of up to twist-6 contributions the calculations
give the decay width $\Gamma=(10.04\pm0.88)\times10^{-14}{GeV}$ for
Chernyak-Zhitnitsky-type(CZ-type) current and
$\Gamma=(6.45\pm1.06)\times10^{-14}{GeV}$ for Ioffe-type current. The
Ioffe-type interpolating current is found to be better for the estimation of
the decay rate from a comparison with experimental data.
