PHENIX plans for low energy running are presented. Current detector setting
makes it possible to measure dielectron spectra down to sqrt(s_NN)=39GeV, and
photon/high pT hadron spectra down to below sub-injection energy
(sqrt(s_NN)=5-10GeV). The upgrade of the trigger scheme after the installation
of VTX detector will enable PHENIX to fully explore the sub-injection energy
regime, starting 2011.
