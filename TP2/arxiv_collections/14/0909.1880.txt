In order to describe correctly the interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic
spin-orbit mechanisms to the spin Hall effect, it is necessary to consider
different sources of spin relaxation. We take into account the spin relaxation
time $\tau_{DP}$ due to the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism as well as the
Elliot-Yafet spin-relaxation time $\tau_s$ due to the spin-orbit scattering
from impurities. The total spin Hall conductivity depends crucially on the
ratio $\tau_s /\tau_{DP}$.
