The Teukolsky Master Equation is the basic tool for study of perturbations of
the Kerr metric in linear approximation. It admits separation of variables,
thus yielding the Teukolsky Radial Equation and the Teukolsky Angular Equation.
We present here a unified description of all classes of exact solutions to
these equations in terms of the confluent Heun functions. Large classes of new
exact solutions are found and classified with respect to their characteristic
properties. Special attention is paid to the polynomial solutions which are
singular ones and introduce collimated one-way-running waves. It is shown that
a proper linear combination of such solutions can present bounded
one-way-running waves. This type of waves may be suitable as models of the
observed astrophysical jets.
