Microscopic theories beyond mean-field are developed to include pairing,
in-medium nucleon-nucleon collisions as well as effects of initial fluctuations
of one-body observables on nuclear dynamics. These theories are applied to
nuclear reactions. The role of pairing on nuclear break-up is discussed. By
including the effect of zero point motion of collective variables through a
stochastic mean-field theory, not only average evolution of one-body
observables are properly described but also fluctuations. Diffusion
coefficients in fusion as well as mass distributions in transfer reactions are
estimated.
