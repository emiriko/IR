We analyze the stability and stabilizability properties of mixed
retarded-neutral type systems when the neutral term is allowed to be singular.
Considering an operator model of the system in a Hilbert space we are
interesting in the critical case when there exists a sequence of eigenvalues
with real parts approaching to zero. In this case the exponential stability is
not possible and we are studying the strong asymptotic stability property. The
behavior of spectra of mixed retarded-neutral type systems does not allow to
apply directly neither methods of retarded system nor the approach of neutral
type systems for analysis of stability. In this paper two technics are combined
to get the conditions of asymptotic non-exponential stability: the existence of
a Riesz basis of invariant finite-dimensional subspaces and the boundedness of
the resolvent in some subspaces of a special decomposition of the state space.
For unstable systems the technics introduced allow to analyze the concept of
regular strong stabilizability for mixed retarded-neutral type systems. The
present paper extends the results by R. Rabah, G.M. Sklyar, A.V. Rezounenko on
stability obtained in [J. Diff. Equat., 214(2005), No. 2, 391-428] and on
stabilizability from [J. Diff. Equat., 245(2008), No. 3, 569-593].
