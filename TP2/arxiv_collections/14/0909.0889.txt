Angiogenesis recapitulates the growth of blood vessels that progressively
expand and remodel into a highly organized and stereotyped vascular network.
During adulthood, endothelial cells that formed the vascular wall retain their
plasticity and can be engaged in neo-vascularization in response to
physiological stimuli, such as hypoxia, wound healing and tissue repair,
ovarian cycle and pregnancy. In addition, numerous human diseases and
pathological conditions are characterized by an excessive, uncontrolled and
aberrant angiogenesis. The signalling pathways involving the small Rho GTPase,
Rac and its downstream effector the p21-activated serine/threonine kinase (PAK)
had recently emerged as pleiotropic modulators in these processes. Indeed, Rac
and PAK were found to modulate endothelial cell biology, such as sprouting,
migration, polarity, proliferation, lumen formation, and maturation.
Elucidating the Rac/PAK molecular circuitry will provide essential information
for the development of new therapeutic agents designed to normalize the blood
vasculature in human diseases.
