Laboratory spectroscopy of non-thermal equilibrium plasmas photoionized by
intense radiation is a key to understanding compact objects, such as black
holes, based on astronomical observations. This paper describes an experiment
to study photoionizing plasmas in laboratory under well-defined and genuine
conditions. Photoionized plasma is here generated using a 0.5-keV Planckian
x-ray source created by means of a laser-driven implosion. The measured x-ray
spectrum from the photoionized silicon plasma resembles those observed from the
binary stars Cygnus X-3 and Vela X-1 with the Chandra x-ray satellite. This
demonstrates that an extreme radiation field was produced in the laboratory,
however, the theoretical interpretation of the laboratory spectrum
significantly contradicts the generally accepted explanations in x-ray
astronomy. This model experiment offers a novel test bed for validation and
verification of computational codes used in x-ray astronomy.
