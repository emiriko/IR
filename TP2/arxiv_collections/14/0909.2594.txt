Filopodia are bundles of actin filaments that extend out ahead of the leading
edge of a crawling cell to probe its upcoming environment. {\it In vitro}
experiments [D. Vignjevic {\it et al.}, J. Cell Biol. {\bf 160}, 951 (2003)]
have determined the minimal ingredients required for the formation of filopodia
from the dendritic-like morphology of the leading edge. We model these
experiments using kinetic aggregation equations for the density of growing
bundle tips. In mean field, we determine the bundle size distribution to be
broad for bundle sizes smaller than a characteristic bundle size above which
the distribution decays exponentially. Two-dimensional simulations
incorporating both bundling and cross-linking measure a bundle size
distribution that agrees qualitatively with mean field. The simulations also
demonstrate a nonmonotonicity in the radial extent of the dendritic region as a
function of capping protein concentration, as was observed in experiments, due
to the interplay between percolation and the ratcheting of growing filaments
off a spherical obstacle.
