I consider a thought experiment measuring the decoherence for quasiclassical
superpositions of gravitational field. A version of the hole argument allows to
prove that a covariant (background-free) theory is completely unable to define
the outcome of this experiment and is therefore not viable. Instead, the
results of experiments of this type allow to reconstruct a common background
shared by all superposed gravitational fields.
