We use Wilsons weak coupling ``momentum'' shell renormalization group method
to show that two-particle interaction terms commonly neglected in bosonization
of one-dimensional correlated electron systems with open boundaries are indeed
irrelevant in the renormalization group sense. Our study provides a more solid
ground for many investigations of Luttinger liquids with open boundaries.
