We study the error threshold of topological color codes on Union Jack
lattices that allow for the full implementation of the whole Clifford group of
quantum gates. After mapping the error-correction process onto a statistical
mechanical random 3-body Ising model on a Union Jack lattice, we compute its
phase diagram in the temperature-disorder plane using Monte Carlo simulations.
Surprisingly, topological color codes on Union Jack lattices have similar error
stability than color codes on triangular lattices, as well as the Kitaev toric
code. The enhanced computational capabilities of the topological color codes on
Union Jack lattices with respect to triangular lattices and the toric code
demonstrate the inherent robustness of this implementation.
