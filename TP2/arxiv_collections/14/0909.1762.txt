A SUSY SO(10) $\times A_4$ GUT model is constructed for fermion masses and
mixing by introducing a minimal set of low dimensional Higgs representations
needed to break the guage symmetry down to $SU(3)_c \times U(1)_{em}$. The
hierarchy of fermion masses can be understood in the framework of $A_4$
symmetry. From the $A_4$-invariant superpotential, the "double lopsided" mass
matrices for the charged leptons and the down quarks are obtained. It is shown
that this structure leads to bi-large neutrino mixings simultaneously with
small CKM mixing angles. An excellent fit to the masses and mixings of the
quarks and leptons as well as to CP violation parameter is obtained. Moreover,
the model predicts the neutrino mixing angle $\sin\theta_{13}\approx 0.15$.
