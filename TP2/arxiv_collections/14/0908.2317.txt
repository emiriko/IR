Generic model predictions for the early neutrino signal of a core-collapse
supernova (SN) imply that IceCube can reconstruct the bounce to within about
+/- 3.5 ms at 95% CL (assumed SN distance 10 kpc), relevant for coincidence
with gravitational-wave detectors. The timing uncertainty scales approximately
with distance-squared. The offset between true and reconstructed bounce time of
up to several ms depends on the neutrino flavor oscillation scenario. Our work
extends the recent study of Pagliaroli et al. [PRL 103, 031102 (2009)] and
demonstrates IceCube's superb timing capabilities for neutrinos from the next
nearby SN.
