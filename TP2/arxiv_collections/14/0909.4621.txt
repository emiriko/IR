We show how Newtonian gravity emerges on 4-dimensional non-commutative
spacetime branes in Yang-Mills matrix models. Large matter clusters such as
galaxies are embedded in large-scale harmonic deformations of the space-time
brane, which screen gravity for long distances. On shorter scales, the local
matter distribution reproduces Newtonian gravity via local deformations of the
brane and its metric. The harmonic ``gravity bag'' acts as a halo with
effective positive energy density. This leads in particular to a significant
enhancement of the orbital velocities around galaxies at large distances
compared with the Newtonian case, before dropping to zero as the geometry
merges with a Milne-like cosmology. Besides these ``harmonic'' solutions, there
is another class of solutions which is more similar to Einstein gravity. Thus
the IKKT model provides an accessible candidate for a quantum theory of
gravity.
