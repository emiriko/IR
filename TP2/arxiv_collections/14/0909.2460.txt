Once the existence of the Higgs boson is established at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), the focus will be shifted toward understanding its couplings to
other particles. A crucial aspect is the measurement of the bottom Yukawa
coupling, which is challenging at the LHC. In this paper we study the use of
forward jet tagging as a means to secure the observation and to significantly
improve the purity of the Higgs boson signal in the H to bbar decay mode from
deep inelastic electron-proton scattering at the LHC. We demonstrate that the
requirement of forward jet tagging in charged current events strongly enhances
the signal-to-background ratio. The impact of a veto on additional partons is
also discussed. Excellent response to hadronic shower and b-tagging
capabilities are pivotal detector performance aspects.
