We calculate the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to quark-quark
annihilation to a scalar resonant state ("diquark") in a color representation
of antitriplet or sextet at the Tevatron and LHC energies. At the LHC, we find
the enhancement (K-factor) for the antitriplet diquark is typically about
1.31--1.35, and for the sextet diquark is about 1.22--1.32 for initial-state
valence quarks. The full transverse-momentum spectrum for the diquarks is also
calculated at the LHC by performing the soft gluon resummation to the leading
logarithm and all orders in the strong coupling.
