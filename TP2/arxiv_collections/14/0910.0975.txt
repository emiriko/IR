The symmetry breaking pattern of QCD features two seemingly disconnected
phenomena: the spontaneous breakdown of the Z(3) center symmetry in the
deconfinement transition of pure-gauge QCD, and the spontaneous breaking of
chiral SU(N_f)xSU(N_f) symmetry in the limit of N_f massless quark flavours.
The dynamical entanglement of these symmetries is displayed in the framework of
a schematic model (the PNJL model) in comparison with results from Lattice QCD.
Extensions to non-zero baryon chemical potential are discussed.
