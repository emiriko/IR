The repertoire of problems theoretically solvable by a quantum computer
recently expanded to include the approximate evaluation of knot invariants,
specifically the Jones polynomial. The experimental implementation of this
evaluation, however, involves many known experimental challenges. Here we
present experimental results for a small-scale approximate evaluation of the
Jones Polynomial by nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR), in addition we show how
to escape from the limitations of NMR approaches that employ pseudo pure
states.
  Specifically, we use two spin 1/2 nuclei of natural abundance chloroform and
apply a sequence of unitary transforms representing the Trefoil Knot, the
Figure Eight Knot and the Borromean Rings. After measuring the state of the
molecule in each case, we are able to estimate the value of the Jones
Polynomial for each of the knots.
