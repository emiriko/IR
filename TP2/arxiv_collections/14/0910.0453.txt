The effects of factorization are considered within the framework of the model
of unstable particles with a smeared mass. It is shown that two-particle cross
section and three-particle decay width can be described by the universal
factorized formulae for an unstable particles of an arbitrary spin in an
intermediate state. The exact factorization is caused by the specific structure
of the model unstable-particle propagators. This result is generalized to
complicated scattering and decay-chain processes with unstable particles in
intermediate states. We analyze applicability of the method and evaluate its
accuracy.
