It is possible that the low-energy effects of physics beyond the standard
model can be parametrized mainly by anomalous couplings of quarks to the W
boson. Such couplings can generate potentially significant contributions to
various transitions that can be probed by current and future experiments. This
work explores constraints on anomalous charm-W couplings from a number of
CP-conserving and -violating processes involving the kaon and other flavored
hadrons.
