By superposition of regular gauge instantons or merons, ensembles of gauge
fields are constructed which describe the confining phase of SU(2) Yang-Mills
theory. Various properties of the Wilson loops, the gluon condensate and the
topological susceptibility are found to be in qualitative agreement with
phenomenology or results of lattice calculations. Limitations in the
application to the glueball spectrum and small size Wilson loops are discussed.
