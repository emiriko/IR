Let $\mathcal{C}_1$ be the largest component of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi
random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. The mixing time of random walk on $\mathcal
{C}_1$ in the strictly supercritical regime, $p=c/n$ with fixed $c>1$, was
shown to have order $\log^2n$ by Fountoulakis and Reed, and independently by
Benjamini, Kozma and Wormald. In the critical window, $p=(1+\varepsilon)/n$
where $\lambda=\varepsilon^3n$ is bounded, Nachmias and Peres proved that the
mixing time on $\mathcal{C}_1$ is of order $n$. However, it was unclear how to
interpolate between these results, and estimate the mixing time as the giant
component emerges from the critical window. Indeed, even the asymptotics of the
diameter of $\mathcal{C}_1$ in this regime were only recently obtained by
Riordan and Wormald, as well as the present authors and Kim. In this paper, we
show that for $p=(1+\varepsilon)/n$ with $\lambda=\varepsilon^3n\to\infty$ and
$\lambda=o(n)$, the mixing time on $\mathcal{C}_1$ is with high probability of
order $(n/\lambda)\log^2\lambda$. In addition, we show that this is the order
of the largest mixing time over all components, both in the slightly
supercritical and in the slightly subcritical regime [i.e.,
$p=(1-\varepsilon)/n$ with $\lambda$ as above].
