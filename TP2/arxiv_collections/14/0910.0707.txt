We report on a detailed abundance analysis of two strongly r-process
enhanced, very metal-poor stars newly discovered in the HERES project, CS
29491-069 ([Fe/H]=-2.51, [r/Fe]=+1.1) and HE 1219-0312 ([Fe/H]=-2.96,
[r/Fe]=+1.5). The analysis is based on high-quality VLT/UVES spectra and MARCS
model atmospheres. We detect lines of 15 heavy elements in the spectrum of CS
29491-069, and 18 in HE 1219-0312; in both cases including the Th II 4019 {\AA}
line. The heavy-element abundance patterns of these two stars are mostly
well-matched to scaled solar residual abundances not formed by the s-process.
We also compare the observed pattern with recent high-entropy wind (HEW)
calculations, which assume core-collapse supernovae of massive stars as the
astrophysical environment for the r-process, and find good agreement for most
lanthanides. The abundance ratios of the lighter elements strontium, yttrium,
and zirconium, which are presumably not formed by the main r-process, are
reproduced well by the model. Radioactive dating for CS 29491-069 with the
observed thorium and rare-earth element abundance pairs results in an average
age of 9.5 Gyr, when based on solar r-process residuals, and 17.6 Gyr, when
using HEW model predictions. Chronometry seems to fail in the case of HE
1219-0312, resulting in a negative age due to its high thorium abundance. HE
1219-0312 could therefore exhibit an overabundance of the heaviest elements,
which is sometimes called an "actinide boost".
