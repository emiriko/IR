We examine the lepton flavor-changing processes in R-parity violating MSSM.
First, we update the constraints on the relevant R-violating couplings by using
the latest data on the rare decays l_i->l_j \gamma. We find that the updated
constraints are much stronger than the old ones from rare Z-decays at LEP. Then
we calculate the processes Z->l_i l_j and \gamma\gamma->l_i l_j. We find that
with the updated constraints the R-violating couplings can still enhance the
rates of these processes to the sensitivity of GigaZ and photon-photon
collision options of the ILC.
