This study presents the mass distribution for a sample of 18 late-type
galaxies in nine Hickson Compact Groups. We used rotation curves from high
resolution 2D velocity fields of Fabry-Perot observations and J-band photometry
from the 2MASS survey, in order to determine the dark halo and the visible
matter distributions. The study compares two halo density profile, an
isothermal core-like distribution and a cuspy one. We also compare their
visible and dark matter distributions with those of galaxies belonging to
cluster and field galaxies coming from two samples: 40 cluster galaxies of
Barnes et al (2004) and 35 field galaxies of Spano et al. (2008). The central
halo surface density is found to be constant with respect to the total absolute
magnitude similar to what is found for the isolated galaxies. This suggests
that the halo density is independent to galaxy type and environment. We have
found that core-like density profiles fit better the rotation curves than
cuspy-like ones. No major differences have been found between field, cluster
and compact group galaxies with respect to their dark halo density profiles.
