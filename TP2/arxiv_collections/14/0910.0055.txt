We explore in depth the validity of a recently proposed scaling law for
earthquake interevent time distributions in the case of the Southern
California, using the waveform cross-correlation catalog of Shearer et al. Two
statistical tests are used: on the one hand, the standard two-sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is in agreement with the scaling of the distributions.
On the other hand, the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic complemented
with Monte Carlo simulation of the inter-event times, as done by Clauset et
al., supports the validity of the gamma distribution as a simple model of the
scaling function appearing on the scaling law, for rescaled inter-event times
above 0.01, except for the largest data set (magnitude greater than 2). A
discussion of these results is provided.
