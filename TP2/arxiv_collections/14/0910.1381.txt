The Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) installed at the Dunn
Solar Telescope of the NSO/SP is used to investigate the morphology and
dynamics of the lower chromosphere and the virtually non-magnetic fluctosphere
below. The study addresses in particular the structure of magnetic elements
that extend into these layers. We choose different quiet Sun regions in and
outside coronal holes. In inter-network regions with no significant magnetic
flux contributions above the detection limit of IBIS, we find intensity
structures with the characteristics of a shock wave pattern. The magnetic flux
elements in the network are long lived and seem to resemble the spatially
extended counterparts to the underlying photospheric magnetic elements. We
suggest a modification to common methods to derive the line-of-sight magnetic
field strength and explain some of the difficulties in deriving the magnetic
field vector from observations of the fluctosphere.
