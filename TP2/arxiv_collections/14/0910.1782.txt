We theoretically study a novel approach for soliton-induced high-power
supercontinuum generation by using kagome lattice HC-PCFs filled with a noble
gas. Anomalous dispersion and broad-band low loss of these fibers enable the
generation of two-octave broad spectra by fs pulses, with high coherence and
high spectral peak power densities up to five orders of magnitude larger than
in standard PCFs. In addition, up to 20 percents of the output radiation energy
forms a narrow UV/VUV band, which can be tuned by contolling the pressure in
the range from 350 nm to 120 nm. In the temporal domain this corresponds to
sub-10-fs UV/VUV pulses with pulse energy of few tens of microjoule, caused by
the formation of a high-order soliton emitting non-solitonic radiation.
