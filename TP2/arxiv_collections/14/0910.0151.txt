The driven state of a well-ordered flux line lattice in a single crystal of
2H-NbSe2 in the time domain has revealed the presence of substantial
fluctuations in velocity, with large and distinct time periods (~ seconds). A
superposition of a periodic drive in the driven vortex lattice causes distinct
changes in these fluctuations. We propose that prior to onset of the peak
effect there exist hithertofore unexplored regime of coherent dynamics, with
unexpected behaviour in velocity fluctuations.
