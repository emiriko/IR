Recent development in the physics of high-temperature cuprate
superconductivity is reviewed, with special emphasis on the phenomena of
unconventional and non-universal low-energy excitations of hole- and
electron-type cuprate superconductors and the possible physical origin. A
phenomenology based on coexisting competing orders with cuprate
superconductivity in the ground state appears to provide consistent account for
a wide range of experimental findings, including the presence (absence) of
pseudogaps and Fermi arcs above the superconducting transition $T_c$ in
hole-type (electron-type) cuprate superconductors and the novel conductance
modulations below $T_c$, particularly in the vortex state. Moreover, the
competing order scenario is compatible with the possibility of pre-formed
Cooper pairs and significant phase fluctuations in cuprate superconductors. The
physical implications of the unified phenomenology and remaining open issues
for the microscopic mechanism of cuprate superconductivity are discussed.
