Biological cells are able to accurately sense chemicals with receptors at
their surfaces, allowing cells to move towards sources of attractant and away
from sources of repellent. The accuracy of sensing chemical concentration is
ultimately limited by the random arrival of particles at the receptors by
diffusion. This fundamental physical limit is generally considered to be the
Berg & Purcell limit [H.C. Berg and E.M. Purcell, Biophys. J. {\bf 20}, 193
(1977)]. Here we derive a lower limit by applying maximum likelihood to the
time series of receptor occupancy. The increased accuracy stems from solely
considering the unoccupied time intervals - disregarding the occupied time
intervals as these do not contain any information about the external particle
concentration, and only decrease the accuracy of the concentration estimate.
Receptors which minimize the bound time intervals achieve the highest possible
accuracy. We discuss how a cell could implement such an optimal sensing
strategy by absorbing or degrading bound particles.
