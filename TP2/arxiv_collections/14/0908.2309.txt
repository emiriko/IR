We present a light-storage experiment in a praseodymium-doped crystal where
the light is mapped onto an inhomogeneously broadened optical transition shaped
into an atomic frequency comb. After absorption of the light the optical
excitation is converted into a spin-wave excitation by a control pulse. A
second control pulse reads the memory (on-demand) by reconverting the spin-wave
excitation to an optical one, where the comb structure causes a photon-echo
type rephasing of the dipole moments and directional retrieval of the light.
This combination of photon echo and spin-wave storage allows us to store
sub-microsecond (450ns) pulses for up to 20 microseconds. The scheme has a high
potential for storing multiple temporal modes in the single photon regime,
which is an important resource for future long-distance quantum communication
based on quantum repeaters.
