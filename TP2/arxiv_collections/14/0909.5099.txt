Dealing with large numbers of symmetries is often problematic. One solution
is to focus on just symmetries that generate the symmetry group. Whilst there
are special cases where breaking just the symmetries in a generating set is
complete, there are also cases where no irredundant generating set eliminates
all symmetry. However, focusing on just generators improves tractability. We
prove that it is polynomial in the size of the generating set to eliminate all
symmetric solutions, but NP-hard to prune all symmetric values. Our proof
considers row and column symmetry, a common type of symmetry in matrix models
where breaking just generator symmetries is very effective. We show that
propagating a conjunction of lexicographical ordering constraints on the rows
and columns of a matrix of decision variables is NP-hard.
