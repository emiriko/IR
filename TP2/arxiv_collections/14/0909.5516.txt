We derive a three-term asymptotic expansion for the expected lifetime of
Brownian motion and for the torsional rigidity on thin domains in R^n, and a
two-term expansion for the maximum (and corresponding maximizer) of the
expected lifetime. The approach is similar to that which we used previously to
study the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian and consists of scaling the
domain in one direction and deriving the corresponding asymptotic expansions as
the scaling parameter goes to zero. Apart from being dominated by the
one-dimensional Brownian motion along the direction of the scaling, we also see
that the symmetry of the perturbation plays a role in the expansion.
  As in the case of eigenvalues, these expansions may also be used to
approximate the exit time for domains where the scaling parameter is not
necessarilly close to zero.
