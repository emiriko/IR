We report about muSR measurements on SmFeAsO1-xFx which helped us to identify
the signature of diluted ferromagnetic inclusions, ubiquitous in the iron
pnictides. These impurities are characterized by a Curie temperature close to
room temperature and they seem responsible for a non negligible magnetic
relaxation of the implanted muons, that should not be confused with intrinsic
pnictide properties.
