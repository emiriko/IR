Aims. We aim here to contribute to the identification of unassociated bright
sources of gamma-rays in the recently released catalogue obtained by the Fermi
collaboration.
  Methods. Our work is based on a extensive cross-identification of sources
from different wavelength catalogues and databases.
  Results. As a first result, we report the finding of a few counterpart
candidates inside the 95% confidence error box of the Fermi LAT unidentified
gamma-ray source 0FGL J1848.6$-$0138. The globular cluster GLIMPSE-C01
remarkably stands out among the most peculiar objects consistent with the
position uncertainty of the gamma-ray source and with a conceivable physical
scenario for gamma-ray production. The Fermi observed spectrum is compared
against theoretical predictions in the literature making the association
plausible but not yet certain due to its low X-ray to gamma-ray luminosity
ratio. Other competing counterparts are also discussed. In particular, we pay a
special attention to a possible Pulsar Wind Nebula inside the Fermi error box
whose nature is yet to be confirmed.
  Conclusions.Both a globular cluster and an infrared source resembling a
Pulsar Wind Nebula have been found in positional agreement with 0FGL
J1848.6$-$0138. In addition, other interesting objects in the field are also
reported. Future gamma-ray observations will narrow the position uncertainty
and we hope to eventually confirm one of the counterpart candidates reported
here. If GLIMPSE-C01 is confirmed, together with the Fermi possible detection
of the well known globular cluster 47 Tuc, then it would provide strong support
to theoretical predictions of globular clusters as gamma-ray sources.
