The possibility that mirror matter with masses in the several hundred GeV-
TeV range exists is explored. Mirror matter appears quite naturally in many
unified models of particle interactions both in GUTs and in strings often in
vector-like combinations. Some of these vector-like multiplets could escape
acquiring super heavy masses and remain light down to the low energies where
they acquire vector-like masses of electroweak size. It is found that a very
small mixing of the vector-like multiplets with MSSM matter (specifically with
the third generation matter) can produce very large contributions to the
magnetic moment of the $\tau$ neutrino by as much as several orders of
magnitude putting this moment in the range of accessibility of improved
experiment. Further, it is shown that if mirror matter exists it would lead to
distinctive signatures at colliders and thus such matter can be explored at the
LHC energies with available luminosities.
