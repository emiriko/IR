The migration of living cells obeys usually the Einstein law of Brownian
motion. While the latter is due to the thermal motion of surrounding matter,
the cells locomotion is generally associated to their vitality. In the present
paper the concept of cell temperament is introduced, being analogous to
thermodynamic temperature and related to the cell entropy production. A
heuristic expression for the diffusion coefficient of cell on structured
surfaces is derived as well. The cell locomemory is also studied via the
generalized Langevin equation.
