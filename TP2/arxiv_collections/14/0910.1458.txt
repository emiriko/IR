We investigate several recently published benchmark criteria for storage or
transmission of continuous-variable quantum information. A comparison reveals
that criteria based on a Gaussian distribution of coherent states are most
resilient to noise. We then address the issue of experimental resources and
derive an equally strong benchmark, solely based on three coherent states and
homodyne detection. This benchmark is further simplified in the presence of
naturally occurring random phases, which remove the need for active input-state
modulation.
