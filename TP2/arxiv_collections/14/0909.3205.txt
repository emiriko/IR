We consider a Poisson process $\eta$ on an arbitrary measurable space with an
arbitrary sigma-finite intensity measure. We establish an explicit Fock space
representation of square integrable functions of $\eta$. As a consequence we
identify explicitly, in terms of iterated difference operators, the integrands
in the Wiener-Ito chaos expansion. We apply these results to extend well-known
variance inequalities for homogeneous Poisson processes on the line to the
general Poisson case. The Poincare inequality is a special case. Further
applications are covariance identities for Poisson processes on (strictly)
ordered spaces and Harris-FKG-inequalities for monotone functions of $\eta$.
