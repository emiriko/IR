Solar magnetic fields leave their fingerprints in the polarization signatures
of the emergent spectral line radiation. This occurs through a variety of
rather unfamiliar physical mechanisms, not only via the Zeeman effect. In
particular, magnetic fields modify the atomic level polarization (population
imbalances and quantum coherences) that anisotropic radiative pumping processes
induce in the atoms and molecules of the solar atmosphere. Interestingly, this
so-called Hanle effect allows us to "see" magnetic fields to which the Zeeman
effect is blind within the limitations of the available instrumentation. Here I
argue that the IR triplet of Ca II and the He I 10830 \AA multiplet would be
very suitable choices for investigating the magnetism of the solar chromosphere
via spectropolarimetric observations from a future space telescope, such as
JAXA's SOLAR-C mission.
