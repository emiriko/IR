We find that the amount and nature of the assumed ionizing background can
strongly affect galaxy formation and evolution. Galaxy evolution simulations
typically incorporate an ultraviolet background which falls off rapidly above
z=3; e.g., that of Haardt & Madau (1996). However, this decline may be too
steep to fit the WMAP constraints on electron scattering optical depth or
observations of intermediate redshift (z ~ 2-4) Ly-alpha forest transmission.
As an alternative, we present simulations of the cosmological formation of
individual galaxies with UV backgrounds that decline more slowly at high
redshift: both a simple intensity rescaling and the background recently derived
by Faucher-Giguere (2009), which softens the spectrum at higher redshifts. We
also test an approximation of the X-ray background with a similar z-dependence.
We find for the test galaxies that an increase in either the intensity or
hardness of ionizing radiation generically pushes star formation towards lower
redshifts: although overall star formation in the simulation boxes is reduced
by 10-25%, the galaxies show a factor of ~2 increase in the fraction of stars
within a 30 kpc radius that are formed after z=1. Other effects include late
gas inflows enhanced up to 30 times, stellar half-mass radii decreased by up to
30%, central velocity dispersions increased up to 40%, and a strong reduction
in substructure. The magnitude of the effects depends on the
environmental/accretion properties of the particular galaxy.
