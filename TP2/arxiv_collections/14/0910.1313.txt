Starting from Jefimenko's equations, we consider the multipole expansions of
electric and magnetic fields for a confined system of charges and currents. We
analyze and comment on the calculus of radiated power, on the consistent use of
approximation criteria, on the invariance of physical results when changing the
point of reference, as well as on the use of electric and magnetic moments
described by symmetric and trace free tensors.
