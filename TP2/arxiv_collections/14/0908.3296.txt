The combined analysis of polarized DIS and SIDIS data is performed in NLO
QCD. The new parametrization on polarized PDFs is constructed. The
uncertainties on PDFs and their first moments are estimated applying the
modified Hessian method.
  The especial attention is paid to the impact of novel SIDIS data on the
polarized distributions of light sea and strange quarks. In particular, the
important question of polarized sea symmetry is studied in comparison with the
latest results on this subject.
