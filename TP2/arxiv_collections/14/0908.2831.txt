We propose a new system where electron and hole states are electrostatically
confined into a quantum ring in bilayer graphene. These structures can be
created by tuning the gap of the graphene bilayer using nanostructured gates or
by position-dependent doping. The energy levels have a magnetic field ($B_{0}$)
dependence that is strikingly distinct from that of usual semiconductor quantum
rings. In particular, the eigenvalues are not invariant under a $B_0 \to -B_0$
transformation and, for a fixed total angular momentum index $m$, their field
dependence is not parabolic, but displays two minima separated by a saddle
point. The spectra also display several anti-crossings, which arise due to the
overlap of gate-confined and magnetically-confined states.
