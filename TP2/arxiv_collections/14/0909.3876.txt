A cosmological model is proposed which uses a causality argument to solve the
homogeneity and entropy problems of cosmology. In this model a chronology
violating region of spacetime causally precedes the remainder of the Universe,
and a theorem establishes the existence of time functions precisely outside the
chronology violating region. This model is shown to nicely reproduce Augustine
of Hippo's thought on time and the beginning of the Universe. In the model the
spacelike boundary representing the Big Bang is replaced by a null hypersurface
at which the gravitational degrees of freedom are almost frozen while the
matter and radiation content is highly homogeneous and thermalized.
