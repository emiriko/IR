I review some of the highlights of results from non-hadron collider flavor
experiments shown at the EPS conference in the summer of 2009. These include
highlights of the latest results from the BaBar and Belle B-factories, CLEO-c,
BES-III, NA48, KTeV, KLOE, NA62, MEG, and mu to e conversion experiments.
