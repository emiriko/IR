Using isothermal and temperature-dependent electrical measurements, we
investigated the resistive switching mechanism of amorphous titanium oxide thin
films deposited by a plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition method between two
aluminum electrodes. We found a bipolar resistive switching behavior in the
high temperature region (> 140 K), and two activation energies of shallow
traps, 0.055 eV and 0.126 eV in the ohmic current regime. We also proposed that
the bipolar resistive switching of amorphous TiO2 thin films is governed by the
transition of conduction mode from a bulk-limited SCLC model (Off state) to an
interface-limited Schottky emission (On state), generated by the ionic movement
of oxygen vacancies.
