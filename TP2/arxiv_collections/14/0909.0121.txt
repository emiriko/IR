Ordering of the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular
lattice is studied by means of a mean-field calculation, a scaling argument and
a Monte Carlo simulation, with special attention to its vortex degree of
freedom. The model exhibits a thermodynamic transition driven by the Z_2-vortex
binding-unbinding, at which various thermodynamic quantities exhibit an
essential singularity. The low-temperature state is a "spin-gel" state with a
long but finite spin correlation length where the ergodicity is broken
topologically. Implications to recent experiments on triangular-lattice
Heisenberg antiferromagnets are discussed.
