In electronics, information has been traditionally stored, processed and
communicated using an electron's charge. This paradigm is increasingly turning
out to be energy-inefficient, because movement of charge within an
information-processing device invariably causes current flow and an associated
dissipation. Replacing charge with the "spin" of an electron to encode
information may eliminate much of this dissipation and lead to more
energy-efficient "green electronics". This realization has spurred significant
research in spintronic devices and circuits where spin either directly acts as
the physical variable for hosting information or augments the role of charge.
In this review article, we discuss and elucidate some of these ideas, and
highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Many of them can potentially reduce
energy dissipation significantly, but unfortunately are error-prone and
unreliable. Moreover, there are serious obstacles to their technological
implementation that may be difficult to overcome in the near term.
  This review addresses three constructs: (1) single devices or binary switches
that can be constituents of Boolean logic gates for digital information
processing, (2) complete gates that are capable of performing specific Boolean
logic operations, and (3) combinational circuits or architectures (equivalent
to many gates working in unison) that are capable of performing universal
computation.
