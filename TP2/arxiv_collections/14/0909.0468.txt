We study the phase behavior of a classical system of particles interacting
through a strictly convex soft-repulsive potential which, at variance with the
pairwise softened repulsions considered so far in the literature, lacks a
region of downward or zero curvature. Nonetheless, such interaction is
characterized by two length scales, owing to the presence of a range of
interparticle distances where the repulsive force increases, for decreasing
distance, much more slowly than in the adjacent regions. We investigate, using
extensive Monte Carlo simulations combined with accurate free-energy
calculations, the phase diagram of the system under consideration. We find that
the model exhibits a fluid-solid coexistence line with multiple re-entrant
regions, an extremely rich solid polymorphism with solid-solid transitions, and
water-like anomalies. In spite of the isotropic nature of the interparticle
potential, we find that, among the crystal structures in which the system can
exist, there are also a number of non-Bravais lattices, such as cI16 and
diamond.
