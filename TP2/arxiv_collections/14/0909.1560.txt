We study angular momentum in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics
(NRQED). We construct the effective total angular momentum operator by applying
Noether's theorem to the NRQED lagrangian. We calculate the NRQED matching for
the individual components of the QED angular momentum up to one loop. We
illustrate an application of our results by the first calculation of the
angular momentum of the ground state hydrogen atom carried in radiative
photons, $\alpha_{\rm em}^3/18\pi$, which might be measurable in future atomic
experiments.
