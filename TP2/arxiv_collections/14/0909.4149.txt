Multilayer films of ZnO with Co were deposited on glass substrates then
annealed in a vacuum. The magnetisation of the films increased with annealing
but not the magnitude of the magneto-optical signals. The dielectric functions
for the films were calculated using the MCD spectra. A Maxwell Garnett theory
of a metallic Co/ZnO mixture is presented. The extent to which this explains
the MCD spectra taken on the films is discussed.
