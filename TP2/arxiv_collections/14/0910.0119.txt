Using a nonequilibrium renormalization group method we study the real-time
evolution of spin and current in the anisotropic Kondo model (both
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic) at finite magnetic field $h_0$ and bias
voltage $V$. We derive analytic expressions for all times in the weak-coupling
regime $\max\{V,h_0,1/t\}\gg T_c$ ($T_c=$ strong coupling scale). We find that
all observables decay both with the spin relaxation and decoherence rates
$\Gamma_{1/2}$. Various $V$-dependent logarithmic, oscillatory, and power-law
contributions are predicted. The low-energy cutoff of logarithmic terms is
generically identified by the difference of transport decay rates. For small
times $t\ll \max\{V,h_0\}^{-1}$, we obtain universal dynamics for spin and
current.
