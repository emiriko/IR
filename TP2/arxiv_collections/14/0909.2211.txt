A generalized model of Heisenberg quantum antiferromagnet on an arbitrary
graph is constructed so that the VBS is the unique ground state. The norm of
the base state and equal time multi point correlation functions are computed in
terms of generalized hyper geometric functions. For the one-dimensional
periodic Heisenberg model we present a method of computing multi point
correlation functions based on the study of a commuting family of transfer
matrices. The connection of multi point correlators with Young tableaux and
Gegenbauer polynomials is found.
