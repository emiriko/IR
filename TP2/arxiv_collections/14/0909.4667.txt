The geometric effects of the beam in near detectors at a neutrino factory are
discussed. The refined systematics treatment, including cross section errors,
flux errors and background uncertainties, is compared with the IDS-NF one.
Different near detector setups are included. We also probe their effects both
at the measurements of standard neutrino oscillation parameters and constraints
of the non-standard neutrino interaction.
