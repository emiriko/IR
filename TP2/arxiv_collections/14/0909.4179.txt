By the example of a kicked quartic oscillator we investigate the dynamics of
classically chaotic quantum systems with few degrees of freedom affected by
persistent external noise. Stability and reversibility of the motion are
analyzed in detail in dependence on the noise level $\sigma$. The critical
level $\sigma_c(t)$, below which the response of the system to the noise
remains weak, is studied versus the evolution time. In the regime with the
Ehrenfest time interval $t_E$ so short that the classical Lyapunov exponential
decay of the Peres fidelity does not show up the time dependence of this
critical value is proved to be power-like. We estimate also the decoherence
time after which the motion turns into a Markovian process.
