We argue that it would be desirable to use Jeffreys' priors in the
construction of numerical model based probabilistic climate forecasts, in order
that those forecasts could be argued to be objective. Hitherto, this has been
considered computationally unfeasible. We propose an approximation that we
believe makes it feasible, and derive closed-form expressions for various
simple cases.
