The IceCube detector is an all-flavor neutrino telescope. For several years
IceCube has been detecting muon tracks from charged-current muon neutrino
interactions in ice. However, IceCube has yet to observe the electromagnetic or
hadronic particle showers or "cascades" initiated by charged or neutral-current
neutrino interactions. The first detection of such an event signature will
likely come from the known flux of atmospheric electron and muon neutrinos. A
search for atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades was performed using a full
year of IceCube data. Reconstruction and background rejection techniques were
developed to reach, for the first time, an expected signal-to-background ratio
~1 or better.
