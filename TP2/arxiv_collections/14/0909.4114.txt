The Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS), which is the widest deep
field radio survey so far attempted, aims to probe the evolution of radio
galaxies out to the edge of the Universe. Using AAOmega on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope we have successfully obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 395 of the
ATLAS radio galaxies. Coupled with 169 redshifts from the existing literature,
we now have 564 spectroscopic redshifts for ATLAS sources.
