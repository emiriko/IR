Bundles of filamentous polymers are primary structural components of a broad
range of cytoskeletal structures, and their mechanical properties play key
roles in cellular functions ranging from locomotion to mechanotransduction and
fertilization. We give a detailed derivation of a wormlike bundle model as a
generic description for the statics and dynamics of polymer bundles consisting
of semiflexible polymers interconnected by crosslinking agents. The elastic
degrees of freedom include bending as well as twist deformations of the
filaments and shear deformation of the crosslinks. We show that a competition
between the elastic properties of the filaments and those of the crosslinks
leads to renormalized effective bend and twist rigidities that become
mode-number dependent. The strength and character of this dependence is found
to vary with bundle architecture, such as the arrangement of filaments in the
cross section and pretwist. We discuss two paradigmatic cases of bundle
architecture, a uniform arrangement of filaments as found in F-actin bundles
and a shell-like architecture as characteristic for microtubules. Each
architecture is found to have its own universal ratio of maximal to minimal
bending rigidity, independent of the specific type of crosslink induced
filament coupling; our predictions are in reasonable agreement with available
experimental data for microtubules. Moreover, we analyze the predictions of the
wormlike bundle model for experimental observables such as the tangent-tangent
correlation function and dynamic response and correlation functions. Finally,
we analyze the effect of pretwist (helicity) on the mechanical properties of
bundles. We predict that microtubules with different number of protofilaments
should have distinct variations in their effective bending rigidity.
