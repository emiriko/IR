It is emphasized that quantum entanglement determined in terms of the von
Neumann entropy operator is a stochastic quantity and, therefore, can
fluctuate. The rms fluctuations of the entanglement entropy of two-qubit
systems in both pure and mixed states have been obtained. It has been found
that entanglement fluctuations in the maximally entangled states are absent.
Regions where the entanglement fluctuations are larger than the entanglement
itself (strong fluctuation regions) have been revealed. It has been found that
the magnitude of the relative entanglement fluctuations is divergent at the
points of the transition of systems from an entangled state to a separable
state. It has been shown that entanglement fluctuations vanish in the separable
states.
