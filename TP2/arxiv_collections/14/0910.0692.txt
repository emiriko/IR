The reduction of biharmonic maps equation in terms of the Maurer-Cartan form
for all smooth map of any compact Riemannian manifolds into a compact Lie group
with bi-invariant Riemannian metric is obtained. By this formula, all the
biharmonic curves into a compact Lie group and all biharmonic maps from a
2-dimensional open domain into a compact Lie group are characterized.
