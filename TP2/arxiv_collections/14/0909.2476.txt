In this paper we describe a new robotic brachytherapy needle-insertion system
that is designed to replace the template used in the manual technique. After a
brief review of existing robotic systems, we describe the requirements that we
based our design upon. A detailed description of the proposed system follows.
Our design is capable of positioning and inclining a needle within the same
workspace as the manual template. To help improve accuracy, the needle can be
rotated about its axis during insertion into the prostate. The system can be
mounted on existing steppers and also easily accommodates existing seed
dispensers, such as the Mick Applicator.
