This paper is a management summary of how the area of End User Computing
(EUC) has been addressed by AIB Capital Markets. The development of an
effective policy is described, as well as the process by which a register of
critical EUC applications was assembled and how those applications were brought
into a controlled environment. A number of findings are included as well as
recommendations for others who would seek to run a similar project.
