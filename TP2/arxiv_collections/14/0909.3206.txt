We summarize the results on patterns of flavour violation in a
Randall-Sundrum model with custodial protection (RSc) and compare them with
those identified in the Littlest Higgs Model with T--parity (LHT) and in a
number of SUSY Flavour Models. While K decays play in this presentation a
prominent role, the inclusion of B physics and lepton flavour violation is
crucial in the distinction between these three popular extensions of the
Standard Model (SM) by means of flavour physics.
