In a standing wave of light, a difference in spatial distributions of
multipolar atom-field interactions may alter the definition of the magic
wavelength to minimize the uncertainty of optical lattice clocks. We show that
the magic wavelength can be determined so as to eliminate the spatial mismatch
in electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and electric quadrupole interactions for
specific combinations of standing waves. Experimental prospects of such
lattices used with a blue magic wavelength are discussed.
