We study the power of closed timelike curves (CTCs) and other nonlinear
extensions of quantum mechanics for distinguishing nonorthogonal states and
speeding up hard computations. If a CTC-assisted computer is presented with a
labeled mixture of states to be distinguished--the most natural formulation--we
show that the CTC is of no use. The apparent contradiction with recent claims
that CTC-assisted computers can perfectly distinguish nonorthogonal states is
resolved by noting that CTC-assisted evolution is nonlinear, so the output of
such a computer on a mixture of inputs is not a convex combination of its
output on the mixture's pure components. Similarly, it is not clear that CTC
assistance or nonlinear evolution help solve hard problems if computation is
defined as we recommend, as correctly evaluating a function on a labeled
mixture of orthogonal inputs.
