The role of the interaction in reaching and crossing the phantom divide line
in the Chaplygin gas model is discussed. We obtain some necessary properties of
the interaction that allow the model to arrive at or cross the phantom divide
line. We show that these properties put some conditions on the ratio of dark
matter to dark energy density in the present epoch.
