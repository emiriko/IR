In the last years, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have become more popular than
ever. The possibility of using them to produce feedback effects that would help
solving some of the still open questions connected to the hierarchical scenario
of galaxy formation and evolution, has made them particularly popular among
theorists. AGN-driven outflows can have different origin. Here, I will
concentrate on the role that the radio-loud phase of nuclear activity (and the
presence of radio plasma jets) can play in the evolution of a galaxy. I will
focus on two aspects in which radio activity could be important. The first is
exploring whether relativistic plasma jet associated with radio-loud galaxies
could provide an effective way to produce gas outflows with characteristics
that can be relevant in the evolution of the host galaxy. The second, is to
investigate whether they can provide a mechanism for the triggering of star
formation.
