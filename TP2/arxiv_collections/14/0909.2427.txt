We investigate the validity of the generalized second law of gravitational
thermodynamics in a non-flat FRW universe containing the interacting new
agegraphic dark energy with cold dark matter. The boundary of the universe is
assumed to be enclosed by the dynamical apparent horizon. We show that for this
model, the equation of state parameter can cross the phantom divide. We also
present that for the selected model under thermal equilibrium with the Hawking
radiation, the generalized second law is always satisfied throughout the
history of the universe. Whereas, the evolution of the entropy of the universe
and apparent horizon, separately, depends on the equation of state parameter of
the interacting new agegraphic dark energy model.
