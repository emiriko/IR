Radial velocity observations accumulated during the past 16 years are used to
derive a preliminary orbit for the CEMP star CS 22881-036. The velocity
amplitude is very small. No velocity variation is found for three additional
CEMP stars observed over roughly the same time interval. Searches for
companions of two CEMP double-lined spectroscopic binaries and of the RR Lyrae
star TY Gruis are reviewed. A disparity between the period distribution of disk
carbon-star binaries and that of their parent population of normal binaries can
be attributed qualitatively to a decline in accreted mass with increasing
binary separation. Finally, possible reasons for failure to find expected
companions of CEMP stars are discussed.
