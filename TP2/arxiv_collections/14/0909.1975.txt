We give an overview of our earlier classification results in [DW4] and [DW6]
for superpotentials of scalar curvature type of the cohomogeneity one
Ricci-flat equations. We then give an account of the classification in the case
where the isotropy representation of the principal orbit consists of exactly
three distinct irreducible real summands--the leftover case from [DW6].
