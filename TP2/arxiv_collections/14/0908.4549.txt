For several novae, a bright X-ray source with a spectrum resembling the class
of Super Soft X-ray Sources (SSS) has been observed a few weeks to months after
outburst. Novae are powered by explosive nuclear burning on the surface of a
white dwarf, and enough energy is produced to power a radiatively driven wind.
Owing to the evolution of the opacity of the ejecta, the observable spectrum
gradually shifts from optical to soft X-rays (SSS phase). It has sometimes been
assumed that at the beginning of the SSS phase no more mass loss occurs.
However, high-resolution X-ray spectra of some novae have shown highly
blue-shifted absorption lines, indicating a significant expansion. In this
paper, I show that all novae that have been observed with X-ray gratings during
their SSS phase show significant blue shifts. I argue that all models that
attempt to explain the X-ray bright SSS phase have to accommodate the continued
expansion of the ejecta.
