The Exo-Planet Imaging Camera and Spectrograph (EPICS) for the future
42-meter European-Extremely Large Telescope, will enable direct images, and
spectra for both young and old Jupiter-mass planets in the infrared. To achieve
the required contrast, several coronagraphic concepts -- to remove starlight --
are under investigation: conventional pupil apodization (CPA), apodized-pupil
Lyot coronagraph (APLC), dual-zone coronagraph (DZC), four-quadrants phase mask
(FQPM), multi-stages FQPM, annular groove phase mask (AGPM), high order optical
vortex (OVC), and band-limited coronagraph (BLC). Recent experiment
demonstrated the interest of an halftone-dot process -- namely microdots
technique -- to generate the adequate transmission profile of pupil apodizers
for CPA, APLC, and DZC concepts. Here, we examine the use of this technique to
produce band-limited focal plane masks, and present guidelines for the design.
Additionally, we present the first near-IR laboratory results with BLCs that
confirm the microdots approach as a suitable technique for ground-based
observations.
