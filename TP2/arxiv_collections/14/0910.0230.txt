We analysed the sensitivity of the process gg to H_1 to gamma-gamma to the
explicitly CP-violating phases phi_mu and phi_{A_f} in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where
H_1 is the lightest Supersymmetric Higgs boson. We conclude that depending on
these phases, the overall production and decay rates of H_1 can vary up to
orders of magnitude compared to the CP-conserving case.
