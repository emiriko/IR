In this paper a generalization of the Voronoi partition is used for optimal
deployment of autonomous agents carrying sensors with heterogeneous
capabilities, to maximize the sensor coverage. The generalized centroidal
Voronoi configuration, in which the agents are located at the centroids of the
corresponding generalized Voronoi cells, is shown to be a local optimal
configuration. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the presented
deployment strategy.
