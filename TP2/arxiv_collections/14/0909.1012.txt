We have performed hydrodynamical simulations of the long-time evolution of
proto-neutron stars to study the nucleosynthesis using the resulting wind
trajectories. Although the conditions found in the present wind models are not
favourable for the production of heavy elements, a small enhancement of the
entropy results in the production of r-process elements with A $\approx$ 195.
This allows us to explore the sensitivity of their production to the
hydrodynamical evolution (wind termination shock) and nuclear physics input
used.
