We present the theory of the Josephson effect in nanotube dots where an SU(4)
symmetry can be realized. We find a remarkably rich phase diagram that
significantly differs from the SU(2) case. In particular, \pi-junction behavior
is largely suppressed. We analytically obtain the Josephson current in various
parameter regions: (i) in the Kondo regime, covering the full crossover from
SU(4) to SU(2), (ii) for weak tunnel couplings, and (iii) for large BCS gap.
The transition between these regions is studied numerically.
