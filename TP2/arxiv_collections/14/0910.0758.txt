Future drag-free missions for space-based experiments in gravitational
physics require a Gravitational Reference Sensor with extremely demanding
sensing and disturbance reduction requirements. A configuration with two
cubical sensors is the current baseline for the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA) and has reached a high level of maturity. Nevertheless, several
promising concepts have been proposed with potential applications beyond LISA
and are currently investigated at HEPL, Stanford, and EADS Astrium, Germany.
The general motivation is to exploit the possibility of achieving improved
disturbance reduction, and ultimately understand how low acceleration noise can
be pushed with a realistic design for future mission. In this paper, we discuss
disturbance reduction requirements for LISA and beyond, describe four different
payload concepts, compare expected strain sensitivities in the 'low-frequency'
region of the frequency spectrum, dominated by acceleration noise, and
ultimately discuss advantages and disadvantages of each of those concepts in
achieving disturbance reduction for space-based detectors beyond LISA.
