A content-based network representation of web logs (blogs) using a basic
word-overlap similarity measure is presented. Due to a strong signal in blog
data the approach is sufficient for accurately classifying blogs. Using Swedish
blog data we demonstrate that blogs that treat similar subjects are organized
in clusters that, in turn, are hierarchically organized in higher-order
clusters. The simplicity of the representation renders it both computationally
tractable and transparent. We therefore argue that the approach is suitable as
a baseline when developing and analyzing more advanced content-based
representations of the blogosphere.
