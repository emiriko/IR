In this paper we discuss some topics on the geometry of type II superstring
backgrounds with D-branes, in particular on the geometrical meaning of the
D-brane charge, the Ramond-Ramond fields and the Wess-Zumino action. We see
that, depending on the behaviour of the D-brane on the four non-compact
space-time directions, we need different notions of homology and cohomology to
discuss the associated fields and charge: we give a mathematical definition of
such notions and show their physical applications. We then discuss the problem
of corretly defining Wess-Zumino action using the theory of p-gerbes. Finally,
we recall the so-called *-problem and make some brief remarks about it.
