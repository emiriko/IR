We explore extensions of the MSSM in which TeV scale vector-like multiplets
can mediate observable n-anti-n oscillations, without causing conflict with the
proton decay experiments, with a U(1) symmetry playing an important role. The
colored vector-like particles, in particular, may be found at the LHC through
some decay modes arising from their direct couplings to quarks.
