This thesis focuses on characterizing the distribution of points and galaxies
using multifractal analysis. In this attempt the main emphasis is on
calculating the Minkowski-Bouligand fractal dimension (Dq) of the distribution
of points over different scales and hence finding the scale of homogeneity of
the distribution. Effects, of finite size of the sample and clustering in the
distribution, on the Dq have been studied in detail. The assumption that the
large scale distribution of matter in the Universe is homogeneous has been
verified with multifractal analysis of the data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
