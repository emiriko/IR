The aim of the paper is to understand the local forms of conformal vector
fields in the neighborhood of a singularity. We begin a general study in this
direction, for any pseudo-Riemannian type, and give a complete answer in the
Riemannian case. This is done using geometric methods, and studying local
dynamics of sequences of conformal transformations.
