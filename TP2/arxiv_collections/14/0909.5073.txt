We address realistic schemes for the generation of non-Gaussian states of
light based on conditional intensity measurements performed on correlated
bipartite states. We consider both quantum and classically correlated states
and different kind of detection, comparing the resulting non Gaussianity
parameters upon varying the input energy and the detection efficiency. We find
that quantum correlations generally lead to higher non Gaussianity, at least in
the low energy regime. An experimental implementation feasible with current
technology is also suggested.
