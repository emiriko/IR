Most of the research done on quantum error correction studies an error model
in which each qubit is affected by noise, independently of the other qubits. In
this paper we study a different noise model -- one in which the noise may be
correlated with the qubits it acts upon.
  We show both positive and negative results. On the one hand, we show
controlled-X errors cannot be perfectly corrected, yet can be approximately
corrected with sub-constant approximation error. On the other hand, we show
that no non-trivial quantum error correcting code can approximately correct
controlled phase error with sub-constant approximation error.
