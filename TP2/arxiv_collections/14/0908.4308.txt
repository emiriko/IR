We have used V- and I- band images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to
identify compact stellar clusters within the tidal tails of twelve different
interacting galaxies. The seventeen tails within our sample span a physical
parameter space of HI/stellar masses, tail pressure and density through their
diversity of tail lengths, optical brightnesses, mass ratios, HI column
densities, stage on the Toomre sequence, and tail kinematics. Our preliminary
findings in this study indicate that star cluster demographics of the tidal
tail environment are compatible with the current understanding of star cluster
formation in quiescent systems, possibly only needing changes in certain
parameters or normalization of the Schechter cluster initial mass function
(CIMF) to replicate what we observe in color-magnitude diagrams and a brightest
absolute magnitude -- log N plot.
