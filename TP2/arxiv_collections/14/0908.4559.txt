We discuss the kinematics of the particles that make up a Reggeon in field
theory, using the terminology of the Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).
Reggeization sums a series of strongly-ordered collinear emissions resulting in
an overall Reggeon exchange that falls in the Glauber or Coulomb kinematic
region. This is an extremely multi-scale problem and appears to fall outside of
the usual organizing scheme of SCET.
