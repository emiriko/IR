The parametric amplifier with and without the pumping fluctuations of
coupling function is considered when the fields are initially prepared in
coherent light.
  The pumping fluctuations are assumed to be normally distributed with
time-dependent variance. The effects of antibunching and anticorrelation of
photons on the photon distribution, correlation between modes and factorial
moments are demonstrated. A possible enhancement of photon antibunching for
certain values of initial mean photon numbers is shown and discussed. We have
shown also that new states (called modified squeezed vacuum states or even
thermal states) can be generated from such an interaction. Further, we have
demonstrated that the sum photon-number distribution can exhibit collapses and
revivals in the photon-number domain somewhat similar to those known in the
Jaynes-Cummings model.
