The mass density of nanowires is determined using in-situ resonance frequency
experiments combined with quasi-static nanotensile tests. Our results reveal a
mass density of 7.36 g/cm3 on average which is below the theoretical density of
bulk cobalt. Also the density of electrodeposited cobalt nanowires is found to
decrease with the aspect ratio. The results are discussed in terms of the
measurement accuracy and the microstructure of the nanowires.
