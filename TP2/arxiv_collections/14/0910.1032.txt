After an overture and a non-technical exposition of the relevant theoretical
framework including a brief discussion of some of the most popular extensions
of the Standard Model, we will compile a list of 20 goals in flavour physics
that could be reached already in the next decade. In addition to K, D and
B_{s,d} decays and lepton flavour violation also flavour conserving observables
like electric dipole moments of the neutron and leptons and (g-2)_\mu are
included in this list. Flavour violation in high energy processes is also one
of these goals. Subsequently we will discuss in more detail the most urgent
issues for the coming years in the context of several extensions of the
Standard Model like models with Minimal Flavour Violation, the general MSSM,
the Littlest Higgs Model with T parity, Randall-Sundrum models and
supersymmetric flavour models. This presentation is not meant to be a
comprehensive review of flavour physics but rather a personal view on this
fascinating field and an attempt to collect those routes that with the help of
upcoming experiments should allow us to reach a much deeper understanding of
physics, in particular flavour physics, at very short distance scales.
