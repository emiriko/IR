We report multi-wavelength power spectra of diffuse Galactic dust emission
from BLAST observations at 250, 350, and 500 microns in Galactic Plane fields
in Cygnus X and Aquila. These submillimeter power spectra statistically
quantify the self-similar structure observable over a broad range of scales and
can be used to assess the cirrus noise which limits the detection of faint
point sources. The advent of submillimeter surveys with the Herschel Space
Observatory makes the wavelength dependence a matter of interest. We show that
the observed relative amplitudes of the power spectra can be related through a
spectral energy distribution (SED). Fitting a simple modified black body to
this SED, we find the dust temperature in Cygnus X to be 19.9 +/- 1.3 K and in
the Aquila region 16.9 +/- 0.7 K. Our empirical estimates provide important new
insight into the substantial cirrus noise that will be encountered in
forthcoming observations.
