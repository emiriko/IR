We analyze galactic black hole mergers and their emitted gravitational waves.
Such mergers have typically unequal masses with mass ratio of the order 1/10.
The emitted gravitational waves carry the inprint of spins and mass quadrupoles
of the binary components. Among these contributions, we consider here the
quasi-precessional evolution of the spins. A method of taking into account
these third post-Newtonian (3PN) effects by renormalizing (redefining) the 1.5
PN and 2PN accurate spin contributions to the accumulated orbital phase is
developed.
