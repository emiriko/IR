A model for describing structural pointlike defects in nanoscaled
ferromagnetic materials is presented. Its details are explicitly developed
whenever interacting with a vortex-like state comprised in a thin nanodisk.
Among others, our model yields results for the vortex equilibrium position
under the influence of several defects along with an external magnetic field in
good qualitative agreement with experiments. We also discuss how such defects
may affect the vortex motion, like its gyrotropic oscillation and dynamical
polarization reversal.
