The flow structure obtained when Localized Arc Filament Plasma Actuators
(LAFPA) are employed to control the flow issuing from a perfectly expanded Mach
1.3 nozzle is elucidated by visualizing coherent structures obtained from
Implicit Large-Eddy Simulations. The computations reproduce recent experimental
observations at the Ohio State University to influence the acoustic and mixing
properties of the jet. Eight actuators were placed on a collar around the
periphery of the nozzle exit and selectively excited to generate various modes,
including first and second mixed (m = +/- 1 and m = +/- 2) and axisymmetric (m
= 0). In this fluid dynamics video

unsteady and phase-averaged quantities are displayed to aid understanding of
the vortex dynamics associated with the m = +/- 1 and m = 0 modes excited at
the preferred column-mode frequency (Strouhal number 0.3). The unsteady flow in
both contains a broad spectrum of coherent features. For m = +/- 1, the
phase-averaged flow reveals the generation of successive distorted elliptic
vortex rings with axes in the flapping plane, but alternating on either side of
the jet axis. This generates a chain of structures where each interacts with
its predecessor on one side and its successor on the other. Through self and
mutual interaction, the leading segment of each loop is pinched and passes
through the previous ring before rapidly breaking up, and the mean jet flow
takes on an elliptic shape. The m = 0 mode exhibits relatively stable roll-up
events, with vortex ribs in the braid regions connecting successive large
coherent structures.
