Quantum states inevitably decay with time into a probabilistic mixture of
classical states, due to their interaction with the environment and measurement
instrumentation. We present the first measurement of the decoherence dynamics
of complex photon states in a condensed-matter system. By controllably
preparing a number of distinct, quantum-superposed photon states in a
superconducting microwave resonator, we show that the subsequent decay dynamics
can be quantitatively described by taking into account only two distinct decay
channels, energy relaxation and dephasing. Our ability to prepare specific
initial quantum states allows us to measure the evolution of specific elements
in the quantum density matrix, in a very detailed manner that can be compared
with theory.
