By a computer simulation approach we study the scattering of $p$- or
$s$-polarized light from a two-dimensional, randomly rough, perfectly
conducting surface. The pair of coupled inhomogeneous integral equations for
two independent tangential components of the magnetic field on the surface are
converted into matrix equations by the method of moments, which are then solved
by the biconjugate gradient stabilized method. The solutions are used to
calculate the mean differential reflection coefficient for given angles of
incidence and specified polarizations of the incident and scattered fields. The
full angular distribution of the intensity of the scattered light is obtained
for strongly randomly rough surfaces by a rigorous computer simulation
approach.
