We define a new theory of discrete Riemann surfaces and present its basic
results. The key idea is to consider not only a cellular decomposition of a
surface, but the union with its dual. Discrete holomorphy is defined by a
straightforward discretisation of the Cauchy-Riemann equation. A lot of
classical results in Riemann theory have a discrete counterpart, Hodge star,
harmonicity, Hodge theorem, Weyl's lemma, Cauchy integral formula, existence of
holomorphic forms with prescribed holonomies. Giving a geometrical meaning to
the construction on a Riemann surface, we define a notion of criticality on
which we prove a continuous limit theorem. We investigate its connection with
criticality in the Ising model. We set up a Dirac equation on a discrete
universal spin structure and we prove that the existence of a Dirac spinor is
equivalent to criticality.
