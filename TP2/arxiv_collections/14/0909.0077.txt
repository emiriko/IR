The problem of quantifying the difference between evolutions of an open
quantum system (in particular, between the actual evolution of an open system
and the ideal target operation on the corresponding closed system) is important
in quantum control, especially in control of quantum information processing.
Motivated by this problem, we develop a measure for evaluating the distance
between unitary evolution operators of a composite quantum system that consists
of a sub-system of interest (e.g., a quantum information processor) and
environment. The main characteristic of this measure is the invariance with
respect to the effect of the evolution operator on the environment, which
follows from an equivalence relation that exists between unitary operators
acting on the composite system, when the effect on only the sub-system of
interest is considered. The invariance to the environment's transformation
makes it possible to quantitatively compare the evolution of an open quantum
system and its closed counterpart. The distance measure also determines the
fidelity bounds of a general quantum channel (a completely positive and
trace-preserving map acting on the sub-system of interest) with respect to a
unitary target transformation. This measure is also independent of the initial
state of the system and straightforward to numerically calculate. As an
example, the measure is used in numerical simulations to evaluate fidelities of
optimally controlled quantum gate operations (for one- and two-qubit systems),
in the presence of a decohering environment. This example illustrates the
utility of this measure for optimal control of quantum operations in the
realistic case of open-system dynamics.
