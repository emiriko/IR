Recently, spin selection rules have been invoked to explain the discrepancy
between measured and calculated adsorption probabilities of molecular oxygen
reacting with Al(111). In this work, we inspect the impact of nonadiabatic spin
transitions on the dynamics of this system from first principles. For this
purpose the motion on two distinct potential-energy surfaces associated to
different spin configurations and possible transitions between them are
inspected by means of the Fewest Switches algorithm. Within this framework we
especially focus on the influence of such spin transitions on observables
accessible to molecular beam experiments. On this basis we suggest experimental
setups that can validate the occurrence of such transitions and discuss their
feasibility.
