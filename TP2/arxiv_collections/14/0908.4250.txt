We describe the performance of amplifiers in the 4 GHz--8 GHz range using
Direct Current Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices(DC SQUIDs) in a
lumped element configuration. We have used external impedance transformers to
couple power into and out of the DC SQUIDs. By choosing appropriate values for
coupling capacitors, resonator lengths and output component values, we have
demonstrated useful gains in several frequency ranges with different
bandwidths, showing over 27 GHz of power gain-bandwidth product. In this work,
we describe our design for the 4 GHz--8 GHz range and present data
demonstrating gain, bandwidth, dynamic range, and drift characteristics.
