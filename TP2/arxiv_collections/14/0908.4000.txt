We present a study of the propagation of higher-order spatial modes in a
waveguided parametric down-conversion photon pair source. Observing the
multimode photon pair spectrum from a periodically poled KTiOPO$_4$ waveguide
allowed us to isolate individual spatial modes through their distinctive
spectral properties. We have measured directly the spatial distribution of each
mode of the photon pairs, confirming the findings of our waveguide model, and
demonstrated by coincidence measurements that the total parity of the modes is
conserved in the nonlinear interaction. Furthermore, we show that we can
combine the advantages of a waveguide source with the potential to generate
spatially entangled photon pairs as in bulk crystal down-converters.
