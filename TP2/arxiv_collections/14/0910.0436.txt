At a time when IceCube is nearing completion, we revisit the rationale for
constructing kilometer-scale neutrino detectors. We focus on the prospect that
such observatories reveal the still-enigmatic sources of cosmic rays. While
only a "smoking gun" is missing for the case that the Galactic component of the
cosmic-ray spectrum originates in supernova remnants, the origin of the
extragalactic component remains a mystery. We speculate on neutrino emission
from gamma-ray bursts and active galaxies.
