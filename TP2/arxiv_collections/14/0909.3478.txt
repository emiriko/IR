In this paper we give a proof of the fact, that the motivic Hodge-Chern class
transformation MHC_y and Hirzebruch class transformation MHT_y* for mixed Hodge
modules and strictly specializable filtered D-modules commute with
specialization in the algebraic and in a suitable complex analytic context.
Here specialization in the Hodge- and D-module context means the corresponding
nearby cycles defined in terms of the $V$-filtration of Malgrange-Kashiwara.
This generalizes a corresponding specialization result of Verdier about
MacPherson's Chern class transformation c_*.
