The aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of magnetic
reconnection at a 3D null point, with respect to their dependence on the
symmetry of the magnetic field around the null. In particular we examine the
rate of flux transport across the null point with symmetric/asymmetric
diffusion regions, as well as how the current sheet forms in time, and its
properties. Mathematical modelling and finite difference resistive MHD
simulations are used. It is found that the basic structure of the mode of
magnetic reconnection considered is unaffected by varying the magnetic field
symmetry, that is, the plasma flow is found cross both the spine and fan of the
null. However, the peak intensity and dimensions of the current sheet are
dependent on the symmetry/ asymmetry of the field lines. As a result, the
reconnection rate is also found to be strongly dependent on the field
asymmetry.
