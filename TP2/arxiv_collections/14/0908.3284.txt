The transport properties, upper critical fields, superconducting anisotropy,
and critical current density in an iso-valent phosphorus-doped BaFe2As2 single
crystal close to optimum doping are investigated in this report. Temperature
dependent resistivity and susceptibility show a superconducting transition
temperature, Tc, just below 31 K both with sharp transitions. The upper
critical field parallel to the ab-plane, Hc2^ab, is above 77 Tesla while that
along the c-axis direction, Hc2^c, is just above 36 Tesla, yielding a low
superconducting anisotropy ratio ~ 2. The estimated inter-plane coherence
length based on the Ginzburg-Landau (G-L) theory indicates BaFe2(As0.68P0.32)2
is still above the point for a dimensional crossover inferring the
superconducting layers are not weakly-coupled in this system. The critical
current density at 5 K obtained from magnetization loops measurement show a
modest Jc as high as 10^5 A/cm2.
