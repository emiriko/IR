We discuss the phenomenon of long-distance entanglement in the ground state
of quantum spin models, its use in high-fidelity and robust quantum
communication, and its realization in many-body systems of ultracold atoms in
optical lattices and in arrays of coupled optical cavities. We investigate
different patterns of site-dependent interaction couplings, singling out two
general settings: Patterns that allow for perfect long-distance entanglement
(LDE) in the ground state of the system, namely such that the end-to-end
entanglement remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, and patterns of quasi
long-distance entanglement (QLDE) in the ground state of the system, namely,
such such that the end-to-end entanglement vanishes with a very slow power-law
decay as the length of the spin chain is increased. We discuss physical
realizations of these models in ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms loaded in
optical lattices. We show how, using either suitably engineered super-lattice
structures or exploiting the presence of edge impurities in lattices with
single periodicity, it is possible to realize models endowed with nonvanishing
LDE or QLDE. We then study how to realize models that optimize the robustness
of QLDE at finite temperature and in the presence of imperfections using
suitably engineered arrays of coupled optical cavities. We finally introduce
LDE-based schemes of long-distance quantum teleportation in linear arrays of
coupled cavities and show that they allow for high-fidelity and high success
rates even at moderately high temperatures.
