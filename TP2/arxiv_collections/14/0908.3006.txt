Lattice mismatch of Cu on Ag(111) produces fast diffusion for special "magic
sizes" of islands. A size- and shape-dependent reptation mechanism is
responsible for low diffusion barriers. Initiating the reptation mechanism
requires a suitable island shape, a property not considered in previous studies
of 1D island chains and 2D closed-shell islands. Shape determines the dominant
diffusion mechanism and leads to multiple clearly identifiable magic-size
trends for diffusion depending on the number of atoms whose bonds are shortened
during diffusion.
