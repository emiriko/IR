We present B and R band spectroastrometry of a sample of 45 Herbig Ae/Be
stars in order to study their binary properties. All but one of the targets
known to be binary systems with a separation of ~0.1-2.0 arcsec are detected by
a distinctive spectroastrometric signature. Some objects in the sample exhibit
spectroastrometric features that do not appear attributable to a binary system.
We find that these may be due to light reflected from dusty halos or material
entrained in winds. We present 8 new binary detections and 4 detections of an
unknown component in previously discovered binary systems. The data confirm
previous reports that Herbig Ae/Be stars have a high binary fraction, 74+/-6
per cent in the sample presented here. We use a spectroastrometric
deconvolution technique to separate the spatially unresolved binary spectra
into the individual constituent spectra. The separated spectra allow us to
ascertain the spectral type of the individual binary components, which in turn
allows the mass ratio of these systems to be determined. In addition, we
appraise the method used and the effects of contaminant sources of flux. We
find that the distribution of system mass ratios is inconsistent with random
pairing from the Initial Mass Function, and that this appears robust despite a
detection bias. Instead, the mass ratio distribution is broadly consistent with
the scenario of binary formation via disk fragmentation.
