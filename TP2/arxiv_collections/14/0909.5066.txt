A comparison is carried out among the star formation histories of early-type
galaxies (ETG) in fossil groups, clusters and low density environments.
Although they show similar evolutionary histories, a significant fraction of
the fossils are younger than their counterparts, suggesting that fossils can be
precursors of the isolated ETGs.
