We analyze the hole doping mechanism in Bi_2Sr_{2-x}La_xCuO_{6+\delta}
(BSLCO). The singular optimum around x=0.35 is found to be connected with a
feedback between the doped CuO_2 layers and its dopant reactant
[La^{3+}/Bi^{3+}-O_\delta] locking the number of doped holes preferentially on
to the universal optimum n_opt=0.16.
