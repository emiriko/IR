We obtain congruences for the number a(n) of cubic partitions using modular
forms. The notion of cubic partitions is introduced by Chan and named by Kim in
connection with Ramanujan's cubic continued fractions. Chan has shown that a(n)
has several analogous properties to the number p(n) of partitions, including
the generating function, the continued fraction, and congruence relations. To
be more specific, we show that $a(25n+22)\equiv 0 ({\rm mod} 5)$, $a(49n+15)
\equiv a(49n+29) \equiv a(49n+36) \equiv a(49n+43) \equiv 0 ({\rm mod} 7)$.
Furthermore, we prove that a(n) takes infinitely many even values and
infinitely odd values.
