This paper is concerned with the status of 1/0 and ways to deal with it.
These matters are treated in the setting of Komori fields, also known as
non-trivial cancellation meadows. Different viewpoints on the status of 1/0
exist in mathematics and theoretical computer science. We give a simple account
of how mathematicians deal with 1/0 in which a customary convention among
mathematicians plays a prominent part, and we make plausible that a convincing
account, starting from the popular computer science viewpoint that 1/0 is
undefined, by means of some logic of partial functions is not attainable.
