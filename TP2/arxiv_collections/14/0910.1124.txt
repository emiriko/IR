Making use of the octonion operator, the electromagnetic field generates an
adjoint field theoretically. The source of adjoint field includes the adjoint
charge and the adjoint current. The adjoint charge has an impact on the
gravitational mass and the mass distribution in the electromagnetic field with
its adjoint field, and causes further the predictions to departure slightly
from the conservation of mass. The inferences can explain why the adjoint
charge will influence the mass distribution in the gravitational field and
electromagnetic field of celestial bodies. And then the adjoint charge can be
considered as one kind of candidate for the dark matter.
