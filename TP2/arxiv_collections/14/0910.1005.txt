A photoacoustic cell intended for laser detection of trace gases is
represented. The cell is adapted so as to enhance the gas-detection performance
and, simultaneously, to reduce the cell size. The cell design provides an
efficient cancellation of the window background (a parasite response due to
absorption of laser beam in the cell windows) and acoustic isolation from the
environment for an acoustic resonance of the cell. The useful photoacoustic
response from a detected gas, window background and noise are analyzed in
demonstration experiments as functions of the modulation frequency for a
prototype cell with the internal volume ~ 0.5 cm^3. The minimal detectable
absorption for the prototype is estimated to be ~ 1.2 10^{-8} cm^{-1} W
Hz^{-1/2}.
