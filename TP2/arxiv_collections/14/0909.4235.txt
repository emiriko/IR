Liouville space search algorithm [Bruschweiler, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85},
4815(2000).] utilizes mixed initial states of the ensemble, and has been
successfully implemented earlier in weakly coupled spins, in which a spin can
be identified as a qubit. It has recently been demonstrated that n-strongly
coupled spins can be collectively treated as an n-qubit system. Application of
algorithms in such systems, requires new approaches using transition selective
pulses rather than qubit selective pulses. This work develops a modified
version of Liouville space search algorithm, which is applicable for strongly
as well as weakly coupled spins. All the steps of the algorithm, can be
implemented by using transition selective pulses. Experimental implementation
is carried out on a strongly dipolar coupled four qubit system.
