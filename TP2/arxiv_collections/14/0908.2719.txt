X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 is microquasar containing historically first
candidate to black hole. Paradigm of magnetic disc accretion dominates in
theoretical models describing processes taking place in objects containing
black holes such as microquasars and active galactic nuclei. Nevertheless up to
now there were no reliable measurements of magnetic fields in these systems.
The first prediction of the Cyg X-1 magnetic field was done by V.F.Shvartsman.
He wrote that Cyg X-1 X-ray emission millisecond flickering evidences the
presence of a black hole and points to the magnetic field role in accretion
onto a black hole. From that times there were many of attempts to search for
the Cyg X-1 magnetic field but all of these efforts indicated upper limits
only. Our VLT FORS1 2007 and 2008 observations revealed a presence of a
magnetic field in the system. For the first time we obtained on the level of 6
standard deviations a magnetic field of the order of 130 G on the surface of
the Cyg X-1 optical component (O-supergiant) and observational estimation on a
4 sigma level of a magnetic field on a outer part of accretion structure (about
600 G) in accordance with theoretical prediction. Scaling this field value to
black hole vicinity we showed that the field is strong enough to explain the
X-ray millisecond flickering and can explain it. Our result presents the first
direct determination of magnetic field in accreting disk around a black hole.
