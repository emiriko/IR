We propose a trick which enables one to incorporate the Gribov horizon into
the Schwinger-Dyson equation in Landau and Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory,
using the Gribov-Zwanziger framework with the horizon term. We find a family of
solutions parameterized by one-parameter $w_R(0)$ which was overlooked so far
by assuming to be zero implicitly. The family includes both the scaling and
decoupling solutions, and specification of the parameter discriminates between
them. In the Landau gauge we discuss a possible decoupling solution satisfying
the Kugo-Ojima criterion for color confinement.
