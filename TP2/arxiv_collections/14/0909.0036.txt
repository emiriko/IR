I consider techniques for Berger-Oliger adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) when
numerically solving partial differential equations with wave-like solutions,
using characteristic (double-null) grids. Such AMR algorithms are naturally
recursive, and the best-known past Berger-Oliger characteristic AMR algorithm,
that of Pretorius & Lehner (J. Comp. Phys. 198 (2004), 10), recurses on
individual "diamond" characteristic grid cells. This leads to the use of
fine-grained memory management, with individual grid cells kept in
2-dimensional linked lists at each refinement level. This complicates the
implementation and adds overhead in both space and time.
  Here I describe a Berger-Oliger characteristic AMR algorithm which instead
recurses on null \emph{slices}. This algorithm is very similar to the usual
Cauchy Berger-Oliger algorithm, and uses relatively coarse-grained memory
management, allowing entire null slices to be stored in contiguous arrays in
memory. The algorithm is very efficient in both space and time.
  I describe discretizations yielding both 2nd and 4th order global accuracy.
My code implementing the algorithm described here is included in the electronic
supplementary materials accompanying this paper, and is freely available to
other researchers under the terms of the GNU general public license.
