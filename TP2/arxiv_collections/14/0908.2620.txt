We derive renormalization group equations which allow us to treat order
parameter fluctuations near quantum phase transitions in cases where an
expansion in powers of the order parameter is not possible. As a prototypical
application, we analyze the nematic transition driven by a d-wave Pomeranchuk
instability in a two-dimensional electron system. We find that order parameter
fluctuations suppress the first order character of the nematic transition
obtained at low temperatures in mean-field theory, so that a continuous
transition leading to quantum criticality can emerge.
