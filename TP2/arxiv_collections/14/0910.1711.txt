We have investigated the fluorine-doping dependence of lattice constants,
transports and specific heat for polycrystalline LaFePO1-xFx. F doping slightly
and monotonically decreases the in-plane lattice parameter. In the normal
state, electrical resistivity at low temperature is proportional to the square
of temperature and the electronic specific heat coefficient has large value,
indicating the existence of moderate electron-electron correlation in this
system. Hall coefficient has large magnitude, and shows large temperature
dependence, indicating the low carrier density and multiple carriers in this
system. Temperature dependence of the upper critical field suggests that the
system is a two gap superconductor. The F-doping dependence of these properties
in this system are very weak, while in the FeAs system (LaFeAsO), the F doping
induces the large changes in electronic properties. This difference is probably
due to the different F-doping dependence of the lattice in these two systems.
It has been revealed that a pure effect of electron doping on electronic
properties is very weak in this Fe pnictide compound.
