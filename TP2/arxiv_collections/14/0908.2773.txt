We highlight how the downward revision in the distance to the star cluster
associated with SGR 1806-20 by Bibby et al. reconciles the apparent low
contamination of BATSE short GRBs by intense flares from extragalactic
magnetars without recourse to modifying the frequency of one such flare per 30
years per Milky Way galaxy. We also discuss the variety in progenitor initial
masses of magnetars based upon cluster ages, ranging from ~50 Msun for SGR
1806-20 and iAXP CXOU J164710.2-455216 Westerlund 1 to ~17 Msun for SGR 1900+14
according to Davies et al. and presumably also 1E 1841-045 if it originated
from one of the massive RSG clusters #2 or #3.
