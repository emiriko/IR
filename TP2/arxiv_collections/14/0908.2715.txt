Hysteretic damping is often modeled by means of linear viscoelastic
approaches such as "nearly constant Attenuation (NCQ)" models. These models do
not take into account nonlinear effects either on the stiffness or on the
damping, which are well known features of soil dynamic behavior. The aim of
this paper is to propose a mechanical model involving nonlinear viscoelastic
behavior for isotropic materials. This model simultaneously takes into account
nonlinear elasticity and nonlinear damping. On the one hand, the shear modulus
is a function of the excitation level; on the other, the description of
viscosity is based on a generalized Maxwell body involving non-linearity. This
formulation is implemented into a 1D finite element approach for a dry soil.
The validation of the model shows its ability to retrieve low amplitude ground
motion response. For larger excitation levels, the analysis of seismic wave
propagation in a nonlinear soil layer over an elastic bedrock leads to results
which are physically satisfactory (lower amplitudes, larger time delays, higher
frequency content).
