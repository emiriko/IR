Quivers play an important role in the representation theory of algebras, with
a key ingredient being the path algebra and the preprojective algebra. Quiver
grassmannians are varieties of submodules of a fixed module of the path or
preprojective algebra. In the current paper, we study these objects in detail.
We show that the quiver grassmannians corresponding to submodules of certain
injective modules are homeomorphic to the lagrangian quiver varieties of
Nakajima which have been well studied in the context of geometric
representation theory. We then refine this result by finding quiver
grassmannians which are homeomorphic to the Demazure quiver varieties
introduced by the first author, and others which are homeomorphic to the
graded/cyclic quiver varieties defined by Nakajima. The Demazure quiver
grassmannians allow us to describe injective objects in the category of locally
nilpotent modules of the preprojective algebra. We conclude by relating our
construction to a similar one of Lusztig using projectives in place of
injectives.
