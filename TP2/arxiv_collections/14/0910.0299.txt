We show that all bounded trajectories in the two dimensional classical system
with the potential $V(r,\phi)=\omega^2 r^2+ \frac{\al k^2}{r^2 \cos^2 {k
\phi}}+ \frac{\beta k^2}{r^2 \sin^2 {k \phi}}$ are closed for all integer and
rational values of $k$. The period is $T=\frac{\pi}{2\omega}$ and does not
depend on $k$. This agrees with our earlier conjecture suggesting that the
quantum version of this system is superintegrable.
