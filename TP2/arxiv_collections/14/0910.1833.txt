The galaxy power spectrum contains information on the growth of structure,
the growth rate through redshift space distortions, and the cosmic expansion
through baryon acoustic oscillation features. We study the ability of two
proposed experiments, BigBOSS and JDEM-PS, to test the cosmological model and
general relativity. We quantify the latter result in terms of the gravitational
growth index \gamma, whose value in general relativity is \gamma\approx 0.55.
Significant deviations from this value could indicate new physics beyond the
standard model of cosmology. The results show that BigBOSS (JDEM-PS) would be
capable of measuring \gamma with an uncertainty \sigma(\gamma) = 0.043 (0.054),
which tightens to \sigma(\gamma) = 0.031 (0.038) if we include Stage III data
priors, marginalizing over neutrino mass, time varying dark energy equation of
state, and other parameters. For all dark energy parameters and related figures
of merit the two experiments give comparable results. We also carry out some
studies of the influence of redshift range, resolution, treatment of
nonlinearities, and bias evolution to enable further improvement.
