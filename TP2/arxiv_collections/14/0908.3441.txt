We derive general properties, which hold for both quantum and classical
systems, of response functions of nonequilibrium steady states. We clarify
differences from those of equilibrium states. In particular, sum rules and
asymptotic behaviors are derived, and their implications are discussed. Since
almost no assumptions are made, our results are applicable to diverse physical
systems. We also demonstrate our results by a molecular dynamics simulation of
a many-body interacting system.
