Families of regimes for control systems are studied possessing the so called
quasi-controllability property that is similar to the Kalman controllability
property. A new approach is proposed to estimate the degree of transients
overshooting in quasi-controllable systems. This approach is conceptually
related with the principle of bounded regimes absence in the absolute stability
problem. Its essence is in obtaining of constructive a priori bounds for degree
of overshooting in terms of the so called quasi-controllability measure. It is
shown that relations between stability, asymptotic stability and instability
for quasi-controllable systems are similar to those for systems described by
linear differential or difference equations in the case when the leading
eigenvalue of the corresponding matrix is simple. The results are applicable
for analysis of transients, classical absolute stability problem, stability
problem for desynchronized systems and so on.
