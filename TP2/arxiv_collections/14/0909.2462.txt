It appeared worthwhile to us to present a state-of-the-art look at the field
of ferroelectrics. We are certainly not attempting to provide a complete review
of all aspects of the field of ferroelectrics over the last years but we wish
to transport a flavour of the current excitement in the field through the
(subjective) choice of four specific examples of current interest: (i)
Piezoelectrics and the morphotropic phase boundary, (ii) Multiferroics, (iii)
The effect of high pressure on ferroelectrics and (iv) Strain-engineering in
ferroelectric oxide thin films. For each topic we will try to work out both
current interesting approaches and an outlook into future challenges.
Throughout our discussion, the reader is referred to a list of significant
review articles, books and papers in the field.
