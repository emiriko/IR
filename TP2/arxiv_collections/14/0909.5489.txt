In this paper we present a review of bosonic renormalization effects on
electronic carriers observed from angle-resolved photoemission spectra in the
cuprates. We specifically discuss the viewpoint that these renormalizations
represent coupling of the electrons to the lattice, and review how the wide
range of materials dependence, such as the number of CuO$_2$ layers, and the
doping dependence can be straightforwardly understood as arising due to novel
electron-phonon coupling.
