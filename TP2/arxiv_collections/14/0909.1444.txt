Responding mechanically to environmental requests, muscles show a
surprisingly large variety of functions. The studies of in vivo cycling muscles
qualified skeletal muscles into four principal locomotor patterns: motor,
brake, strut, and spring. While much effort of has been done in searching for
muscle design patterns, no fundamental concepts underlying empirically
established patterns were revealed. In this interdisciplinary study, continuum
mechanics is applied to the problem of muscle structure in relation to
function. The ability of a powering muscle, treated as a homogenous solid
organ, tuned to efficient locomotion via the natural frequency is illuminated
through the non-linear elastic muscle moduli controlled by contraction
velocity. The exploration of the elastic force patterns known in solid state
physics incorporated in activated skeletal and cardiac muscles via the
mechanical similarity principle yields analytical rationalization for locomotor
muscle patterns. Besides the explanation of the origin of muscle allometric
exponents observed for muscles in legs of running animals and wings of flying
birds, the striated muscles are patterned through primary and secondary
activities expected to be useful in designing of artificial muscles and
modeling living and extinct animals.
