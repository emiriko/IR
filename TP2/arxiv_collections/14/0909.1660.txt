The dynamics of dark matter-wave solitons in elongated atomic condensates are
discussed at finite temperatures. Simulations with the stochastic
Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal a noticeable, experimentally observable spread
in individual soliton trajectories, attributed to inherent fluctuations in both
phase and density of the underlying medium. Averaging over a number of such
trajectories (as done in experiments) washes out such background fluctuations,
revealing a well-defined temperature-dependent temporal growth in the
oscillation amplitude. The average soliton dynamics is well captured by the
simpler dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, both numerically and via an
analytically-derived equation for the soliton center based on perturbation
theory for dark solitons.
