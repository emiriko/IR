Chirped-pulse interferometry (CPI) captures the metrological advantages of
quantum Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry in a completely classical system.
Modified HOM interferometers are the basis for a number of seminal
quantum-interference effects. Here, the corresponding modifications to CPI
allow for the first observation of classical analogues to the HOM peak and
quantum beating. They also allow a new classical technique for generating phase
super-resolution exhibiting a coherence length dramatically longer than that of
the laser light, analogous to increased two-photon coherence lengths in
entangled states.
