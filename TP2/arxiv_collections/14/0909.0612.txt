We have measured the heat capacity of YBa2Cu3O6+d for 0.7<d<0.8 between 1.8
and 300K. It was found that doping dependences of specific heat jump and
temperature of heat capacity jump contradict to the assumption of spatially
homogeneous electronic density. The results suggest that the transition from
60K to 90K phase has a percolative nature and the structure of underdoped 60K
phase can be considered as array of superconducting nanoclusters embedded in
the insulating matrix.
