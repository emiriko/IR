The Pomeron loop amplitude and the amplitude for the diagram with any general
number of loops is derived in the QCD dipole approach. It was found that the
major contribution to the amplitude of an arbitrary Pomeron enhanced diagram,
is equivalent to the diagram with non interacting Pomerons. This provides the
necessary tools for solving the long standing theoretical problem of summing
over Pomeron loop diagrams. In this theoretical framework the contribution of
the full set of enhanced diagrams to the survival probability is estimated.
This enables an accurate prediction for the exclusive cross section for
diffractive Higgs production, which includes the suppression factor needed to
screen out the full set of hard re-scattering corrections, in QCD.
