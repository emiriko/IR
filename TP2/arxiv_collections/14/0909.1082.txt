We present new information on galaxies in the vicinity of luminous radio
galaxies and quasars at z=4,5,6. These fields were previously found to contain
overdensities of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) or spectroscopic Lyman alpha
emitters. We use HST and Spitzer data to infer stellar masses, and contrast our
results with large samples of LBGs in more average environments as probed by
the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). The following results were
obtained. First, LBGs in both overdense regions and in the field at z=4-5 lie
on a very similar sequence in a z'-[3.6] versus [3.6] color-magnitude diagram.
This is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass (log[M*/Msun] = 9-11) in
which galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their star
formation rate (SFR) increases. Second, the two radio galaxies are among the
most massive objects (log[M*/Msun]~11) known to exist at z~4-5, and are
extremely rare based on the low number density of such objects as estimated
from the ~25x larger area GOODS survey. We suggest that the presence of these
massive galaxies and supermassive black holes has been boosted through rapid
accretion of gas or merging inside overdense regions. Third, the total stellar
mass found in the z=4 ``proto-cluster'' TN1338 accounts for <30% of the stellar
mass on the cluster red sequence expected to have formed at z>4, based on a
comparison with the massive X-ray cluster Cl1252 at z=1.2. Although future
near-infrared observations should determine whether any massive galaxies are
currently being missed, one possible explanation for this mass difference is
that TN1338 evolves into a smaller cluster than Cl1252. This raises the
interesting question of whether the most massive protocluster regions at z>4
remain yet to be discovered.
