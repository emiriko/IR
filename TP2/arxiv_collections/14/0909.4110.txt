We present new far-ultraviolet spectra of an oxygen-rich knot in the Large
Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant N132D, obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. Moderate resolution (v~200 km/s) spectra
in the HST far-ultraviolet bandpass (1150 - 1750 A) show emission from several
ionization states of oxygen as well as trace amounts of other species. We use
the improvements in sensitivity and resolving power offered by COS to separate
contributions from different velocity components within the remnant, as well as
emission from different species within the oxygen-rich knot itself. This is the
first time that compositional and velocity structure in the ultraviolet
emission lines from N132D has been resolved, and we use this to assess the
chemical composition of the remnant. No nitrogen is detected in N132D and
multiple carbon species are found at velocities inconsistent with the main
oxygen component. We find helium and silicon to be associated with the
oxygen-rich knot, and use the reddening-corrected line strengths of OIII],
OIV], OV, and SiIV to constrain the composition and physical characteristics of
this oxygen-rich knot. We find that models with a silicon-to-oxygen abundance
ratio of N(Si)/N(O) = 0.01 can reproduce the observed emission for a shock
velocity of ~130 km/s, implying a mass of ~50 solar masses for the N132D
progenitor star.
