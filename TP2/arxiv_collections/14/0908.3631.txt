In the presence of a laser-induced spin-orbit coupling an interacting ultra
cold spinor Bose-Einstein condensate may acquire a quasi-relativistic character
described by a non-linear Dirac-like equation. We show that as a result of the
spin-orbit coupling and the non-linearity the condensate may become
self-trapped, resembling the so-called chiral confinement, previously studied
in the context of the massive Thirring model. We first consider 1D geometries
where the self-confined condensates present an intriguing sinusoidal dependence
on the inter-particle interactions. We further show that multi-dimensional
chiral-confinement is also possible under appropriate feasible laser
arrangements, and discuss the properties of 2D and 3D condensates, which differ
significantly from the 1D case.
