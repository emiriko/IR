Tomographic probability representation is introduced for fermion fields. The
states of the fermions are mapped onto probability distribution of discrete
random variables (spin projections). The operators acting on the fermion states
are described by fermionic tomographic symbols. The product of the operators
acting on the fermion states is mapped onto star-product of the fermionic
symbols. The kernel of the star-product is obtained. The antisymmetry of the
fermion states is formulated as the specific symmetry property of the
tomographic joint probability distribution associated with the states.
