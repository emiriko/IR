Strong confinement of charges in few electron systems such as in atoms,
molecules and quantum dots leads to a spectrum of discrete energy levels that
are often shared by several degenerate quantum states. Since the electronic
structure is key to understanding their chemical properties, methods that probe
these energy levels in situ are important. We show how electrostatic force
detection using atomic force microscopy reveals the electronic structure of
individual and coupled self-assembled quantum dots. An electron addition
spectrum in the Coulomb blockade regime, resulting from a change in cantilever
resonance frequency and dissipation during tunneling events, shows one by one
electron charging of a dot. The spectra show clear level degeneracies in
isolated quantum dots, supported by the first observation of predicted
temperature-dependent shifts of Coulomb blockade peaks. Further, by scanning
the surface we observe that several quantum dots may reside on what
topologically appears to be just one. These images of grouped weakly and
strongly coupled dots allow us to estimate their relative coupling strengths.
