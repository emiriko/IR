The purpose of this Note is twofold: First, we introduce the general
formalism of evolutionary genetics dynamics involving fitnesses, under both the
deterministic and stochastic setups, and chiefly in discrete-time. In the
process, we particularize it to a one-parameter model where only a selection
parameter is unknown. Then and in a parallel manner, we discuss the estimation
problems of the selection parameter based on a single-generation frequency
distribution shift under both deterministic and stochastic evolutionary
dynamics. In the stochastics, we consider both the celebrated Wright-Fisher and
Moran models.
