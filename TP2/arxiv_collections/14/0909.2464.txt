We report on the design, fabrication, and preliminary testing of a 150 zone
array built in a `surface-electrode' geometry microfabricated on a single
substrate. We demonstrate transport of atomic ions between legs of a `Y'-type
junction and measure the in-situ heating rates for the ions. The trap design
demonstrates use of a basic component design library that can be quickly
assembled to form structures optimized for a particular experiment.
