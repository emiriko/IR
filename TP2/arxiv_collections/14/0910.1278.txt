The improved dynamics of loop quantum cosmology is extended to include the
Bianchi type II model. Because these space-times admit both anisotropies and
non-zero spatial curvature, certain technical difficulties arise over and above
those encountered in the analysis of the (anisotropic but spatially flat)
Bianchi type I space-times, and of the (spatially curved but isotropic) k=+/-1
models. We address these and show that the big-bang singularity is resolved in
the same precise sense as in the recent analysis of the Bianchi I model.
Bianchi II space-times are of special interest to quantum cosmology because of
the expected behavior of the gravitational field near generic space-like
singularities in classical general relativity.
