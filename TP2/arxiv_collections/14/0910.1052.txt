We present a scheme for stabilizing multiple lasers at wavelengths between
795 and 866 nm to the same atomic reference line. A reference laser at 852 nm
is stabilized to the Cs D2 line using a Doppler-free frequency modulation
technique. Through transfer cavities, four lasers are stabilized to the
relevant atomic transitions in 40Ca+. The rms linewidth of a transfer-locked
laser is measured to be 123 kHz with respect to an independent atomic
reference, the Rb D1 line. This stability is confirmed by the comparison of an
excitation spectrum of a single 40Ca+ ion to an eight-level Bloch equation
model. The measured Allan variance of 10^(-22) at 10 s demonstrates a high
degree of stability for time scales up to 100 s.
