Unless protected by the exact integrability, solitons are subject to
dissipative forces, originating from a thermally fluctuating background. At low
enough temperatures $T$ background fluctuations should be considered as being
quantized which enables us to calculate finite lifetime of the solitons
$\tau\sim T^{-4}$. We also find that the coherent nature of the quantum
fluctuations leads to long-range interactions between the solitons mediated by
the superradiation. Our results are of relevance to current experiments with
ultracold atoms, while the approach may be extended to solitons in other media.
