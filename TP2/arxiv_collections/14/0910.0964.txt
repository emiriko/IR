Grover's algorithm for quantum search can also be applied to classical energy
transfer. The procedure takes a system in which the total energy is equally
distributed among $N$ subsystems and transfers most of the it to one marked
subsystem. We show that in a relativistic setting the efficiency of this
procedure can be improved. We will consider the transfer of relativistic
kinetic energy in a series of elastic collisions. In this case, the number of
steps of the energy transfer procedure approaches 1 as the initial velocities
of the objects become closer to the speed of light. This is a consequence of
introducing non-linearities in the procedure. However, the maximum attainable
transfer will depend on the particular combination of speed and number of
objects. In the procedure, we will use $N$ elements, like in the classical
case, instead of the $log_2(N)$ states of the quantum algorithm.
