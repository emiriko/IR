We present preliminary results of the first and on-going radial velocity
survey for circumbinary planets. With a novel radial velocity technique
employing an iodine absorption cell we achieve an unprecedented RV precision of
up to 2 m/s for double-lined binary stars. The high resolution spectra
collected with the Keck I/Hires, TNG/Sarg and Shane/CAT/Hamspec
telescopes/spectrographs over the years 2003-2008 allow us to derive RVs and
compute planet detection limits for ten double-lined binary stars. For this
initial sample of targets, we can rule out planets on dynamically stable orbits
with masses as small as ~0.3 to 3 MJup for the orbital periods of up to ~5.3
years. Even though the presented sample of stars is too small to make any
strong conclusions, it is clear that the search for circumbinary planets is now
technique-wise possible and eventually will provide new constraints for the
planet formation theories.
