The democratization of wireless networks combined to the emergence of mobile
devices increasingly autonomous and efficient lead to new services. Positioning
services become overcrowded. Accuracy is the main quality criteria in
positioning. But to better appreciate this one a coefficient is needed. In this
paper we present Geometric and Signal Strength Dilution of Precision (DOP) for
positioning systems based on Wi-Fi and Signal Strength measurements.
