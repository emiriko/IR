In this paper, I review how optical spectro-interferometry has become a
particularly well suited technique to study the close environment of young
stars, by spatially resolving both their IR continuum and line emission
regions. I summarize in which ways optical interferometers have brought major
insights about our understanding of the inner part of circumstellar disks, a
region in which the first stages of planet formation are thought to occur. In
particular, I emphasize how new methods are now enabling to probe the hot gas
emission, in addition to the circumstellar dust.
