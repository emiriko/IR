It is pointed out that relativistic classical electron theory with classical
electromagnetic zero-point radiation has a scaling symmetry which is suitable
for understanding the equilibrium behavior of classical thermal radiation at a
spectrum other than the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. In relativistic classical
electron theory, the masses of the particles are the only scale-giving
parameters associated with mechanics while the action-angle variables are scale
invariant. The theory thus separates the interaction of the action variables of
matter and radiation from the scale-giving parameters. Classical zero-point
radiation is invariant under scattering by the charged particles of
relativistic classical electron theory. The basic ideas of the matter
-radiation interaction are illustrated in a simple relativistic classical
electromagnetic example.
