Given a diagram D of a knot K, we give easily computable bounds for
Rasmussen's concordance invariant s(K). The bounds are not independent of the
diagram D chosen, but we show that for diagrams satisfying a given condition
the bounds are tight. As a corollary we improve on previously known
Bennequin-type bounds on the slice genus.
