In the following paper we present an internal shocks model, iShocks, for
simulating a variety of relativistic jet scenarios; these scenarios can range
from a single ejection event to an almost continuous jet, and are highly user
configurable. Although the primary focus in the following paper is black hole
X-ray binary jets, the model is scale and source independent and could be used
for supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei or other flows such as
jets from neutron stars. Discrete packets of plasma (or `shells') are used to
simulate the jet volume. A two-shell collision gives rise to an internal shock,
which acts as an electron re-energization mechanism. Using a pseudo-random
distribution of the shell properties, the results show how for the first time
it is possible to reproduce a flat/inverted spectrum (associated with compact
radio jets) in a conical jet whilst taking the adiabatic energy losses into
account. Previous models have shown that electron re-acceleration is essential
in order to obtain a flat spectrum from an adiabatic conical jet: multiple
internal shocks prove to be efficient in providing this re-energization. We
also show how the high frequency turnover/break in the spectrum is correlated
with the jet power, $\nu_b \propto L_{\textrm W}^{\sim 0.6}$, and the
flat-spectrum synchrotron flux is correlated with the total jet power,
$F_{\nu}\propto L_{\textrm W}^{\sim 1.4}$. Both the correlations are in
agreement with previous analytical predictions.
