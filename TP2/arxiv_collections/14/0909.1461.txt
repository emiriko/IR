We study the effect of team and hierarchy on the waiting-time dynamics of
priority-queue networks. To this end, we introduce generalized priority-queue
network models incorporating interaction rules based on team-execution and
hierarchy in decision making, respectively. It is numerically found that the
waiting time distribution exhibits a power law for long waiting times in both
cases, yet with different exponents depending on the team size and the position
of queue nodes in the hierarchy, respectively. The observed power-law behaviors
have in many cases a corresponding single or pairwise-interacting queue
dynamics, suggesting that the pairwise interaction may constitute a major
dynamics consequence in the priority-queue networks. It is also found that the
reciprocity of influence is a relevant factor for the priority-queue network
dynamics
