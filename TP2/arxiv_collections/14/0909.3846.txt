[Abridged] We present a new deep 21-cm survey of the Andromeda galaxy, based
on high resolution observations performed with the Synthesis Telescope and the
26-m antenna at DRAO. The HI distribution and kinematics of the disc are
analyzed and basic dynamical properties are given. The rotation curve is
measured out to 38 kpc, showing a nuclear peak, a dip around 4 kpc, two
distinct flat parts and an increase in the outermost regions. Except for the
innermost regions, the axisymmetry of the gas rotation is very good. A very
strong warp of the HI disc is evidenced. The central regions appear less
inclined than the average disc inclination, while the outer regions appear more
inclined. Mass distribution models by LCDM NFW, Einasto or pseudo-isothermal
dark matter halos with baryonic components are presented. They fail to
reproduce the exact shape of the rotation curve. No significant differences are
measured between the various shapes of halo. The dynamical mass of M31 enclosed
within a radius of 38 kpc is (4.7 +/- 0.5) x 10^11 Msol. The dark matter
component is almost 4 times more massive than the baryonic mass inside this
radius. A total mass of 1.0 x 10^12 Msol is derived inside the virial radius.
New HI structures are discovered in the datacube, like the detection of up to
five HI components per spectrum, which is very rarely seen in other galaxies.
The most remarkable new HI structures are thin HI spurs and an external arm in
the disc outskirts. A relationship between these spurs and outer stellar clumps
is evidenced. The external arm is 32 kpc long, lies on the far side of the
galaxy and has no obvious counterpart on the other side of the galaxy. Its
kinematics clearly differs from the outer adjacent disc. Both these HI
perturbations could result from tidal interactions with galaxy companions.
