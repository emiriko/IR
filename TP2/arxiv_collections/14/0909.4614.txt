We report four probe impedance of La0.67Ba0.33MnO3 at f = 100 kHz under
different dc bias magnetic fields. The ac resistance (R) exhibits a peak around
Tp = 325 K which is accompanied by a rapid increase and a peak in the reactance
(X) in a zero field. The magnetoreactance exhibits a sharp peak close to Tp and
its magnitude (= 60% in H = 1 kG) exceeds that of the ac magnetoresistance (= 5
% inH = 1 kG). It is suggested that the magnetoreactance arises from changes in
the self inductance of the sample rather than the capacitance.
