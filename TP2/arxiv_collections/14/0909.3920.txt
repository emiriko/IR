Random interaction models have been successful in describing the amorphous
properties of solids such as spin-glasses and structural glasses. This
modelling approach is applied to a system of zero-spin cold bosons moving in an
amorphous environment. The bosons are given to interact according to a
non-random hard-core interaction. Additionally the bosons are subjected to a
random interaction potential similar to that used for glasses. The approach is
to apply a combination of replica methods and field theoretic techniques
developed for superfluid Bose systems. This leads to an equation for the
low-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate which is derived in the Hartree-Fock
approximation. The equation is similar to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, but
the hard-core coupling constant is renormalised by the presence of the random
interactions in a position dependent way. The amorphous contribution contains
the replica diagonal and off-diagonal Green's functions, for which the Dyson
equations are formulated.
