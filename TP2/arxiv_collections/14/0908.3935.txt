We consider theoretically the transport through the double quantum dot
structure of the recent experiment of C. Payette {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 102}, 026808 (2009)] and calculate stationary current and shotnoise.
Three-level mixing gives rise to a pronounced current suppression effect, the
character of which charges markedly with bias direction. We discuss these
results in connexion with the dark states of coherent population trapping in
quantum dots.
