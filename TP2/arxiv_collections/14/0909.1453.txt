The 4-dimensional abstract Kummer variety K^4 with 16 nodes leads to the K3
surface by resolving the 16 singularities. Here we present a simplicial
realization of this minimal resolution. Starting with a minimal 16-vertex
triangulation of K^4 we resolve its 16 isolated singularities - step by step -
by simplicial blowups. As a result we obtain a 17-vertex triangulation of the
standard PL K3 surface. A key step is the construction of a triangulated
version of the mapping cylinder of the Hopf map from the real projective
3-space onto the 2-sphere with the minimum number of vertices. Moreover we
study simplicial Morse functions and the changes of their levels between the
critical points. In this way we obtain slicings through the K3 surface of
various topological types.
