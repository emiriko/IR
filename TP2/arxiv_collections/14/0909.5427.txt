SHORTENED ABSTRACT: We study numerically the properties of spin- and
charge-transport in a nanoscale diffusive
superconductor$\mid$ferromagnet$\mid$superconductor junction when the
magnetization texture is non-uniform. Specifically, we incorporate the presence
of a Bloch/Neel domain walls and conical ferromagnetism, including spin-active
interfaces. The superconducting leads are assumed to be of s-wave type. We
investigate how the 0-$\pi$ transition is influenced by the inhomogeneous
magnetization texture and focus on the particular case where the charge-current
vanishes while the spin-current is non-zero. In the case of a Bloch/Neel
domain-wall, the spin-current can be seen only for one component of the spin
polarization, whereas in the case of conical ferromagnetism the spin-current
has the three components. We explain all of these results in terms of the
interplay between the triplet anomalous Green's function induced in the
ferromagnetic region and the local direction of the magnetization vector in the
ferromagnet. Interestingly, we find that the spin-current exhibits
discontinuous jumps at the 0--$\pi$ transition points of the critical
charge-current. We explain this result in terms of the different symmetry
obeyed by the current-phase relation when comparing the charge- and
spin-current. Specifically, we find that whereas the charge-current obeys the
well-known relation $I_c(\phi) = -I_c(2\pi-\phi)$, the spin-current satisfies
$I_s(\phi) = I_s(2\pi-\phi)$, where $\phi$ is the superconducting phase
difference.
