We discuss the proximate phases of a three-dimensional system with Dirac-like
dispersion. Using the cubic lattice with plaquette $\pi$-flux as a model, we
find, among others phases, a chiral topological insulator and singlet
topological superconductor. While the former requires a special "chiral"
symmetry, the latter is stable as long as time reversal and SU(2) spin rotation
symmetry are present. These phases are characterized by stable surface Dirac
fermion modes, and by an integer topological invariant in the bulk. The key
features of these phases are readily understood in a two dimensional limit with
an appropriate pairing of Dirac nodes between layers. This Dirac node-pairing
picture is also shown to apply to $Z_2$ topological insulators protected by
time-reversal symmetry (TRS). The nature of point-like topological defects in
these phases is also investigated, revealing an interesting duality relation
between these topological phases and the Neel phase.
