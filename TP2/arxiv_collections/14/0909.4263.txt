We present the first models of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals within the
effective-one-body (EOB) formalism, focusing on quasi-circular orbits into
non-rotating black holes. We show that the phase difference and (Newtonian
normalized) amplitude difference between analytical EOB and numerical
Teukolsky-based gravitational waveforms can be reduced to less than 10^(-1) rad
and less than 2 x 10^(-3), respectively, after a 2-year evolution. The
inclusion of post-Newtonian self-force terms in the EOB approach leads to a
phase disagreement of roughly 6-27 rad after a 2-year evolution. Such inclusion
could also allow for the EOB modeling of waveforms from intermediate-mass
ratio, quasi-circular inspirals.
