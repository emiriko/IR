We study the collision of two Bose-Einstein condensates with pure dipolar
interaction. A stationary pure dipolar condensate is known to be stable when
the atom number is below a critical value. However, collapse can occur during
the collision between two condensates due to local density fluctuations even if
the total atom number is only a fraction of the critical value. Using full
three-dimensional numerical simulations, we observe the collapse induced by
local density fluctuations. For the purpose of future experiments, we present
the time dependence of the density distribution, energy per particle and the
maximal density of the condensate. We also discuss the collapse time as a
function of the relative phase between the two condensates.
