We seek to understand the propagation mechanisms of positrons in the
interstellar medium (ISM). This understanding is a key to determine whether the
spatial distribution of the annihilation emission observed in our Galaxy
reflects the spatial distribution of positron sources and, therefore, makes it
possible to place constraints on the origin of positrons. We review the
different processes that are likely to affect the transport of positrons in the
ISM. These processes fall into three broad categories: scattering off
magnetohydrodynamic waves, collisions with particles of the interstellar gas
and advection with large-scale fluid motions. We assess the efficiency of each
process and describe its impact on the propagation of positrons. We also
develop a model of positron propagation, based on Monte-Carlo simulations,
which enable us to estimate the distances traveled by positrons in the
different phases of the ISM. We find that low-energy (< 10 MeV) positrons
generally have negligible interactions with magnetohydrodynamic waves, insofar
as these waves are heavily damped. Positron propagation is mainly controlled by
collisions with gas particles. Under these circumstances, positrons can travel
huge distances (up to 30 kpc/n_H for 1 MeV positrons) along magnetic field
lines before annihilating.
