We present a simple iterative strategy for measuring the connection strength
between a pair of vertices in a graph. The method is attractive in that it has
a linear complexity and can be easily parallelized. Based on an analysis of the
convergence property, we propose a mutually reinforcing model to explain the
intuition behind the strategy. The practical effectiveness of this measure is
demonstrated through several combinatorial optimization problems on graphs and
hypergraphs.
