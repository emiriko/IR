We report experiments on micron-scale normal metal loop connected by
superconducting wires, where the sample geometry enables full modulation of the
thermal activation barrier with applied magnetic flux, resembling a symmetric
quantum interference device. We find that except a constant factor of five, the
modulation of the barrier can be well fitted by the Ambegaokar-Halperin model
for a resistively shunted junction, extended here to a proximity junction with
flux-tunable coupling energy estimated using quasiclassical theory. This
observation sheds light on the understanding of effect of thermal fluctuation
in proximity junctions, while may also lead to an unprecedented level of
control in quantum interference devices.
