We present results from a study of the kinematic structure of star-forming
galaxies at redshift z~3 selected in the VVDS, using integral-field
spectroscopy of rest-frame optical nebular emission lines, in combination with
rest-frame UV spectroscopy, ground-based optical/near-IR and Spitzer
photometry. We also constrain the underlying stellar populations to address the
evolutionary status of these galaxies. We infer the kinematic properties of
four galaxies: VVDS-20298666, VVDS-020297772, VVDS-20463884 and VVDS-20335183
with redshifts z = 3.2917, 3.2878, 3.2776, and 3.7062, respectively. While
VVDS-20463884 presents an irregular velocity field with a peak in the local
velocity dispersion of the galaxy shifted from the centre of the galaxy,
VVDS-20298666 has a well-resolved gradient in velocity over a distance of ~4.5
kpc with a peak-to-peak amplitude of v = 91 km/s . We discovered that the
nearby galaxy, VVDS-020297772 (which shows traces of AGN activity), is in fact
a companion at a similar redshift with a projected separated of 12 kpc. In
contrast, the velocity field of VVDS-020335183 seems more consistent with a
merger on a rotating disk. However, all of the objects have a high local
velocity dispersion (sigma ~ 60-70 km/s), which gives v/sigma < 1. It is
unlikely that these galaxies are dynamically cold rotating disk of ionized gas.
