A time-dependent search for neutrino flares from pre-defined directions in
the whole sky is presented. The analysis uses a time clustering algorithm
combined with an unbinned likelihood method. This algorithm provides a search
for significant neutrino flares over time-scales that are not fixed a-priori
and that are not triggered by multiwavelength observations. The event selection
is optimized to maximize the discovery potential, taking into account different
time-scales of source activity and background rates. The method is applied to a
pre-defined list of bright and variable astrophysical sources using 22-string
IceCube data. No significant excess is found.
