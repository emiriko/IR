We propose two types of quantum dense coding communication networks with
optical continuous variables, in which a quadripartite entangled state of the
optical field with totally three-party correlations of quadrature amplitudes is
utilized. In the networks, the exchange of information between any two
participants can be manipulated by one or two of the remaining participants.
The channel capacities for a variety of communication protocols are numerically
calculated. Due to the fact that the quadripartite entangled states applied in
the communication systems have been successfully prepared already in the
laboratory, the proposed schemes are experimentally accessible at present.
