We examine the properties of the transfer function F_T = V_m / V_{LFP}
between the intracellular membrane potential (V_m) and the local field
potential (V_{LFP}) in cerebral cortex. We first show theoretically that, in
the subthreshold regime, the frequency dependence of the extracellular medium
and that of the membrane potential have a clear incidence on F_T. The
calculation of F_T from experiments and the matching with theoretical
expressions is possible for desynchronized states where individual current
sources can be considered as independent. Using a mean-field approximation, we
obtain a method to estimate the impedance of the extracellular medium without
injecting currents. We examine the transfer function for bipolar (differential)
LFPs and compare to simultaneous recordings of V_m and V_{LFP} during
desynchronized states in rat barrel cortex in vivo. The experimentally derived
F_T matches the one derived theoretically, only if one assumes that the
impedance of the extracellular medium is frequency-dependent, and varies as
1/sqrt(omega) (Warburg impedance) for frequencies between 3 and 500 Hz. This
constitutes indirect evidence that the extracellular medium is non-resistive,
which has many possible consequences for modeling LFPs.
