Transparent glasses of BaNaB9O15 (BNBO) were fabricated via the conventional
melt-quenching technique. The amorphous and the glassy nature of the
as-quenched samples were respectively, confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The glass transition and
crystallization parameters were evaluated under non-isothermal conditions using
DSC. The correlation between the heating rate dependent glass transition and
the crystallization temperatures was discussed and deduced the Kauzmann
temperature for BNBO glass-plates and powdered samples. The values of the
Kauzmann temperature for the plates and powdered samples were 776 K and 768 K,
respectively. Approximation-free method was used to evaluate the
crystallization kinetic parameters for the BNBO glass samples. The effect of
the sample thickness on the crystallization kinetics of BNBO glasses was also
investigated.
