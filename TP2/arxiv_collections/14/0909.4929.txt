We performed numerical simulations of dynamical encounters between hard
massive binaries and a very massive star (VMS; formed through runaway mergers
of ordinary stars in the dense core of a young massive star cluster), in order
to explore the hypothesis that this dynamical process could be responsible for
the origin of high-velocity (\geq 200-400 km/s) early or late B-type stars. We
estimated the typical velocities produced in encounters between very tight
massive binaries and VMSs (of mass of \geq 200 Msun) and found that about 3-4
per cent of all encounters produce velocities of \geq 400 km/s, while in about
2 per cent of encounters the escapers attain velocities exceeding the Milky
Ways's escape velocity. We therefore argue that the origin of high-velocity
(\geq 200-400 km/s) runaway stars and at least some so-called hypervelocity
stars could be associated with dynamical encounters between the tightest
massive binaries and VMSs formed in the cores of star clusters. We also
simulated dynamical encounters between tight massive binaries and single
ordinary 50-100 Msun stars. We found that from 1 to \simeq 4 per cent of these
encounters can produce runaway stars with velocities of \geq 300-400 km/s
(typical of the bound population of high-velocity halo B-type stars) and
occasionally (in less than 1 per cent of encounters) produce hypervelocity
(\geq 700 km/s) late B-type escapers.
