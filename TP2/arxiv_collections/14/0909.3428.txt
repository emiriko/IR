We investigate the electromechanical response of doubly clamped graphene
nanoribbons to a transverse gate voltage. An analytical model is developed to
predict the field-induced deformation of graphene nanoribbons as a function of
field intensity and graphene geometry. This model is validated thought
atomistic simulations using the combination of a constitutive charge-dipole
model and a pseudo-chemical many-body potential. As a newly observed effect of
electric polarization, this field-induced deflection allows the graphene to
oscillate at its natural frequency, which is found to decrease dramatically
with increasing graphene size.
