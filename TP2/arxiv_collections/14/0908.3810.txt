Following on our initial absorption-line analysis of fifteen novae spectra we
present additional evidence for the existence of two distinct components of
novae ejecta having different origins. As argued in Paper I one component is
the rapidly expanding gas ejected from the outer layers of the white dwarf by
the outburst. The second component is pre-existing outer, more slowly expanding
circumbinary gas that represents ejecta from the secondary star or accretion
disk. We present measurements of the emission-line widths that show them to be
significantly narrower than the broad P Cygni profiles that immediately precede
them. The emission profiles of novae in the nebular phase are distinctly
rectangular, i.e., strongly suggestive of emission from a relatively thin,
roughly spherical shell. We thus interpret novae spectral evolution in terms of
the collision between the two components of ejecta, which converts the early
absorption spectrum to an emission-line spectrum within weeks of the outburst.
The narrow emission widths require the outer circumbinary gas to be much more
massive than the white dwarf ejecta, thereby slowing the latter's expansion
upon collision. The presence of a large reservoir of circumbinary gas at the
time of outburst is suggestive that novae outbursts may sometime be triggered
by collapse of gas onto the white dwarf, as occurs for dwarf novae, rather than
steady mass transfer through the inner Lagrangian point.
