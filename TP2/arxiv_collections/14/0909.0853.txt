We theoretically and numerically present the hybrid phonon modes for the
double heterostructure GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs and their interactions with electrons.
More specifically, we have calculated the electron capture within a symmetric
quantum well via the emission of hybrid phonons. Our investigation shows that
the capture rates via the hybrid phonons are matched to the rates predicted by
the dielectric continuum (DC) model and the concentration of aluminium which is
an important parameter for controlling the electron capture process in light
emitting diodes (LED).
