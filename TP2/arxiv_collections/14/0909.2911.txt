We have succeeded in growing single crystals of orthorhombic CeT2Al10 (T=Fe,
Ru, Os) by Al self-flux method for the first time, and measured the electrical
resistivity at pressures up to 8 GPa, the magnetic susceptibility and specific
heat at ambient pressure. These results indicate that CeT2Al10 belongs to the
heavy fermion compounds. CeRu2Al10 and CeOs2Al10 show a similar phase
transition at T0 = 27.3 and 28.7 K, respectively. The temperature dependences
in the ordered phases are well described by the thermally activated form,
suggesting that partial gap opens over the Fermi surfaces below T0. When
pressure is applied to CeRu2Al10, T0 disappears suddenly between 3 and 4 GPa,
and CeRu2Al10 turns into a Kondo insulator, followed by a metal. The similarity
of CeT2Al10 under respective pressures suggests a scaling relation by some
parameter controlling the unusual physics in these compounds.
