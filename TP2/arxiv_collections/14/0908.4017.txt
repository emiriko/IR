We present magnetic and transport properties of PrRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ single
crystals which exhibit antiferromagnetic order below T$_{N}$ = 68 K. Well
defined anomalies due to magnetic phase transition are observed in magnetic
susceptibility, resistivity, and specific heat data. The T$_{N}$ of 68 K for
PrRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ is much higher than 5.4 K expected on the basis of de-Gennes
scaling. The magnetic susceptibility data reveal strong uniaxial anisotropy in
this compound similar to that of PrCo$_{2}$Si$_{2}$. With increasing pressure
T$_{N}$ increases monotonically up to T$_N$ = 71.5 K at 22.5 kbar.
