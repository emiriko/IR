We use our numerical code, DRAGON, to study the implications of recent data
on our knowledge of the propagation properties of cosmic ray nuclei in the
Galaxy. We show that B/C (as well as N/O and C/O) data, including those
recently taken by CREAM, and ${\bar p}/p$ data, especially including recent
PAMELA results, can consistently be fitted within a unique
diffusion-reacceleration model. The requirement that light nuclei and $\bar p$
data are consistently reproduced within experimental uncertainties places
significant limits on the main propagation parameters. In particular, we find
the allowed range of the diffusion coefficient spectral index to be $0.3 <
\delta < 0.6$ at 95% confidence level and that Kraichnan type diffusion is
favored with respect to Kolmogorov. While some amount of reacceleration is
required, only a limited range of the Alfv\'en velocity value ($10 \simleq v_A
\simleq 20 \km \s^{-1}$) is allowed by a combined analysis of nuclear and
antiproton data, which we perform here for the first time. If antiproton data
are not used to constrain the propagation parameters, a larger set of models is
allowed. In this case, we determine which combinations of the relevant
parameters maximize and minimize the antiproton flux under the condition of
still fitting light nuclei data at 95% C.L. These models may then be used to
constrain a possible extra antiproton component arising from astrophysical or
exotic sources (e.g. dark matter annihilation or decay).
