4U 2206+54 is a high mass X-ray binary which has been suspected to contain a
neutron star accreting from the wind of its companion BD +53 2790. Reig et al.
have recently detected 5560 s period pulsations in both RXTE and INTEGRAL
observations which they conclude are due to the spin of the neutron star. We
present observations made with Suzaku which are contemporaneous with their RXTE
observation of this source. We find strong pulsations at a period of 5554 +/- 9
s in agreement with their results. We also present a reanalysis of BeppoSAX
observations of 4U 2206+54 made in 1998, in which we find strong pulsations at
a period of 5420 +/- 28 seconds, revealing a spin-down trend in this
long-period accreting pulsar. Analysis of these data suggests that the neutron
star in this system is an accretion-powered magnetar.
