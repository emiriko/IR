We present the asymptotically AdS solutions of the Einstein gravity with
hyperbolic horizons in the presence of $So(n(n-1)/2-1, 1)$ Yang-Mills fields
governed by the non-Abelian Born-Infeld lagrangian. We investigate the
properties of these solutions as well as their asymptotic behavior in varies
dimensions. The properties of these kind of solutions are like the
Einstein-Yang-Mills solutions. But the differences seems to appear in the role
of the mass, charge and born-Infeld parameter $\beta$, in the solutions. For
example in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory the solutions with non-negative mass
cannot present an extreme black hole while that of in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Born
Infeld theory can. Also the singularities in higher dimensional
Einstein-Yang-Mills theory for non-negative mass are always spacelike, while
depending on choosing the parameters, we can find timelike singularities in the
similar case of Einstein-Yang-Mills-Born-Infeld theory. We also extend the
solutions of Einstein to the case of Gauss-Bonnet and Lovelock gravity. It is
shown that, these solutions in the limits of $\beta\to0$, and $\beta\to\infty$,
represent pure gravity and gravity coupled with Yang-Mills fields,
respectively.
