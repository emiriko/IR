We consider a model of classical noncommutative particle in an external
electromagnetic field. For this model, we prove the existence of generalized
gauge transformations. Classical dynamics in Hamiltonian and Lagrangian form is
discussed, in particular, the motion in the constant magnetic field is studied
in detail.
