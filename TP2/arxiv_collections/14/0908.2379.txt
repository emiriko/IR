We have proposed a kind of nonvolatile resistive switching memory based on
amorphous LaLuO3, which has already been established as a promising candidate
of high-k gate dielectric employed in transistors. Well-developed unipolar
switching behaviors in amorphous LaLuO3 make it suited for not only logic but
memory applications using the conventional semiconductor or the emerging
nano/CMOS architectures. The conduction transition between high- and low-
resistance states is attributed to the change in the separation between oxygen
vacancy sites in the light of the correlated barrier hopping theory. The mean
migration distances of vacancies responsible for the resistive switching are
demonstrated in nanoscale, which could account for the ultrafast programming
speed of 6 ns. The origin of the distributions in switching parameters in
oxides can be well understood according to the switching principle.
Furthermore, an approach has also been developed to make the operation voltages
predictable for the practical applications of resistive memories.
