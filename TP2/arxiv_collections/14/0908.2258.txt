In this paper, we study gamma ray spectra for various scenarios of dark
matter annihilation and decay. We focus on processes which generate only
high-energy photons or leptons and photons, but no proton-antiproton pairs, to
be compatible with PAMELA's data. We investigate photons produced directly from
two-body decay chains and photons produced together with charged particles. For
the former case we also include the process DM(+DM) -> N phi -> 2N gamma which
can arise from specific strongly-coupled dark matter scenarios. For the latter
case, photons are either generated by final state radiation from high-energy
leptons or are directly generated from contact interactions represented by
higher-order (non-renormalizable) operators obtained after integrating out
heavy modes. We compare their overall annihilation cross-sections/decay rates
taking into account chiral suppression (in the s-wave approximation), dimension
of operators and dark matter particle properties. A rough estimate shows that,
for a dark matter particle with a mass of O(1 TeV), the hard photon spectra in
direct electron-positron-photon final states arising from either scalar boson
dark matter annihilation/decay or Majorana fermion dark matter annihilation are
dominated by higher-order operators if the scale of the leading operator is
lower than O(1000 TeV). Otherwise, all the photon spectra arising in this way
are dominated by final state radiation. Among the spectra studied, the
higher-order operators spectrum is the hardest while the final state radiation
spectrum with an intermediate decay is the softest.
