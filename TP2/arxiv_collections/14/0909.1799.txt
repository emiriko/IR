We review for non-experts possible phenomenological scenari in String Theory.
In particular we focus on vacuum configurations with intersecting and/or
magnetized unoriented D-branes. We will show how a TeV scale tension may be
compatible with the existence of Large Extra Dimensions and how anomalous
U(1)'s can give rise to interesting signatures at LHC or in cosmic rays.
Finally, we discuss unoriented D-brane instantons as a source of
non-perturbative effects that can contribute to moduli stabilization and susy
braking in combination with fluxes. We conclude with an outlook and directions
for future work.
