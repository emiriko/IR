The passively evolving stellar population in elliptical galaxies (Es)
provides a continuous source of fuel for accretion on the central supermassive
black hole (SMBH), which is 1) extended over the entire galaxy life (but
declining with cosmic time), 2) linearly proportional to the stellar mass of
the host spheroid, 3) summing up to a total gas mass that is >100 times larger
than the currently observed SMBH masses, 4) available independently of merging
events. The main results of numerical simulations of Es with central SMBH, in
which a physically based implementation of radiative and mechanical feedback
effects is considered, are presented.
