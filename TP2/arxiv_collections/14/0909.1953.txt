A minimal version of the inverse seesaw model featuring only two pairs of
TeV-scale singlet neutrinos is discussed from the perspective of non-standard
neutrino interactions. A particular attention is paid to the non-standard
patterns of flavour and CP violation emerging due to the possibly enhanced
non-decoupling effects of the heavy sector and the associated non-unitarity of
the effective lepton mixing matrix.
