We study the spin edge states, induced by the combined effect of spin-orbit
interaction (SOI) and hard-wall confining potential, in a two-dimensional
electron system, exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an exact
solution of the problem and show that the spin resolved edge states are
separated in space. The SOI generated rearrangement of the spectrum results in
a peaked behavior of the net spin current versus the Fermi energy. The
predicted oscillations of the spin current with a period, determined by the SOI
renormalized cyclotron energy, can serve as an effective tool for controlling
the spin motion in spintronic devices.
