A new analogy between superfluid systems and cosmology is here presented,
which relies strongly on the following ingredient: the back-reaction of the
vacuum to the quanta of sound waves. We show how the presence of thermal
phonons, the excitations above the quantum vacuum for $T> 0$, enable us to
deduce an hydrodynamical equation formally similar to the one obtained for a
perfect fluid in a Universe obeying the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric.
