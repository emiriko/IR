We investigate the geometric phase or Berry phase of adiabatic quantum
evolution in the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) systems governed by nonlinear
Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equations. We study how this phase is modified by the
nonlinearity and find that the Bogoliubov fluctuations around the eigenstates
are accumulated during the nonlinear adiabatic evolution and contribute a
finite phase of geometric nature. A two-mode BEC model is used to illustrate
our theory. Our theory is applicable to other nonlinear systems such as
paraxial wave equation for nonlinear optics and Ginzburg-Landau equations for
complex order parameters in condensed-matter physics.
