This paper completes and extends some earlier studies by the author to show
that Morris-Thorne wormholes are compatible with quantum field theory. The
strategy is to strike a balance between reducing the size of the unavoidable
exotic region and the degree of fine-tuning of the metric coefficients required
to achieve this reduction, while simultaneously satisfying the constraints from
quantum field theory. The fine-tuning also serves to satisfy various
traversabilty criteria such as tidal constraints and proper distances through
the wormhole. The degree of fine-tuning turns out to be a generic feature of
the type of wormhole discussed.
