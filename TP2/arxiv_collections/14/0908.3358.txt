We discuss a protected quantum computation process based on a hexagon
Josephson junction array. Qubits are encoded in the punctured array, which is
topologically protected. The degeneracy is related to the number of holes. The
topological degeneracy is lightly shifted by tuning the flux through specific
hexagons. We also show how to perform single qubit operation and basic quantum
gate operations in this system.
