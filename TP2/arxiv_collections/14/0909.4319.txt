We study both experimentally and theoretically the generation of photon pairs
by spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in standard birefringent optical fibers.
The ability to produce a range of two-photon spectral states, from highly
correlated (entangled) to completely factorable, by means of cross-polarized
birefringent phase matching, is explored. A simple model is developed to
predict the spectral state of the photon pair which shows how this can be
adjusted by choosing the appropriate pump bandwidth, fiber length and
birefringence. Spontaneous Raman scattering is modeled to determine the
tradeoff between SFWM and background Raman noise, and the predicted results are
shown to agree with experimental data.
