Single-particle excitation spectra of gamma-Fe in the paramagnetic state have
been investigated by means of the first-principles dynamical coherent potential
approximation theory which has recently been developed. It is found that the
central peak in the density of states consisting of the t2g bands is destroyed
by electron correlations, and the Mott-Hubbard type correlated bands appear.
The results indicate that the gamma-Fe can behave as correlated electrons at
high temperatures.
