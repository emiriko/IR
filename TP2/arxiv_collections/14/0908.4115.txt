In this work we provide a list of 200 crystal entries in the Inorganic
Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) that have errors, incomplete information, or
are given a generic name of zeolite when they may belong to a different family
of crystals. We also provide a table containing the ICSD code number of 1473
