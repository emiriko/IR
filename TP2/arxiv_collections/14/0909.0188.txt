We consider several orthogonal quantum groups satisfying the easiness
assumption axiomatized in our previous paper. For each of them we discuss the
computation of the asymptotic law of Tr(u^k) with respect to the Haar measure,
u being the fundamental representation. For the classical groups O_n, S_n we
recover in this way some well-known results of Diaconis and Shahshahani.
