We focus on Horava-Lifshitz (HL) theory of gravity, and, in particular, on
the Kehagias and Sfetsos s solution that is the analog of Schwarzschild black
hole of General Relativity. In the weak-field and slow-motion approximation we
analytically work out the secular precession of the longitude of the pericentre
of a test particle induced by this solution. Its analytical form is different
from that of the general relativistic Einstein's pericentre precession. Then,
we compare it to the latest determinations of the corrections to the standard
Newtonian/ Einsteinian planetary perihelion precessions recently estimated by
E.V. Pitjeva with the EPM2008 ephemerides. It turns out that the planets of the
solar system, taken singularly one at a time, allow to put lower bounds on the
adimensional HL parameter \psi_0 of the order of 10^-12 (Mercury) 10^-24
(Pluto). They are not able to account for the Pioneer anomalous acceleration
for r > 20 AU.
