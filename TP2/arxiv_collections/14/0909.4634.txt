The magnetic properties of a monolayer of Fe4 single molecule magnets grafted
onto a Au (111) thin film have been investigated using low energy muon spin
rotation. The properties of the monolayer are compared to bulk Fe4. We find
that the magnetic properties in the monolayer are consistent with those
measured in the bulk, strongly indicating that the single molecule magnet
nature of Fe4 is preserved in a monolayer. However, differences in the
temperature dependencies point to a small difference in their energy scale. We
attribute this to a ~60% increase in the intramolecular magnetic interactions
in the monolayer.
