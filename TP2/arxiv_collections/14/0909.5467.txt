In this paper, we present a few measurements done at the D0 experiment at the
Fermilab Tevatron Collider. These measurements include the triple differential
cross sections of the photon and associated jet production, the photon and
heavy flavour (b and c) jet, and finally, study of the event with double parton
scattering using photon+3 jets events. Each section below presents a brief
description of those measurements and results.
