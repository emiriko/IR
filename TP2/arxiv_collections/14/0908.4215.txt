Recent measurements at RHIC suggest that a nearly perfect fluid of quarks and
gluons is produced in AA collisions. Moreover the passage of supersonic partons
through this medium seems to produce waves. These waves might pile up and form
Mach cones, which would manifest themselves in the so called away-side jets,
forming a broad structure in the angular distribution of the particles
recoiling against a trigger jet of moderate energy. In most of the theoretical
descriptions of these phenomena, the hydrodynamic equations are linearized for
simplicity. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed broadening
of the away-side peak. It is based on hydrodynamics but it is a consequence of
the non-linearities of the equations, which instead of simple waves may lead to
localized waves or even solitons.
  We investigate in detail the consequences of including the non-linear terms.
We use a simple equation of state for the QGP and expand the hydrodynamic
equations around equilibrium configurations. The resulting differential
equations describe the propagation of perturbations in the energy density. We
solve them numerically and find that localized perturbations can propagate for
long distances in the plasma. Under certain conditions our solutions mimick the
propagation of Korteweg - de Vries solitons.
