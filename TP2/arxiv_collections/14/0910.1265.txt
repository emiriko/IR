We provide a comprehensive review of hadronic decays of D and D_s mesons. We
discuss current theoretical and experimental challenges and successes in
understanding of hadronic transitions of those mesons. A brief overview of the
theoretical and experimental tools are given before discussing the absolute
branching fractions for D and D_s mesons. Cabibbo suppressed and rare hadronic
decays are discussed and compared with theory before discussing our
understanding of hadronic multibody decays.
