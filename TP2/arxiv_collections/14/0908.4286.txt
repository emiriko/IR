The total cross sections for the 120Te(p,gamma)121I and 120Te(p,n)120I
reactions have been measured by the activation method in the effective
center-of-mass energies between 2.47 MeV and 7.93 MeV. The targets were
prepared by evaporation of 99.4 % isotopically enriched 120Te on Aluminum and
Carbon backing foils, and bombarded with proton beams provided by the FN tandem
accelerator at the University of Notre Dame. The cross sections and $S$ factors
were deduced from the observed gamma ray activity, which was detected off-line
by two Clover HPGe detectors mounted in close geometry. The results are
presented and compared with the predictions of statistical model calculations
using the codes NON-SMOKER and TALYS.
