We present a liquid crystal method of correcting the phase of an aberrated
wavefront using a spatial light modulator. A simple and efficient lab model has
been demonstrated for wavefront correction. The crux of a wavefront correcting
system in an adaptive optics system lies in the speed and the image quality
that can be achieved. The speeds and the accuracy of wavefront representation
using Zernike polynomials have been presented using a very fast method of
computation.
