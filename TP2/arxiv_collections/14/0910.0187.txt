One of the most common basic techniques for improving the performance of web
applications is caching frequently accessed data in fast data stores,
colloquially known as cache daemons. In this paper we present a cache daemon
suitable for storing complex data while maintaining fine-grained control over
data storage, retrieval and expiry. Data manipulation in this cache daemon is
performed via standard SQL statements so we call it SQLcached. It is a
practical, usable solution already implemented in several large web sites.
