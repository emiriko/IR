We begin by reviewing a technique to approximate the dynamics of stochastic
programs --written in a stochastic process algebra-- by a hybrid system,
suitable to capture a mixed discrete/continuous evolution. In a nutshell, the
discrete dynamics is kept stochastic while the continuous evolution is given in
terms of ODEs, and the overall technique, therefore, naturally associates a
Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process with a stochastic program. The specific
contribution in this work consists in an increase of the flexibility of the
translation scheme, obtained by allowing a dynamic reconfiguration of the
degree of discreteness/continuity of the semantics. We also discuss the
relationships of this approach with other hybrid simulation strategies for
biochemical systems.
