Electron transport properties through single conjugated molecules sandwiched
between two non-superconducting electrodes are studied by the use of Green's
function technique. Based on the tight-binding model, we do parametric
calculations to characterize the electron transport through such molecular
bridges. The electron transport properties are significantly influenced by (a)
the existence of localizing groups in these conjugated molecules and (b) the
molecule to electrode coupling strength, and, here we focus our results in
these two aspects.
