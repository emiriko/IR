The modulation of high-energy transients' (or steadily emitting sources')
light curves due to the imperfect alignment of the detector's view axis with
the spin axis in a spin-stabilized satellite is derived. It is shown how the
orientation of the detector's view axis with respect to the satellite's spin
axis may be estimated using observed light curves. The effects of statistical
fluctuations are considered. Conversely, it is shown how the attitude of a
spin-axis stabilized satellite as well as the unknown position of a celestial
source of high-energy photons may be determined using a detector whose
view-axis is intentionally kept inclined and is known accurately beforehand.
The case of three-axes stabilized satellites is also discussed.
