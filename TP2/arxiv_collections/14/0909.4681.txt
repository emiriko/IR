We calculate explicitly the Betti numbers of a class of barely G2 manifolds -
that is, G2 manifolds that are realised as a product of a Calabi-Yau manifold
and a circle, modulo an involution. The particular class which we consider are
those spaces where the Calabi-Yau manifolds are complete intersections of
hypersurfaces in products of complex projective spaces and the involutions are
free acting.
