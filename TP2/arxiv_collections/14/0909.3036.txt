For a general model of a mesoscopic multi-level quantum dot, we determine the
necessary conditions for the existence of an anomalous Josephson current with
spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. They correspond to a finite
spin-orbit coupling, a suitably oriented Zeeman field, and the dot being a
chiral conductor. We provide analytical expressions for the anomalous
supercurrent covering a wide parameter regime.
