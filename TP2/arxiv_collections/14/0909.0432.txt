Our statistics on Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) shows that the electrons
temperature ($T$) of hard X-ray and the shock waves traveling velocity
($\upsilon$) decreases with ages ($t$) for all-sort remnants. However, the
shock waves swept-up mass ($M_{su}$) of ISM increases with the age. Second, the
remnant radio fluxes ($S$) at 1 GHz increase slightly with ISM electrons
density ($n_0$). At last, the number distributions illustrate that the
supernovae (SNe) initial kinetic energy ($E_0$), hydrogen column density
($N_H$), electrons temperature (kT) of hard X-ray, magnetic field ($B$) and the
shock waves swept-up mass ($M_{su}$) of ISM mainly peaked at $(1 \sim 10)
\times 10^{50}$ ergs, $(1 \sim 10)\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, a few KeV, 100
$\mu$G and 10$\sim$100 $M_{\odot}$, respectively.
