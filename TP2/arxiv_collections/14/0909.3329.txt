Several lines of evidence suggest that quantum gravity at very short
distances may behave effectively as a two-dimensional theory. I summarize these
hints, and offer an additional argument based on the strong-coupling limit of
the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The resulting scenario suggests a novel approach
to quantum gravity at the Planck scale.
