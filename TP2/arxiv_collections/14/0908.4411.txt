A variational treatment of the Gutzwiller - renormalized t-J Hamiltonian
combined with the mean-field (MF) approximation is proposed, with a
simultaneous inclusion of additional consistency conditions. Those conditions
guarantee that the averages calculated variationally represent true mean-field
expectation values. This is not ensured a priori when the effective Hamiltonian
contains renormalization factors which depend on the mean-field averages. A
comparison with previous mean-field treatments is made for both superconducting
(d-RVB) and normal states and encompasses calculations of both the
superconducting gap and the renormalized hopping amplitudes, as well as the
electronic structure. The $C_{4v}$-symmetry breaking in the normal phase - the
Pomeranchuk instability (PI) - is also analyzed.
