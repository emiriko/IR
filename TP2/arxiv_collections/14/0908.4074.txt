Grouping images into semantically meaningful categories using low-level
visual feature is a challenging and important problem in content-based image
retrieval. The groupings can be used to build effective indices for an image
database. Digital image analysis techniques are being used widely in remote
sensing assuming that each terrain surface category is characterized with
spectral signature observed by remote sensors. Even with the remote sensing
images of IRS data, integration of spatial information is expected to assist
and to improve the image analysis of remote sensing data. In this paper we
present a satellite image retrieval based on a mixture of old fashioned ideas
and state of the art learning tools. We have developed a methodology to
classify remote sensing images using HSV color features and Haar wavelet
texture features and then grouping them on the basis of particular threshold
value. The experimental results indicate that the use of color and texture
feature extraction is very useful for image retrieval.
