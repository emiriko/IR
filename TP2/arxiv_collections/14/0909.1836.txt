We present the time evolution of viscously accreting circumstellar disks as
they are irradiated by ultraviolet and X-ray photons from a low-mass central
star. Our model is a hybrid of a 1D time-dependent viscous disk model coupled
to a 1+1D disk vertical structure model used for calculating the disk structure
and photoevaporation rates. We find that disks of initial mass 0.1M_o around
1M_o stars survive for 4x10^6 years, assuming a viscosity parameter
$\alpha=0.01$, a time-dependent FUV luminosity $L_{FUV}~10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ L_o
and with X-ray and EUV luminosities $L_X \sim L_{EUV} ~ 10^{-3}$L_o. We find
that FUV/X-ray-induced photoevaporation and viscous accretion are both
important in depleting disk mass. Photoevaporation rates are most significant
at ~ 1-10 AU and at >~ 30 AU. Viscosity spreads the disk which causes mass loss
by accretion onto the central star and feeds mass loss by photoevaporation in
the outer disk. We find that FUV photons can create gaps in the inner,
planet-forming regions of the disk (~ 1-10 AU) at relatively early epochs in
disk evolution while disk masses are still substantial. EUV and X-ray photons
are also capable of driving gaps, but EUV can only do so at late, low
accretion-rate epochs after the disk mass has already declined substantially.
Disks around stars with predominantly soft X-ray fields experience enhanced
photoevaporative mass loss. We follow disk evolution around stars of different
masses, and find that disk survival time is relatively independent of mass for
stars with M <~ 3M_o; for M >~ 3M_o the disks are short-lived(~10^5 years).
