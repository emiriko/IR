The role of geometrical frustration in strongly interacting bosonic systems
is studied with a combined numerical and analytical approach. We demonstrate
the existence of a novel quantum phase featuring both Bose-Einstein
condensation and spin-glass behaviour. The differences between such a phase and
the otherwise insulating "Bose glasses" are elucidated.
