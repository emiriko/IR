The paper reviews recent experiments on tritium beta spectroscopy searching
for the absolute value of the electron neutrino mass $m(\nu_e)$. By use of
dedicated electrostatic filters with high acceptance and resolution, the
uncertainty on the observable $m^2(\nu_e)$ has been pushed down to about 3
eV$^2$. The new upper limit of the mass is $m(\nu_e) < 2$ eV at 95% C.L. In
view of erroneous and unphysical mass results obtained by some earlier
experiments in beta decay, particular attention is paid to systematic effects.
The mass limit is discussed in the context of current neutrino research in
particle- and astrophysics. A preview is given of the next generation of beta
spectroscopy experiments currently under development and construction; they aim
at lowering the $m^2(\nu_e)$-uncertainty by another factor of 100, reaching a
sensitivity limit $m(\nu_e) < 0.2$ eV.
