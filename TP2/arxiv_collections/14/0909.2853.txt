We perform a deep search for galaxies in the redshift range 6.5<z<7.5, to
measure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in this
redshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of their
Luminosity Function. We present here the first results of an ESO Large Program,
that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in the
near-IR by the camera Hawk-I at the VLT. We have obtained two Hawk-I pointings
on the GOODS South field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90
arcmin2. The images reach Y=26.7 mags for the two fields. We have used public
ACS images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteria
Z-Y>1, Y-J<1.5 and Y-K<2. The other public data in the UBVRIJHK bands are used
to reject possible low redshift interlopers. The output has been compared with
extensive Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of our
selection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. We detect 7
high quality candidates in the magnitude range Y=25.5-26.7. This interval
samples the critical range for M* at z>6 (M_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). After
accounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidence
level a Luminosity Function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including the
effects of cosmic variance. For galaxies brighter than M_1500=-19.0 we derive a
luminosity density rho_UV=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/Hz/Mpc3, implying a
decrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. On the basis of our findings, we
make predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,
based on ULTRA-VISTA, HST-WFC3 or JWST-NIRCam, evaluating the best
observational strategy to maximise their impact.
