It is generally acknowledged that neither the Klein-Gordon equation nor the
Dirac Hamiltonian can produce sound solitary-particle relativistic quantum
mechanics due to the ill effects of their negative-energy solutions; instead
their field-quantized wavefunctions are reinterpreted as dealing with particle
and antiparticle simultaneously--despite the clear physical distinguishability
of antiparticle from particle and the empirically known slight breaking of the
underlying CP invariance. The natural square-root Hamiltonian of the free
relativistic solitary particle is iterated to obtain the Klein-Gordon equation
and linearized to obtain the Dirac Hamiltonian, steps that have calculational
but not physical motivation, and which generate the above-mentioned problematic
negative-energy solutions as extraneous artifacts. Since the natural square
root Hamiltonian for the free relativistic solitary particle contrariwise
produces physically unexceptionable quantum mechanics, this article focuses on
extending that Hamiltonian to describe a solitary particle (of either spin 0 or
spin one-half) in relativistic interaction with an external electromagnetic
field. That is achieved by use of Lorentz-covariant solitary-particle four
momentum techniques together with the assumption that well-known
nonrelativistic dynamics applies in the particle's rest frame.
Lorentz-invariant solitary particle actions, whose formal Hamiltonization is an
equivalent alternative approach, are as well explicitly displayed. It is
proposed that two separate solitary-particle wavefunctions, one for a particle
and the other for its antiparticle, be independently quantized in lieu of
"reinterpreting" negative energy solutions--which indeed don't even afflict
proper solitary particles.
