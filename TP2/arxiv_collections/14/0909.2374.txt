We calculate the dependence on intermediate scale of the gaugino mass ratios
upon breaking of SO(10) into the SM via an intermediate group $H$. We see that
the ratios change significantly when the intermediate scale is low (say, $10^8$
GeV or 1 Tev) compared to the case when the two breakings occur at the same
scale.
