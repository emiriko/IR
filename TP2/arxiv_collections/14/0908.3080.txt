In this work, we extract the QCD Equation of State (EoS) using experimental
results of the $\phi$ meson produced in nuclear collisions at AGS, SPS and RHIC
energies. The data are confronted to simple thermodynamic expectations and
lattice results. The experimental data indicate a first order phase transition,
with a mixed phase stretching energy density between $\sim$ 1 and 3.2
GeV/$fm^3$.
