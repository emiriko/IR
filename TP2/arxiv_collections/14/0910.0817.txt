Biometrics technologies are gaining popularity today since they provide more
reliable and efficient means of authentication and verification. Keystroke
Dynamics is one of the famous biometric technologies, which will try to
identify the authenticity of a user when the user is working via a keyboard.
The authentication process is done by observing the change in the typing
pattern of the user. A comprehensive survey of the existing keystroke dynamics
methods, metrics, different approaches are given in this study. This paper also
discusses about the various security issues and challenges faced by keystroke
dynamics.
