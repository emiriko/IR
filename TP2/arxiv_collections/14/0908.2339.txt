The GOES X1.5 class flare that occurred on August 30,2002 at 1327:30 UT is
one of the few events detected so far at submillimeter wavelengths. We present
a detailed analysis of this flare combining radio observations from 1.5 to 212
GHz (an upper limit of the flux is also provided at 405 GHz) and X-ray.
Although the observations of radio emission up to 212 GHz indicates that
relativistic electrons with energies of a few MeV were accelerated, no
significant hard X-ray emission was detected by RHESSI above ~ 250 keV. Images
at 12--20 and 50--100 keV reveal a very compact, but resolved, source of about
~ 10" x 10". EUV TRACE images show a multi-kernel structure suggesting a
complex (multipolar) magnetic topology. During the peak time the radio spectrum
shows an extended flatness from ~ 7 to 35 GHz. Modeling the optically thin part
of the radio spectrum as gyrosynchrotron emission we obtained the electron
spectrum (spectral index delta, instantaneous number of emitting electrons). It
is shown that in order to keep the expected X-ray emission from the same
emitting electrons below the RHESSI background at 250 keV, a magnetic field
above 500 G is necessary. On the other hand, the electron spectrum deduced from
radio observations >= 50 GHz is harder than that deduced from ~ 70 - 250 keV
X-ray data, meaning that there must exist a breaking energy around a few
hundred keV. During the decay of the impulsive phase, a hardening of the X-ray
spectrum is observed which is interpreted as a hardening of the electron
distribution spectrum produced by the diffusion due to Coulomb collisions of
the trapped electrons in a medium with an electron density of n_e ~ 3E10 - 5E10
cm-3.
