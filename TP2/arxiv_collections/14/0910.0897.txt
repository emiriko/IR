We analyze the consequences of Lorentz violation (LV) to three-generation
neutrino oscillation in the massless neutrino sector. We present a general
formalism of three-family neutrino oscillation with neutrino flavor states
being mixing states of energy eigenstates. It is also found that the mixing
parts could strongly depend on neutrino energy by special choices of Lorentz
violation parameters. By confronting with the existing experimental data on
neutrino oscillation, the upper bounds on LV parameters are derived. Because
the oscillation amplitude could vary with the neutrino energy, neutrino
experiments with energy dependence may test and constrain the Lorentz violation
scenario for neutrino oscillation.
