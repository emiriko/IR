While measuring the ratio R_K = \Gamma(K+e2(\gamma))/\Gamma(K+\mu2(\gamma)),
the KLOE Collaboration has studied the radiative process Ke2\gamma. The ratio
of the width for the Ke2\gamma decay with a positively polarized photon from
structure-dependent radiation to the inclusive K\mu2(\gamma) width is found to
be 1.484(68) 10-5. The observed radiation spectrum agrees with predictions from
chiral perturbation theory and is in contrast with predictions based on the
light front quark model. This result reduces the contribution to systematic
uncertainties on measurements of R_K. In a separate study, KLOE has measured
the ratio of the radiative Ke3\gamma decay width to the inclusive Ke3(\gamma)
width to be 924(28) 10-5. The distribution in energy and angle of the radiative
photon has been analyzed in an attempt to isolate the signature from
interference of the inner-bremsstrahlung and structure-dependent amplitudes.
