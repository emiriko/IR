In the year 2005 Jorge Hirsch introduced the h index for quantifying the
research output of scientists. Today, the h index is a widely accepted
indicator of research performance. The h index has been criticized for its
insufficient reliability - the ability to discriminate reliably between
meaningful amounts of research performance. Taking as an example an extensive
data set with bibliometric data on scientists working in the field of molecular
biology, we compute h2 lower, h2 upper, and sRM values and present them as
complementary approaches that improve the reliability of the h index research
performance measurement.
