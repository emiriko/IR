We explore the scalar phenomenology of a model of electroweak scale neutrinos
that incorporates the presence of a lepton number violating singlet scalar. An
analysis of the pseudoscalar-Majoron field associated to this singlet field is
carried out in order to verify the viability of the model and to restrict its
parameter space. In particular we study the Majoron decay $J \to \nu \nu$ and
use the bounds on the Majoron mass and width obtained in a modified Majoron
Decaying Dark Matter scenario.
