Given a collection of N asymptotically Euclidean ends with zero scalar
curvature, we construct a Riemannian manifold with zero scalar curvature and
one asymptotically Euclidean end, whose boundary has a neighborhood isometric
to the disjoint union of a specified collection of sub-regions of the given
ends. An application is the construction of time-symmetric solutions of the
constraint equations which model N-body initial data.
