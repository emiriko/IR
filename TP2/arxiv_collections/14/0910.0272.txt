We present our 2nd response to Thibault's commentary article [1] and his
reply [2], in which he commented upon our ankylography paper [3] and our 1st
response [4]. In this article, we further explain why we think Thibault's
theoretical analysis is flawed and his interpretation of our experiment is
incorrect. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative analysis and a numerical
experiment to illustrate why ankylography can in principle be applicable to
general samples. Finally, we present detailed procedures for our numerical
experiment on ankylographic reconstructions, which uses the traditional HIO
algorithm only with the positivity constraint [5]. We welcome anyone (including
Thibault) interested in ankylography to perform numerical experiments and
verify our results. We will be very happy to provide any help if needed.
