The power spectrum is obtained for the Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter map
for WMAP's cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation temperature datasets.
The interest for CMB Kolmogorov map is that it can carry direct information
about voids in the matter distribution, so that the correlations in the
distribution of voids have to be reflected in the power spectrum. Although
limited by the angular resolution of the WMAP, this analysis shows the
possibility of acquiring this crucial information via CMB maps. Even the
already obtained behavior, some of which is absent in the simulated maps, can
influence the development of views on the void correlations at the large-scale
web formation.
