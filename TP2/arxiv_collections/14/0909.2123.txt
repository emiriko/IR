We review the properties of the surface waves that are scattered by
two-dimensional sub-wavelength indentations on metallic surfaces. We show that
two distinct waves are involved, a surface plasmon polariton (SPP) and a
quasi-cylindrical wave (quasi-CW). We discuss the main characteristics of these
waves, their damping characteristic lengths and their relative excitation
weights as a function of the separation distance from the indentation and as a
function of the metal conductivity. In particular we show that derive a
closed-form expression for the quasi-CW, which clarifies its physical origin
and its main properties. We further present an intuitive microscopic model,
which explains how the elementary SPPs and quasi-CWs exchange their energies by
multiple-scattering to build up a rich variety of near- and far-field optical
effects.
