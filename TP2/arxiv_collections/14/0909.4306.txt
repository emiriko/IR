A point source observed 8 AU in projection from beta Pictoris in L' (3.8
micron) imaging in 2003 has been recently presented as a planet candidate. Here
we show the results of L'-band adaptive optics imaging obtained at Keck
Observatory in 2008. We do not detect beta Pic b beyond a limiting radius of
0.29 arcsec, or 5.5 AU in projection, from the star. If beta Pic b is an
orbiting planet, then it has moved >=0.12 arcsec (2.4 AU in projection) closer
to the star in the five years separating the two epochs of observation. We
examine the range of orbital parameters consistent with the observations,
including likely bounds from the locations of previously inferred planetesimal
belts. We find a family of low-eccentricity orbits with semimajor axes ~8-9 AU
that are completely allowed, as well as a broad region of orbits with e<~0.2,
a>~10 AU that are allowed if the apparent motion of the planet was towards the
star in 2003. We compare this allowed space with predictions of the planetary
orbital elements from the literature. Additionally, we show how similar
observations in the next several years can further constrain the space of
allowed orbits. Non-detections of the source through 2013 will exclude the
interpretation of the candidate as a planet orbiting between the 6.4 and 16 AU
planetesimal belts.
