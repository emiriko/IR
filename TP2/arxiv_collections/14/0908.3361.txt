WebNC is a system for efficiently sharing, retrieving and viewing web
applications. Unlike existing screencasting and screensharing tools, WebNC is
optimized to work with web pages where a lot of scrolling happens. WebNC uses a
tile-based encoding to capture, transmit and deliver web applications, and
relies only on dynamic HTML and JavaScript. The resulting webcasts require very
little bandwidth and are viewable on any modern web browser including Firefox
and Internet Explorer as well as browsers on the iPhone and Android platforms.
