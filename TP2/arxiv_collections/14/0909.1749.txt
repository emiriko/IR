We suggest a new CPX-derived scenario for the search of strangephilic MSSM
Higgs bosons at the Tevatron and the LHC, in which all neutral and charged
Higgs bosons decay predominantly into pairs of strange quarks and into a
strange and a charm quark, respectively. The proposed scenario is realized
within a particular region of the MSSM parameter space and requires large
values of tan(beta), where threshold radiative corrections are significant to
render the effective strange-quark Yukawa coupling dominant. Experimental
searches for neutral Higgs bosons based on the identification of b-quark jets
or tau leptons may miss a strangephilic Higgs boson and its existence could be
inferred indirectly by searching for hadronically decaying charged Higgs
bosons. Potential strategies and experimental challenges to search for
strangephilic Higgs bosons at the Tevatron and the LHC are discussed.
