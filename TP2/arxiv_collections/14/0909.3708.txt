Electron transport characteristics through molecular wires are studied by
using the Green's function formalism. Parametric calculations are performed
based on the tight-binding model to investigate the transport properties
through the wires. The transport characteristics are significantly influenced
by (a) the interference effects, (b) chemical substituent group, (c)
molecule-to-electrode coupling strength and (d) the gate voltage, and, here we
focus our results in these aspects. In this article we also discuss the noise
power of current fluctuations. The noise power gives key information about the
electron correlation which is obtained by calculating the Fano factor (F) and
the complete knowledge of the current fluctuations is very essential to
fabricate efficient molecular devices.
