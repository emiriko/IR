As starburst galaxies show a star formation rate up to several hundred times
larger than the one in a typical galaxy, the expected supernova rate is higher
than average. This in turn implies a high rate of long gamma ray bursts (GRBs),
which are extreme supernova events. We present a catalog of 127 local starburst
galaxies with redshifts of z<0.03. Using this catalog we investigate the
possibility of detecting neutrinos from Gamma Ray Bursts from nearby starburst
galaxies. We show that the rate of long GRBs is correlated to the supernova
rate which in turn is correlated to the far infrared output. For the entire
catalog, 0.03 GRB per year are expected to occur. The true number can even be
higher since only the brightest sources were included in the catalog.
