We explore the phase diagram and the critical behavior of QCD thermodynamic
quantities in the context of the so-called Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model.
We show that this improved field theoretical model is a successful candidate
for studying the equation of state and the critical behavior around the
critical end point. We argue that a convenient choice of the model parameters
is crucial to get the correct description of isentropic trajectories. The
effects of the regularization procedure in several thermodynamic quantities is
also analyzed. The results are compared with simple thermodynamic expectations
and lattice data.
