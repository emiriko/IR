This is a short review of the framework proposed in \cite{Goh:2009wg} which
gives rise to indirect Dark Matter (DM) signals explaining the recent
cosmic-ray anomalies and links cosmic-ray signals of DM to LHC signals of a
leptonic Higgs sector.The states of the leptonic Higgs doublet are lighter than
about 200 GeV, yielding large 2 tau and 4 tau event rates at the LHC. For the
case of annihilations, cosmic photon and neutrino signals are constrained.
