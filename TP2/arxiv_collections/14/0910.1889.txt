The chargino-neutralino production with subsequent leptonic decays is one of
the most promising supersymmetry (SUSY) signatures at the Tevatron
proton-antiproton collider. We present the most recent results on the search
for the three-lepton and missing-transverse-energy SUSY signature using 3.2
fb-1 of data collected with the CDF II detector. The results are interpreted
within the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) scenario.
