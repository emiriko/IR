Motivated by recent realizations of microwave-driven nonlinear resonators in
superconducting circuits, the impact of environmental degrees of freedom is
analyzed as seen from a rotating frame. A system plus reservoir model is
applied to consistently derive in the weak coupling limit the master equation
for the reduced density in the moving frame and near the first bifurcation
threshold. It turns out that additional interactions between momenta of system
and bath appear which have been omitted in previous studies. Explicit
expressions for the effective temperature and the Lamb-shift are given which
for ohmic baths are in agreement with experimental findings, while for
structured environments population inversion is predicted that may
qualitatively explain recent observations.
