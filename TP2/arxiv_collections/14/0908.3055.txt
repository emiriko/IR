We consider a complex vector bundle E endowed with a connection A over the
eight-dimensional manifold R^2 x G/H, where G/H = SU(3)/U(1)xU(1) is a
homogeneous space provided with a never integrable almost complex structure and
a family of SU(3)-structures. We establish an equivalence between G-invariant
solutions A of the Spin(7)-instanton equations on R^2 x G/H and general
solutions of non-Abelian coupled vortex equations on R^2. These vortices are
BPS solitons in a d=4 gauge theory obtained from N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory in ten dimensions compactified on the coset space G/H with an
SU(3)-structure. The novelty of the obtained vortex equations lies in the fact
that Higgs fields, defining morphisms of vector bundles over R^2, are not
holomorphic in the generic case. Finally, we introduce BPS vortex equations in
N=4 super Yang-Mills theory and show that they have the same feature.
