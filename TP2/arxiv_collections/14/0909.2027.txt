Using the coherent state techniques developed for the analysis of the EPRL
model we give the asymptotic formula for the Ponzano-Regge model amplitude for
non-tardis triangulations of handlebodies in the limit of large boundary spins.
The formula produces a sum over all possible immersions of the boundary
triangulation and its value is given by the cosine of the Regge action
evaluated on these. Furthermore the asymptotic scaling registers the existence
of flexible immersions. We verify numerically that this formula approximates
the 6j-symbol for large spins.
