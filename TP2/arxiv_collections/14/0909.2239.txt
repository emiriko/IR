Let G be a semisimple, simply-connected algebraic group over an algebraically
closed field of characteristic p > 0. We observe that the tensor product of the
Steinberg module with a minuscule module is always indecomposable tilting.
Although quite easy to prove, this fact does not seem to have been observed
before. It has the following consequence: If p >= 2h-2 and a given tilting
module has highest weight p-adically close to the r-th Steinberg weight, then
the tilting module is isomorphic to a tensor product of two simple modules,
usually in many ways.
