Time projection chambers drifting negative ions (NITPC) instead of electrons
have several advantages. A NITPC can operate at very high reduced drift fields
without diffusion runaway, and the readout digitization sampling rate
requirement is considerably relaxed due to the low drift speed of negative
ions. The initiation of Townsend avalanches to allow gas gain in these devices
has not been understood until now. It is shown here that the avalanche in low
pressure CS$_2$ vapor is most likely initiated by collisional detachment of the
electron from the negative molecular ion. In mixtures of Nitromethane vapor
with CO$_2$ the mechanism appears to be more complex.
