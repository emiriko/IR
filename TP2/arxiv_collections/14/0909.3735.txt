In this paper we provide a comprehesive analysis of different properties of
pnictides both in the normal and superconducting state, with a particular focus
on the optimally-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ system. We show that, by
using the band dispersions experimentally measured by ARPES, a four-band
Eliashberg model in the intermediate-coupling regime can account for both the
measured hierarchy of the gaps and for several spectroscopic and thermodynamic
signatures of low-energy renormalization. These include the kinks in the band
dispersion and the effective masses determined via specific-heat and
superfluid-density measurements. We also show that, although an
intermediate-coupling Eliashberg approach is needed to account for the
magnitude of the gaps, the temperature behavior of the thermodynamic quantities
does not show in this regime a significant deviation with respect to
weak-coupling BCS calculations. This can explain the apparent success of
two-band BCS fits of experimental data reported often in the literature.
