We consider the dynamics of a movable mirror (cantilever) of a nonlinear
optical cavity. We show that a $\chi^{(3)}$ medium with a strong Kerr
nonlinearity placed inside a cavity inhibits the normal mode splitting (NMS)
due to the photon blockade mechanism. This study demonstrates that NMS could be
used as a tool to observe the photon blockade effect. We also found that the
backaction cooling of the movable mirror is reduced in the presence of the Kerr
medium.
