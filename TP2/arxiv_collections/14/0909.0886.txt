We study the second sound dipole mode in a partially Bose-Einstein condensed
gas. This mode is excited by spatially separating and releasing the
center-of-mass of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with respect to the
thermal cloud, after which the equilibration is observed. The oscillation
frequency and the damping rate of this mode is studied for different harmonic
confinements and temperatures. The measured damping rates close to the
collisionless regime are found to be in good agreement with Landau damping. For
increasing hydrodynamicity of the cloud we observe an increase of the damping.
