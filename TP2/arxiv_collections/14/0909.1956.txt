Transport through molecular magnets is studied in the regime of strong
coupling to the leads. We consider a resonant-tunneling model where the
electron spin in a quantum dot or molecule is coupled to an additional local,
anisotropic spin via exchange interaction. The two opposite regimes dominated
by resonant tunneling and by Kondo transport, respectively, are considered. In
the resonant-tunneling regime, the stationary state of the impurity spin is
calculated for arbitrarily strong molecule-lead coupling using a
master-equation approach, which treats the exchange interaction perturbatively.
We find that the characteristic fine structure in the differential conductance
persists even if the hybridization energy exceeds thermal energies. Transport
in the Kondo regime is studied within a diagrammatic approach. We show that
magnetic anisotropy gives rise to a splitting of the Kondo peak at low bias
voltages.
