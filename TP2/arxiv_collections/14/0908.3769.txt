The influence of a single magnetic cluster in a non-magnetic host metal on
the spin current $\mathbf{j}^{(s)}$ and the charge current $\mathbf{j}$ in the
vicinity of a ferromagnetic STM tip is studied theoretically. Spin-flip
processes due to electron interaction with the cluster are taken into account.
We show that quantum interference between the partial waves injected from the
STM tip and those scattered by the cluster results in the appearance of
components perpendicular to the initial polarization of the spin current
$\mathbf{j}^{(s)}$, which obtain a strongly inhomogeneous spatial distribution.
This interference produces oscillations of the conductance as a function of the
distance between the contact and the cluster center. The oscillation amplitude
depends on the current polarization. We predict a strong magneto-orientational
effect: the conductance oscillations may grow, shrink, or even vanish for
rotation of the cluster magnetic moment $\mathbf{\mu}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ by an
external magnetic field. These results can be used for the determination of the
$ \mathbf{\mu}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ for magnetic clusters below a metal surface.
