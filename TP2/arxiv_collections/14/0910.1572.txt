We present the strategy which has been used recently to optimize integrated
luminosity at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. We use a
relatively simple model where we keep the proton intensity fixed, use
parameters from fits to the luminosity decay of recent stores as a function of
initial antiproton intensity (stash size), and vary the stash size to optimize
the integrated luminosity per week. The model assumes a fixed rate of
antiproton production, that a store is terminated as soon as the target stash
size for the next store is reached, and that the only downtime is due to store
turn-around time. An optimal range of stash sizes is predicted. Since the start
of Tevatron operations based on this procedure, we have seen an improvement of
approximately 35% in integrated luminosity. Other recent operational
improvements have been achieved by decreasing the shot-setup time and by
reducing beam-beam effects by making the proton and antiproton brightnesses
more compatible, for example by scraping protons to smaller emittances.
