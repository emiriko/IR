I argue that the Doppler shift asymmetries observed in some young stellar
object (YSO) result from the interaction of the jets with the circumstellar
gas, rather than from jets' rotation. The jets do rotate, but at a velocity
much below claimed values. During the meeting I carefully examined new claims,
and found problems with the claimed jets' rotation. I will challenge any future
observation that will claim to detect jet rotation in YSOs that requires the
jets (and not a wind) to be launched from radii much larger than the accreting
stellar radius. I conclude that the most likely jets' launching mechanism
involves a very efficient dynamo in the inner part of the accretion disk, with
jets' launching mechanism that is similar to solar flares (coronal mass
ejection).
