A small prototype of a finely granulated digital hadron calorimeter with
Resistive Plate Chambers as active elements was exposed to positive pions of 1
>. 16 GeV energy from the Fermilab test beam. The event selection separates
events with mostly non-interacting particles and events with hadronic showers
which initiated in the front part of the calorimeter. The data are compared to
a Monte Carlo simulation of the set-up. The paper concludes with predictions
for the performance of an extended digital hadron calorimeter.
