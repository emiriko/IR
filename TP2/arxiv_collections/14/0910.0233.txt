In this paper, the nonlocal mixing of coherent current states in d-wave
superconducting banks is investigated. The superconducting banks are connected
via a ballistic point contact. The banks have a mis-orientation and a phase
difference. Furthermore, they are subjected to a tangential transport current
along the $ab$-plane of d-wave crystals and parallel with interface between
superconductors. The effects of mis-orientation and external transport current
on the current-phase relations and current distributions are subjects of this
paper. It observed that, at values of phase difference close to 0, $\pi$ and
$2\pi$ the current distribution may have a vortex-like form in vicinity of the
point contact. The current distribution of this junction between d-wave
superconductors is totally different from the junction between s-wave
superconductors. As the interesting results, spontaneous and Josephson currents
are observed for the case of $\phi=0$.
