Non-extensive statistical physics has allowed to generalize mathematical
functions such as exponential and logarithms. The same framework is used to
generalize sum and product so that the operations allow a more fluid way to
work with mathematical expressions emerging from non-additive formulation of
statistical physics. In this work we employ the generalization of the
exponential, logarithm and product to obtain a formula for the survival
fraction corresponding to the application of several radiation doses on a
living tissue. Also we provide experimental recommendations to determine the
universal characteristics of living tissues in interaction with radiation.
These results have a potential application in radiobiology and radiation
oncology.
