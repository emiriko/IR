We explore the initial conditions for fragments in the extended regions
($r\gtrsim 50$ AU) of gravitationally unstable disks. We combine analytic
estimates for the fragmentation of spiral arms with 3D SPH simulations to show
that initial fragment masses are in the gas giant regime. These initial
fragments will have substantial angular momentum, and should form disks with
radii of a few AU. We show that clumps will survive for multiple orbits before
they undergo a second, rapid collapse due to H$_2$ dissociation and that it is
possible to destroy bound clumps by transporting them into the inner disk. The
consequences of disrupted clumps for planet formation, dust processing, and
disk evolution are discussed. We argue that it is possible to produce
Earth-mass cores in the outer disk during the earliest phases of disk
evolution.
