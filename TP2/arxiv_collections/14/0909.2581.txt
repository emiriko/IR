We show that there is no need for the hypothetical Dark Energy (DE) and Dark
Matter (DM) to explain phenomena attributed to them. In contrast to the
consensus of the last decade, we show that the time derivative of the
cosmological scale factor, is a constant. We derive H(z), the Hubble parameter,
as a function of the redshift, z. Based on H(z), we derive a curve of the
Distance Modulus versus log(z). This curve fits data from supernovae
observations, without any free parameters. This fit is as good as that obtained
by current cosmology, which needs the free parameters Omega_M and Omega_Lambda.
We obtain these results by using the hitherto un-noticed fact that the global
gravitational energy density in our Hubble Sphere (HS) is equal to the
Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB) energy density. We derive the dynamic
and kinematic relations that govern the motions of celestial bodies in and
around galaxies. This derivation does not require any gravitating matter beyond
the observed baryonic matter. The theoretical Rotation Curves (RC), resulting
from these relations, fit observed RCs. We obtain these results by examining
the interplay between the local gravitational energy density, around a galaxy,
and the CMB energy density. This interplay causes the inhomogeneous and
anisotropic space expansion around a galaxy.
