We report a calculation of the low-lying baryon magnetic moments using
covariant chiral perturbation theory within the extended-on-mass-shell
renormalization scheme including intermediate octet and decuplet contributions.
For the case of the baryon octet, we succeed to improve the Coleman-Glashow
description by including the leading SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects coming from the
lowest-order loops. We compare with previous attempts at the same order using
heavy-baryon and covariant infrared chiral perturbation theory, and discuss the
source of the differences. For the case of the decuplet-baryons we fix the only
unknown LEC with the well measured magnetic dipole moment of the $\Omega^-$ and
predict the corresponding ones of the $\Delta(1232)$ isospin multiplet. In
particular we obtain $\mu_{\Delta^{++}}=6.0(6) \mu_N$ and
$\mu_{\Delta^{+}}=2.84(34) \mu_N$ that compare well with the current
experimental information.
