Extragalactic surveys in the emission line of [O III] 5007 have provided us
with the absolute line strengths of large, homogeneous sets of planetary
nebulae. These data have been used to address a host of problems, from the
measurement of the extragalactic distance scale, to the study of stellar
populations. I review our current understanding of the [O III] planetary nebula
luminosity function (PNLF), and discuss some of the physical processes that
effect its structure. I also describe the features of the H-alpha PNLF, a
function that, upon first glance, looks similar to the [O III] PNLF, but which
includes a very different set of objects. Finally, I discuss recent
measurements of alpha, the number of PNe found in a stellar population,
normalized to that population's bolometric luminosity. I show that, contrary to
expectations, the values of alpha found in actively star-forming spirals is
essentially the same as those measured in late-type elliptical and lenticular
systems. I discuss how this result sheds light on the physics of the planetary
nebula phenomenon.
