In the weak field limit general relativity reduces, as is well known, to the
Newtonian gravitation. Alternative theories of gravity, however, do not
necessarily reduce to Newtonian gravitation; some of them, for example, reduce
to Yukawa-like potentials instead of the Newtonian potential. Since the
Newtonian gravitation is largely used to model with success the structures of
the universe, such as for example galaxies and clusters of galaxies, a way to
probe and constrain alternative theories, in the weak field limit, is to apply
them to model the structures of the universe. In the present study, we consider
how to probe Yukawa-like potentials using N-body numerical simulations.
