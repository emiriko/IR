We have obtained deep, high spatial resolution images of the central region
of Abell 1795 at Halpha and [NII] (6583A) with the Maryland Magellan Tunable
Filter (MMTF), and in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) with the Advanced Camera for
Surveys Solar Blind Channel on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The superb
image quality of the MMTF data has made it possible to resolve the known SE
filament into a pair of thin, intertwined filaments extending for ~50 kpc, with
a width < 1 kpc. The presence of these thin, tangled strands is suggestive of a
cooling wake where runaway cooling is taking place, perhaps aided by an
enhanced magnetic field in this region. The HST data further resolve these
strands into chains of FUV-bright stellar clusters, indicating that these
filaments are indeed sites of on-going star formation, but at a rate ~2 orders
of magnitude smaller than the mass-deposition rates predicted from the X-ray
data. The elevated [NII]/Halpha ratio and large spatial variations of the
FUV/Halpha flux ratio across the filaments indicate that O-star photoionization
is not solely responsible for the ionization. The data favor collisional
heating by cosmic rays either produced in-situ by magnetohydrodynamical
processes or conducted in from the surrounding intracluster medium.
