We demonstrate that unrestricted Hartree-Fock theory applied to electrons in
a uniform potential has stable Wigner crystal solutions for $r_s \geq 1.44$ in
two dimensions and $r_s \geq 4.5$ in three dimensions. The correlation energies
of the Wigner crystal phases are considerably smaller than those of the fluid
phases at the same density.
