We determined the spatial orientation of the Algol AB close pair orbital
plane using optical interferometry with the CHARA Array, and radio
interferometry with the European VLBI Network (EVN). We found the longitude of
the line of nodes for the close pair being $\Omega_1=48\deg\pm2\deg$ and the
mutual inclination of the orbital planes of the close and the wide pairs being
$95\deg\pm3\deg$. This latter value differs by $5\deg$ from the formerly known
$100\deg$ which would imply a very fast inclination variation of the system,
not supported by the photometric observations. We also investigated the
dynamics of the system with numerical integration of the equations of motions
using our result as an initial condition. We found large variations in the
inclination of the close pair (its amplitude $\sim 170\deg$) with a period of
about 20 millenia. This result is in good agreement with the photometrically
observed change of amplitude in Algol's primary minimum.
