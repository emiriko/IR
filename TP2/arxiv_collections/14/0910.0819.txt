Wimax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a promising
technology which can offer high speed voice, video and data service up to the
customer end. The aim of this paper is the performance evaluation of an Wimax
system under different combinations of digital modulation (BPSK, QPSK, 4 QAM
and 16 QAM) and different communication channels AWGN and fading channels
(Rayleigh and Rician). And the Wimax system incorporates Reed Solomon (RS)
encoder with Convolutional encoder with half and two third rated codes in FEC
channel coding. The simulation results of estimated Bit Error Rate (BER)
displays that the implementation of interleaved RS code (255, 239, 8) with two
third rated Convolutional code under BPSK modulation technique is highly
effective to combat in the Wimax communication system. To complete this
performance analysis in Wimax based systems, a segment of audio signal is used
for analysis. The transmitted audio message is found to have retrieved
effectively under noisy situation.
