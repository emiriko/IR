The prediction and prevention of traumatic brain injury, spinal injury and
general musculo-skeletal injury is a very important aspect of preventive
medical science. Recently, in a series of papers, I have proposed a new coupled
loading-rate hypothesis as a unique cause of all above injuries. This new
hypothesis states that the main cause of all mechanical injuries is a Euclidean
Jolt, which is an impulsive loading that strikes any part of the human body
(head, spine or any bone/joint) - in several coupled degrees-of-freedom
simultaneously. It never goes in a single direction only. Also, it is never a
static force. It is always an impulsive translational and/or rotational force,
coupled to some human mass eccentricity.
