We discuss the feasibility of seeing a Higgs boson which decays to four
bottom quarks through a pair of (pseudo-)scalars at the LHCb experiment to
argue that the use of b-physics triggers and off-line vertex reconstruction, as
opposed to jet triggers with b tagging, may be more effective for this signal.
Focusing on inclusive production for the Higgs, we find that for light scalar
masses below 20 GeV, signal reconstruction efficiencies of order a few percent
may be enough for LHCb to find evidence for a Higgs with a dominant 4b decay
channel.
