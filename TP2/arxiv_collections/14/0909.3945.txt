In these proceedings I discuss various extragalactic surveys which will be
undertaken over the next few years and which will be complementary to any HI
and/or continuum surveys with the SKA-precursor telescopes. I concentrate on
the near-infrared public surveys which will be undertaken with the Visible and
Infrared Survey Telscope for Astronomy (VISTA), and in particular the VISTA
Deep Extragalactic Observations (VIDEO) survey which will provide the ideal
data set to combine with any deep SKA-precursor observations of the
extragalactic sky. After highlighting the links that the SKA precursors have
with the various VISTA surveys, I briefly describe two forthcoming Herschel
surveys, Herschel-ATLAS survey and HerMES which have a large scientific overlap
with the SKA-precursor telescopes. Finally, I present a case study in combining
multi-wavelength data sets with radio-frequency surveys to find the highest
redshift radio sources with the aim of probing the epoch of reionization.
