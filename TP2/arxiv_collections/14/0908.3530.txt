We discuss the cosmic ray spectra in annihilating/decaying Nambu-Goldstone
dark matter models. The recent observed positron/electron excesses at PAMELA
and Fermi experiments are well fitted by the dark matter with a mass of 3TeV
for the annihilating model, while with a mass of 6 TeV for the decaying model.
We also show that the Nambu-Goldstone dark matter models predict a distinctive
gamma-ray spectrum in a certain parameter space.
