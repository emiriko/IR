Periodic table of chemical elements symbolizes an elegant graphical
representation of symmetry at atomic level and provides an overview on
arrangement of electrons. It started merely as tabular representation of
chemical elements, later got strengthened with quantum mechanical description
of atomic structure and recent studies have revealed that periodic table can be
formulated using SO(4,2)* SU(2) group. IUPAC, the governing body in Chemistry,
doesn't approve any periodic table as a standard periodic table. The only
specific recommendation provided by IUPAC is that the periodic table should
follow the 1 to 18 group numbering. In this technical paper, we describe a new
graphical representation of periodic table, referred as 'Circular form of
Periodic table'. The advantages of circular form of periodic table over other
representations are discussed along with a brief discussion on history of
periodic tables.
