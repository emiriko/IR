We consider the possibility that the DAMA signal arises from channeled events
in simple models where the dark matter interaction with nuclei is suppressed at
small momenta. As with the standard WIMP, these models have two parameters (the
dark matter mass and the size of the cross-section), without the need to
introduce an additional energy threshold type of parameter. We find that they
can be consistent with channeling fractions as low as about ~ 15%, so long as
at least ~70% of the nuclear recoil energy for channeled events is deposited
electronically. Given that there are reasons not to expect very large
channeling fractions, these scenarios make the channeling explanation of DAMA
much more compelling.
