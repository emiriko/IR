IGR J18483-0311 is an X-ray pulsar with transient X-ray activity, belonging
to the new class of High Mass X-ray Binaries called Supergiant Fast X-ray
Transients. This system is one of the two members of this class, together with
IGR J11215-5952, where both the orbital (18.52d) and spin period (21s) are
known. We report on the first complete monitoring of the X-ray activity along
an entire orbital period of a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient. These Swift
observations, lasting 28d, cover more than one entire orbital phase
consecutively. They are a unique data-set, which allows us to constrain the
different mechanisms proposed to explain the nature of this new class of X-ray
transients. We applied the new clumpy wind model for blue supergiants developed
by Ducci et al. (2009), to the observed X-ray light curve. Assuming an
eccentricity of e=0.4, the X-ray emission from this source can be explained in
terms of the accretion from a spherically symmetric clumpy wind, composed of
clumps with different masses, ranging from 10^{18}g to 5x 10^{21}g.
