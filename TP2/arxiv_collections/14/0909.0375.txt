The dynamic behavior of the entanglement for two two-level atoms coupled to a
common lossy cavity is studied. We find that the speed of disentanglement is a
decreasing (increasing) function of the damping rate of the cavity for on/near
(far-off) resonant couplings. The quantitative explanations for these phenomena
are given, and further, it is shown that they are related to the quantum Zeno
and anti-Zeno effect induced by the non-Markovian environment.
