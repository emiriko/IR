Does the advent of flash devices constitute a radical change for secondary
storage? How should database systems adapt to this new form of secondary
storage? Before we can answer these questions, we need to fully understand the
performance characteristics of flash devices. More specifically, we want to
establish what kind of IOs should be favored (or avoided) when designing
algorithms and architectures for flash-based systems. In this paper, we focus
on flash IO patterns, that capture relevant distribution of IOs in time and
space, and our goal is to quantify their performance. We define uFLIP, a
benchmark for measuring the response time of flash IO patterns. We also present
a benchmarking methodology which takes into account the particular
characteristics of flash devices. Finally, we present the results obtained by
measuring eleven flash devices, and derive a set of design hints that should
drive the development of flash-based systems on current devices.
