The three goals of this PhD thesis are to improve the understanding of the
mechanisms underlying the dynamical instabilities observed in semiconductor
lasers subject to external optical feedback, to propose a technique to suppress
these instabilities and finally to take advantage of them, for instance for
secure communications or to generate microwave time-periodic oscillations.
