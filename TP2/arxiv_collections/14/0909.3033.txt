By using a quasi-stationary approach, we consider the mass evolution of
Schwarzschild black holes in the presence of a nonminimally coupled
cosmological scalar field. The mass evolution equation is analytically solved
for generic coupling, revealing a qualitatively distinct behavior from the
minimal coupling case. In particular, for black hole masses smaller than a
certain critical value, the accretion of the scalar field can lead to mass
decreasing even if no phantom energy is involved. The physical validity of the
adopted quasi-stationary approach and some implications of our result for the
evolution of primordial and astrophysical black holes are discussed. More
precisely, we argue that black hole observational data could be used to place
constraints on the nonminimally coupled energy content of the universe.
