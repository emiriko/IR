Energy loss of a jet due to multiple collisions in the nuclear target is
studied in the framework of the perturbative QCD with an infrared cutoff. An
iterational procedure for its calculation is developed, which allows to
reliably find up to 16 successive collisions in rescattering. The calculated
shift of the scaling variable reaches values of the order 0.1 at medium $x$ and
transverse momentum $p$ in the interval 5-10 GeV/c. The shift is found to be
independent of the atomic number of the target and energy.
