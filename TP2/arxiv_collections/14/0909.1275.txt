We study the intermittency properties of the energy and helicity cascades in
two 1536^3 direct numerical simulations of helical rotating turbulence.
Symmetric and anti-symmetric velocity increments are examined, as well as
probability density functions of the velocity field and of the helicity
density. It is found that the direct cascade of energy to small scales is scale
invariant and non-intermittent, whereas the direct cascade of helicity is
highly intermittent. Furthermore, the study of structure functions of different
orders allows us to identify a recovery of isotropy of strong events at very
small scales in the flow. Finally, we observe the juxtaposition in space of
strong laminar and persistent helical columns next to time-varying vortex
tangles, the former being associated with the self-similarity of energy and the
latter with the intermittency of helicity.
