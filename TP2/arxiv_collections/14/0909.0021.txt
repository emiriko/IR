In this talk, I describe and defend four non-standard claims about four
effective field theories, and try to extract some lessons about the limits of
effective field theory. The four theses (and a capsule diagnosis given in
parentheses) are: 1) Kaon loops are not a reliable part of chiral perturbation
theory (dimensional regularization does not know about the chiral scale), 2)
Regge physics is inappropriately missing from SCET (an infinite set of scales
are needed) 3) There is likely a barrier in the use of EFT in general
relativity in the extreme infrared (curvature effects build up) and 4) Gauge
non-invariant operators should be included in describing physics beyond the
Standard Model (as they could probe the idea of emergent gauge symmetry and
falsify string theory).
