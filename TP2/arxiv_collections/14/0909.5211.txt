We present several different calculations pertaining to the nature of the
low-energy excitations of the site-diluted S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet, in
particular at the percolation point. We present a picture of excitations
originating from an effective low-energy subsystem consisting of localized
magnetic moments. At the percolation point, these moments lead to an
anomalously large dynamic exponent; z=3.6(1). The magnetic moments are shown to
originate from local sublattice imbalance, which we study quantitatively using
a classical dimer-monomer model. The localization properties of triplet
excitations of clusters with singlet ground state are examined using
simulations in the valence bond basis. The triplet is shown to affect
predominantly sites on the classical monomer regions. The number of sites
affected grows as a non-trivial power of the cluster size. We also study a
bilayer model, where there is no sublattice imbalance. Accordingly, we find a
much smaller dynamic exponent, consistent with quantum rotor (or possibly
fracton) excitations.
