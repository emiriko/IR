The compound lambda-(BETS)2FeCl4 provides an effective demonstration of the
interaction of pi-conduction electron and d-electron localized moment systems
in molecular crystalline materials where antiferromagnetic insulating and
magnetic field induced superconducting states can be realized. The
metal-insulator transition has been thought to be cooperative, involving both
the itinerant pi- electron and localized d-electron spins where
antiferromagnetic order appears in both systems simultaneously. However, recent
specific heat data has indicated otherwise [Akiba et al., J. Phys. Soc. Japan
78,033601(2009)]: although the pi-electron system orders antiferromagnetically
and produces a metal-insulator transition, a "mysterious" paramagnetic
d-electron state remains. We report 57Fe Mossbauer measurements that support
the paramagnetic model, provided the d-electron spins remain in a fast
relaxation state below the transition. From the measured hyperfine fields, we
also determine the temperature dependence of the pi-d electron exchange field.
