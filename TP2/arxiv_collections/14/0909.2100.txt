MICADO is the adaptive optics imaging camera being studied for the E-ELT. Its
design has been optimised for use with MCAO, but will have its own SCAO module
for the initial operational phase; and in principle could also be used with
GLAO or LTAO. In this contribution, we outline a few of the science drivers for
MICADO and show how these have shaped its design. The science drivers have led
to a number of requirements on the AO system related to astrometry, photometry,
and PSF uniformity. We discuss why these requirements have arisen and what
might be done about them.
