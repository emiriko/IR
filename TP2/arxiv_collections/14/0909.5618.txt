We suggest the procedure of direct derivation of the symmetry energy from the
shift of neutron-proton chemical potentials \Delta\lambda=\lambda_{n}-
\lambda_{p} for nuclei beyond the beta-stability line. We observe the presence
of anomalous strong (about 15%) shell oscillations at the symmetry energy
coefficient b_{sym}. Our results do not confirm the existence of exceptionally
large values of the symmetry energy coefficient at mass number A\approx 100
which was earlier reported in Ref.[2]. Using the fitting procedure, we have
evaluated the volume, b_{sym,vol}, and surface, b_{sym,surf}, contributions to
the symmetry energy. We have estimated the experimental value of
surface-to-volume ratio as r_{S/V}=|b_{sym,surf}}|/b_{sym,vol}\approx 1.7 for
the fitting interval A\geq 50.
