Measurements of cross-sections and transverse single spin asymmetries of
identified charged hadrons at forward rapidities from transversely polarized
proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV are presented. The results are
discussed in the context of interplay between perturbative and non-perturbative
QCD effects.
