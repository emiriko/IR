The bivariate high-temperature expansion of the spin-spin
correlation-function of the three-dimensional classical XY (planar rotator)
model, with spatially-anisotropic nearest-neighbor couplings, is extended from
the 10th through the 21st order. The computation is carried out for the
simple-cubic lattice, in the absence of magnetic field, in the case in which
the coupling strength along the z-axis of the lattice is different from those
along the x- and the y-axes. It is then possible to determine accurately the
critical temperature as function of the parameter R which characterizes the
coupling anisotropy and to check numerically the universality, with respect to
R, of the critical exponents of the three-dimensional anisotropic system. The
analysis of our data also shows that the main predictions of the generalized
scaling theory for the crossover from the three-dimensional to the
two-dimensional critical behavior are compatible with the series
extrapolations.
