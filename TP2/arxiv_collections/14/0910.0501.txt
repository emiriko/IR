We consider N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories based on the group SU(N)_1 x
SU(N)_2 x ... x SU(N)_k with matter content (N,N*,1,...,1) + (1,N,N*,..., 1) +
>... + (N*,1,1,...,N) as candidates for the unification symmetry of all
particles. In particular we examine to which extent such theories can become
finite, and find that a necessary condition is that there should be exactly
three families. From phenomenological considerations an SU(3)^3 model is
singled out. We consider an all-loop and a two-loop finite model based on this
gauge group and we study their predictions concerning the third generation
quark masses.
