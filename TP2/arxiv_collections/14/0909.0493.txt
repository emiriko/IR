The search strategy for the Standard Model Higgs boson at the Large Hadron
Collider is reviewed, with a particular emphasis on its potential observation
by the ATLAS and CMS detectors in the $\gamma\gamma$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, $ZZ^{*}$
and $WW^{*}$ final states. The combined Higgs discovery potential of ATLAS and
CMS is discussed, as well as the expected exclusion limits on the production
rate times the branching ratio as a function of the Higgs mass and the
collected luminosity.
