We apply optimal control theory to determine the shortest time in which an
energy eigenstate of a weakly anharmonic oscillator can be created under the
practical constraint of linear driving. We show that the optimal pulses are
beatings of mostly the transition frequencies for the transitions up to the
desired state and the next leakage level. The time of a shortest possible pulse
for a given nonlinearity scale with the nonlinearity parameter delta as a power
law of alpha with alpha=-0.73 +/-0.029. This is a qualitative improvement
relative to the value alpha=1 suggested by a simple Landau-Zener argument.
