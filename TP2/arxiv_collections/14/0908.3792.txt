Motivated by the realization of the Dirac point (DP) with a double-cone
structure for optical field in the negative-zero-positive index metamaterial
(NZPIM), the reflection, transmission, and Goos-H\"{a}nchen (GH) shifts inside
the NZPIM slab are investigated. Due to the linear Dirac dispersion, the
transmission as the function of the frequency has a gap, thus the correspond
reflection has a frequency or wavelength window for the perfect reflection,
which is similar to the Bragg reflection in the one-dimensional photonic
crystals. Near the DP, the associated GH shifts in the transmission and
reflection can be changed from positive to negative with increasing the
wavelength. These negative and positive shifts can also be enhanced by
transmission resonances, when the frequency is far from that at the DP. All
these phenomena will lead to some potential applications in the integrated
optics and optical devices.
