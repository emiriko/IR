In IEEE 802.11, load balancing algorithms (LBA) consider only the associated
stations to balance the load of the available access points (APs). However,
although the APs are balanced, it causes a bad situation if the AP has a lower
signal length (SNR) less than the neighbor APs. So, balance the load and
associate one mobile station to an access point without care about the signal
to noise ratio (SNR) of the AP cause possibly an unforeseen QoS, such as the
bit rate, the end to end delay, the packet loss. In this way, we study an
improvement load balancing algorithm with SNR integration at the selection
policy.
