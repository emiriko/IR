In this paper we show that the leading coefficient $\mu(y,w)$ of some
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials $P_{y,w}$ with $y,w$ in an affine Weyl group of
type $\tilde A_n $ is $n+2$. This fact has some consequences on the dimension
of first extension groups of finite groups of Lie type with irreducible
coefficients.
