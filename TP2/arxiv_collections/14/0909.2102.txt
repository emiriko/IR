We are presenting new results on kinematics and structure of the Mrk 334
Seyfert galaxy. Panoramic (3D) spectroscopy is performed at the 6-m telescope
of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences
using the MPFS integral-field spectrograph and scanning Fabry--Perot
interferometer. The deep images have revealed that Mrk 334 is observed during
the final stage of its merging with a massive companion. A possible mass ratio
ranges from 1/5 to 1/3. The merger has triggered mass redistribution in the
disk resulting in an intensification of nuclear activity and in a burst of star
formation in the inner region of the galaxy. The circumnuclear starburst is so
intense that its contribution to the gas ionization exceeds that contribution
of the AGN. We interpret the nuclear gas outflow with velocities of ~200 km/s
as a galactic superwind that accompanies the violent star formation. This
suggestion is consistent with the asymmetric X-ray brightness distribution in
Mrk 334. The trajectory of the fragments of the disrupted satellite in the
vicinity of the main galaxy nucleus can be traced. In the galaxy disk a cavern
is found that is filled with a low-density ionized gas. We consider this region
to be the place where the remnants of the companion have recently penetrated
through the gaseous disk of the main galaxy.
