We briefly reviewed some recent progress on the studies of supernova remnants
(SNRs), including the radio SNRs (the structure, polarization, spectrum etc.),
observational characteristics of X-ray emission, pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe),
association properties between SNR and PSR, interaction of SNR and interstellar
medium (ISM), cosmos ray and the SNRs in external galaxies, etc..
Correspondingly to the continue improvement of space and spectrum resolution of
the on-ground and in-space astronomical equipments at wavelengthes as radio,
optical, X-ray and so on, we know about SNRs more and deeper.
