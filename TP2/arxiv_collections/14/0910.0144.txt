This paper criticises the notion that long-range dependence is an important
contributor to the queuing behaviour of real Internet traffic. The idea is
questioned in two different ways. Firstly, a class of models used to simulate
Internet traffic is shown to have important theoretical flaws. It is shown that
this behaviour is inconsistent with the behaviour of real traffic traces.
Secondly, the notion that long-range correlations significantly affects the
queuing performance of traffic is investigated by destroying those correlations
in real traffic traces (by reordering). It is shown that the longer ranges of
correlations are not important except in one case with an extremely high load.
