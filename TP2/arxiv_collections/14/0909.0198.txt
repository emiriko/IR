We have performed polarized and unpolarized small angle neutron scattering
experiments on single crystals of HoMnO3 and have found that an increase in
magnetic scattering at low momentum transfers begins upon cooling through
temperatures close to the spin reorientation transition at TSR ~ 40 K. We
attribute the increase to an uncompensated magnetization arising within
antiferromagnetic domain walls. Polarized neutron scattering experiments
performed while applying an electric field show that the field suppresses
magnetic scattering below T ~ 50 K, indicating that the electric field affects
the magnetization via the antiferromagnetic domain walls rather than through a
change to the bulk magnetic order.
