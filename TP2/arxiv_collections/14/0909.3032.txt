Differential cross sections for dijet photoproduction and this process in
association with a leading neutron, e+ + p -> e+ + jet + jet + X (+ n), have
been measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of
40 pb-1. The fraction of dijet events with a leading neutron was studied as a
function of different jet and event variables. Single- and double-differential
cross sections are presented as a function of the longitudinal fraction of the
proton momentum carried by the leading neutron, xL, and of its transverse
momentum squared, pT^2. The dijet data are compared to inclusive DIS and
photoproduction results; they are all consistent with a simple pion-exchange
model. The neutron yield as a function of xL was found to depend only on the
fraction of the proton beam energy going into the forward region, independent
of the hard process. No firm conclusion can be drawn on the presence of
rescattering effects.
