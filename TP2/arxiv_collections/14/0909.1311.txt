Neutrinos are a very promising messenger at tens of EeV and above. They can
be produced by several channels, namely as by products of hadronic interactions
at the sources, as the main products of the decay of super massive particles
and, in a guaranteed way, as the result of the propagation of UHECR through the
bath of microwave relic photons. A new era of very large exposure space
observatories, of which the JEM-EUSO mission is a prime example, is on the
horizon and, with it, it is even larger the possibility of astrophysical
neutrino detection at the highest energies. In the present work we use a
combination of the PYTHIA interaction code with the CONEX shower simulation
package in order to produce fast one-dimensional simulations of neutrino
initiated showers in air. We make a detail study of the structure of the
corresponding longitudinal profiles, but focus our physical analysis mainly on
the development of showers at mid and high altitudes, where they can be an
interesting target for space fluorescence observatories.
