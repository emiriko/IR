We investigate a population of binary mistake sequences that result from
learning with parametric models of different order. We obtain estimates of
their error, algorithmic complexity and divergence from a purely random
Bernoulli sequence. We study the relationship of these variables to the
learner's information density parameter which is defined as the ratio between
the lengths of the compressed to uncompressed files that contain the learner's
decision rule. The results indicate that good learners have a low information
density$\rho$ while bad learners have a high $\rho$. Bad learners generate
mistake sequences that are atypically complex or diverge stochastically from a
purely random Bernoulli sequence. Good learners generate typically complex
sequences with low divergence from Bernoulli sequences and they include mistake
sequences generated by the Bayes optimal predictor. Based on the static
algorithmic interference model of \cite{Ratsaby_entropy} the learner here acts
as a static structure which "scatters" the bits of an input sequence (to be
predicted) in proportion to its information density $\rho$ thereby deforming
its randomness characteristics.
