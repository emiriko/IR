One limitation on the performance of optical traps is the noise inherently
present in every setup. Therefore, it is the desire of most experimentalists to
minimize and possibly eliminate noise from their optical trapping experiments.
A step in this direction is to quantify the actual noise in the system and to
evaluate how much each particular component contributes to the overall noise.
For this purpose we present Allan variance analysis as a straightforward
method. In particular, it allows for judging the impact of drift which gives
rise to low-frequency noise, which is extremely difficult to pinpoint by other
methods. We show how to determine the optimal sampling time for calibration,
the optimal number of data points for a desired experiment, and we provide
measurements of how much accuracy is gained by acquiring additional data
points. Allan variances of both micrometer-sized spheres and asymmetric
nanometer-sized rods are considered.
