We study the finite temperature nature of a quantum phase transition between
an Abelian and a non-Abelian topological phase in an exactly solvable model of
a chiral spin liquid. By virtue of the exact solvability, this model can serve
as a testbed for developing better measures for describing topological quantum
phase transitions. We characterize this phase transition in terms of the global
flux and entanglement entropy, and discuss to what extent the existence of a
topologically ordered ground state with non-Abelian excitations is revealed at
finite temperature.
