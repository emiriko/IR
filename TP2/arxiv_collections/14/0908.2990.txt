We use high signal-to-noise spectroscopy for a sample of 232 quiescent
galaxies in the Shapley Supercluster, to investigate how their stellar
populations depend on velocity dispersion, luminosity and stellar mass. The
sample spans a large range in velocity dispersion (sigma from 30-300 km/s) and
in luminosity (M_R from -18.7 to -23.2). Estimates of age, total metallicity
(Z/H) and alpha-element abundance ratio (a/Fe) were derived from
absorption-line analysis, using single-burst models. Age, Z/H and a/Fe are all
correlated positively with velocity dispersion, but we also find significant
residual trends with luminosity: at given sigma, the brighter galaxies are
younger, less alpha-enriched, and have higher Z/H. At face value, these results
might suggest that the stellar populations depend on stellar mass as well as on
velocity dispersion. However, we show that the observed trends can be
reproduced by models in which the stellar populations depend systematically
only on sigma, and are independent of stellar mass Mstel. For age, the observed
luminosity correlation arises because young galaxies are brighter, at fixed
Mstel. For metallicity, the observed luminosity dependence arises because
metal-rich galaxies, at fixed mass, tend also to be younger, and hence
brighter. We find a good match to the observed luminosity correlations with Age
~ sigma^0.40, Z/H ~ sigma^0.35, a/Fe ~ sigma^0.20, where the slopes are close
to those found when fitting traditional scaling relations. We conclude that the
star formation and enrichment histories of galaxies are determined primarily by
the depth of their gravitational potential wells. The observed residual
correlations with luminosity do not imply a corresponding dependence on stellar
mass.
