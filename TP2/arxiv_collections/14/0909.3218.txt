We investigate the exact nature of the superfluid-to-Mott-insulator crossover
for interacting bosons on an optical lattice in a one-dimensional, harmonic
trap by high-precision density-matrix renormalization-group calculations. The
results reveal an intermediate regime characterized by a cascade of microscopic
steps. These arise as a consequence of individual boson "squeezing" events and
display an even-odd alternation dependent on the trap symmetry. We discuss the
experimental observation of this behavior, which is generic in an external
trapping potential.
