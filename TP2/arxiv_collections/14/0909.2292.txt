This report mainly focused on the basic concepts and the recovery methods for
the random sampling. The recovery methods involve the orthogonal matching
pursuit algorithm and the gradient-based total variation strategy. In
particular, a fast and efficient observation matrix filling technique was
implemented by the classic Shannon interpolation and Poisson summation
formulae. The numerical results for the trigonometric signal, the
Gaussian-modulated sinusoidal pulse, and the square wave were demonstrated and
discussed. The work may give some help for future work in theoretical study and
practical implementation of the random sampling.
