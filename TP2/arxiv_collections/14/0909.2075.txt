We investigate a close connection between generalized uncertainty principle
(GUP) and deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. The GUP commutation
relations correspond to the UV-quantum theory, while the canonical commutation
relations represent the IR-quantum theory. Inspired by this UV/IR quantum
mechanics, we obtain the GUP-corrected graviton propagator by introducing
UV-momentum $p_i=p_{0i}(1+\beta p_{0}^2)$ and compare this with tensor
propagators in the HL gravity. Two are the same up to $p_0^4$-order.
