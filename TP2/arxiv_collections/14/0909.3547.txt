Laterally coupled charge sensing of quantum dots is highly desirable, because
it enables measurement even when conduction through the quantum dot itself is
suppressed. In this work, we demonstrate such charge sensing in a double top
gated MOS system. The current through a point contact constriction integrated
near a quantum dot shows sharp 2% changes corresponding to charge transitions
between the dot and a nearby lead. We extract the coupling capacitance between
the charge sensor and the quantum dot, and we show that it agrees well with a
3D capacitance model of the integrated sensor and quantum dot system.
