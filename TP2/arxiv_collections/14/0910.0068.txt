In this talk, I review the T-odd correlations induced by CP violating
anomalous top-quark couplings at both production and decay level in the process
gg --> t t_bar --> (b mu+ nu_mu) (b_bar mu-nu_mu_bar). In addition I will also
focus on experimental sensitivities corresponding to the anomalous couplings at
the LHC.
