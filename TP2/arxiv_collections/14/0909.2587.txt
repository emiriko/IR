The PHENIX experiment has conducted searches for the QCD critical point with
measurements of multiplicity fluctuations, transverse momentum fluctuations,
event-by-event kaon-to-pion ratios, elliptic flow, and correlations.
Measurements have been made in several collision systems as a function of
centrality and transverse momentum. The results do not show significant
evidence of critical behavior in the collision systems and energies studied,
although several interesting features are discussed.
