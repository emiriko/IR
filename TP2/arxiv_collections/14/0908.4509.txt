In this paper we define a new class of weighted complex networks sharing
several properties with fractal sets, and whose topology can be completely
analytically characterized in terms of the involved parameters and of the
fractal dimension. The proposed framework defines an unifying general theory of
fractal networks able to unravel some hidden mechanisms responsible for the
emergence of fractal structures in Nature.
