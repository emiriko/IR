A chain of interacting particles subject also to a nonlinear on-site
potential admits stable soliton-like configurations : static kinks. The linear
normal-modes around such a kink contain a discrete set of localized,
gap-separated modes. Quantization of the Hamiltonian in these modes results in
an interacting system of phonons. We investigate numerically the coherence
properties of such localized modes at low temperatures using a non-Markovian
master equation. We show that low decoherence rates can be achieved in these
nonlinear configurations for a surprisingly long time. If realized in the ion
trap, kink internal modes may be advantageously used for Quantum Information
Processing.
