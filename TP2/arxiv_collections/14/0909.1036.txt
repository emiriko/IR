I show that quantum theory is the only probabilistic framework that permits
arbitrary processes to be emulated by sequences of local measurements. This
supports the view that, contrary to conventional wisdom, measurement should not
be regarded as a complex phenomenon in need of a dynamical explanation but
rather as a primitive -- and perhaps the only primitive -- operation of the
theory.
