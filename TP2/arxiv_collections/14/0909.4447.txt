A recent paper proposes a way of constructing infinite dimensional symmetries
of the non-supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills action using isometries of the
space-time. We review the Lagrangian formulation of N = 4 super Yang-Mills MHV
rules and extend the approach taken for the non-supersymmetric case to
construct infinite dimensional symmetries of self-dual N = 4 super Yang-Mills.
