Rolf Landauer made important contributions to many branches of science.
Within the broad area of transport in disordered media, he wrote seminal papers
on electrical conduction in macroscopically inhomogeneous materials, as well as
fundamental analyses of electron transport in quantum mechanical systems with
disorder on the atomic scale. We review here some of these contributions. We
also briefly describe some main events in his personal and scientific life.
