One dimensional nano-beam photonic crystal cavities fabricated in silicon
dioxide are considered in both simulation and experiment. Quality factors of
over 10^4 are found via simulation, while quality factors of over 5*10^3 are
found in experiment, for cavities with mode volumes of 2.0 cubic wavelengths
(in oxide) and in the visible wavelength range (600-716nm). The dependences of
the cavity quality factor and mode volume for different design parameters are
also considered.
