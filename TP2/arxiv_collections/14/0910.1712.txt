The theories of brane world and multidimensional gravity are widely discussed
in the literature in connection with problems of evolution of early Universe,
including dark matter and energy. A natural physical concept is that a
distinguished surface in the space-time manifold is a topological defect
appeared as a result of a phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking.
The macroscopic theory of phase transitions allows considering the brane world
concept self-consistently, even without the knowledge of the nature of physical
vacuum. Gravitational properties of topological defects (cosmic strings,
monopoles,...) in extra dimensions are studied in General Relativity
considering the order parameter as a vector and a multiplet in a plane target
space of scalar fields. The common results and differences of these two
approaches are analyzed and demonstrated in detail. Among the variety of
regular solutions, there are those having brane features, including solutions
with multiple branes, as well as the ones of potential interest from the
standpoint of the dark matter and hierarchy problems. Regular configurations
have a growing gravitational potential and are able to trap the matter on the
brane. If the energy of spontaneous symmetry breaking is high, the attracting
potential can have several points of minimum. Identical in the uniform bulk
spin-less particles, being trapped within the separate points of minimum,
acquire different masses and appear to an observer on brane as different
particles with integer spins.
