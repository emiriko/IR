Polycrystalline Sr1-xNdxFeAsF samples were prepared at various Nd-doping
levels using both a stoichiometric mixture of the starting materials and in
slight excess amounts of FeAs. Susceptibility and resistivity of the samples
were studied down to 4 K revealing a probable coexistence of superconductivity
and a magnetic ordering. Temperature dependence of resistivity for all the
Nd-doped samples shows the presence of a transition below 15 K most likely
originating from the magnetic ordering of Nd moments, while the
spin-density-wave anomaly at 175 K survives up to 0.35 Nd-doping.
Superconductivity only occurs above 0.40 Nd-doping with onset maximum Tc
reaching as high as 52 K.
