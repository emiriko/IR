Large extragalactic surveys allow us to trace, in a statistical sense, how
supermassive black holes, their host galaxies, and their dark matter halos
evolve together over cosmic time, and so explore the consequences of AGN
feedback on galaxy evolution. Recent studies have found significant links
between the accretion states of black holes and galaxy stellar populations,
local environments, and obscuration by gas and dust. This article describes
some recent results and shows how such studies may provide new constraints on
models of the co-evolution of galaxies and their central SMBHs. Finally, I
discuss observational prospects for the proposed Wide-Field X-ray Telescope
mission.
