We revisit the vertical structure of black hole accretion disks in spherical
coordinates. By comparing the advective cooling with the viscous heating, we
show that advection-dominated disks are geometrically thick, i.e., with the
half-opening angle > 2\pi/5, rather than slim as supposed previously in the
literature.
