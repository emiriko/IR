We use graphical field gradients in an adynamical, background independent
fashion to propose a new approach to quantum gravity and unification. Our
proposed reconciliation of general relativity and quantum field theory is based
on a modification of their graphical instantiations, i.e., Regge calculus and
lattice gauge theory, respectively, which we assume are fundamental to their
continuum counterparts. Accordingly, the fundamental structure is a graphical
amalgam of space, time, and sources (in parlance of quantum field theory)
called a "spacetimesource element." These are fundamental elements of space,
time, and sources, not source elements in space and time. The transition
amplitude for a spacetimesource element is computed using a path integral with
discrete graphical action. The action for a spacetimesource element is
constructed from a difference matrix K and source vector J on the graph, as in
lattice gauge theory. K is constructed from graphical field gradients so that
it contains a non-trivial null space and J is then restricted to the row space
of K, so that it is divergence-free and represents a conserved exchange of
energy-momentum. This construct of K and J represents an adynamical global
constraint between sources, the spacetime metric, and the energy-momentum
content of the element, rather than a dynamical law for time-evolved entities.
We use this approach via modified Regge calculus to correct proper distance in
the Einstein-deSitter cosmology model yielding a fit of the Union2 Compilation
supernova data that matches LambdaCDM without having to invoke accelerating
expansion or dark energy. A similar modification to lattice gauge theory
results in an adynamical account of quantum interference.
