Is the turbulence in cluster-forming regions internally driven by stellar
outflows or the consequence of a large-scale turbulent cascade? We address this
question by studying the turbulent energy spectrum in NGC 1333. Using synthetic
13CO maps computed with a snapshot of a supersonic turbulence simulation, we
show that the VCS method of Lazarian and Pogosyan provides an accurate estimate
of the turbulent energy spectrum. We then apply this method to the 13CO map of
NGC 1333 from the COMPLETE database. We find the turbulent energy spectrum is a
power law, E(k) k^-beta, in the range of scales 0.06 pc < ell < 1.5 pc, with
slope beta=1.85\pm 0.04. The estimated energy injection scale of stellar
outflows in NGC 1333 is ell_inj 0.3 pc, well resolved by the observations.
There is no evidence of the flattening of the energy spectrum above the scale
ell_inj predicted by outflow-driven simulations and analytical models. The
power spectrum of integrated intensity is also a nearly perfect power law in
the range of scales 0.16 pc < ell < 7.9 pc, with no feature above ell_inj. We
conclude that the observed turbulence in NGC 1333 does not appear to be driven
primarily by stellar outflows.
