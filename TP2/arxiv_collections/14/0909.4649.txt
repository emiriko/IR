We consider a system of three identical bosons near a Feshbach resonance in
the universal regime with large scattering length usually described by model
independent zero-range potentials. We employ the adiabatic hyperspherical
approximation and derive the rigorous large-distance equation for the adiabatic
potential for finite-range interactions. The effective range correction to the
zero-range approximation must be supplemented by a new term of the same order.
The non-adiabatic term can be decisive. Efimov physics is always confined to
the range between effective range and scattering length. The analytical results
agree with numerical calculations for realistic potentials.
