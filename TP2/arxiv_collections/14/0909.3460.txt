We report low-temperature thermal-expansion measurements on single crystals
of the {\it layered} heavy fermion system \cri ($0.3\leq x \leq 0.6$) and
compare it with a previous study on the related {\it cubic} system \ci [R.
K\"{u}chler {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 96}, 256403 (2006)]. Both
systems display a quantum critical point as proven by a divergent Gr\"uneisen
ratio. Most remarkably, the three-dimensional itinerant model explains quantum
criticality in {\it both} systems, suggesting that the crystalline anisotropy
in \cri is unimportant. This is ascribed to the effect of weak disorder in
these doped systems.
