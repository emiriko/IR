We present a detailed study of GRB090111, focusing on its extra soft
power-law photon index Gamma>5 at the very steep decay phase emission
(power-law index alpha=5.1, steeper than 96% of GRBs detected by Swift) and the
following peculiar X-ray re-brightening. Our spectral analysis supports the
hypothesis of a comoving Band spectrum with the the peak of the nu*F_nu
spectrum evolving with time to lower values: a period of higher temporal
variability in the 1-2 keV light-curve ends when the E_peak evolves outside the
energy band. The X-ray re-brightening shows extreme temporal properties when
compared to a homogeneous sample of 82 early flares detected by Swift. While an
internal origin cannot be excluded, we show these properties to be consistent
with the energy injection in refreshed shocks produced by slow shells colliding
with the fastest ones from behind, well after the internal shocks that are
believed to give rise to the prompt emission have ceased.
