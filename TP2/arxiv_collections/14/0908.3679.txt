We study the separability of symmetric bipartite quantum states and show that
a single correlation measurement is sufficient to detect the entanglement of
any bipartite symmetric state with a non-positive partial transpose. We also
discuss entanglement conditions and entanglement witnesses for states with a
positive partial transpose.
