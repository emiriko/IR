We analyse the effect of the canonical quantization of the rotational mode of
the O(3) $\sigma$-model which includes the Skyrme term. Numerical evidence is
presented that the quantum correction to the mass of the rotationally-invariant
charge $n=1,2$ configurations may stabilize the solution even in the limit of
vanishing potential. The corresponding range of values of the parameters is
discussed.
