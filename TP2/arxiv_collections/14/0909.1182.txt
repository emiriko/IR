It is well known that the dark matter dominates the dynamics of galaxies and
clusters of galaxies. Its constituents remain a mystery despite an assiduous
search for them over the past three decades. Recent results from the
satellite-based PAMELA experiment detect an excess in the positron fraction at
energies between 10-100 GeV in the secondary cosmic ray spectrum. Other
experiments namely ATIC, HESS and FERMI show an excess in the total electron
(\ps + \el) spectrum for energies greater 100 GeV. These excesses in the
positron fraction as well as the electron spectrum could arise in local
astrophysical processes like pulsars, or can be attributed to the annihilation
of the dark matter particles. The second possibility gives clues to the
possible candidates for the dark matter in galaxies and other astrophysical
systems. In this article, we give a report of these exciting developments.
