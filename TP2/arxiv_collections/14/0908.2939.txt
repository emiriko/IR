We study the disk emission component hidden in the single-peaked Broad
Emission Lines (BELs) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We compare the observed
broad lines from a sample of 90 Seyfert 1 spectra taken from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey with simulated line profiles. We consider a two-component Broad Line
Region (BLR) model where an accretion disk and a surrounding non-disk region
with isotropic cloud velocities generate the simulated BEL profiles. The
analysis is mainly based in measurements of the full widths (at 10%, 20% and
30% of the maximum intensity) and of the asymmetries of the line profiles.
Comparing these parameters for the simulated and observed H$\alpha$ broad
lines, we {found} that the hidden disk emission {may} be present in BELs even
if the characteristic {of two peaked line profiles is} absent. For the
available sample of objects (Seyfert 1 galaxies with single-peaked BELs), our
study indicates that, {in the case of the hidden disk emission in single peaked
broad line profiles}, the disk inclination tends to be small (mostly
$i<25^\circ$) and that the contribution of the disk emission to the total flux
should be smaller than the contribution of the surrounding region.
