A coupling system between Gaussian type-microwave photon flux, static
magnetic field and fractal membranes (or other equivalent microwave lenses) can
be used to detect high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) in the microwave
band. We study the signal photon flux, background photon flux and the requisite
minimal accumulation time of the signal in the coupling system. Unlike pure
inverse Gertsenshtein effect (G-effect) caused by the HFGWs in the GHz band,
the the electromagnetic (EM) detecting scheme (EDS) proposed by China and the
US HFGW groups is based on the composite effect of the synchro-resonance effect
and the inverse G-effect. Key parameters in the scheme include first-order
perturbative photon flux (PPF) and not the second-order PPF; the
distinguishable signal is the transverse first-order PPF and not the
longitudinal PPF; the photon flux focused by the fractal membranes or other
equivalent microwave lenses is not only the transverse first-order PPF but the
total transverse photon flux, and these photon fluxes have different
signal-to-noise ratios at the different receiving surfaces. Theoretical
analysis and numerical estimation show that the requisite minimal accumulation
time of the signal at the special receiving surfaces and in the background
noise fluctuation would be $\sim10^3-10^5$ seconds for the typical laboratory
condition and parameters of $h_{r.m.s.}\sim10^{-26}-10^{-30}$ at 5GHz with
bandwidth $\sim$1Hz. In addition, we review the inverse G-effect in the EM
detection of the HFGWs, and it is shown that the EM detecting scheme based only
on the pure inverse G-effect in the laboratory condition would not be useful to
detect HFGWs in the microwave band.
