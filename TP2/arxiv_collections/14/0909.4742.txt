We present the phenomenology of a supersymmetric model with sneutrino as the
next to lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) in the gravitino dark matter
scenario at the LHC. We focus on the leptonic signatures and study the
feasibility of a particular trilepton signature as a possible discovery channel
of supersymmetry.
