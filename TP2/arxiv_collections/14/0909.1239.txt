SuperB is a next generation asymmetric e+e- flavor factory with a baseline
luminosity of 10^36 cm^-2 s^-1, 50-100 times the peak luminosity of the
existing B-factories. The physics motivation is presented and the
complementarity with the LHC is discussed. The conceptual design of the
detector is also briefly described.
