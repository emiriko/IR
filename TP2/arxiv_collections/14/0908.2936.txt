A closed set of coupled equations of motion for the description of
time-dependent electron transport is derived. It provides the time evolution of
energy-resolved quantities constructed from non-equilibrium Green functions. By
means of an auxiliary-mode expansion a viable propagation scheme for finite
temperatures is obtained, which allows to study arbitrary time dependences and
structured reservoirs. Two illustrative examples are presented.
