Secure group communication in heterogeneous environment is gaining popularity
due to the advent of wireless and ubiquitous computing. Although a number of
protocols for group key agreement have been proposed, most of them are not
applicable in heterogeneous environment where a number of computationally
limited nodes coexist with one or more computationally efficient nodes. Among
the few existing protocols, where some fail to satisfy the key agreement
properties, some are unable to handle the agreement for dynamic group. In this
work, we propose a constant round group key agreement protocol for
heterogeneous environment using polynomial interpolation. The protocol ensures
both communication and computation efficiency by shifting the major computation
load on powerful users, achieves true contributory key agreement property and
dynamic handling of user join and leave. The security of the protocol has been
analyzed under formal model. The comparison result shows considerable
improvement in protocol efficiency compared to the existing ones.
