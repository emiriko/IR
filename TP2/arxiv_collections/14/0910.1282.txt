The role of the topology and its relation with the geometry of biopolymers
under different physical conditions is a nontrivial and interesting problem.
Aiming at understanding this issue for a related simpler system, we use Monte
Carlo methods to investigate the interplay between writhe and knotting of ring
polymers in good and poor solvents. The model that we consider is interacting
self-avoiding polygons on the simple cubic lattice. For polygons with fixed
knot type we find a writhe distribution whose average depends on the knot type
but is insensitive to the length $N$ of the polygon and to solvent conditions.
This "topological contribution" to the writhe distribution has a value that is
consistent with that of ideal knots. The standard deviation of the writhe
increases approximately as $\sqrt{N}$ in both regimes and this constitutes a
geometrical contribution to the writhe. If the sum over all knot types is
considered, the scaling of the standard deviation changes, for compact
polygons, to $\sim N^{0.6}$. We argue that this difference between the two
regimes can be ascribed to the topological contribution to the writhe that, for
compact chains, overwhelms the geometrical one thanks to the presence of a
large population of complex knots at relatively small values of $N$. For
polygons with fixed writhe we find that the knot distribution depends on the
chosen writhe, with the occurrence of achiral knots being considerably
suppressed for large writhe. In general, the occurrence of a given knot thus
depends on a nontrivial interplay between writhe, chain length, and solvent
conditions.
