We propose a quantum key distribution protocol based on a quantum
retrodiction protocol, known as the Mean King problem. The protocol uses a two
way quantum channel. We show security against coherent attacks in a
transmission error free scenario, even if Eve is allowed to attack both
transmissions. This establishes a connection between retrodiction and key
distribution.
