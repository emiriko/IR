R-hadrons are predicted in a range of supersymmetric scenarios including
split-supersymmetry and gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. In this paper,
the discovery potential of the ATLAS experiment for gluino and stop-based
R-hadrons is outlined. A range of final state observables such as high
transverse momentum muon-like objects and information on ionization energy loss
is used. It is shown that ATLAS would be able to discover such particles at
comparatively modest amounts of luminosity (1fb-1) for masses up to 1 TeV.
