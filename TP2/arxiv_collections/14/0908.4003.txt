It is a classical result of Stein and Waterman that the asymptotic number of
RNA secondary structures is $1.104366 n^{-3/2} 2.618034^n$. In this paper, we
study combinatorial asymptotics for two special subclasses of RNA secondary
structures - canonical and saturated structures. Canonical secondary structures
were introduced by Bompf\"unewerer et al., who noted that the run time of
Vienna RNA Package is substantially reduced when restricting computations to
canonical structures. Here we provide an explanation for the speed-up.
Saturated secondary structures have the property that no base pairs can be
added without violating the definition of secondary structure (i.e. introducing
a pseudoknot or base triple). Here we compute the asymptotic number of
saturated structures, we show that the asymptotic expected number of base pairs
is $0.337361 n$, and the asymptotic number of saturated stem-loop structures is
$0.323954 1.69562^n$, in contrast to the number $2^{n-2}$ of (arbitrary)
stem-loop structures as classically computed by Stein and Waterman. Finally, we
show that the density of states for [all resp. canonical resp. saturated]
secondary structures is asymptotically Gaussian. We introduce a stochastic
greedy method to sample random saturated structures, called quasi-random
saturated structures, and show that the expected number of base pairs of is
$0.340633 n$.
