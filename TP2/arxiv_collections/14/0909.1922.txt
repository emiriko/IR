Inflation generically produces primordial gravitational waves with a red
spectral tilt. In this paper we calculate the backreaction produced by these
gravitational waves on the expansion of the universe. We find that in radiation
domination the backreaction acts as a relativistic fluid, while in matter
domination a small dark energy emerges with an equation of state w=-8/9.
