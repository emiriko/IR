We report the influence of Ni/Mn ordering on the spin-phonon coupling in
multifunctional La2NiMnO6. Three types of films with different levels of
structural order, including long-range Ni/Mn cation order, cation disorder, and
an admixture of the ordered and disordered phases, are compared by polarized
micro-Raman spectroscopy and magnetometry. Each film displays a strong
dependence on the polarization configuration and a unique set of Raman active
phonon excitations. Long-range cation ordering results in the splitting of
Raman active phonon peaks because of Brillouin zone folding and lowering
symmetry. Phonon mode softening begins clearly at a distinct temperature for
each sample revealing a strong spin-lattice interaction. It follows closely the
magnetization curve in ordered films. Unlike the admixture and the ordered
films, softening behavior is strongly suppressed in the cation-disordered
films. These differences may be understood based on the variation in amplitude
of the spin-spin correlation functions due to the local Ni/Mn cation ordering.
