The explorative mind-map is a dynamic framework, that emerges automatically
from the input, it gets. It is unlike a verificative modeling system where
existing (human) thoughts are placed and connected together. In this regard,
explorative mind-maps change their size continuously, being adaptive with
connectionist cells inside; mind-maps process data input incrementally and
offer lots of possibilities to interact with the user through an appropriate
communication interface. With respect to a cognitive motivated situation like a
conversation between partners, mind-maps become interesting as they are able to
process stimulating signals whenever they occur. If these signals are close to
an own understanding of the world, then the conversational partner becomes
automatically more trustful than if the signals do not or less match the own
knowledge scheme. In this (position) paper, we therefore motivate explorative
mind-maps as a cognitive engine and propose these as a decision support engine
to foster trust.
