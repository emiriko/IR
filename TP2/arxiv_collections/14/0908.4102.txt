Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi inhomogeneous spacetimes can be used as a cosmological
model to account for the type Ia supernova data. However, such models also give
rise to large velocities of galaxy clusters with respect to the cosmic
microwave background. Those velocities can be measured using the kinematic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. This paper presents a calculation of galaxy cluster
velocities as a function of redshift for such a model.
