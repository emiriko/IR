We use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe the electronic
excitations of the non-superconducting state that exists between the
antiferromagnetic Mott insulator at zero doping and the superconducting state
at larger dopings in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}. We find that this state is a
nodal liquid whose excitation gap becomes zero only at points in momentum
space. Despite exhibiting a resistivity characteristic of an insulator and the
absence of coherent quasiparticle peaks, this material has the same gap
structure as the d-wave superconductor. We observe a smooth evolution of the
spectrum across the insulator-to-superconductor transition, which suggests that
high temperature superconductivity emerges when quantum phase coherence is
established in a non-superconducting nodal liquid.
