Critical phenomena and quantum phase transitions are paradigmatic concepts in
modern condensed matter physics. A central example in the field of mesoscopic
physics is the localization-delocalization (metal-insulator) quantum phase
transition driven by disorder -- the Anderson transition. Although the notion
of localization has appeared half a century ago, this field is still full of
surprising new developments. The most recent arenas where novel peculiar
localization phenomena have been studied are graphene and topological
insulators, i.e., bulk insulators with delocalized (topologically protected)
states on their surface. Besides exciting physical properties, the topological
protection renders such systems promising candidates for a variety of
prospective electronic and spintronic devices. It is thus of crucial importance
to understand properties of boundary metallic modes in the realistic systems
when both disorder and interaction are present. Here we find a novel critical
state which emerges in the bulk of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall (QSH)
systems and on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators with
strong spin-orbit interaction due to the interplay of nontrivial Z_2 topology
and the Coulomb repulsion. At low temperatures, this state possesses a
universal value of electrical conductivity. In particular, we predict that the
direct QSH phase transition occurs via this novel state. Remarkably, the
interaction-induced critical state emerges on the surface of a
three-dimensional topological insulator without any adjustable parameters. This
``self-organized quantum criticality'' is a novel concept in the field of
interacting disordered systems.
