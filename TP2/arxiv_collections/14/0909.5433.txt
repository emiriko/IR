I study the one-dimensional spin-1 Blume-Emery-Griffiths model with bilinear
and biquadratic exchange interactions and single-ion crystal field under an
applied magnetic field. This model can be exactly mapped into a tight-binding
Hubbard model - extended to include intersite interactions - provided one
renormalizes the chemical and the on-site potentials, which become temperature
dependent. After this transformation, I provide the exact solution of the
Blume-Emery-Griffiths model in one dimension by means of the Green's functions
and equations of motion formalism. I investigate the magnetic variations of
physical quantities - such as magnetization, quadrupolar moment, susceptibility
- for different values of the interaction parameters and of the applied field,
focusing on the role played by the biquadratic interaction in the breakdown of
the magnetization plateaus.
