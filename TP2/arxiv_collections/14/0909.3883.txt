Recently many studies have considered the possibility of a Lorentz Invariance
Violation (LIV), and explored its consequences in a wide range of experiments.
If this is true, a LIV could explains some mysteries in Cosmology. In this
paper specifically, we will analyze the effects on The Primordial Baryogenesis
because it is one of the more important and mysterious phenomena of the
Big-Bang, that happened at very high energies, so we have a real chance to
obtain an important effect. We will see that this effect could exist, depending
directly on the temperature, that is very high at this time in the history of
the Universe. So, it is possible to use this result as a test for a LIV and
explore the possibility that the boson that started the baryogenesis explains,
in part, the dark matter. We will obtain estimates about the beginning time of
the baryogenesis and the boson mass too, that come directly from the LIV.
