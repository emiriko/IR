Using properly defined Feynman propagator we obtain non--zero imaginary
contribution to the scalar field effective action in even dimensional de Sitter
space. Such a propagator follows from the path integral in de Sitter space and
obeys composition principle proposed in arXiv:0709.2899. The obtained
expression for the effective action shows particle production with the
Gibbons--Hawking rate.
