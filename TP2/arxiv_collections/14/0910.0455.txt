We propose here a formal foundation for practical calculations of vibrational
mode lifetimes in solids. The approach is based on a recursion method analysis
of the Liouvillian. From this we derive the lifetime of a vibrational mode in
terms of moments of the power spectrum of the Liouvillian as projected onto the
relevant subspace of phase space. In practical terms, the moments are evaluated
as ensemble averages of well-defined operators, meaning that the entire
calculation is to be done with Monte Carlo. These insights should lead to
significantly shorter calculations compared to current methods. A companion
piece presents numerical results.
