We study the phase structure of the QGP-Hadron system under quasi-static
equilibrium using the Ramanathan et al. statistical model for the QGP fireball
formation in a hadronic medium. While in the earlier published studies we had
used the Peshier effective potential which is appropriate for the deconfined
QGP phase but could be extrapolated to the transition region from the higher
momentum regime, in this paper we study the same system using the Cornell and
Richardson potentials which are more relevant for the low momentum confinement
regime, but could again be extrapolated to the transition region from below.
Surprisingly, the overall picture in both the cases are quite similar with
minor divergences,(though,the results with the Richardson potential shows a
sizable deviation from the other two potentials), thus indicating the
robustness of the model and its self-consistency. The result of our numerical
results pertaining to the variation of the velocity of sound in the QGP-Hadron
medium with temperature in the various scenarios considered by us, is that, the
phase transition seems to be a gentle roll-over of phases rather than a sharp
transition of either the first or second order, a result in conformity with
recent lattice calculations, but with much less effort.
