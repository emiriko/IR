We study the response of a model micro-electrochemical cell to a large ac
voltage of frequency comparable to the inverse cell relaxation time. To bring
out the basic physics, we consider the simplest possible model of a symmetric
binary electrolyte confined between parallel-plate blocking electrodes,
ignoring any transverse instability or fluid flow. We analyze the resulting
one-dimensional problem by matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of thin
double layers and extend previous work into the strongly nonlinear regime,
which is characterized by two novel features - significant salt depletion in
the electrolyte near the electrodes and, at very large voltage, the breakdown
of the quasi-equilibrium structure of the double layers. The former leads to
the prediction of "ac capacitive desalination", since there is a time-averaged
transfer of salt from the bulk to the double layers, via oscillating diffusion
layers. The latter is associated with transient diffusion limitation, which
drives the formation and collapse of space-charge layers, even in the absence
of any net Faradaic current through the cell. We also predict that steric
effects of finite ion sizes (going beyond dilute solution theory) act to
suppress the strongly nonlinear regime in the limit of concentrated
electrolytes, ionic liquids and molten salts. Beyond the model problem, our
reduced equations for thin double layers, based on uniformly valid matched
asymptotic expansions, provide a useful mathematical framework to describe
additional nonlinear responses to large ac voltages, such as Faradaic
reactions, electro-osmotic instabilities, and induced-charge electrokinetic
phenomena.
