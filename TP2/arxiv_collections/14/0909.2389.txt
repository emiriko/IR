A triangulated spherical surface model is numerically studied, and it is
shown that the model undergoes phase transitions between the smooth phase and
the collapsed phase. The model is defined by using a director field, which is
assumed to have an interaction with a normal of the surface. The interaction
between the directors and the surface maintains the surface shape. The director
field is not defined within the two-dimensional differential geometry, and this
is in sharp contrast to the conventional surface models, where the surface
shape is maintained only by the curvature energies. We also show that the
interaction makes the Nambu-Goto model well-defined, where the bond potential
is given by the area of triangles; the Nambu-Goto model is well-known as an
ill-defined one even when the conventional two-dimensional bending energy is
included in the Hamiltonian.
