The development of electronic commerce is characterized with anonymity,
uncertainty, lack of control and potential opportunism. Therefore, the success
of electronic commerce significantly depends on providing security and privacy
for its consumers sensitive personal data. Consumers lack of acceptance in
electronic commerce adoption today is not merely due to the concern on security
and privacy of their personal data, but also lack of trust and reliability of
Web vendors. Consumers trust in online transactions is crucial for the
continuous growth and development of electronic commerce. Since Business to
Consumer (B2C) ecommerce requires the consumers to engage the technologies, the
consumers face a variety of security risks. This study addressed the role of
security, privacy and risk perceptions of consumers to shop online in order to
establish a consensus among them. The analyses provided descriptive frequencies
for the research variables and for each of the study s research constructs. In
addition, the analyses were completed with factor analysis and Pearson
correlation coefficients. The findings suggested that perceived privacy of
online transaction on trust is mediated by perceived security, and consumers
trust in online transaction is significantly related with the trustworthiness
of Web vendors. Also, consumers trust is negatively associated with perceived
risks in online transactions. However, there is no significant impact from
perceived security and perceived privacy to trust in online transactions.
