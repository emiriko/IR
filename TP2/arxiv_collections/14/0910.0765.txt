We present a new dispersive analysis of the isospin breaking decay eta --> 3
pi. The resulting representation of the decay amplitude allows us to determine
the quark mass double ratio Q and we find as a preliminary result Q = 22.3 +/-
0.4. Finally, we discuss a number of improvements that we intend to implement
in the future.
