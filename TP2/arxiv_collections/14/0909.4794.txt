I report on the observation of electroweak production of single top quarks in
proton anti-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV using 2.3
inverse-fb of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider. Using events containing an isolated electron or muon, missing
transverse energy, two, three or four jets, with one or two of them identified
as originating from the fragmentation of a b quark, the measured cross section
for the process (pp-bar to tb+X,tqb+X) is 3.94 +- 0.88 pb (for a top quark mass
of 170 GeV). The probability to measure a cross section at this value or higher
in the absence of signal is 2.5E-7, corresponding to a 5.0 standard deviation
significance. Using the same dataset, the measured cross sections for the t-
and the s-channel processes when determined simultaneously with no assumption
on their relative production rate are 3.14+0.94-0.80 pb and 1.05+-0.81pb
respectively, consistent with standard model expectations. The measured
t-channel cross section has a significance of 4.8 standard deviations,
representing the first evidence for the production of an individual single top
process to be detected.
