We study Weyl symmetry for non-relativistic conformal filed theories on
curved spatial spaces, and calculate it's quantum anomaly. We show that there
is no geometric anomaly, and the non-relativistic Weyl anomaly can appear only
due to interaction. Also we study the anomaly by using the light-cone approach.
