It is possible to define and calculate in a gauge-invariant manner the chiral
as well as the partial wave content of the quark-antiquark Fock component of a
meson in the infrared, where mass is generated. Using the variational method
and a set of interpolators that span a complete chiral basis we extract in a
lattice QCD Monte Carlo simulation with two dynamical light quarks the orbital
angular momentum and spin content of the rho-meson. We obtain in the infrared a
simple 3S1 component as a leading component of the rho-meson with a small
admixture of the 3D1 partial wave, in agreement with the SU(6) flavor-spin
symmetry.
