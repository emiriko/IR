We propose a polarization-dependent spatial phase modulation method to purify
the two-photon polarization entanglement generated by the biexciton cascade
decay in a single semiconductor quantum dot. In principle, our method can
completely compensate the random phase acquired from the decay of the
non-degenerate exciton states in time domain. In frequency domain, our method
is equivalent to shifting photon frequency according to its polarization. The
method can be applied immediately by existing experimental set-ups.
