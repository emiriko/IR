Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars play a fundamental role in the s-process
nucleosynthesis during their thermal pulsing phase. The theoretical predictions
obtained by AGB models at different masses, s-process efficiencies, dilution
factors and initial r-enrichment, are compared with spectroscopic observations
of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor stars enriched in s-process elements, CEMP(s),
collected from the literature. We discuss here five stars as example, CS
22880-074, CS 22942-019, CS 29526-110, HE 0202-2204, and LP 625-44. All these
objects lie on the main-sequence or on the giant phase, clearly before the
TP-AGB stage: the hypothesis of mass transfer from an AGB companion, would
explain the observed s-process enhancement. CS 29526-110 and LP 625-44 are
CEMP(s+r) objects, and are interpreted assuming that the molecular cloud, from
which the binary system formed, was already enriched in r-process elements by
SNII pollution. In several cases, the observed s-process distribution may be
accounted for AGB models of different initial masses with proper 13C-pocket
efficiency and dilution factor. Na (and Mg), produced via the neutron capture
chain starting from 22Ne, may provide an indicator of the initial AGB mass.
