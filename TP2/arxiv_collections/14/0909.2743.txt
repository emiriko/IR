We use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to experimentally generate a bound
entangled (more precisely: pseudo bound entangled) state, i.e. a quantum state
which is non-distillable but nevertheless entangled. Our quantum system
consists of three qubits. We characterize the produced state via state
tomography to show that the created state has a positive partial transposition
with respect to any bipartite splitting, and we use a witness operator to prove
its entanglement.
