The interaction of a weak probe laser with an inverted-Y type four-level
atomic system driven by two additional coherent fields is investigated
theoretically. Under the influence of the coherent coupling fields, the
steady-state linear susceptibility of the probe laser shows that the system can
have single or double electromagnetically induced transparency windows
depending on the amplitude and the detuning of the coupling lasers. The
corresponding index of refraction associated with the group velocity of the
probe laser can be controlled at both transparency windows by the coupling
fields. The propagation of the probe field can be switched from superluminal
near the resonance to subluminal on resonance within the single transparency
window when two coupling lasers are on resonance. This provides a potential
application in quantum information processing. We propose an atomic $^{87}Rb$
system for experimental observation.
