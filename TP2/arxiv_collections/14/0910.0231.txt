We study the stability of classical structures in chaotic systems when a
dissipative quantum evolution takes place. We consider a paradigmatic model,
the quantum baker map in contact with a heat bath at finite temperature. We
analyze the behavior of the purity, fidelity and Husimi distributions
corresponding to initial states localized on short periodic orbits (scar
functions) and map eigenstates. Scar functions, that have a fundamental role in
the semiclassical description of chaotic systems, emerge as very robust against
environmental perturbations. This is confirmed by the study of other states
localized on classical structures. Also, purity and fidelity show a
complementary behavior as decoherence measures.
