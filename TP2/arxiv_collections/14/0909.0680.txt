(Abridged) We present mass models of a sample of 14 spiral and 14 S0 galaxies
that constrain their stellar and dark matter content. For each galaxy we derive
the stellar mass distribution from near-infrared photometry under the
assumptions of axisymmetry and a constant Ks-band stellar mass-to-light ratio,
(M/L)_Ks. To this we add a dark halo assumed to follow a spherically symmetric
NFW profile and a correlation between concentration and dark mass within the
virial radius, M_DM. We solve the Jeans equations for the corresponding
potential under the assumption of constant anisotropy in the meridional plane,
beta_z. By comparing the predicted second velocity moment to observed long-slit
stellar kinematics, we determine the three best-fitting parameters of the
model: (M/L)_Ks, M_DM and beta_z. These simple axisymmetric Jeans models are
able to accurately reproduce the wide range of observed stellar kinematics,
which typically extend to ~2-3 Re or, equivalently, ~0.5-1 R_25. We find a
median stellar mass-to-light ratio at Ks-band of 1.09 (solar units) with an rms
scatter of 0.31. We present preliminary comparisons between this large sample
of dynamically determined stellar mass-to-light ratios and the predictions of
stellar population models. The stellar population models predict slightly lower
mass-to-light ratios than we measure. The mass models contain a median of 15
per cent dark matter by mass within an effective radius Re, and 49 per cent
within the optical radius R_25. Dark and stellar matter contribute equally to
the mass within a sphere of radius 4.1 Re or 1.0 R_25. There is no evidence of
any significant difference in the dark matter content of the spirals and S0s in
our sample.
