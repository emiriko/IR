We show that pseudo-spin 1/2 degrees of freedom can be categorized in two
types according to their behavior under time reversal. One type exhibits the
properties of ordinary spin whose three Cartesian components are all odd under
time reversal. For the second type, only one of the components is odd while the
other two are even. We discuss several physical examples for this second type
of pseudo-spin and highlight observable consequences that can be used to
distinguish it from ordinary spin.
