Delving into present trends and anticipating future malware trends, a hybrid,
SQL on the server-side, JavaScript on the client-side, self-replicating worm
based on two-stage quines was designed and implemented on an ad-hoc scenario
instantiating a very common software pattern. The proof of concept code
combines techniques seen in the wild, in the form of SQL injections leading to
cross-site scripting JavaScript inclusion, and seen in the laboratory, in the
form of SQL quines propa- gated via RFIDs, resulting in a hybrid code
injection. General features of hybrid worms are also discussed.
