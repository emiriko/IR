In this paper we develop a stochastic boundary conditions (SBC) for
event-driven molecular dynamics simulations of a finite volume embedded within
an infinite environment. In this method, we first collect the statistics of
injection/ejection events in periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Once
sufficient statistics are collected, we remove the PBC and turn on the SBC. In
the SBC simulations, we allow particles leaving the system to be truly ejected
from the simulation, and randomly inject particles at the boundaries by
resampling from the injection/ejection statistics collected from the current or
previous simulations. With the SBC, we can measure thermodynamic quantities
within the grand canonical ensemble, based on the particle number and energy
fluctuations. To demonstrate how useful the SBC algorithm is, we simulated a
hard disk gas and measured the pair distribution function, the compressibility
and the specific heat, comparing them against literature values.
