We present a minimal physical model for the flagellar motor that enables
bacteria to swim. Our model explains the experimentally measured torque-speed
relationship of the proton-driven E. coli motor at various pH and temperature
conditions. In particular, the dramatic drop of torque at high rotation speeds
(the "knee") is shown to arise from saturation of the proton flux. Moreover, we
show that shot noise in the proton current dominates the diffusion of motor
rotation at low loads. This suggests a new way to probe the discreteness of the
energy source, analogous to measurements of charge quantization in
superconducting tunnel junctions.
