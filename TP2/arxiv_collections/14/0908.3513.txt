Recent theories and experiments have suggested that strong spin-orbit
coupling effects in certain band insulators can give rise to a new phase of
quantum matter, the so-called topological insulator, which can show macroscopic
entanglement effects. Such systems feature two-dimensional surface states whose
electrodynamic properties are described not by the conventional Maxwell
equations but rather by an attached axion field, originally proposed to
describe strongly interacting particles. It has been proposed that a
topological insulator with a single spin-textured Dirac cone interfaced with a
superconductor can form the most elementary unit for performing fault-tolerant
quantum computation. Here we present an angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy study and first-principle theoretical calculation-predictions that
reveal the first observation of such a topological state of matter featuring a
single-surface-Dirac-cone realized in the naturally occurring Bi$_2$Se$_3$
class of materials. Our results, supported by our theoretical predictions and
calculations, demonstrate that undoped compound of this class of materials can
serve as the parent matrix compound for the long-sought topological device
where in-plane surface carrier transport would have a purely quantum
topological origin. Our study further suggests that the undoped compound
reached via n-to-p doping should show topological transport phenomena even at
room temperature.
