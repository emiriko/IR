We demonstrate experimentally that disordered scattering can be used to
improve, rather than deteriorate, the focusing resolution of a lens. By using
wavefront shaping to compensate for scattering, light was focused to a spot as
small as one tenth of the diffraction limit of the lens. We show both
experimentally and theoretically that it is the scattering medium, rather than
the lens, that determines the width of the focus. Despite the disordered
propagation of the light, the profile of the focus was always exactly equal to
the theoretical best focus that we derived.
