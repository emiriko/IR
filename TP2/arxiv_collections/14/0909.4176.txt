Nb doped SrTiO3, the first discovered two-gap superconductor, is shown to be
the most unconventional one of the known multiband superconductors, since the
smaller of the two superconducting gaps follows a non BCS temperature
dependence. Such a behavior stems from two cooperating effects: an extreme
anisotropy in the frequency dependent interactions, involving one very soft
mode and an almost vanishing interband interaction. In contrast to all other
multiband superconductors, the temperature dependence of the superfluid density
of Nb doped SrTiO3 is predicted to exhibit an inflection point close to Tc and
not close to T=0.
