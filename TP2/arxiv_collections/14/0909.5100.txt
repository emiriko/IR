We discuss the jet kinematics of a complete flux-density-limited sample of
135 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) resulting from a 13 year program to
investigate the structure and evolution of parsec-scale jet phenomena. Our
analysis is based on new 2 cm Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images obtained
between 2002 and 2007, but includes our previously published observations made
at the same wavelength, and is supplemented by VLBA archive data. In all, we
have used 2424 images spanning the years 1994-2007 to study and determine the
motions of 526 separate jet features in 127 jets. The data quality and temporal
coverage (a median of 15 epochs per source) of this complete AGN jet sample
represents a significant advance over previous kinematics surveys. In all but
five AGNs, the jets appear one-sided, most likely the result of differential
Doppler boosting. In general the observed motions are directed along the jet
ridge line, outward from the optically thick core feature. We directly observe
changes in speed and/or direction in one third of the well-sampled jet
components in our survey. While there is some spread in the apparent speeds of
separate features within an individual jet, the dispersion is about three times
smaller than the overall dispersion of speeds among all jets. This supports the
idea that there is a characteristic flow that describes each jet, which we have
characterized by the fastest observed component speed. The observed maximum
speed distribution is peaked at ~10c, with a tail that extends out to ~50c.
This requires a distribution of intrinsic Lorentz factors in the parent
population that range up to ~50. We also note the presence of some rare
low-pattern speeds or even stationary features in otherwise rapidly flowing
jets... (abridged)
