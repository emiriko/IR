We present full QCD and SUSY-QCD corrections to neutralino pair annihilation
into quark-antiquark pairs. We show results and numerically evaluate their
impact on the neutralino annihilation cross section and the relic density in
scenarios with non-universal gaugino masses. By comparing to the relic density
obtained from a pure leading order calculation, we demonstrate that the
corrections strongly influence the extraction of SUSY mass parameters from
cosmological data.
