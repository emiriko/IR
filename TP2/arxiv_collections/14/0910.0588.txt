In this letter, hadronic decay channels of light pseudoscalar mesons are
realized in Yangian algebra. In the framework of Yangian, we find that these
decay channels can be formulated by acting transition operators, composed of
the generators of Yangian, on the corresponding pseudoscalar mesons. This new
description of decays allows us to present a possible interpretation of the new
unknown particle $X$ in the decay $K^0_L\to \pi^0 \pi^0 X$: it is an entangled
state of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$.
