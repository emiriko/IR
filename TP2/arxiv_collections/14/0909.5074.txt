A model for comminution processes in ball mills is presented. The model
provides an empirical approach using the physically realistic modelization of
the ball mill system, but also deployes the statistical method to extract
relevant thermodynamics observables. Those physical observables are
investigated by treating the whole system as a statistical macroscopic
ensemble.
