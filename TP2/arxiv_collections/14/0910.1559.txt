We survey the cohomology jumping loci and the Alexander-type invariants
associated to a space, or to its fundamental group. Though most of the material
is expository, we provide new examples and applications, which in turn raise
several questions and conjectures.
  The jump loci of a space X come in two basic flavors: the characteristic
varieties, or, the support loci for homology with coefficients in rank 1 local
systems, and the resonance varieties, or, the support loci for the homology of
the cochain complexes arising from multiplication by degree 1 classes in the
cohomology ring of X. The geometry of these varieties is intimately related to
the formality, (quasi-) projectivity, and homological finiteness properties of
\pi_1(X).
  We illustrate this approach with various applications to the study of
hyperplane arrangements, Milnor fibrations, 3-manifolds, and right-angled Artin
groups.
