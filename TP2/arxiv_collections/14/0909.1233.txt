The impact of pairing correlations on the fission barriers is investigated in
Relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov (RHB) theory and Relativistic Mean Field
(RMF)+BCS calculations. It is concluded that the constant gap approximation in
the usual RMF+BCS calculations does not provide an adequate description of the
barriers. The RHB calculations show that there is a substantial difference in
the predicted barrier heights between zero-range and finite range pairing
forces even in the case when the pairing strengths of these two forces are
adjusted to the same value of the pairing gap at the ground state.
