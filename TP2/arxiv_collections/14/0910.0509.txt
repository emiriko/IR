Boolean networks are discrete dynamical systems in which the state (zero or
one) of each node is updated at each time t to a state determined by the states
at time t-1 of those nodes that have links to it. When these systems are used
to model genetic control, the case of 'canalizing' update rules is of
particular interest. A canalizing rule is one for which a node state at time
$t$ is determined by the state at time t-1 of a single one of its inputs when
that inputting node is in its canalizing state. Previous work on the
order/disorder transition in Boolean networks considered complex, non-random
network topology. In the current paper we extend this previous work to account
for canalizing behavior.
