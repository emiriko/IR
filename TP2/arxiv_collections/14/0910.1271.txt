We present a detailed survey of the dynamical structure of the phase space
around the new moons of the Pluto - Charon system. The spatial elliptic
restricted three-body problem was used as model and stability maps were created
by chaos indicators. The orbital elements of the moons are in the stable domain
both on the semimajor axis - eccentricity and - inclination spaces. The
structures related to the 4:1 and 6:1 mean motion resonances are clearly
visible on the maps. They do not contain the positions of the moons, confirming
previous studies. We showed the possibility that Nix might be in the 4:1
resonance if its argument of pericenter or longitude of node falls in a certain
range. The results strongly suggest that Hydra is not in the 6:1 resonance for
arbitrary values of the argument of pericenter or longitude of node.
