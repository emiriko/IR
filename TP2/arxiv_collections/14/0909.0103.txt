We give a new expression for the expected number of inversions in the product
of n random adjacent transpositions in the symmetric group S_{m+1}. We then
derive from this expression the asymptotic behaviour of this number when n
scales with m in various ways. Our starting point is an equivalence, due to
Eriksson et al., with a problem of weighted walks confined to a triangular area
of the plane.
