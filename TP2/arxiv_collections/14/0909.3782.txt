We study systematically the impact of the time-even tensor terms of the
Skyrme energy density functional, i.e. terms bilinear in the spin-current
tensor density, on deformation properties of closed shell nuclei corresponding
to 20, 28, 40, 50, 82, and 126 neutron or proton shell closures. We compare
results obtained with three different families of Skyrme parameterizations
whose tensor terms have been adjusted on properties of spherical nuclei: (i)
TIJ interactions proposed in the first paper of this series [T. Lesinski et
al., Phys. Rev. C 76, 014312 (2007)] which were constructed through a complete
readjustment of the rest of the functional (ii) parameterizations whose tensor
terms have been added perturbatively to existing Skyrme interactions, with or
without readjusting the spin-orbit coupling constant. We analyse in detail the
mechanisms at play behind the impact of tensor terms on deformation properties
and how studying the latter can help screen out unrealistic parameterizations.
It is expected that findings of the present paper are to a large extent
independent of remaining deficiencies of the central and spin-orbit
interactions, and will be of great value for the construction of future,
improved energy functionals.
