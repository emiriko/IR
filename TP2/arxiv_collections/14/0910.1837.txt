We study how well-known effects of the long-ranged Friedel oscillations are
affected by strong electronic correlations. We first show that their range and
amplitude are significantly suppressed in strongly renormalized Fermi liquids.
We then investigate the interplay of elastic and inelastic scattering in the
presence of these oscillations. In the singular case of two-dimensional
systems, we show how the anomalous ballistic scattering rate is confined to a
very restricted temperature range even for moderate correlations. In general,
our analytical results indicate that a prominent role of Friedel oscillations
is relegated to weakly interacting systems.
