We present the complete automation of the universal subtraction formalism
proposed by Frixione, Kunszt, and Signer for the computation of any cross
section at the next-to-leading order in QCD. Given a process, the only
ingredient to be provided externally is the infrared- and ultraviolet-finite
contribution of virtual origin. Our implementation, currently restricted to the
case of e+e- collisions, is built upon and works in the same way as MadGraph.
It is particularly suited to parallel computation, and it can deal with any
physical process resulting from a theory implemented in MadGraph, thus
including the Standard Model as well as Beyond the Standard Model theories. We
give results for some sample processes that document the performances of the
implementation, and show in particular how the number of subtraction terms has
an extremely mild growth with final-state multiplicity.
