A recent quantum computing paper (G. S. Uhrig, Phys Rev Lett 98 100504
(2007)) analytically derived optimal pulse spacings for a multiple spin echo
sequence designed to remove decoherence in a two level system coupled to a
bath. The spacings in what has been called a UDD sequence differ dramatically
from the conventional, equal pulse spacing of a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill
(CPMG) multiple spin echo sequence. The UDD sequence was derived for a model
that is unrelated to magnetic resonance, but was recently shown theoretically
to be more general. Here we show that the UDD sequence has theoretical
advantages for magnetic resonance imaging of structured materials such as
tissue, where diffusion in compartmentalized and microstructured environments
leads to fluctuating fields on a range of different timescales. We also show
experimentally, both in excised tissue and in a live mouse tumor model, that
optimal UDD sequences produce different T2-weighted contrast than do CPMG
sequences with the same number of pulses and total delay, with substantial
enhancements in most regions.
