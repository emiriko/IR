As a part of the construction of an information theory based on general
probabilistic theories, we propose and investigate the several
distinguishability measures and "entropies" in general probabilistic theories.
As their applications, no-cloning theorems, information-disturbance theorems
are reformulated, and a bound of the accessible informations is discussed in
any general probabilistic theories, not resorting to quantum theory.
