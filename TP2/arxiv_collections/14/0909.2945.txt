We have discovered a new iron pnictide oxide superconductor
(Fe2As2)(Sr4(Mg,Ti)2O6). This material is isostructual with (Fe2As2)(Sr4M2O6)
(M = Sc, Cr), which was found in our previous study. The structure of this
compound is tetragonal with a space group of P4/nmm and consists of the
anti-fluorite type FeAs and perovskite-type blocking layers. The lattice
constants are a = 3.935 A and c = 15.952 A for (Fe2As2)(Sr4MgTiO6). In both
magnetization and resistivity measurements, this compound exhibits
superconductivity below 10 K. Moreover, ratio of Mg and Ti in this compound can
be changed toward Ti-rich composition. (Fe2As2)(Sr4Mg1-xTi1+xO6) phase is
obtained at 0 < x as a main phase, and Tc and superconducting volume fraction
increase with increasing x. The highest Tc(onset) was confirmed at 39 K for x =
0.6 in resistivity measurement.
