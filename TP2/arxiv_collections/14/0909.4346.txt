Based on the generalized Boltzmann equation and the reverse function of the
distribution function, we investigate the two-parameter generalized statistics
and get an expression between the two parameters (k,r) and the physical
quantities about the system considered. We find that the two parameters can
define some characteristics of the system. As examples, this result can just
return to the previous one obtained for Tsallis and statistics. For some
complex systems, we may need the two-parameter statistics to describe.
