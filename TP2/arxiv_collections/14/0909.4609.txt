We report electrical, magnetic, magnetodielectric and magnetoabsorption
properties of a polycrystalline GaFeO3. The resistivity measurement shows that
the sample is highly insulating below 200 K and the resistivity above 200 K
obey the Arrhenius law with an activation energy of Ea = 0.67 eV. An anomaly
occurs in the temperature dependence of permittivity (e) near the ferrimagnetic
transition temperature (TC = 228 K) in a zero magnetic field and it is
suppressed under H = 60 mT which indicates a possible magnetoelectric coupling
in GaFeO3 with a fractional change of de/e = -1.8% at 60 mT around TC. The
coercivity (HC) of the sample increases dramatically with lowering temperature
below 200 K from 0.1 T at 200 K to 0.9 T at 5 K. Magnetoabsorption was studied
with a LC resonance technique and we found a close correlation between the
shift in the resonance frequency due to applied magnetic field and the coercive
field measured using dc magnetization measurements. Our results obtained with
multiple techniques suggest that GaFeO3 is an interesting ferrimagnet with
potential applications in future multiferroic devices.
