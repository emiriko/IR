We study Andreev transport through double quantum dots connected in series
normal and superconducting (SC) leads, using the numerical renormalization
group. The ground state of this system shows a crossover between a local
Cooper-pairing singlet state and a Kondo singlet state, which is caused by the
competition between the Coulomb interaction and the SC proximity. We show that
the ground-state properties reflect this crossover especially for small values
of the inter-dot coupling $t$, while in the opposite case, for large $t$,
another singlet with an inter-dot character becomes dominant. We find that the
conductance for the local SC singlet state has a peak with the unitary-limit
value $4e^2/h$. In contrast, the Andreev reflection is suppressed in the Kondo
regime by the Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, the conductance has two
successive peaks in the transient region of the crossover. It is further
elucidated that the gate voltage gives a different variation into the
crossover. Specifically, as the energy level of the dot that is coupled to the
normal lead varies, the Kondo screening cloud is deformed to a long-range
singlet bond.
