In terms of a suitable variant of the EPR-Bohm example, we argue that the
quantum mechanically predicted and experimentally verified violation of a
Bell-type path-spin noncontextual realist inequality for an `intraparticle'
path-spin entanglement involving single neutrons can be used to infer a form of
nonlocality, distinct from Bell-type nonlocality, that is required for any
relevant hidden variable model to be compatible with the quantum mechanical
treatment of an EPR-Bohm-type `interparticle' entanglement.
