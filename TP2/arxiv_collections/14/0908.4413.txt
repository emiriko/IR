This paper presents the system called PATATRAS (PATent and Article Tracking,
Retrieval and AnalysiS) realized for the IP track of CLEF 2009. Our approach
presents three main characteristics: 1. The usage of multiple retrieval models
(KL, Okapi) and term index definitions (lemma, phrase, concept) for the three
languages considered in the present track (English, French, German) producing
ten different sets of ranked results. 2. The merging of the different results
based on multiple regression models using an additional validation set created
from the patent collection. 3. The exploitation of patent metadata and of the
citation structures for creating restricted initial working sets of patents and
for producing a final re-ranking regression model. As we exploit specific
metadata of the patent documents and the citation relations only at the
creation of initial working sets and during the final post ranking step, our
architecture remains generic and easy to extend.
