For linear and fully non-linear diffusion equations of Bellman-Isaacs type,
we introduce a class of approximation schemes based on differencing and
interpolation. As opposed to classical numerical methods, these schemes work
for general diffusions with coefficient matrices that may be non-diagonal
dominant and arbitrarily degenerate. In general such schemes have to have a
wide stencil. Besides providing a unifying framework for several known first
order accurate schemes, our class of schemes includes new first and higher
order versions. The methods are easy to implement and more efficient than some
other known schemes. We prove consistency and stability of the methods, and for
the monotone first order methods, we prove convergence in the general case and
robust error estimates in the convex case. The methods are extensively tested.
