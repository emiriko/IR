Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are widely used over the Internet as they
provide a simple and elegant way of interaction between the client and the
server. This paper proposes a solution for securing the remote procedure calls
(RPC) by tunneling it through HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure
Socket Layer). RPC over HTTP actually uses the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
protocol as a transport for the traffic. SSL mandates that the server
authenticates itself to the client using a digital certificate (and associated
private key). SSL is normally configured to encrypt traffic before transmitting
it between the server and client and vice versa.
