We present the design and development of a data stream system that captures
data uncertainty from data collection to query processing to final result
generation. Our system focuses on data that is naturally modeled as continuous
random variables. For such data, our system employs an approach grounded in
probability and statistical theory to capture data uncertainty and integrates
this approach into high-volume stream processing. The first component of our
system captures uncertainty of raw data streams from sensing devices. Since
such raw streams can be highly noisy and may not carry sufficient information
for query processing, our system employs probabilistic models of the data
generation process and stream-speed inference to transform raw data into a
desired format with an uncertainty metric. The second component captures
uncertainty as data propagates through query operators. To efficiently quantify
result uncertainty of a query operator, we explore a variety of techniques
based on probability and statistical theory to compute the result distribution
at stream speed. We are currently working with a group of scientists to
evaluate our system using traces collected from the domains of (and eventually
in the real systems for) hazardous weather monitoring and object tracking and
monitoring.
