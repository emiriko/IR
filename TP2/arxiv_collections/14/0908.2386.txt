We discuss the duality symmetry of the linear(BFKL) and the non-linear(BK)
high energy evolutions in the multicolor limit. We show that the usual color
dipole picture is dual to the forward reggeized gluon formulation. The
presented analysis is also generalized to the non-forward case where we suggest
an extended version of the duality symmetry. We give it a physical
interpretation as a symmetry under rotation of the Kernel in the transverse
space from s-channel(dipoles) to t-channel(reggeized gluons). The duality
symmetry is related to the integrability of the system. The duality symmetry of
the BK equation found in the present study can be regarded as an indirect
indication of its integrability.
