We discuss the electromagnetic properties of both a charged free particle,
and a charged particle bounded by an harmonic potential, within collapse
models. By choosing a particularly simple, yet physically relevant, collapse
model, and under only the dipole approximation, we are able to solve the
equation of motion exactly. In this way, both the finite time and large time
behavior can be analyzed accurately. We discovered new features, which did not
appear in previous works on the same subject. Since, so far, the spontaneous
photon emission process places the strongest upper bounds on the collapse
parameters, our results call for a further analysis of this process for those
atomic systems which can be employed in experimental tests of collapse models,
as well as of quantum mechanics.
