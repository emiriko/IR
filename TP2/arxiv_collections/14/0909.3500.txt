We present our response to Pierre Thibault's article, titled "Feasibility of
3D reconstruction from a single 2D diffraction measurement" [1], in which he
commented upon our recent ankylography paper [2]. While we appreciate
Thibault's efforts in promoting further reflection on our paper, we found
serious errors both in his understanding and analysis of ankylography: he
inaccurately presented the oversampling scheme in ankylography, incorrectly
described our reconstruction algorithm and our experiment, and formulated
arguments based upon a flawed and overly-restrictive theoretical analysis.
Therefore, we conclude that his main claims are either scientifically invalid
or a misrepresentation of our claims about ankylography. Below is our detailed
point-by-point response to his criticisms.
