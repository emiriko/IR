New Micromegas (Micro-mesh gaseous detectors) are being developed in view of
the future physics projects planned by the COMPASS collaboration at CERN.
Several major upgrades compared to present detectors are being studied:
detectors standing five times higher luminosity with hadron beams, detection of
beam particles (flux up to a few hundred of kHz/mm^2, 10 times larger than for
the present detectors) with pixelized read-out in the central part, light and
integrated electronics, and improved robustness. Studies were done with the
present detectors moved in the beam, and two first pixelized prototypes are
being tested with muon and hadron beams in real conditions at COMPASS. We
present here this new project and report on two series of tests, with old
detectors moved into the beam and with pixelized prototypes operated in real
data taking condition with both muon and hadron beams.
