The asymmetric Higgs sector of one $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ bidoublet
$(\phi_1^0,\phi_1^-;\phi_2^+,\phi_2^0)$ and one $SU(2)_R$ doublet [but no
$SU(2)_L$ doublet] is considered in a nonsupersymmetric left-right extension of
the standard model (SM) of particle interactions. The inverse seesaw mechanism
for neutrino mass is naturally implemented with the addition of fermion
singlets, allowing thereby the possibility of breaking $SU(2)_R$ at the TeV
scale. In the limit $v_2 = < \phi_2^0 > = 0$, the unavoidable flavor-changing
neutral Higgs couplings to quarks are studied and shown to be naturally
suppressed in $K-\bar{K}$ and $B-\bar{B}$ mixing, as well as in $b \to s
\gamma$. All particles are consistent with having masses less than 1 TeV, and
could be observable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
