We use a 380 ks XMM-Newton high-resolution RGS spectrum to look for narrow
spectral features from the nuclear environment of 1H0707-495. We do not find
any evidence of a line-of-sight ionized wind (warm absorber). We do, however,
detect broad emission lines, of width ~5000 km s^-1, consistent with O VIII
Ly-alpha, N VII Ly-alpha, C VI Ly-alpha and a Fe XIX/Fe XX/Ne IX He-alpha
blend. Intriguingly, these lines have both blueshifted and redshifted
components, whose velocity shifts are consistent with an origin in an accretion
disc at ~1600 R_g from the black hole. The features can be interpreted as the
narrow line cores of the disc reflection spectrum, thus providing independent
support for the discline interpretation of the X-ray spectrum of 1H0707-495. We
discuss the relevance of our findings for the `X-ray broad line region' in
other Seyferts, and for the origins of the optical broad line region itself.
