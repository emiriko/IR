We reexamine the renormalization group equations (RGEs) for the dimensionless
and dimensionful parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM), incorporating 1-loop thresholds. The inclusion of these thresholds
necessarily results in splitting between dimensionless couplings which are
equal at the tree level. Assuming that the SUSY-breaking mechanism does not
introduce new intergenerational couplings, we present the most general form for
high-scale, soft-SUSY-breaking (SSB) parameters. With this as our boundary
condition, we consider illustrative examples of numerical solutions to the
RGEs. In a supersymmetric grand unified theory with the scale of SUSY scalars
split from that of gauginos and higgsinos, we find that the gaugino mass
unification relation may be violated to the order of 10%. Further, we consider
the rate for the flavor violating decay of the lightest stop to charm plus
neutralino. We find that using the complete RGE solution as opposed to the
commonly used `single-step' integration of the RGEs can qualitatively change
the picture of event-topologies from top-squark pair production, or from gluino
production if gluino to stop plus top is the dominant gluino decay mode.
