Structural and energy stability results for a new class of decahedral
structural motif termed decmon (Montejano's decahedra) are presented. After
making proper truncations to the regular icosahedron, this structural motif
presents exposed <100> and <111> facets, whose energetic competition make the
structures very stable. It is also identified structural transitions as a
function of the cluster size, the appearing and competition of surface
reconstruction, and an outline for a path transformation from the Mackay
icosahedra (I_h) to the regular decahedra (D_h) symmetry structures, as well as
experimental evidence of the decmon decahedral motif in metallic nanoparticles.
