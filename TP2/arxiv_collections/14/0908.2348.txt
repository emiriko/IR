We demonstrate experimentally the storage and retrieval of weak coherent
light fields at telecommunication wavelengths in a solid. Light pulses at the
single photon level are stored for a time up to 600 ns in an Erbium-doped
Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal at 2.6 K and retrieved on demand. The memory is based on
photon echoes with controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening, which is
realized here for the first time at the single photon level. This is
implemented with an external field gradient using the linear Stark effect. This
experiment demonstrates the feasibility of a solid state quantum memory for
single photons at telecommunication wavelengths, which would represent an
important resource in quantum information science.
