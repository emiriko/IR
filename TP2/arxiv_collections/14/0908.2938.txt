A compact, quasi-4pi position sensitive silicon array, TIARA, designed to
study direct reactions induced by radioactive beams in inverse kinematics is
described here. The Transfer and Inelastic All-angle Reaction Array (TIARA)
consists of 8 resistive charge division detectors forming an octagonal barrel
around the target and a set of double-sided silicon-strip annular detectors
positioned at each end of the barrel. The detector was coupled to the -ray
array EXOGAM and the spectrometer VAMOS at the GANIL Laboratory to demonstrate
the potential of such an apparatus with radioactive beams. The 14N(d,p)15N
reaction, well known in direct kinematics, has been carried out in inverse
kinematics for that purpose. The observation of the 15N ground state and
excited states at 7.16 and 7.86 MeV is presented here as well as the comparison
of the measured proton angular distributions with DWBA calculations.
Transferred l-values are in very good agreement with both theoretical
calculations and previous experimental results obtained in direct kinematics.
