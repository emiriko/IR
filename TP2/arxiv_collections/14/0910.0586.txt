We extend the analysis of a very recent work (Phys. Rev. {\bf C 80}, 025210
(2009)) to study the dissociation phenomenon of 1p states of the charmonium and
bottomonium spectra ($\chi_c$ and $\chi_b$) in a hot QCD medium. This study
employed a medium modified heavy quark potential which is obtained by
incorporating both perturbative and non-perturbative medium effects encoded in
the dielectric function to the full Cornell potential. The medium modified
potential has a quite different form (a long range Coulomb tail in addition to
the usual Yukawa term) compared to the usual picture of Debye screening. We
further study the flavor dependence of their binding energies and dissociation
temperatures by employing the perturbative, non-perturbative, and the lattice
parametrized form of the Debye masses. These results are consistent with the
predictions of the current theoretical works.
