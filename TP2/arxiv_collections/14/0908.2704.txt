We report Hubble Space Telescope imaging, obtained 155 and 449 days after the
2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, together with ground-based
spectroscopic observations, obtained from the Observatorio Astron\'omico
Nacional en San Pedro M\'artir, Baja California, M\'exico and at the
Observatorio Astrof\'isico Guillermo Haro, at Cananea, Sonora, M\'exico. The
observations at the first epoch were used as inputs to model the geometry and
kinematic structure of the evolving RS Oph nebular remnant. We find that the
modeled remnant comprises two distinct co-aligned bipolar components; a
low-velocity, high-density innermost (hour glass) region and a more extended,
high-velocity (dumbbell) structure. This overall structure is in agreement with
that deduced from radio observations and optical interferometry at earlier
epochs. We find that the asymmetry observed in the west lobe is an instrumental
effect caused by the profile of the HST filter and hence demonstrate that this
lobe is approaching the observer. We then conclude that the system has an
inclination to the line of sight of 39$^{+1}_{-10}$ degrees. This is in
agreement with the inclination of the binary orbit and lends support to the
proposal that this morphology is due to the interaction of the outburst ejecta
with either an accretion disk around the central white dwarf and/or a
pre-existing red giant wind that is significantly denser in the equatorial
regions of the binary than at the poles. The second epoch HST observation was
also modeled. However, as no spectra were taken at this epoch, it is more
difficult to constrain any model. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that between the
two HST epochs the outer dumbbell structure seems to have expanded linearly.
