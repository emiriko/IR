We study the implications for generating the cosmological baryon asymmetry
through leptogenesis in the recent model of Fileviez Perez and Wise, which
provides a new mechanism for generating neutrino masses at one-loop by
introducing new color octet fermion and scalar fields. We find that there are
significant differences with respect to other models for leptogenesis: low
scale leptogenesis can occur naturally and the CP asymmetry can be large as
there is no upper bound arising from neutrino masses. The CP asymmetry is
insensitive to the phases in the neutrino mixing matrix. We investigate in
detail the minimal model that can simultaneously fit low scale neutrino
physics, the $\mu \to e \gamma$ bound and leptogenesis. The model can provide
outstanding collider signatures and the value of the CP-asymmetry can be more
constrained from lepton flavour violating processes than from neutrino physics.
