Biased (degree-dependent) percolation was recently shown to provide new
strategies for turning robust networks fragile and vice versa. Here we present
more detailed results for biased edge percolation on scale-free networks. We
assume a network in which the probability for an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$
to be retained is proportional to $(k_ik_j)^{-\alpha}$ with $k_i$ and $k_j$ the
degrees of the nodes. We discuss two methods of network reconstruction,
sequential and simultaneous, and investigate their properties by analytical and
numerical means. The system is examined away from the percolation transition,
where the size of the giant cluster is obtained, and close to the transition,
where nonuniversal critical exponents are extracted using the generating
functions method. The theory is found to agree quite well with simulations. By
introducing an extension of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn construction, we find that
biased percolation is well described by the $q\to 1$ limit of the $q$-state
Potts model with inhomogeneous couplings.
