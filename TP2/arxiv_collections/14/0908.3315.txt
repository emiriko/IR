We give a canonical representation for trim acyclic deterministic finite
automata (Adfa) with n states over an alphabet of k symbols. Using this normal
form, we present a backtracking algorithm for the exact generation of Adfas.
This algorithm is a non trivial adaptation of the algorithm for the exact
generation of minimal acyclic deterministic finite automata, presented by
Almeida et al.
