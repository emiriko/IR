The paper investigates the ellipsometric method of measuring the
magneto-optical parameter and optical constants in one experiment at affixed
angle of the light incidence in ferromagnetics. The influence of the
magnetization modulation on the change of ellipsometrical angles is shown. The
method is considered for the geometries of polar, meridional and equatorial
reflection Kerr effects. The formulae relating to the measured signals in
polarizer-subject-analyzer (PSA) circuit with four magneto-optical and optical
constants illustrated by the example of ferromagnetic Ni are given.
