A Levi nondegenerate real analytic hypersurface M of C^2 represented in local
coordinates (z, w) in C^2 by a complex defining equation of the form w = Theta
(z, \bar z, \bar w) which satisfies an appropriate reality condition, is
spherical if and only if its complex graphing function Theta satisfies an
explicitly written sixth-order polynomial complex partial differential
equation. In the rigid case (known before), this system simplifies
considerably, but in the general nonrigid case, its combinatorial complexity
shows well why the two fundamental curvature tensors constructed by Elie Cartan
in 1932 in his classification of hypersurfaces have, since then, never been
reached in parametric representation.
