Recent experiments by the CLEO III detector at CESR indicate that the $\jpsi$
spectrum produced in $\Upsilon$ decay is in conflict with Non-Relativistic QCD
(NRQCD) calculations. The measured $\jpsi$ momentum distribution is much softer
than predicted by the color-octet mechanisms. The expected peak at the
kinematic limit is not observed in the data. However it has recent been pointed
out that NRQCD calculations break down near the kinematic endpoint due to large
perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. In this paper we combine NRQCD
with soft collinear effective theory to study the color-octet contribution to
the $\Upsilon \to \jpsi + X$ decay in this region of phase space. We obtain a
spectrum that is significantly softened when including the correct degrees of
freedom in the endpoint region, giving better agreement with the data than
previous predictions.
