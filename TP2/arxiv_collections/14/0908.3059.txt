Considering the mechanism of dissipative slow-roll that has been used in warm
inflation scenario, we show that dissipation may alter usual cosmological
scenarios associated with SUSY-flat directions. We mainly consider SUSY-flat
directions that have strong interactions with non-flat directions and may cause
strong dissipation both in thermal and non-thermal backgrounds. An example is
the Affleck-Dine mechanism in which dissipation may create significant (both
qualitative and quantitative) discrepancies between the conventional scenario
and the dissipative one. We also discuss several mechanisms of generating
curvature perturbations in which the dissipative field, which is distinguished
from the inflaton field, can be used as the source of cosmological
perturbations. Considering the Morikawa-Sasaki dissipative coefficient, the
damping caused by the dissipation may be significant for many MSSM flat
directions even if the dissipation is far from thermal equilibrium.
