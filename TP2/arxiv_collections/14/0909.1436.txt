The energy and angular dependence of double differential cross sections
dsigma/dOmega dE were measured for p, d, t, 3,4He, 6,7Li, 7,9Be, and 10,11B
produced in collisions of 0.175 GeV protons with Ni target. The analysis of
measured dfferential cross sections allowed to extract total production cross
sections for ejectiles listed above. The shape of the spectra and angular
distributions indicate the presence of other nonequilibrium processes besides
the emission of nucleons from the intranuclear cascade, and besides the
evaporation of various particles from remnants of intranuclear cascade. These
nonequilibrium processes consist of coalescence of nucleons into light charged
particles during the intranuclear cascade, of the fireball emission which
contributes to the cross sections of protons and deuterons, and of the break-up
of the target nucleus which leads to the emission of intermediate mass
fragments. All such processes were found earlier at beam energies 1.2, 1.9, and
2.5 GeV for Ni as well as for Au targets, however, significant differences in
properties of these processes at high and low beam energy are observed in the
present study.
