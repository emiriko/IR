Charge transport through a short DNA oligomer (Dickerson dodecamer) in
presence of structural fluctuations is investigated using a hybrid
computational methodology based on a combination of quantum mechanical
electronic structure calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations
with a model Hamiltonian approach. Based on a fragment orbital description, the
DNA electronic structure can be coarse-grained in a very efficient way. The
influence of dynamical fluctuations arising either from the solvent
fluctuations or from base-pair vibrational modes can be taken into account in a
straightforward way through time series of the effective DNA electronic
parameters, evaluated at snapshots along the MD trajectory. We show that charge
transport can be promoted through the coupling to solvent fluctuations, which
gate the onsite energies along the DNA wire.
