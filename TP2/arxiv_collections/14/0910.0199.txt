Given a compact closed subset $M$ of a line segment in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we
construct a sequence of minimal surfaces $\Sigma_k$ embedded in a neighborhood
$C$ of the line segment that converge smoothly to a limit lamination of $C$
away from $M$. Moreover, the curvature of this sequence blows up precisely on
$M$, and the limit lamination has non-removable singularities precisely on the
boundary of $M$.
