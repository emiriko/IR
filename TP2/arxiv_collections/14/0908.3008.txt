We optimize two-mode, entangled, number states of light in the presence of
loss in order to maximize the extraction of the available phase information in
an interferometer. Our approach optimizes over the entire available input
Hilbert space with no constraints, other than fixed total initial photon
number. We optimize to maximize the Fisher information, which is equivalent to
minimizing the phase uncertainty. We find that in the limit of zero loss the
optimal state is the so-called N00N state, for small loss, the optimal state
gradually deviates from the N00N state, and in the limit of large loss the
optimal state converges to a generalized two-mode coherent state, with a finite
total number of photons. The results provide a general protocol for optimizing
the performance of a quantum optical interferometer in the presence of photon
loss, with applications to quantum imaging, metrology, sensing, and information
processing.
