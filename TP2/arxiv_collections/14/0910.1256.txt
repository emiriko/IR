Nernst effect is the transverse electric field due to a longitudinal thermal
gradient in presence of magnetic field. Its magnitude was recently studied up
to 33 T in a bismuth single crystal with a magnetic field oriented along the
trigonal axis . In addition to quantum oscillations of the Nernst response, a
rich structure with several additional peaks was also detected when the
magnetic field exceeded the quantum limit, which is of the order of 10 T in
this configuration. The origin of these high-field Nernst anomalies is a
subject of ongoing research. Very recently, Seradjeh, Wu, and Phillips have
suggested that a surface state can give rise to these anomalies. This proposal
does not resist a critical examination.
