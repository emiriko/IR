In an attempt to re-establish space-time as an essential frame for
formulating quantum gravity - rather than an "emergent" one -, we find that
exact invariance under scale transformations is an essential new ingredient for
such a theory. Use is made of the principle of "black hole complementarity",
the notion that observers entering a black hole describe its dynamics in a way
that appears to be fundamentally different from the description by an outside
observer. These differences can be boiled down to conformal transformations. If
we add these to our set of symmetry transformations, black holes, space-time
singularities, and horizons disappear, while causality and locality may survive
as important principles for quantum gravity.
