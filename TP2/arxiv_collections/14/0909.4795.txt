The infrared response of the organic conductor (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$ and the Mott
insulator (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$ are investigated as a function of temperature and
pressure and for the polarization parallel and perpendicular to the molecular
stacks. By applying external pressure on (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, the Mott gap
rapidly diminishes until the deconfinement transition occurs when the gap
energy is approximately twice the interchain transfer integral. In its
deconfined state (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$ exhibits a crossover from a
quasi-one-dimensional to a higher-dimensional metal upon reducing the
temperature. For (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$ this dimensional crossover is observed
either with increase in external pressure or with decrease in temperature. We
quantitatively determine the dimensional crossover line in the
pressure-temperature diagram based on the degree of coherence in the optical
response perpendicular to the molecular stacks.
