We have investigated some of the properties of dense sub-nuclear matter at
the crustal region (both the outer crust and the inner crust region) of a
magnetar. The relativistic version of Thomas-Fermi (TF) model is used in
presence of strong quantizing magnetic field for the outer crust matter. The
compressed matter in the outer crust, which is a crystal of metallic iron, is
replaced by a regular array of spherically symmetric Wigner-Seitz (WS) cells.
In the inner crust region, a mixture of iron and heavier neutron rich nuclei
along with electrons and free neutrons has been considered. Conventional
Harrison-Wheeler (HW) and Bethe-Baym-Pethick (BBP) equation of states are used
for the nuclear mass formula. A lot of significant changes in the
characteristic properties of dense crustal matter, both at the outer crust and
the inner crust, have been observed.
