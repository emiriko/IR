Stellar magnetosphere and accretion disk interact, and a result should be
outflow launched from the innermost vicinity of a protostellar object. We
simulated physical conditions in this region by resistive MHD simulations.
Outflows resembling the observed ones do not happen in the closest vicinity,
except for quasi-stationary funnel flows onto the star, but could occur at few
tens of stellar radii above the star. Numerical simulations we performed using
our resistive version of ZEUS-3D code, ZEUS347.
