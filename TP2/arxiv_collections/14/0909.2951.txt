Measurements of inclusive hadron suppression and di-hadron azimuthal
correlations have provided important insights into jet quenching in hot QCD
matter. However, they do not provide access to the energy of the hard
scattering and are limited in their sensitivity since they can be affected by
biases toward hard fragmentation and small energy loss.
  Full jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions enables a complete study of
the modification of jet structure due to energy loss, but is challenging due to
the high multiplicity environment. Study of jet production and properties in
d+Au and p+p collisions provides important baseline measurement for jet studies
in heavy-ion collisions.
  We report measurements of fully reconstructed jets in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200 \mathrm{GeV}$ from the STAR
experiment at RHIC. Measurement of initial state nuclear effects in d+Au
collisions utilizing di-jet azimuthal correlations is presented together with
similar measurement in p+p collisions. Inclusive jet $\pt$ spectra and
fragmentation functions in p+p and central Au+Au collisions are reported, with
subsequent studies of jet nuclear modification factor, jet energy profile and
modifications in the fragmentation function due to jet quenching.
