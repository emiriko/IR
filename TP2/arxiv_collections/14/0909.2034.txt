We propose a new dark matter candidate, quirky dark matter, that is a scalar
baryonic bound state of a new non-Abelian force that becomes strong below the
electroweak scale. The bound state is made of chiral quirks: new fermions that
transform under both the new strong force as well as in a chiral representation
of the electroweak group, acquiring mass from the Higgs mechanism. Electric
charge neutrality of the lightest baryon requires approximately degenerate
quirk masses which also causes the charge radius of the bound state to be
negligible. The abundance is determined by an asymmetry that is linked to the
baryon and lepton numbers of the universe through electroweak sphalerons. Dark
matter elastic scattering with nuclei proceeds through Higgs exchange as well
as an electromagnetic polarizability operator which is just now being tested in
direct detection experiments. A novel method to search for quirky dark matter
is to look for a gamma-ray dark line spectroscopic feature in galaxy clusters
that result from the quirky Lyman-alpha or quirky hyperfine transitions.
Colliders are expected to dominantly produce quirky mesons, not quirky baryons,
consequently large missing energy is not the primary collider signal of the
physics associated with quirky dark matter.
