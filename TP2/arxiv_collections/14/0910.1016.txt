We are carrying out a spectroscopic monitoring of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars,
in order to detect binary systems. The sample consists of approximately 50
stars of the Nitrogen sequence (WN) and fainter than V = 13. The observations
are made from the 4-m telescope at CTIO, Chile. In the following, we present
the first results of the 2007-2008 campaign.
