The dynamics of a system, consisting of a particle initially in a Gaussian
state interacting with a field mode, under the action of repeated measurements
performed on the particle, is examined. It is shown that regardless of its
initial state the field is distilled into a squeezed state. The dependence on
the physical parameters of the dynamics is investigated.
