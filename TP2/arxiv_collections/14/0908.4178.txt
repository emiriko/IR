We consider the Proca field with dynamical term given by the exterior
derivative with respect to the most general connection; the most general Proca
field equations are given, and a discussion about the propagation and the
geometrical properties are presented: it is shown that this generalization is
inconsistent. So the standard theory is already the most general Proca Theory
possible.
