We develop a framework to study the exclusive two-body decays of bottomonium
into two charmed mesons and apply it to study the decays of the C-even
bottomonia. Using a sequence of effective field theories, we take advantage of
the separation between the scales contributing to the decay processes, 2m_b >>
m_c >> \Lambda_{QCD}. We prove that, at leading order in the EFT power
counting, the decay rate factorizes into the convolution of two perturbative
matching coefficients and three non-perturbative matrix elements, one for each
hadron. We calculate the relations between the decay rate and non-perturbative
bottomonium and D-meson matrix elements at leading order, with next-to-leading
log resummation. The phenomenological implications of these relations are
discussed.
