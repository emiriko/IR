The imbalance of dijets produced in hadronic collisions has been used to
extract the average transverse momentum of partons inside the hadrons. In this
paper we discuss new contributions to the dijet imbalance that could complicate
or even hamper this extraction. They are due to polarization of initial state
partons inside unpolarized hadrons that can arise in the presence of nonzero
parton transverse momentum. Transversely polarized quarks and linearly
polarized gluons produce specific azimuthal dependences of the two jets that in
principle are not suppressed. Their effects cannot be isolated just by looking
at the angular deviation from the back-to-back situation, rather they enter jet
broadening observables. In this way they directly affect the extraction of the
average transverse momentum of unpolarized partons that is thought to be
extracted. We discuss appropriately weighted cross sections to isolate the
additional contributions.
