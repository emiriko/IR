We report the first detection of the Zeeman effect in the 36 GHz Class I
methanol maser line. The observations were carried out with 13 antennas of the
EVLA toward the high mass star forming region M8E. Based on our adopted Zeeman
splitting factor of $z = 1.7 Hz/mG, we detect a line of sight magnetic field of
-31.3 +/- 3.5 mG and 20.2 +/- 3.5 mG to the northwest and southeast of the
maser line peak respectively. This change in sign over a 1300 AU size scale may
indicate that the masers are tracing two regions with different fields, or that
the same field curves across the regions where the masers are being excited.
The detected fields are not significantly different from the magnetic fields
detected in the 6.7 GHz Class II methanol maser line, indicating that methanol
masers may trace the large scale magnetic field, or that the magnetic field
remains unchanged during the early evolution of star forming regions. Given
what is known about the densities at which 36 GHz methanol masers are excited,
we find that the magnetic field is dynamically significant in the star forming
region.
