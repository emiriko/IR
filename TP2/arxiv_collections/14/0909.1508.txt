The actual (classical) Brain-Computer Interface attempts to use brain signals
to drive suitable actuators performing the actions corresponding to subject's
intention. However this goal is not fully reached, and when BCI works, it does
only in particular situations. The reason of this unsatisfactory result is that
intention cannot be conceived simply as a set of classical input-output
relationships. It is therefore necessary to resort to quantum theory, allowing
the occurrence of stable coherence phenomena, in turn underlying high-level
mental processes such as intentions and strategies. More precisely, within the
context of a dissipative Quantum Field Theory of brain operation it is possible
to introduce generalized coherent states associated, within the framework of
logic, to the assertions of a quantum metalanguage. The latter controls the
quantum-mechanical computing corresponding to standard mental operation. It
thus become possible to conceive a Quantum Cyborg in which a human mind
controls, through a quantum metalanguage, the operation of an artificial
quantum computer.
