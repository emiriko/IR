Implications of the recently discovered systematic abundance difference
between the Sun and two collections of `solar twins' are discussed. The
differences can be understood as an imprint on the abundances of the solar
convection zone caused by the lock-up of heavy elements in the planets. Such a
scenario also leads naturally to possible solutions of two other abundance
peculiarities; 1) the discrepancy between photospheric abundances derived from
accurate 3-D models of the solar photosphere and the abundance of heavy
elements in the solar interior deduced from helioseismology, and 2) the
abundance pattern of Jupiter, which can either--with great difficulty--be
interpreted as a general and similar overabundance of both common elements such
as carbon, nitrogen and sulphur and rare inert gases such as argon, krypton and
xenon, or--much more simply--as an under-abundance of hydrogen.
