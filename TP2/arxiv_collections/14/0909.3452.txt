Temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient, R_H_, has been investigated
in charge-spin stripe-ordered La-214 high-T_c_ superconductors. Using the
simplest stripe-ordered system of La_2-x_Ba_x_CuO_4_, it has been clarified
that both the behavior of R_H_ and its sign exhibit significant dependences on
the hole concentration. That is, R_H_ is zero in the ground state of the
charge-spin stripe order at x=1/8, while it is negative in the less-stabilized
state of the charge stripe for x<1/8. These are interpreted as owing to the
delicate balance of the contributions of the hole-like Fermi surface and the
possible electron pocket arising from the formation of the charge-spin stripe
order.
