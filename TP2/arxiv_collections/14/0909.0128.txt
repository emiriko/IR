In a previous paper, we have proposed the minimal B-L extended standard model
as a phenomenologically viable model that realizes the Coleman-Weinberg-type
breaking of the electroweak symmetry. Assuming the classical conformal
invariance and stability up to the Planck scale, we will show in this paper
that the model naturally predicts TeV scale B-L breaking as well as a light
standard-model singlet Higgs boson and light right-handed neutrinos around the
same energy scale. We also study phenomenology and detectability of the model
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC).
