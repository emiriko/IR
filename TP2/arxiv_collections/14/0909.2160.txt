The large data sample being recorded with the Belle detector at the Y(5S)
energy provides a unique opportunity to study the poorly-known Bs0 meson. Three
analyses, using a sample of 23.6 /fb, are presented. We report the first
observation of the three dominant exclusive Bs0 decays, Bs0 -> Ds*- pi+, Bs0 ->
Ds- rho+ and Bs0 -> Ds*- rho+, the first observation of the CP-eigenstate decay
Bs0 -> J/psi eta, and the results from a study of the charmless Bs0 -> K+K-,
Bs0 -> K+pi-, Bs0 -> pi+pi- and Bs0 -> K0 K0bar decays.
