We present the field and temperature behavior of the narrow Electron Spin
Resonance (ESR) response in YbRh2Si2 well below the single ion Kondo
temperature. The ESR g factor reflects a Kondo-like field and temperature
evolution of the Yb3+ magnetism. Measurements towards low temperatures (>0.5K)
have shown distinct crossover anomalies of the ESR parameters upon approaching
the regime of a well defined heavy Fermi liquid. Comparison with the field
dependence of specific heat and electrical resistivity reveal that the ESR
parameters can be related to quasiparticle mass and cross section and, hence,
contain inherent heavy electron properties.
