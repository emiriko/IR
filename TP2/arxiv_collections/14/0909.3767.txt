Time is absolute in standard quantum theory and dynamical in general
relativity. The combination of both theories into a theory of quantum gravity
leads therefore to a "problem of time". In my essay I shall investigate those
consequences for the concept of time that may be drawn without a detailed
knowledge of quantum gravity. The only assumptions are the experimentally
supported universality of the linear structure of quantum theory and the
recovery of general relativity in the classical limit. Among the consequences
are the fundamental timelessness of quantum gravity, the approximate nature of
a semiclassical time, and the correlation of entropy with the size of the
Universe.
