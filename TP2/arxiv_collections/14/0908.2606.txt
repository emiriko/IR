The last half-century has seen dramatic developments in gamma-ray telescopes,
from their initial conception and development through to their blossoming into
full maturity as a potent research tool in astronomy. Gamma-ray telescopes are
leading research in diverse areas such as gamma-ray bursts, blazars, Galactic
transients, and the Galactic distribution of aluminum-26.
