The threshold degree of a Boolean function f:{0,1}^n->{-1,+1} is the least
degree of a real polynomial p such that f(x)=sgn p(x). We construct two
halfspaces on {0,1}^n whose intersection has threshold degree Theta(sqrt n), an
exponential improvement on previous lower bounds. This solves an open problem
due to Klivans (2002) and rules out the use of perceptron-based techniques for
PAC learning the intersection of two halfspaces, a central unresolved challenge
in computational learning. We also prove that the intersection of two majority
functions has threshold degree Omega(log n), which is tight and settles a
conjecture of O'Donnell and Servedio (2003).
  Our proof consists of two parts. First, we show that for any nonconstant
Boolean functions f and g, the intersection f(x)^g(y) has threshold degree O(d)
if and only if ||f-F||_infty + ||g-G||_infty < 1 for some rational functions F,
G of degree O(d). Second, we settle the least degree required for approximating
a halfspace and a majority function to any given accuracy by rational
functions.
  Our technique further allows us to make progress on Aaronson's challenge
(2008) and contribute strong direct product theorems for polynomial
representations of composed Boolean functions of the form F(f_1,...,f_n). In
particular, we give an improved lower bound on the approximate degree of the
AND-OR tree.
