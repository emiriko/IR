Scientists continue to wrestle with the enigma of time. Is time a dynamic or
a fundamental property of spacetime? Why does it have an arrow pointing from
past to future? Why are physical laws time-symmetric in a universe with broken
time-reversal symmetry? These questions remain a mystery. The hope has been
that an understanding of the selection of the initial state for our universe
would solve such puzzles, especially that of time's arrow.
  In this article, I discuss how the birth of the universe from the multiverse
helps to unravel the nature of time and the reasons behind the time-reversal
symmetry of our physical laws. I make the distinction between a local emerging
arrow of time in the nucleating universe and the fundamental time with no arrow
in the multiverse. The very event of nucleation of the universe from the
multiverse breaks time-reversal symmetry, inducing a locally emergent arrow.
But, the laws of physics imprinted on this bubble are not processed at birth.
Time-reversal symmetry of laws in our universe is inherited from its birth in
the multiverse, since these laws originate from the arrowless multiversal time.
