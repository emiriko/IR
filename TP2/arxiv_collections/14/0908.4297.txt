Using the exact propagators in a constant magnetic field, the neutrino
self-energy has been calculated to all orders in the field strength B within
the minimal extension of the Weinberg-Salam model with massive Dirac neutrinos.
A simple and very accurate formula for the self-energy is obtained, that is
valid for 0 < B << m^2_W/e and for and for neutrino transverse momentum to the
magnetic field p_{\perp} << m_W. I discuss the implications of this finding to
the dispersion of massless neutrinos in vacuum and in a charge-symmetric
medium, and to the magnetic field induced resonance transitions of massive
neutrinos inside supernovae and magnetars, and calculate the neutrino magnetic
moment.
