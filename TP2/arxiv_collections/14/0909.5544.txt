We describe the generalization of Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT) for QCD
observables, initiated by Radyushkin, Krasnikov, Pivovarov, Shirkov and
Solovtsov, to fractional powers of coupling -- Fractional APT (FAPT). The basic
aspects of FAPT is shortly summarized. We describe how to treat heavy-quark
thresholds in FAPT and then show how to resum perturbative series in both the
one-loop APT and FAPT. As an application we consider FAPT description of the
Higgs boson decay $H^0\to b\bar{b}$. The main conclusion is: To achieve an
accuracy of the order of 1% it is enough to take into account up to the third
correction.
