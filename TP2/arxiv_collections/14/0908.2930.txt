We reproduce the sub-exponential decoherence of one-dimensional
quasicondensates observed in recent experiments. Counter-intuitively, the
quasicondensates may decohere even when stongly coupled, if the temperature is
large enough or the peak density is low enough to allow significant density
fluctuations. We also propose an experiment to investigate the growth of
coherence between two initially incoherent quasicondensates. We predict that
the coherence will rise on a much slower timescale, and the final coherence
again depends strongly on the density fluctuations.
