I report on the development of new code to support the Nasmyth and E-W
antenna mount types in AIPS which will allow polarisation analysis of
observations made using these uncommon antenna configurations. These mount
types may become more widely spread as they have several advantages,
particularly for geodetic observatories. Multi-band observations, with multiple
receivers, can only be fitted into telescopes with Nasmyth feeds. These are the
requirements for the new generation of geodetic arrays as discussed in IVS2010.
Further more the next generation of antennae will also be required to have very
high slew rates, and these can be achieved with the E-W mount.
  The mount type affects the differential phase between the left and the right
hand circular polarisations (LHC and RHC) for different points on the sky. The
target antennae for the project was the Yebes 40m telescope, but as that was
still under construction the data used as a demonstration was from the Pico
Veleta antenna as part of the Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA). For the E-W
mount type there are suitable data from the Australian LBA array. I demonstrate
the effectiveness of the changes made and that the Nasmyth and E-W corrections
can be applied.
