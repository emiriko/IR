Recent experiments by Potok et al. have demonstrated a remarkable tunability
between a single-channel Fermi liquid fixed point and a two-channel non-Fermi
liquid fixed point. Motivated by this we study the nonequilibrium dynamics due
to a sudden quench of the parameters of a Hamiltonian from a single-channel to
a two-channel anisotropic Kondo system. We find a distinct difference between
the long time behavior of local quantities related to the impurity spin as
compared to that of bulk quantities related to the total (conduction electrons
+ impurity) spin of the system. In particular, the local impurity spin and the
local spin susceptibility are found to equilibrate, but in a very slow
power-law fashion which is peculiar to the non-Fermi liquid properties of the
Hamiltonian. In contrast, we find a lack of equilibration in the two particle
expectation values related to the total spin of the system.
