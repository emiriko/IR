We present a precise comparison of the results of the dipole models with the
newest data from HERA on the diffractive open charm production. We found good
agreement with the data on the diffractive open charm production both for the
the gluon distributions from the considered dipole models and the DGLAP fits to
HERA data from our earlier analysis for diffractive parton distributions with
higher twist. We also show that exclusive diffractive charm production can
practically be neglected
