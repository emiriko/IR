Let A_r be the minimal resolution of the cyclic quotient singularity
C^2/Z_{r+1}. We study the equivariant quantum cohomology ring of the n-fold
symmetric product stack [Sym^n(A_r)] of A_r. We calculate the operators of
quantum multiplication by divisor classes. Under the assumption of the
nonderogatory conjecture, these operators completely determine the ring
structure, which provides an affirmative answer to the Crepant Resolution
Conjecture on [Sym^n(A_r)] and Hilb^n(A_r). More strikingly, this allows us to
complete a tetrahedron of equivalences relating the Gromov-Witten theories of
[Sym^n(A_r)]/Hilb^n(A_r) and the relative Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas
theories of A_r x P^1.
