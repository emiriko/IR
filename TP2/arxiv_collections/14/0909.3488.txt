We consider the resummation of soft and Coulomb gluons for pair-production
processes of heavy coloured particles at hadron colliders, and discuss recent
results on the construction of a basis in colour space that diagonalizes the
soft function to all orders in perturbation theory and the determination of the
two-loop soft anomalous dimension needed for NNLL resummations. We present
results for the combined NLL resummation of soft gluon and Coulomb-gluon
effects for squark-antisquark production at the LHC.
