A 20-fold increase over the single path optical absorption is demonstrated
with a low loss medium placed in a resonant cavity. This has been applied to
laser cooling of Yb:ZBLAN glass resulting in 90% absorption of the incident
pump light. A coupled-cavity scheme to achieve active optical impedance
matching is analyzed.
