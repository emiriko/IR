A theoretical study of the structural and electronic properties of the
chloride ion and water molecules in the first hydration shell is presented. The
calculations are performed on an ensemble of configurations obtained from
molecular dynamics simulations of a single chloride ion in bulk water. The
simulations utilize the polarizable AMOEBA force field for trajectory
generation, and MP2-level calculations are performed to examine the electronic
structure properties of the ions and surrounding waters in the external field
of more distant waters. The ChelpG method is employed to explore the effective
charges and dipoles on the chloride ions and first-shell waters. The Quantum
Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) is further utilized to examine charge
transfer from the anion to surrounding water molecules.
  From the QTAIM analysis, 0.2 elementary charges are transferred from the ion
to the first-shell water molecules. The default AMOEBA model overestimates the
average dipole moment magnitude of the ion compared with the estimated quantum
mechanical value. The average magnitude of the dipole moment of the water
molecules in the first shell treated at the MP2 level, with the more distant
waters handled with an AMOEBA effective charge model, is 2.67 D. This value is
close to the AMOEBA result for first-shell waters (2.72 D) and is slightly
reduced from the bulk AMOEBA value (2.78 D). The magnitude of the dipole moment
of the water molecules in the first solvation shell is most strongly affected
by the local water-water interactions and hydrogen bonds with the second
solvation shell, rather than by interactions with the ion.
