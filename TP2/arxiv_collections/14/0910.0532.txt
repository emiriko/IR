The presence of electric currents in the atmospheres of magnetic chemically
peculiar (mCP) stars could bring important theoretical constrains about the
nature and evolution of magnetic field in these stars. The Lorentz force, which
results from the interaction between the magnetic field and the induced
currents, modifies the atmospheric structure and induces characteristic
rotational variability of pressure-sensitive spectroscopic features, that can
be analysed using phase-resolved spectroscopic observations. In this work we
continue the presentation of results of the magnetic pressure studies in mCP
stars focusing on the high-resolution spectroscopic observations of Bp star
56Ari. We have detected a significant variability of the Halpha, Hbeta, and
Hgamma spectral lines during full rotation cycle of the star. Then these
observations are interpreted in the framework of the model atmosphere analysis,
which accounts for the Lorentz force effects. We used the LLmodels stellar
model atmosphere code for the calculation of the magnetic pressure effects in
the atmosphere of 56Ari taking into account realistic chemistry of the star and
accurate computations of the microscopic plasma properties. The Synth3 code was
employed to simulate phase-resolved variability of Balmer lines. We demonstrate
that the model with the outward-directed Lorentz force in the dipole+quadrupole
configuration is likely to reproduce the observed hydrogen lines variation.
These results present strong evidences for the presence of non-zero global
electric currents in the atmosphere of this early-type magnetic star.
