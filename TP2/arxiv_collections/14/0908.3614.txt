We use detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to study the dynamics of blood
pressure oscillations and its feedback control in rats by analyzing systolic
pressure time series before and after a surgical procedure that interrupts its
control loop. We found, for each situation, a crossover between two scaling
regions characterized by exponents that reflect the nature of the feedback
control and its range of operation. In addition, we found evidences of
adaptation in the dynamics of blood pressure regulation a few days after
surgical disruption of its main feedback circuit. Based on the paradigm of
antagonistic, bipartite (vagal and sympathetic) action of the central nerve
system, we propose a simple model for pressure homeostasis as the balance
between two nonlinear opposing forces, successfully reproducing the crossover
observed in the DFA of actual pressure signals.
