On the graphene moire on Ir(111) a variety of highly perfect cluster
superlattices can be grown as shown is for Ir, Pt, W, and Re. Even materials
that do not form cluster superlattices upon room temperature deposition may be
grown into such by low temperature deposition or the application of cluster
seeding through Ir as shown for Au, AuIr, FeIr. Criteria for the suitability of
a material to form a superlattice are given and largely confirmed. It is proven
that at least Pt and Ir even form epitaxial cluster superlattices. The
temperature stability of the cluster superlattices is investigated and
understood on the basis of positional fluctuations of the clusters around their
sites of minimum potential energy. The binding sites of Ir, Pt, W and Re
cluster superlattices are determined and the ability to cover samples
macroscopically with a variety of superlattices is demonstrated.
