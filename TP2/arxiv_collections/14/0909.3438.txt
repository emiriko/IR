We report on a model of polymer nanocomposites with fibrous fillers which
explicitly considers the microscopic filler features and replicates the
composites as random distributions of particles interconnected via electron
tunneling. By exploiting the critical path method, we are able to obtain simple
formulas, applicable to most nanotube and nanofiber composites, which allow to
infer the overall composite conductivity starting from few parameters like
filler volume fraction, size, and aspect-ratio. The validity of our formulation
is assessed by reinterpreting existing experimental results and by extracting
the characteristic tunneling length, which is mostly found within its expected
value range. These results can be used practically to tailor the electrical
properties of nanocomposites.
