Constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment and lepton flavor
violating processes are translated into lower bounds on v_Delta*m_H++ in the
Higgs Triplet Model by considering correlations through the neutrino mass
matrix. The discrepancy of the sign of the contribution to the muon anomalous
magnetic dipole moment between the measurement and the prediction in the model
is clarified. It is shown that mu to e gamma, tau decays (especially, tau to mu
e e), and the muonium conversion can give a more stringent bound on
v_Delta*m_H++ than the bound from mu to eee which is expected naively to give
the most stringent one.
