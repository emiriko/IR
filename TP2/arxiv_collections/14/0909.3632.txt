Binary star systems containing a neutron star or a black hole with an
evolved, massive star are dynamically perturbed when the latter undergoes a
supernova explosion. It is possible that the natal kick received by the
newly-formed neutron star in the supernova may place the stellar remnants into
a bound, highly eccentric orbit. In this case, the two compact objects can
tidally interact and spiral into one another on a short timescale. The
interaction with an accretion disc of supernova debris is also considered. We
quantify the likelihood of such events and show that they would be expected to
produce a high-energy transient, possibly a short gamma-ray burst, typically
within a few days of the supernova.
