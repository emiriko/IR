This thesis examines some of the more fundamental requirements of a
successful quantum computation, namely the ability to transmit quantum
information with maximum efficiency, and the creation of entanglement. I focus
specifically on neutron entanglement, showing that the spins of two or more
distinct neutrons can be measurably entangled by forward-scattering from an
isotropic medium. The interpretation of `time' in scattering experiments is
also discussed. I present a simple treatment based on the Heisenberg S-matrix,
from which it emerges that in certain situations the quantum-mechanical time
parameter appearing in the effective time-evolution operator for the spin
system has an intuitive physical interpretation. The final part of the thesis
deals with quantum information transfer in arrays of permanently coupled
dipolar systems. It is shown that spin chains with dipolar couplings offer high
fidelity long-distance state transmission, but transfer times in unmodulated
chains are unfeasibly long. Possible optimization methods are discussed,
concluding with a review of recent achievements in this field.
