A qualitatively different manifestation of the Rayleigh instability is
demonstrated, where, instead of the usual extended undulations and breakup of
the liquid into many droplets, the instability is localized, leading to an
isolated narrowing of the liquid filament. The localized instability, caused by
a nonuniform curvature of the liquid domain, plays a key role in the
evaporation of thin liquid films off solid surfaces.
