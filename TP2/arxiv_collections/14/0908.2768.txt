A new gauge fixing that imposes the U(1) real and quaternion real condition
on the correlator of domain wall fermion on the left wall and right wall is
proposed. The method is applied to the calculation of the mass function, the
QCD effective coupling and the charge form factor of the proton. By assuming
topological charge change $|Q|=1$, the charge form factor of the proton is
approximately fitted by the dipole form factor.
  The difference of the Kugo-Ojima color confinement parameter in quenched
simulation and in unquenched simulation is expected to be due to an anomaly
caused by the vertex of two fermion zero modes and the Bose ghost/gluon.
