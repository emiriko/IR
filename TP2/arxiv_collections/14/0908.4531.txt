It is known from work by H. Abels and P. Abramenko that for a classical
Fq-group G of rank n the arithemetic lattice G(Fq[t]) of Fq[t]-rational points
is of type Fn-1 provided that q is large enough. We show that the statement is
true without any assumption on q and for any isotropic, absolutely almost
simple group G defined over Fq.
