We present a composite K-band luminosity function for 10 clusters at low
redshift, where member galaxies are identified from an existing spectroscopic
survey (the 2dF galaxy redshift survey). Our kinematically selected K-band
luminosity function is well fitted by a Schechter function with $M^*_K=-24.50 +
5\log h$ and $\alpha=-0.98$ over $-27 < <M_K -5\log h < -22$. This is very
similar to the 2dF field value and suggests that the integrated mass accretion
history of galaxies does not vary strongly with environment
