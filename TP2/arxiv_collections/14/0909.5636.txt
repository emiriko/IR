The issue of predicting solar flares is one of the most fundamental in
physics, addressing issues of plasma physics, high-energy physics, and
modelling of complex systems. It also poses societal consequences, with our
ever-increasing need for accurate space weather forecasts. Solar flares arise
naturally as a competition between an input (flux emergence and rearrangement)
in the photosphere and an output (electrical current build up and resistive
dissipation) in the corona. Although initially localised, this redistribution
affects neighbouring regions and an avalanche occurs resulting in large scale
eruptions of plasma, particles, and magnetic field. As flares are powered from
the stressed field rooted in the photosphere, a study of the photospheric
magnetic complexity can be used to both predict activity and understand the
physics of the magnetic field. The magnetic energy spectrum and multifractal
spectrum are highlighted as two possible approaches to this.
