The Hall effect is investigated for eight superconducting Fe(Se_0.5_Te_0.5_)
thin films grown on MgO and LaSrAlO_4_ substrates with different transition
temperatures (T_c_). The normal Hall coefficients (R_H_) have positive values
with magnitude of 1 - 1.5 x 10^-3^ cm^3^/C at room temperature for the all
samples. With decreasing temperature, we find two characteristic types of
behavior in R_H_(T) depending on T_c_. For thin films with lower T_c_
(typically T_c_ < 5 K), R_H_ start decreasing approximately below T = 250 K
toward a negative side, some of which shows sign reversal at T = 50 - 60 K, but
turns positive toward T = 0 K. On the other hand for the films with higher T_c_
(typically T_c_ > 9 K), R_ H_ leaves almost unchanged down to T = 100 K, and
then starts decreasing toward a negative side. Around the temperatures when
R_H_ changes its sign from positive to negative, obvious nonlinearity is
observed in the field-dependence of Hall resistance as to keep the low-field
R_H_ positive while the high-field R_H_ negative. Thus the electronic state
just above T_c_ is characterized by n_e_ (electron density) > n_h_ (hole
density) with keeping \mu_e_ < \mu_h_. These results suggest the dominance of
electron density to the hole density is an essential factor for the occurence
of superconductivity in Fe-chalcogenide superconductors.
