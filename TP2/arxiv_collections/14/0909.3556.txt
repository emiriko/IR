Here we report the magnetic properties of the layered cobalt oxide system,
LixCoO2, in the whole range of Li composition, 0 <= x <= 1. Based on
dc-magnetic susceptibility data, combined with results of 59Co-NMR/NQR
observations, the electronic phase diagram of LixCoO2 has been established. As
in the related material NaxCoO2, a magnetic critical point is found to exist
between x = 0.35 and 0.40, which separates a Pauli-paramagnetic and a
Curie-Weiss metals. In the Pauli-paramagnetic regime (x <= 0.35), the
antiferromagnetic spin correlations systematically increase with decreasing x.
Nevertheless, CoO2, the x = 0 end member is a non-correlated metal in the whole
temperature range studied. In the Curie-Weiss regime (x >= 0.40), on the other
hand, various phase transitions are observed. For x = 0.40, a susceptibility
hump is seen at 30 K, suggesting the onset of static AF order. A magnetic jump,
which is likely to be triggered by charge ordering, is clearly observed at Tt =
175 K in samples with x = 0.50 (= 1/2) and 0.67 (= 2/3), while only a tiny kink
appears at T = 210 K in the sample with an intermediate Li composition, x =
0.60. Thus, the phase diagram of the LixCoO2 system is complex, and the
electronic properties are sensitively influenced by the Li content (x).
