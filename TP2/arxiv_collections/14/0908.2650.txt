Earliest 2007 UHECR anisotropy findings and ICRC AUGER updated maps and
clustering confirms our understanding of CenA as the main nearby UHECR source.
Those events are mostly lightest nuclei, as He. The events are spread by
galactic fields. We argue that the main UHECR event bending, along CenA, is
spreading vertically (respect to horizontal spiral galactic fields) by random
(and a final coherent) Lorentz force. The He-nuclei dominance is also well
probed by detailed AUGER composition data. The Lightest nuclei are still
compatible with most recent Hires composition results. Such lightest UHECR
nuclei are fragile and opaque even to nearest Universe. Offering a very narrow
local (ten Mpc) view. This opacity explain the otherwise puzzling Virgo
persistent absence. The He photo-disruption in flight should lead to halves
energy tail clustering (along the same CenA group), events made by deuterium,
He3 and protons (or unstable neutrons). This tail anisotropy should be revaled.
The consequent foreseen UHE neutrino by UHECR Lightest nuclei dissociation, at
tens-a hundred PeV, may rise soon in AUGER and TA telescopes. Such neutrino
signal are quite inclined upward fluorescent Tau air-showers at nearest (2 - 4
km) horizons, at middle-low telescope view zenith angles. Their air-showers
will be opening and extending in widest azimuth angle and fastest angular
velocity spread. Contrary to far EeV tau expected by popular GZK neutrinos.
Even hard to observe these Tau Air-showers at tens and hundred PeVs may soon
shine (in a peculiar way) at near telescope views and within a short (years)
time, both in AUGER, HEAT and TA sky.
