This work demonstrates the potential and the limitations of
archaeo-geophysical techniques available at the Archaeological Geophysics
Laboratory of the Department of Physics at the University of Sofia with various
case studies in natural and artificial environment. Special attention is
focused on GPR which is the most powerful archaeogeophysical technique This
laboratory is the only one in Bulgaria, which develops new geophysical
techniques and equipment for survey of archaeological sites and their dating.
