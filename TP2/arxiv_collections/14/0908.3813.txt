We present radio timing measurements of six rotating radio transient (RRAT)
sources discovered in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey. These provide four
new phase-connected timing solutions and two updated ones, making a total of
seven of the original 11 reported RRATs now with high-precision rotational and
astrometric parameters. Three of these seven RRATs have magnetic fields greater
than 10^13 G, with spin-down properties similar to those of the magnetars and
X-ray detected isolated neutron stars. Another two of these RRATs have long
periods and large characteristic ages, and lie near the `death-line' for radio
pulsar emission. The remaining two RRATs with timing solutions have properties
typical of the bulk of the pulsar population. The new solutions offer insights
into what might be responsible for the unusual emission properties. We
demonstrate that the RRATs have significantly longer periods and higher
magnetic fields than normal radio pulsars, and find no correlation with other
spin-down parameters. These solutions also provide precise positions, which
will facilitate follow-up studies at high energies, crucial for relating these
sources with other neutron star populations.
