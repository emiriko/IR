We present a method for obtaining quantum transport properties in graphene
that uniquely combines three crucial features: microscopic treatment of charge
disorder, fully quantum mechanical analysis of transport, and the ability to
model experimentally relevant system sizes. As a pertinent application we study
the disorder dependence of Klein tunneling dominated transport in p-n-p
junctions. Both the resistance and the Fano factor show broad resonance peaks
due to the presence of quasi bound states. This feature is washed out by the
disorder when the mean free path becomes of the order of the distance between
the two p-n interfaces.
