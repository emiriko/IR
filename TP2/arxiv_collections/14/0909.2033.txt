We study the evolution of quantum eigenstates in the presence of level
crossing under adiabatic cyclic change of environmental parameters. We find
that exotic holonomies, indicated by exchange of the eigenstates after a single
cyclic evolution, can arise from non-Abelian gauge potentials among
non-degenerate levels. We illustrate our arguments with solvable two and three
level models.
