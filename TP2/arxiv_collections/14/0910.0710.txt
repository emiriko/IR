We investigate the cubic to tetragonal phase transition in the
pressure-temperature phase diagram of strontium titanate SrTiO3 (STO) by means
of Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction on single crystal samples. X-ray
diffraction experiments are performed at room temperature, 381 and 467 K up to
53 GPa, 30 GPa and 26 GPa respectively. The observation of the superstructure
reflections in the X-ray patterns provides evidence that the crystal undergoes
at all investigated temperatures a pressure-induced transition from cubic to
the tetragonal I4/mcm phase, identical to the low-temperature phase. No other
phase transition is observed at room temperature up to 53 GPa. Together with
previously published data, our results allow us to propose a new linear phase
boundary in the pressure-temperature phase diagram. The data are analyzed in
the framework of the Landau theory of phase transitions. With a revised value
of the coupling coefficient between the order parameter and the volume
spontaneous strain, the model built from pressure-independent coefficients
reproduces satisfactorily the boundary in the phase diagram, but fails at
reflecting the more pronounced second-order character of the pressure-induced
phase transition as compared to the temperature-induced transition. We propose
a new Landau potential suitable for the description of the pressure-induced
phase transition. Finally, we show that particular attention has to be paid to
hydrostatic conditions in the study of the high-pressure phase transition in
STO.
