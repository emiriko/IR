The three open clusters Be 15, Be 80, and NGC 2192 have been observed using
CCD UBV(RI)_C photometry at the San Pedro M\'artir Observatory, M\'exico within
the framework of our open-cluster survey. The fundamental parameters of
interstellar reddening, distance, and age have been derived, and also the
metallicity for NGC 2192 (solar metallicity has been assumed for the other
two). By shifting the colours of Schmidt-Kaler in the (U-B, B-V) two-colour
diagram along the appropriate reddening vector, the interstellar reddenings
have been derived as E(B-V)=0.23+/-0.03 mag for Be 15, 1.31+/-0.05 for Be 80,
and 0.16+/-0.03 for NGC 2192. Evidence is shown for a variable interstellar
extinction across the cluster Be 80. For NGC 2192 a nicely consistent fit is
obtained for both the interstellar reddening and the metallicity ([Fe/H]=-0.31)
using simultaneously the F-type and red-clump stars. By fitting isochrones to
the observed sequences of these three clusters in various colour-magnitude
diagrams of different colour indices, (B-V, V-I, or V-R) the averages of
distance moduli and heliocentric distances ((V-M_V)_o (mag); d(pc)) are the
following: (10.74+/-0.01; 1202) for Be 15, (10.75+/-0.01; 1413) for Be 80, and
(12.7+/-0.01; 3467) for NGC 2192, and the averages of the inferred best ages
(log(age); age (Gyr)) are (8.6+/-0.05; 0.4) for Be 80, and (9.15+/-0.05; 1.4)
for NGC 2192; for Be 15 there are two distinct possibilities for the age fit,
depending on the membership of three brighter stars, (9.35 or 9.95+/-0.05; 2.2
or 8.9). The need for spectroscopic observations in Be 15 is emphasized to
select between alternate reddening and age solutions, and for deeper UBV
observations in Be 80 to study in greater detail the variable interstellar, or
intracluster, reddening across this cluster.
