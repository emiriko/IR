We simulate the twist of carbon nanotubes using atomic molecular dynamic
simulations. The ultimate twist angle per unit length and the deformation
energy are calculated for nanotubes of different geometries. It is found that
the big tube is harder to be twisted while the small tube exhibits higher
ultimate twisting ratio. For multi-walled nanotubes, the zigzag tube is found
to be able to stand more deformation than the armchair one. We observed the
surface transformation during twisting. Formation of structural defects is
observed prior to fracture.
