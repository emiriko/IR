We implement a cavity opto-electromechanical system integrating electrical
actuation capabilities of nanoelectromechanical devices with ultrasensitive
mechanical transduction achieved via intra-cavity optomechanical coupling.
Electrical gradient forces as large as 0.40 microN are realized, with
simultaneous mechanical transduction sensitivity of 1.5 X 10^-18 m/rtHz
representing a three orders of magnitude improvement over any
nanoelectromechanical system to date. Opto-electromechanical feedback cooling
is demonstrated, exhibiting strong squashing of the in-loop transduction
signal. Out-of-loop transduction provides accurate temperature calibration even
in the critical paradigm where measurement backaction induces opto-mechanical
correlations.
