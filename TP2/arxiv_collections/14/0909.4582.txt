We introduce a moduli functor for varieties whose tropicalization realizes a
given weighted fan and show that this functor is an algebraic space in general,
and is represented by a scheme of finite type when the associated toric variety
is quasiprojective. We study the geometry of these tropical realization spaces
for the matroid fans studied by Ardila and Klivans, and show that the tropical
realization space of a matroid fan is a torus torsor over the realization space
of the matroid. As a consequence, we deduce that these tropical realization
spaces satisfy Murphy's Law.
