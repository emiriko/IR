We apply the dynamical systems tools to study the linear dynamics of a
self-interacting scalar field trapped in the braneworld, for a wide variety of
self-interaction potentials. We focus on Randall-Sundrum (RS) and on
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld models exclusively. These models are
complementary to each other: while the RS brane produces ultra-violet (UV)
corrections to general relativity, the DGP braneworld modifies Einstein's
theory at large scales, i. e., produces infra-red (IR) modifications of general
relativity. This study of the asymptotic properties of both braneworld models,
shows -- in the phase space -- the way the dynamics of a scalar field trapped
in the brane departs from standard general relativity behaviour.
