We generalize the Cramer's rule of linear algebra. We apply it to calculate
the spectra of nucleus by applying Hill-Wheeler projection operator to
Hartree-Fock wave function, and to derive L\"owdin formula and Thouless
theorem. We derive by an elementary method the infinitesimal or L\"owdin
projection operators and its integral representation to be useful for the
projection of Slater determinant.
