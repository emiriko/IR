The feasibility and specific design of an acoustic neutrino detection array
at the South Pole depend on the acoustic properties of the ice. The South Pole
Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS) has been built to evaluate the acoustic
characteristics of the ice in the 1 to 100 kHz frequency range. The most recent
results of SPATS are presented.
