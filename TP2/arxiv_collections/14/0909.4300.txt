The inclusive same-sign dilepton channel is already recognized as a promising
discovery signature for supersymmetry in the early days of the LHC. We point
out that it can also be used for precision measurements of sparticle masses
after the initial discovery. As an illustration, we consider the LM6 CMS study
point in minimal supergravity, where the same-sign leptons most often result
from chargino decays to sneutrinos. We discuss three different techniques for
determining the chargino and sneutrino masses in an inclusive manner, i.e.
using only the two well measured lepton momenta, while treating all other
upstream objects in the event as a single entity of total transverse momentum
PT. This approach takes full advantage of the large production rates of colored
superpartners, but does not rely on the poorly measured hadronic jets, and
avoids any jet combinatorics problems. We discuss the anticipated precision of
our methods in the early LHC data.
