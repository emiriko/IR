We report on low-temperature electronic transport measurements of a silicon
metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dot, with independent gate control of
electron densities in the leads and the quantum dot island. This architecture
allows the dot energy levels to be probed without affecting the electron
density in the leads, and vice versa. Appropriate gate biasing enables the dot
occupancy to be reduced to the single-electron level, as evidenced by
magnetospectroscopy measurements of the ground state of the first two charge
transitions. Independent gate control of the electron reservoirs also enables
discrimination between excited states of the dot and density of states
modulations in the leads.
