We present a review of the SUSY search strategies in ATLAS in conjunction
with a readiness of the detector systems for first collision data in 2009 fall.
Commissioning was performed with the LHC single beams and the cosmic ray data
in 2008. The talk covers the analysis strategies based on the large Etmiss plus
high pT multi-jets signature in which the number of methods are investigated to
extract background estimation from real data. The expected discovery reach with
inclusive analysis is shown. The review also covers the special signature
searches for certain SUSY scenarios, where specific detector components play a
crucial role in detecting and measuring them.
