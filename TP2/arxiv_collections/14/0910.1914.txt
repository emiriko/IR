We study a Fredholm determinant of the hypergeometric kernel arising in the
representation theory of the infinite-dimensional unitary group. It is shown
that this determinant coincides with the Palmer-Beatty-Tracy tau function of a
Dirac operator on the hyperbolic disk. Solution of the connection problem for
Painleve VI equation allows to determine its asymptotic behavior up to a
constant factor, for which a conjectural expression is given in terms of Barnes
functions. We also present analogous asymptotic results for the Whittaker and
Macdonald kernel.
