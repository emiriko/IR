In this paper, we partially solve an open problem, due to J.C. Molluzzo in
1976, on the existence of balanced Steinhaus triangles modulo a positive
integer $n$, that are Steinhaus triangles containing all the elements of
$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ with the same multiplicity. For every odd number $n$,
we build an orbit in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, by the linear cellular automaton
generating the Pascal triangle modulo $n$, which contains infinitely many
balanced Steinhaus triangles. This orbit, in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, is
obtained from an integer sequence called the universal sequence. We show that
there exist balanced Steinhaus triangles for at least $2/3$ of the admissible
sizes, in the case where $n$ is an odd prime power. Other balanced Steinhaus
figures, such as Steinhaus trapezoids, generalized Pascal triangles, Pascal
trapezoids or lozenges, also appear in the orbit of the universal sequence
modulo $n$ odd. We prove the existence of balanced generalized Pascal triangles
for at least $2/3$ of the admissible sizes, in the case where $n$ is an odd
prime power, and the existence of balanced lozenges for all admissible sizes,
in the case where $n$ is a square-free odd number.
