Establishing relations between global stellar parameters and asteroseismic
quantities can help improve our understanding of stellar astrophysics and
facilitate the interpretation of observations. We present an observed relation
between the large frequency separation, $\Delta\nu$, and the frequency of
maximum power, $\nu_{max}$. We find that $\Delta\nu$ is proportional to
$(\nu_{max})^0.77$, allowing prediction of $\Delta\nu$ to about 15 per cent
given $\nu_{max}$. Our result is further supported by established scaling
relations for $\Delta\nu$ and $\nu_{max}$ and by extended stellar model
calculations, which confirm that $\Delta\nu$ can be estimated using this
relation for basically any star showing solar-like oscillations in the
investigated range (0.5<M/Msol<4.0).
