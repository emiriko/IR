We consider exclusive double diffractive production of scalar \chi_c(0^+),
axial-vector \chi_c(1^+) and tensor \chi_c(2^+) charmonia in
proton-(anti)proton collisions at different energies. The corresponding
amplitudes for these processes are derived within the k_t-factorisation
approach and the corresponding cross section is calculated with different
unintegrated gluon distribution functions (UGDFs) known from the literature. We
compare exclusive production of all charmonium states \chi_c(0^+), \chi_c(1^+)
and \chi_c(2^+) including branching fraction for radiative J/\Psi + \gamma
decay channel. Corresponding experimental consequences are discussed.
