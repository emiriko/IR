A new approach to grow FeSe1-xTex single crystals with optical zone-melting
technique was successfully employed. Crystals with actual composition 0.4 < x <
1.0 all show high crystallinity with no phase separation. The ability to
visually observe the locally heated melt, and ease of use and control of the
image furnace make this method a promising and time-efficient way for obtaining
high-quality FeSe1-xTex crystals. Our results indicate that with adequate heat
treatment, the non-uniform distribution of Se and Te atoms in crystal lattice
can be effectively eliminated, while the transition width of superconductivity
can be reduced to about 2 K, which suggest the crystals are homogeneous in
nature.
