We describe new techniques in the construction of optical lattices to realize
a coherent atom-based microscope, comprised of two atomic species used as
target and probe atoms, each in an independently controlled optical lattice.
Precise and dynamic translation of the lattices allows atoms to be brought into
spatial overlap to induce atomic interactions. For this purpose, we have
fabricated two highly stable, hexagonal optical lattices, with widely separted
wavelengths but identical lattice constants using diffractive optics. The
relative translational stability of 12nm permits controlled interactions and
even entanglement operations with high fidelity. Translation of the lattices is
realized through a monolithic electro-optic modulator array, capable of moving
the lattice smoothly over one lattice site in 11 microseconds, or rapidly on
the order of 100 nanoseconds.
