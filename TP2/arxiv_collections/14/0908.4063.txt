We demonstrate the decoy-state quantum key distribution over 200 km with
photon polarization through optical fiber, by using super-conducting single
photon detector with a repetition rate of 320 Mega Hz and a dark count rate of
lower than 1 Hz. Since we have used the polarization coding, the
synchronization pulses can be run in a low frequency. The final key rate is
14.1 Hz. The experiment lasts for 3089 seconds with 43555 total final bits.
