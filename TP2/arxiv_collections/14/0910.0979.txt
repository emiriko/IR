In the Israel-Stewart's theory of second order hydrodynamics, we have
analysed the recent PHENIX data on charged particles elliptic flow in Au+Au
collisions.
  PHENIX data demand more viscous fluid in peripheral collisions than in
central collisions. Over a broad range of collision centrality (0-10%- 50-60%),
viscosity to entropy ratio ($\eta/s$) varies between 0-0.17.
