In this paper an updated Geant4 simulation toolkit is presented describing
the interactions in matter of heavy hadrons containing long-lived squarks and
gluinos. Generic signatures are derived that are applicable at the Large Hadron
Collider, and the problem of theoretical uncertainties arising from model
dependence is addressed. For a more detailed description of the assumptions and
techniques used, the reader is referred to arXiv:0908.1868.
