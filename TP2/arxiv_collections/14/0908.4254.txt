We explore the possibility that, at zero temperature, vortices can be created
spontaneously in a condensate of cold Fermi atoms, whose scattering is
controlled by a narrow Feshbach resonance, by rapid magnetic tuning from the
BEC to BCS regime. This could be achievable with current experimental
techniques.
