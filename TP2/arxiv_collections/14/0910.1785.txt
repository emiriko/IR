We review the theoretical and phenomenological aspects of the Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model: the Higgs sector including radiative corrections
and the 2-loop beta-functions for all parameters of the general NMSSM; the
tadpole and domain wall problems, baryogenesis; NMSSM phenomenology at
colliders, B physics and dark matter; specific scenarios as the constrained
NMSSM, Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking, U(1)'-extensions, CP and R-parity
violation.
