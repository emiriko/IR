A general approach describing quantum decision procedures is developed. The
approach can be applied to quantum information processing, quantum computing,
creation of artificial quantum intelligence, as well as to analyzing decision
processes of human decision makers. Our basic point is to consider an active
quantum system possessing its own strategic state. Processing information by
such a system is analogous to the cognitive processes associated to decision
making by humans. The algebra of probability operators, associated with the
possible options available to the decision maker, plays the role of the algebra
of observables in quantum theory of measurements. A scheme is advanced for a
practical realization of decision procedures by thinking quantum systems. Such
thinking quantum systems can be realized by using spin lattices, systems of
magnetic molecules, cold atoms trapped in optical lattices, ensembles of
quantum dots, or multilevel atomic systems interacting with electromagnetic
field.
