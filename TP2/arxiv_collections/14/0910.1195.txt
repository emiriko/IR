In this lectures we outline the construction of pure spinor superstrings. We
consider both the open and closed pure spinor superstrings in critical and
noncritical dimensions and on flat and curved target spaces with RR flux. We
exhibit the integrability properties of pure spinor superstrings on curved
backgrounds with RR fluxes.
