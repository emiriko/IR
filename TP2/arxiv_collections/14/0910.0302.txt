In this article, we report the recent progress on decoherence dynamics of
electrons in quantum dot quantum computing systems using the exact master
equation we derived recently based on the Feynman-Vernon influence functional
approach. The exact master equation is valid for general nanostructure systems
coupled to multi-reservoirs with arbitrary spectral densities, temperatures and
biases. We take the double quantum dot charge qubit system as a specific
example, and discuss in details the decoherence dynamics of the charge qubit
under coherence controls. The decoherence dynamics risen from the entanglement
between the system and the environment is mainly non-Markovian. We further
discuss the decoherence of the double-dot charge qubit induced by quantum point
contact (QPC) measurement where the master equation is re-derived using the
Keldysh non-equilibrium Green function technique due to the non-linear coupling
between the charge qubit and the QPC. The non-Markovian decoherence dynamics in
the measurement processes is extensively discussed as well.
