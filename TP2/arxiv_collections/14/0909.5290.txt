In the context of Markov processes, we show a new scheme to derive dual
processes and a duality function based on a boson representation. This scheme
is applicable to a case in which a generator is expressed by boson creation and
annihilation operators. For some stochastic processes, duality relations have
been known, which connect continuous time Markov processes with discrete state
space and those with continuous state space. We clarify that using a generating
function approach and the Doi-Peliti method, a birth-death process (or discrete
random walk model) is naturally connected to a differential equation with
continuous variables, which would be interpreted as a dual Markov process. The
key point in the derivation is to use bosonic coherent states as a bra state,
instead of a conventional projection state. As examples, we apply the scheme to
a simple birth-coagulation process and a Brownian momentum process. The
generator of the Brownian momentum process is written by elements of the
SU(1,1) algebra, and using a boson realization of SU(1,1) we show that the same
scheme is available.
