Based on a scheme that produces an entanglement between the spin and the path
variables of a single spin-1/2 particle (qubit) using a beam-splitter and a
spin-flipper, we formulate a procedure for transferring this intraparticle
hybrid entanglement to an interparticle entanglement between the spin variables
of two other spatially separated spin-1/2 particles which never interact with
each other during the entire process. This procedure of entanglement swapping
is accomplished by a Mach-Zehnder setup in conjunction with the Stern-Gerlach
measuring device, using suitable unitary operations. The proposed protocol,
thus, enables the use of intraparticle entanglement as a resource - a feature
that has remained unexplored.
