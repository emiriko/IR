We discuss a duel-type game in which Player I uses his resource continuously
and Player II distributes it by discrete portions. Each player knows how much
resources he and his opponent have at every moment of time. The solution of the
game is given in an explicit form.
  Keywords: noisy duel, payoff, strategy, the value of a game, consumption of
resource.
