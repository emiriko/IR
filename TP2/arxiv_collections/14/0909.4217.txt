We consider models of relativistic matter containing sharp interfaces across
which the matter model changes. These models will be relevant for neutron stars
with crusts, phase transitions, or for viscous boundaries where the length
scale is too short to be modelled smoothly. In particular we look at numerical
techniques that allow us to evolve stable interfaces, for the interfaces to
merge, and for strong waves and shocks to interact with the interfaces. We test
these techniques for ideal hydrodynamics in special and general relativity for
simple equations of state, finding that simple level set-based methods extend
well to relativistic hydrodynamics.
