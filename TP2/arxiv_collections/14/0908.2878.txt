We propose a definition of characters in the context of
Schneider-Teitelbaum's theory of locally analytic representations of p-adic
reductive groups. This character will be a function on a compact subgroup of a
maximal torus of the reductive group in question. As an example we treat the
locally analytic principal series of SL(2,Q_p).
