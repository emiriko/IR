We study a production of Coulomb-assisted $\Sigma^-$-nucleus bound states by
nuclear ($K^-$, $\pi^+$) reactions within a distorted-wave impulse
approximation, so as to examine several types of the $\Sigma$-nucleus
potentials that are consistent with the available $\Sigma^-$ atomic X-ray data
and nuclear ($\pi^-$, $K^+$) data. We theoretically demonstrate the inclusive
($K^-$, $\pi^+$) spectra of the $\Sigma^-$ unstable bound states on $^{28}$Si,
$^{58}$Ni, and $^{208}$Pb targets at incident $K^-$ lab momenta $p_{K}=
400\text{--}800$ MeV/c. The results show that the near-recoilless ($K^-$,
$\pi^+$) reaction on the $^{58}$Ni target gives a clear candidate to confirm
properties of the $\Sigma$-nucleus potentials having a repulsion inside the
nuclear surface and an attraction outside the nucleus with a sizable
absorption, whereas details of the repulsion of the potential at the nuclear
center cannot be determined by the inclusive spectra. This is a promising
attempt to extract properties of the $\Sigma$-nucleus potential in the nucleus
at forthcoming J-PARC experiments, as a full complement to the analyses of the
$\Sigma^-$ atomic and ($\pi^-$, $K^+$) data.
