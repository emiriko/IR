We investigate the dynamics of a scalar field governed by the Lifshitz-type
action which should appear naturally in Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The wave of
the scalar field may propagate with any speed without an upper bound. To
preserve the causality, the action cannot have a generic form. Due to the
superluminal propagation, a formation of a singularity may cause the breakdown
of the predictability of the theory. To check whether such a catastrophe could
occur in Horava-Lifshitz gravity, we investigate the dynamics of a dust. It
turns out that the dust does not collapse completely to form a singularity in a
generic situation, but expands again after it attains a maximum energy density.
