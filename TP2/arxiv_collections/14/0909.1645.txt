We study observation-based strategies for partially-observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs) with omega-regular objectives. An observation-based
strategy relies on partial information about the history of a play, namely, on
the past sequence of observations. We consider the qualitative analysis
problem: given a POMDP with an omega-regular objective, whether there is an
observation-based strategy to achieve the objective with probability~1
(almost-sure winning), or with positive probability (positive winning). Our
main results are twofold. First, we present a complete picture of the
computational complexity of the qualitative analysis of POMDP s with parity
objectives (a canonical form to express omega-regular objectives) and its
subclasses. Our contribution consists in establishing several upper and lower
bounds that were not known in literature. Second, we present optimal bounds
(matching upper and lower bounds) on the memory required by pure and randomized
observation-based strategies for the qualitative analysis of POMDP s with
parity objectives and its subclasses.
