The paper studies the problem of filtering a discrete-time linear system
observed by a network of sensors. The sensors share a common communication
medium to the estimator and transmission is bit and power budgeted. Under the
assumption of conditional Gaussianity of the signal process at the estimator
(which may be ensured by observation packet acknowledgements), the conditional
prediction error covariance of the optimum mean-squared error filter is shown
to evolve according to a random dynamical system (RDS) on the space of
non-negative definite matrices. Our RDS formalism does not depend on the
particular medium access protocol (randomized) and, under a minimal distributed
observability assumption, we show that the sequence of random conditional
prediction error covariance matrices converges in distribution to a unique
invariant distribution (independent of the initial filter state), i.e., the
conditional error process is shown to be ergodic. Under broad assumptions on
the medium access protocol, we show that the conditional error covariance
sequence satisfies a Markov-Feller property, leading to an explicit
characterization of the support of its invariant measure. The methodology
adopted in this work is sufficiently general to envision this application to
sample path analysis of more general hybrid or switched systems, where existing
analysis is mostly moment-based.
