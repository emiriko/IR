We compute the dynamical polarizability of graphene beyond the usual Dirac
cone approximation, integrating over the full Brillouin zone. We find
deviations at $\hbar\omega=2t$ ($t$ the hopping parameter) which amount to a
logarithmic singularity due to the van Hove singularity and derive an
approximate analytical expression. Also at low energies, we find deviations
from the results obtained from the Dirac cone approximation which manifest
themselves in a peak spitting at arbitrary direction of the incoming wave
vector $\q$. Consequences for the plasmon spectrum are discussed.
