We compare the results of the photometrical analysis of barred galaxies with
those of a similar analysis from N-body simulations. The photometry is for a
sample of nine barred galaxies observed in the J and Ks bands with the CANICA
near infrared (NIR) camera at the 2.1-m telescope of the Observatorio
Astrofisico Guillermo Haro (OAGH) in Cananea, Sonora, Mexico. The comparison
includes radial ellipticity profiles and surface brightness (density for the
N-body galaxies) profiles along the bar major and minor axes. We find very good
agreement, arguing that the exchange of angular momentum within the galaxy
plays a determinant role in the evolution of barred galaxies.
