We derive several entanglement criteria for bipartite continuous variable
quantum systems based on the Shannon entropy. These criteria are more sensitive
than those involving only second-order moments, and are equivalent to
well-known variance product tests in the case of Gaussian states. Furthermore,
they involve only a pair of quadrature measurements, and will thus should prove
extremely useful the experimental identification of entanglement.
