Electron pairing is central to modern concepts of superconductivity, and
provides a basis for the ubiquitous presence of h/2e in the theory and
phenomenology. However, the lack of a consistent real-space picture of
phonon-mediated pairing suggests that the pairing interpretation may be
incomplete or even misleading. Alternatively, the present picture refers back
to an old proposal by Frohlich, whereby superconductivity is based on an
induced electron charge density wave coupled to a one-dimensional static
lattice distortion. In the new picture, dynamic three-dimensional
charge-density waves couple to coherent standing-wave phonons, giving rise to a
mobile superconducting ground state that does not pin on crystalline defects.
Long-range order in the ground state is associated with localized electron
orbitals in a correlated two-phase field, which provides for flux quantization
in units of h/2e on the macroscopic scale larger than the coherence length,
without the need for a macroscopic pair wave function. While much of the
formalism for this picture may carry over from conventional BCS theory, this
picture makes distinct predictions for observable structures on the microscopic
and mesoscopic scales.
