The calculating of the coherent information is a fundamental step in
obtaining the quantum capacity of a quantum channel. We introduce orthogonal
and complete code basis to evaluate the coherent information per channel use
when the input is the maximal mixture of stabilizer codewords. In the code
basis, the output density matrix is diagonal, the joint output of the system
and the auxiliary is block diagonal. The coherent information is worked out by
counting the weights of error operators.
