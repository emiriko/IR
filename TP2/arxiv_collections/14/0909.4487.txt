We develop a complete Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence for twisted pairs on a
compact Riemann surface X. The main novelty lies in a careful study of the the
notion of polystability for pairs, required for having a bijective
correspondence between solutions to the Hermite-Einstein equations, on one
hand, and polystable pairs, on the other. Our results allow us to establish
rigorously the homemomorphism between the moduli space of polystable G-Higgs
bundles on X and the character variety for representations of the fundamental
group of X in G. We also study in detail several interesting examples of the
correspondence for particular groups and show how to significantly simplify the
general stability condition in these cases.
