New results on radiative K+- decays from the NA48/2 experiment are presented.
In the channel K+- -> pi+- pi0 gamma more than 1 million decays were
reconstructed, leading to the first measurement of the interference between
direct photon emission and inner bremsstrahlung and stringent limits on CP
violation in this decay. For K+- -> pi+- gamma gamma, a precise measurement of
the branching fraction was performed, based on more than 1000 events. In
addition, the related decay K+- -> pi+- e+ e- gamma was observed for the first
time and measurements of the decay rate and the decay parameter c^ were carried
out.
