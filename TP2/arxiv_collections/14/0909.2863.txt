SARAH is a Mathematica package for building and studying supersymmetric
models. It calculates for a given superpotential and gauge sector the full
Lagrangian of a model. With the new version of SARAH it is possible to
calculate automatically all interactions for the different eigenstates and
write model files for FeynArts and CompHep/CalcHep. In addition, the tadpole
equations are calculated, gauge fixing terms can be given and ghost
interactions are added, particles can be integrated out and non supersymmetric
limits of the theory can be chosen. CP and flavor violation can easily be
switched on or off.
