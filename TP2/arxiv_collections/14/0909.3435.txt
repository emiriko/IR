HD172189 is a spectroscopic eclipsing binary system with a rapidly-rotating
pulsating delta Scuti component. It is also a member of the open cluster
IC4756. These combined characteristics make it an excellent laboratory for
asteroseismic studies. To date, HD172189 has been analysed in detail
photometrically but not spectroscopically. For this reason we have compiled a
set of spectroscopic data to determine the absolute and atmospheric parameters
of the components. We determined the radial velocities (RV) of both components
using four different techniques. We disentangled the binary spectra using
KOREL, and performed the first abundance analysis on both disentangled spectra.
By combining the spectroscopic results and the photometric data, we obtained
the component masses, 1.8 and 1.7 solar masses, and radii, 4.0 and 2.4 solar
radii, for inclination i = 73.2 degrees, eccentricity e = 0.28, and orbital
period 5.70198 days. Effective temperatures of 7600 K and 8100 K were also
determined. The measured vsini are 78 and 74 km/s, respectively, giving
rotational periods of 2.50 and 1.55 days for the components. The abundance
analysis shows [Fe/H] = -0.28 for the primary (pulsating) star, consistent with
observations of IC4756. We also present an assessment of the different analysis
techniques used to obtain the RVs and the global parameters.
