Over the years security experts in the field of Information Technology have
had a tough time in making passwords secure. This paper studies and takes a
careful look at this issue from the angle of philosophy and cognitive science.
We have studied the process of passwords to rank its strengths and weaknesses
in order to establish a quality metric for passwords. Finally we related the
process to human senses which enables us to propose a constitutional scheme for
the process of password. The basic proposition is to exploit relationship
between human senses and password to ensure improvement in authentication while
keeping it an enjoyable activity.
