Reading documents on mobile devices is challenging. Not only are screens
small and difficult to read, but also navigating an environment using limited
visual attention can be difficult and potentially dangerous. Reading content
aloud using text-tospeech (TTS) processing can mitigate these problems, but
only for content that does not include rich visual information. In this paper,
we introduce a new technique, SeeReader, that combines TTS with automatic
content recognition and document presentation control that allows users to
listen to documents while also being notified of important visual content.
Together, these services allow users to read rich documents on mobile devices
while maintaining awareness of their visual environment.
