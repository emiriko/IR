A L\'evy noise on $\mathbb{R}^d$ assigns a random real "mass" $\Pi(B)$ to
each Borel subset $B$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite Lebesgue measure. The
distribution of $\Pi(B)$ only depends on the Lebesgue measure of $B$, and if
$B_1, ..., B_n$ is a finite collection of pairwise disjoint sets, then the
random variables $\Pi(B_1), ..., \Pi(B_n)$ are independent with $\Pi(B_1 \cup
>... \cup B_n) = \Pi(B_1) + ... + \Pi(B_n)$ almost surely. In particular, the
distribution of $\Pi \circ g$ is the same as that of $\Pi$ when $g$ is a
bijective transformation of $\mathbb{R}^d$ that preserves Lebesgue measure. It
follows from the Hewitt--Savage zero--one law that any event which is almost
surely invariant under the mappings $\Pi \mapsto \Pi \circ g$ for every
Lebesgue measure preserving bijection $g$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ must have
probability 0 or 1. We investigate whether certain smaller groups of Lebesgue
measure preserving bijections also possess this property. We show that if $d
\ge 2$, the L\'evy noise is not purely deterministic, and the group consists of
linear transformations and is closed, then the invariant events all have
probability 0 or 1 if and only if the group is not compact.
