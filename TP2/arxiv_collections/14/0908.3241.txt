We study height distributions of Japanese schoolchildren based on the
statictical data which are obtained from the school health survey by the
ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology, Japan . From
our analysis, it has been clarified that the distribution of height changes
from the lognormal distribution to the normal distribution in the periods of
puberty.
