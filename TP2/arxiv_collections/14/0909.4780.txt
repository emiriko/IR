We present results of simulations of the spectrum of the accretion flow onto
the supermassive black hole in our Galactic Centre, Sagittarius A*, generated
with a coupling of Monte-Carlo (MC) radiation and general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) codes. In our modeling, we use the 2D HARM GRMHD
code to first model the physical parameters of the disk, then feed its results
into our 2D MC photon transport code. We will discuss results obtained which
fit radio, IR, and Chandra-obtained flaring or quiescent x-ray data points, as
well as the validity of the amount of scaling of input parameters (density,
temperature, and magnetic field) required to fit these points. HARM output will
be used to suggest whether the scaling is within reasonable limits.
