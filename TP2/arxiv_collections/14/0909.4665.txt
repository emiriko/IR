The prospects for central exclusive diffractive (CED) production of BSM Higgs
bosons at the LHC are reviewed. This comprises the production of MSSM and 4th
generation Higgs bosons. The sensitivity of the searches in the forward proton
mode for the Higgs bosons as well as the possibility of a coupling structure
determination are briefly discussed.
