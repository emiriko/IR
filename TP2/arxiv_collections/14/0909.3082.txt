The superconducting Josephson junction has been demonstrated to be a strong
candidate for building quantum bits or "qubits" which are the components of a
future quantum computer. In recent years, considerable theoretical and
experimental effort have been focused on studying quantum properties of single
qubits and two coupled solid-state qubits. We present results of numerical
simulations of the energy spectra of more three phase qubits that are
capacitively-coupled in different configurations. We discuss the ensuing
entanglement between component qubits as manifested in avoided crossings and
how these may play a role in building gates and transmitting qubit state
information.
