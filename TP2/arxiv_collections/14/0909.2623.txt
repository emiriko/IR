A major problem of unstructured P2P systems is their heavy network traffic.
This is caused mainly by high numbers of query answers, many of which are
irrelevant for users. One solution to this problem is to use Top-k queries
whereby the user can specify a limited number (k) of the most relevant answers.
In this paper, we present FD, a (Fully Distributed) framework for executing
Top-k queries in unstructured P2P systems, with the objective of reducing
network traffic. FD consists of a family of algorithms that are simple but
effec-tive. FD is completely distributed, does not depend on the existence of
certain peers, and addresses the volatility of peers during query execution. We
vali-dated FD through implementation over a 64-node cluster and simulation
using the BRITE topology generator and SimJava. Our performance evaluation
shows that FD can achieve major performance gains in terms of communication and
response time.
