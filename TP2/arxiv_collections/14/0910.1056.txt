Gaseous and liquid xenon particle detectors are being used in a number of
applications including dark matter search and neutrino-less double beta decay
experiments. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is often used in these detectors
both as electrical insulator and as a light reflector to improve the efficiency
of detection of scintillation photons. However, xenon emits in the vacuum
ultraviolet wavelength region (175 nm) where the reflecting properties of PTFE
are not sufficiently known.
  In this work we report on measurements of PTFE reflectance, including its
angular distribution, for the xenon scintillation light. Various samples of
PTFE, manufactured by different processes (extruded, expanded, skived and
pressed) have been studied. The data were interpreted with a physical model
comprising both specular and diffuse reflections. The reflectance obtained for
these samples ranges from about 47% to 66% for VUV light. Fluoropolymers,
namely ETFE, FEP and PFA were also measured.
