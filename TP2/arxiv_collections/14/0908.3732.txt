Investigations of the anomalies in the Earth rotation, in particular, the
polar motion components, play an important role in our understanding of the
processes that drive changes in the Earth's surface, interior, atmosphere, and
ocean. This paper is primarily aimed at investigation of the Chandler wobble
(CW) at the whole available 163-year interval to search for the major CW
amplitude and phase variations. First, the CW signal was extracted from the
IERS (International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service) Pole
coordinates time series using two digital filters: the singular spectrum
analysis and Fourier transform. The CW amplitude and phase variations were
examined by means of the wavelet transform and Hilbert transform. Results of
our analysis have shown that, besides the well-known CW phase jump in the
1920s, two other large phase jumps have been found in the 1850s and 2000s. As
in the 1920s, these phase jumps occurred contemporarily with a sharp decrease
in the CW amplitude.
