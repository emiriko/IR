The deepest multi-wavelength surveys now provide measurements of star
formation in galaxies out to z>1, and allow to reconstruct its history for
large parts of the galaxy population. I review recent studies, which have
consistently revealed a picture where galaxy star formation rates and their
evolution are primarily determined by galaxy mass. Unless they undergo a
quenching of their star formation, galaxies of similar masses have very similar
star formation histories, which turn out to be relatively smooth: star
formation rates decline with redshift in a primarily gradual manner, while
typical starburst episodes have only a modest amplitude that barely evolves.
  I discuss how the found relations and their redshift evolution can provide an
observed reference star formation history as a function of galaxy mass.
  The observed amplitudes and timescales of galaxy star formation are not fully
reproduced by current theoretical models, and are a promising testbed to
improve the assumed baryon physics. However, measurements of star formation
rates in distant galaxies need to be treated with caution. Near-future data,
methods and instruments will help us to improve on calibrations and
sensitivities for high redshift star formation.
