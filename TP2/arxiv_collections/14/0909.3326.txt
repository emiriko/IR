An exact analytic form for the second virial coefficient, valid for the
entire range of temperature, is presented for the Lennard-Jones fluid in this
paper. It is derived by making variable transformation that gives rise to the
Hamiltonian mimicking a harmonic oscillator-like dynamics for negative energy.
It is given in terms of parabolic cylinder functions or confluent
hypergeometric functions. Exact limiting laws for the second virial coefficient
in the limits of low and high temperatuers are also deduced for the
Lennard-Jones fluid.
