Particles with TeV mass and strong self-interactions generically have the
right annihilation cross section to explain an observed excess of cosmic
electrons and positrons if the end-product of the annihilation is charged
leptons. We present an explicit model of strongly-coupled TeV-scale dark matter
whose relic abundance related to the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the
observed universe. The B - L asymmetry of the standard model is transfered to
the dark sector by an operator carrying standard model lepton number. Lepton
number violation naturally induces dark matter particle-antiparticle
oscillations at late times, allowing dark matter-antimatter annihilations
today. The dark matter annihilates into lighter strongly-interacting particles
in the dark sector that decay to leptons via the transfer operator. The strong
dynamics in the dark sector is at the weak scale due to supersymmetry breaking.
The correct dark matter abundance is automatically obtained for natural values
of dimensionless parameters, analogous to the situation for conventional WIMPs.
