The magnetic and electronic modifications induced at the interfaces in
(SrMnO$_{3}$)$_{n}$/(LaMnO$_{3}$)$_{2n}$ superlattices have been investigated
by linear and circular magnetic dichroism in the Mn L$_{2,3}$ x-ray absorption
spectra. Together with theoretical calculations, our data demonstrate that the
charge redistribution across interfaces favors in-plane ferromagnetic (FM)
order and $e_{g}(x^{2}-y^{2})$ orbital occupation, in agreement with the
average strain. Far from interfaces, inside LaMnO$_3$, electron localization
and local strain favor antiferromagnetism (AFM) and $e_{g}(3z^{2}-r^{2})$
orbital occupation. For $n=1$ the high density of interfacial planes ultimately
leads to dominant FM order forcing the residual AFM phase to be in-plane too,
while for $n \geq 5$ the FM layers are separated by AFM regions having
out-of-plane spin orientation.
