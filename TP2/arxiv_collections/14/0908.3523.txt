Cognitive Dimensions is a framework for analyzing human-computer interaction.
It is used for meta-analysis, that is, for talking about characteristics of
systems without getting bogged down in details of a particular implementation.
In this paper, I discuss some of the dimensions of this theory and how they can
be applied to analyze information seeking interfaces. The goal of this analysis
is to introduce a useful vocabulary that practitioners and researchers can use
to describe systems, and to guide interface design toward more usable and
useful systems
