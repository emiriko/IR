Using a parametric approach, we determine the configuration of super-AGB
stars at the explosion as a function of the initial mass and metallicity, in
order to verify if the EC-SN scenario involving a super-AGB star is compatible
with the observations regarding SN2008ha and SN2008S. The results show that
both the SNe can be explained in terms of EC-SNe from super-AGB progenitors
having a different configuration at the collapse. The impact of these results
on the interpretation of other sub-luminous SNe is also discussed.
