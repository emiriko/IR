We investigate the scale-locality of subgrid-scale (SGS) energy flux and
inter-band energy transfers defined by the sharp spectral filter. We show by
rigorous bounds, physical arguments and numerical simulations that the spectral
SGS flux is dominated by local triadic interactions in an extended turbulent
inertial-range. Inter-band energy transfers are also shown to be dominated by
local triads if the spectral bands have constant width on a logarithmic scale.
We disprove in particular an alternative picture of ``local transfer by
nonlocal triads,'' with the advecting wavenumber mode at the energy peak.
Although such triads have the largest transfer rates of all {\it individual}
wavenumber triads, we show rigorously that, due to their restricted number,
they make an asymptotically negligible contribution to energy flux and
log-banded energy transfers at high wavenumbers in the inertial-range. We show
that it is only the aggregate effect of a geometrically increasing number of
local wavenumber triads which can sustain an energy cascade to small scales.
Furthermore, non-local triads are argued to contribute even less to the
space-average energy flux than is implied by our rigorous bounds, because of
additional cancellations from scale-decorrelation effects. We can thus recover
the -4/3 scaling of nonlocal contributions to spectral energy flux predicted by
Kraichnan's ALHDIA and TFM closures. We support our results with numerical data
from a $512^3$ pseudospectral simulation of isotropic turbulence with
phase-shift dealiasing. We conclude that the sharp spectral filter has a firm
theoretical basis for use in large-eddy simulation (LES) modeling of turbulent
flows.
