We present a consistent age ordering for young clusters and groups determined
using the contraction of stars through their pre-main-sequence phase. We
compare these with ages derived from the evolution of the upper main-sequence
stars, and find the upper MS ages are older by a factor 1.5 to 2. We show that
increasing the binary fraction and number of equal-mass binaries amongst the
O-stars compared to the rest of the MS cannot remove this discrepancy.
