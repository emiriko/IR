We present results from a catalogue of 1696 X-ray point sources detected in
the massive star forming region (SFR) Cygnus OB2, the majority of which have
optical or near-IR associations. We derive ages of 3.5 and 5.25 Myrs for the
stellar populations in our two fields, in agreement with recent studies that
suggest that the central 1-3 Myr OB association is surrounded and contaminated
by an older population with an age of 5-10 Myrs. The fraction of sources with
proto-planetary disks, as traced by K-band excesses, are unusually low. Though
this has previously been interpreted as due to the influence of the large
number of OB stars in Cyg OB2, contamination from an older population of stars
in the region could also be responsible. An initial mass function is derived
and found to have a slope of Gamma = -1.27, in agreement with the canonical
value. Finally we introduce the recently approved Chandra Cygnus OB2 Legacy
Survey that will image a 1 square degree area of the Cygnus OB2 association to
a depth of 120 ks, likely detecting ~10,000 stellar X-ray sources.
