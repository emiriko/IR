The diffuse Galactic gamma-ray data from the region of the
  Galactic Center has been collected by the LAT instrument on the
  Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. In this paper we argue that it may be able
to provide an unambiguous evidence of originating, in addition to known
astrophysical sources, from dark matter annihilations in the halo,
independently of the mass and other properties of the dark matter particle. We
also show that the recently released high precision data from mid-latitudes is
already providing an upper bound, albeit still a weak one, on the cuspiness of
the dark matter density profile as a function of the mass of the dark matter
assumed to be a stable neutralino of minimal supersymmetry.
