We have developed a versatile software package for the simulation of
di-electron production in $pp$ and $dp$ collisions at SIS energies. Particular
attention has been paid to incorporate different descriptions of the Dalitz
decay $\Delta \to N e^+e^-$ via a common interface. In addition, suitable
parameterizations for the virtual bremsstrahlung process $NN \to NN e^+e^-$
based on one-boson exchange models have been implemented. Such simulation tools
with high flexibility of the framework are important for the interpretation of
the di-electron data taken with the HADES spectrometer and the design of
forthcoming experiments.
