For an arbitrary ordinary second order differential equation a test is
constructed that checks if this equation is equivalent to Painleve I, II or
Painleve III with three zero parameters equations under the substitutions of
variables. If it is true then in case the Painleve equations I and II an
explicite change of variables is given that is written using the differential
invariants of the equation.
