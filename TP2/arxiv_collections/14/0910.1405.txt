We introduce examples of three- and four-mode entangled Gaussian mixed states
that are not detected by the scaling and Peres-Horodecki separability criteria.
The presented modification of the scaling criterion resolves this problem. Also
it is shown that the new criterion reproduces the main features of the scaling
pictures for different cases of entangled states, while the previous versions
lead to completely different outcomes. This property of the presented scheme is
evidence of its higher generality.
