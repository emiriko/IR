We present results of thermal evolution calculations for objects originating
in the Kuiper belt and transferring inwards, to the region of the outer
planets. Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) are considered to be part of a reservoir
that supplies the flux of small icy bodies, mainly Centaurs and Jupiter-family
comets, to regions interior to the orbit of Neptune. We study the internal
thermal evolution, for yr, of three typical KBOs and use the end state of the
simulation as initial conditions for evolutionary calculations of two typical
Centaurs. Some evolutionary trends can be identified for the KBOs, depending on
key physical parameters, such as size and composition. The subsequent evolution
in the Centaur region results in both specific features for each modeled object
(mainly surface and sub-surface composition) and common characteristics of
thermally evolved Centaurs.
