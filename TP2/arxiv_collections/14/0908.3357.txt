We argue that the ratio $S_3 =\mathrm{^3_\Lambda H} / (\mathrm{^3He} \times
\frac{\Lambda}{p})$ is a good representation of the local correlation between
baryon number and strangeness, and therefore is a valuable tool to probe the
nature of the dense matter created in high energy heavy-ion collision: quark
gluon plasma or hadron gas. A multiphase transport model (AMPT) plus a
dynamical coalescence model is used to elucidate our arguments. We find that
AMPT with string melting predicts an increase of $S_3$ with increasing beam
energy, and is consistent with experimental data, while AMPT with only hadronic
scattering results in a low $S_3$ throughout the energy range from AGS to RHIC,
and fails to describe the experimental data.
