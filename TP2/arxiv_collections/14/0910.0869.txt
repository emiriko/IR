Results of the Spectral Quark Model for the gravitational, electromagnetic,
and transition form factors of the pion are discussed. In this model both the
parton distribution amplitude and the parton distribution function are flat, in
agreement with the transverse lattice calculations at low renormalization
scales. The model predictions for the gravitational form factor are compared to
the lattice data, with good agreement. We also find a remarkable relation
between the three form factors, holding within our model, which besides
reproducing the anomaly, provides a relation between radii which is reasonably
well fulfilled. Comparison with the CELLO, CLEO, and BaBar data for the
transition form factor is also considered.
