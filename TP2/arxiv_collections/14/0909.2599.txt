The effect of a background rotation on the decay of homogeneous turbulence
produced by a grid is experimentally investigated. Experiments have been
performed in a channel mounted in the large-scale 'Coriolis' rotating platform,
and measurements have been carried out in the planes normal and parallel to the
rotation axis using particle image velocimetry. After a short period of about
0.4 tank rotation where the energy decays as $t^{-6/5}$, as in classical
isotropic turbulence, the energy follows a shallower decay law compatible with
$t^{-3/5}$, as dimensionally expected for energy transfers governed by the
linear timescale $\Omega^{-1}$. The crossover occurs at a Rossby number $Ro
\simeq 0.25$, without noticeable dependence with the grid Rossby number. After
this transition, anisotropy develops in the form of vertical layers where the
initial vertical velocity remains trapped. These layers of nearly constant
vertical velocity become thinner as they are advected and stretched by the
large-scale horizontal flow, producing significant horizontal gradient of
vertical velocity which eventually become unstable. After the $Ro \simeq 0.25$
transition, the vertical vorticity field first develops a cyclone-anticyclone
asymmetry, reproducing the growth law of the vorticity skewness, $S_\omega(t)
\simeq (\Omega t)^{0.7}$, reported by Morize, Moisy & Rabaud [{\it Phys.
Fluids} {\bf 17} (9), 095105 (2005)]. At larger time, however, the vorticity
skewness decreases and eventually returns to zero. The present results indicate
that the shear instability of the vertical layers contribute significantly to
the re-symmetrisation of the vertical vorticity at large time, by re-injecting
vorticity fluctuations of random sign at small scales. These results emphasize
the importance of the initial conditions in the decay of rotating turbulence.
