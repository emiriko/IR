The conductivity tensor is introduced for the low-dimensional electron
systems. Within the particle-in-a-box model and the diagonal response
approximation, components of the conductivity tensor for a quasi-homogeneous
ultrathin metal film and wire are calculated under the assumption $d\cong
\lambda_{\rm F}$ (where $d$ is the characteristic small dimension of the
system, $\lambda_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wavelength for bulk metal). We find the
transmittance of ultrathin films and compare these results with available
experimental data. The analytical estimations for the size dependence of the
Fermi level are presented, and the oscillations of the Fermi energy in
ultrathin films and wires are computed. Our results demonstrate the strong size
and frequency dependences of the real and imaginary parts of the conductivity
components in the infrared range. A sharp distinction of the results for Au and
Pb is observed and explained by the difference in the relaxation time of these
metals.
