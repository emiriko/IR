Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations of the hybrid variable
Gamma Pegasi (Handler et al. 2009, Handler 2009) revealed 6 frequencies of the
SPB type and 8 of the Beta Cep type pulsations. Standard seismic models, which
have been constructed with OPAL (Iglesias & Rogers 1996) and OP (Seaton 2005)
opacities by fitting three frequencies (those of the radial fundamental and two
dipole modes), do not reproduce the frequency range of observed pulsations and
do not fit the observed individual frequencies with a satisfactory accuracy. We
argue that better fitting can be achieved with opacity enhancements, over the
OP data, by about 20-50 percent around the opacity bumps produced by excited
ions of the iron-group elements at temperatures of about 200 000 K (Z bump) and
2 million K (Deep Opacity Bump).
