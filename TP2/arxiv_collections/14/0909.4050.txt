We used chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetic calculations to model
chemistry of the volatiles released by heating different types of carbonaceous,
ordinary and enstatite chondritic material as a function of temperature and
pressure. Our results predict the composition of atmospheres formed by
outgassing during accretion of the Earth and other terrestrial planets.
Outgassing of CI and CM carbonaceous chondritic material produces H2O-rich
(steam) atmospheres in agreement with the results of impact experiments.
However, outgassing of other types of chondritic material produces atmospheres
dominated by other gases. Outgassing of ordinary (H, L, LL) and high iron
enstatite (EH) chondritic material yields H2-rich atmospheres with CO and H2O
being the second and third most abundant gases. Outgassing of low iron
enstatite (EL) chondritic material gives a CO-rich atmosphere with H2, CO2, and
H2O being the next most abundant gases. Outgassing of CV carbonaceous
chondritic material gives a CO2-rich atmosphere with H2O being the second most
abundant gas. Our results predict that the atmospheres formed during accretion
of the Earth and Mars were probably H2-rich unless the accreted material was
dominantly CI and CM carbonaceous chondritic material. We also predict
significant amounts of S, P, Cl, F, Na, and K in accretionary atmospheres at
high temperatures (1500-2500 K). Finally, our results may be useful for
interpreting spectroscopic observations of accreting extrasolar terrestrial
planets.
