Elliptic functions are known to appear in many problems, applied and
theoretical. However, a lesser known application is in the study of exact
solutions to Einstein's gravitational field equations in a
Friedmann-Robertson-Lemaitre-Walker (FRLW) cosmology. We will show explicitly
how Jacobi and Weierstrass elliptic functions arise in this context, and will
additionally show connections with theta functions.
