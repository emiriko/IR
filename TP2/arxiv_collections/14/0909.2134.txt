In this article we propose a new direct method of effective parameters
restoration that is based on the wave propagation phenomenon. It retrieves the
effective properties unambiguously, is applicable to thick metamaterial (MTM)
slabs and is easy in implementation. It is validated on the case studies of
fishnet, split cube in carcass, Jerusalem cross and ultrahigh refractive index
MTMs. The constraints of the method are designated.
