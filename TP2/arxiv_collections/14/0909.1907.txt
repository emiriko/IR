We formulate the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory, with the assumption
of local equilibrium made in the reference frame floating with normal
electrons. This theory with floating nucleation kernel is applied to the far
infrared (FIR) conductivity in the Abrikosov vortex lattice. It yields better
agreement with recent experimental data [PRB {\bf 79}, 174525 (2009)] than the
customary time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory.
