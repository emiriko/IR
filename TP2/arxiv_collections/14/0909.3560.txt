We consider a class of continuous-time stochastic growth models on
$d$-dimensional lattice with non-negative real numbers as possible values per
site. We remark that the diffusive scaling limit proven in our previous work
[Nagahata, Y., Yoshida, N.: Central Limit Theorem for a Class of Linear
Systems, Electron. J. Probab. Vol. 14, No. 34, 960--977. (2009)] can be
extended to wider class of models so that it covers the cases of
potlatch/smoothing processes.
