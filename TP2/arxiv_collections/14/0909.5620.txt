We present a derivation of the low energy Lagrangian governing the dynamics
of the spin degrees of freedom in a spinor Bose condensate, for any phase in
which the average magnetization vanishes. This includes all phases found within
mean-field treatments except for the ferromagnet, for which the low energy
dynamics has been discussed previously. The Lagrangian takes the form of a
sigma model for the rotation matrix describing the local orientation of the
spin state of the gas.
