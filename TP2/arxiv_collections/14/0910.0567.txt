Many therapeutic advantages such as prolonged circulation in the blood,
increased tumor drug uptake, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and markedly
reduced toxic side effects are provided by a carbon nanotube based
chemotherapeutic formulation. In this system, doxorubicin (DOX) is loaded onto
the sidewalls of functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes by
supramolecular pi-pi stacking.
