We report simultaneous measurements of the distribution of lattice constants
and the antiferromagnetic moment in high-purity URu2Si2, using both Larmor and
conventional neutron diffraction, as a function of temperature and pressure up
to 18 kbar. We establish that the tiny moment in the hidden order (HO) state is
purely parasitic and quantitatively originates from the distribution of lattice
constants. Moreover, the HO and large-moment antiferromagnetism (LMAF) at high
pressure are separated by a line of first-order phase transitions, which ends
in a bicritical point. Thus the HO and LMAF are coupled non-linearly and must
have different symmetry, as expected of the HO being, e.g., incommensurate
orbital currents, helicity order, or multipolar order.
