Quantum discord quantifies non-classical correlations in a quantum system
including those not captured by entanglement. Thus, only states with zero
discord exhibit strictly classical correlations. We prove that these states are
negligible in the whole Hilbert space: typically a state picked out at random
has positive discord; and, given a state with zero discord, a generic
arbitrarily small perturbation drives it to a positive-discord state. These
results hold for any Hilbert-space dimension, and have direct implications on
quantum computation and on the foundations of the theory of open systems. In
addition, we provide a simple necessary criterion for zero quantum discord.
Finally, we show that, for almost all positive-discord states, an arbitrary
Markovian evolution cannot lead to a sudden, permanent vanishing of discord.
