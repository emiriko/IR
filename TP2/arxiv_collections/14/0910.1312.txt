We describe an extension of the hadronic SU(3) non-linear sigma model to
include quarks. As a result, we obtain an effective model which interpolates
between hadronic and quark degrees of freedom. The new parameters and the
potential for the Polyakov loop (used as the order parameter for deconfinement)
are calibrated in order to fit lattice QCD data and reproduce the QCD phase
diagram. Finally, the equation of state provided by the model, combined with
gravity through the inclusion of general relativity, is used to make
predictions for neutron stars.
