In this work, we propose a scheme to design the time evolution of the entropy
of entanglement between two qubits. It is shown an explicit accurate solution
for the inverse problem of determining the time dependence of the coupling
constant from a user-defined dynamical entanglement function. Such an active
control of entanglement can be implemented in many different physical
implementations of coupled qubits, and we briefly comment on the use of
interacting flux qubits.
