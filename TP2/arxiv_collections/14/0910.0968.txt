The geoeffective magnetic cloud (MC) of 20 November 2003, has been associated
to the 18 November 2003, solar active events in previous studies. In some of
these, it was estimated that the magnetic helicity carried by the MC had a
positive sign, as well as its solar source, active region (AR) NOAA 10501. In
this paper we show that the large-scale magnetic field of AR 10501 had a
negative helicity sign. Since coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are one of the
means by which the Sun ejects magnetic helicity excess into the interplanetary
space, the signs of magnetic helicity in the AR and MC should agree. Therefore,
this finding contradicts what is expected from magnetic helicity conservation.
However, using for the first time correct helicity density maps to determine
the spatial distribution of magnetic helicity injection, we show the existence
of a localized flux of positive helicity in the southern part of AR 10501. We
conclude that positive helicity was ejected from this portion of the AR leading
to the observed positive helicity MC.
