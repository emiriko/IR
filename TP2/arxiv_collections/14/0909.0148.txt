The ZZ Ceti star KUV 02464+3239 was observed over a whole season at the
mountain station of Konkoly Observatory. A rigorous frequency analysis revealed
6 certain periods between 619 and 1250 seconds, with no shorter period modes
present. We use the observed periods, published effective temperature and
surface gravity, along with the model grid code of Bischoff-Kim, Montgomery and
Winget (2008) to perform a seismological analysis. We find acceptable model
fits with masses between 0.60 and 0.70 M_Sun. The hydrogen layer mass of the
acceptable models are almost always between 10^-4 and 10^-6 M_*. In addition to
our seismological results, we also show our analysis of individual light curve
segments. Considering the non-sinusoidal shape of the light curve and the
Fourier spectra of segments showing large amplitude variations, the importance
of non-linear effects in the pulsation is clearly seen.
