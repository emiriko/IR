In an attempt to understand why catalytic methods for the growth of boron
nitride nanotubes work much worse than for their carbon counterparts, we use
first-principles calculations to study the energetics of elemental reactions
forming N2, B2 and BN molecules on an iron catalyst. We observe that in the
case of these small molecules, the catalytic activity is hindered by the
formation of B2 on the iron surface. We also observe that the local morphology
of a step edge present in our nanoparticle model stabilizes the boron nitride
molecule with respect to B2 due to the ability of the step edge to offer sites
with different coordination simultaneously for nitrogen and boron. Our results
emphasize the importance of atomic steps for a high yield chemical vapor
deposition growth of BN nanotubes and may outline new directions for improving
the efficiency of the method.
