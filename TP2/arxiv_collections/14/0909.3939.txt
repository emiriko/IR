MCSCF calculations are performed in order to determine the exchange coupling
between the 2p electrons of the N atom and the LUMOs of the fullerene cage in
the case of mono- and tri-anions of N@C60. The exchange coupling resulted by
our calculations is large compared to the hyperfine interaction. The strong
coupling can explain the missing EPR signal of the nitrogen in paramagnetic
anions.
