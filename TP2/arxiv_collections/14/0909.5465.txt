We study a hybrid optomechanical system consisting of a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) trapped inside a single-mode optical cavity with a moving
end-mirror. The intracavity light field has a dual role: it excites a momentum
side-mode of the condensate, and acts as a nonlinear spring that couples the
vibrating mirror to that collective density excitation. We present the dynamics
in a regime where the intracavity optical field, the mirror, and the side-mode
excitation all display bistable behavior. In this regime we find that the
dynamics of the system exhibits Hamiltonian chaos for appropriate initial
conditions.
