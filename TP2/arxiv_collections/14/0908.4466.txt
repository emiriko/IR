Using chiral anomaly, we discuss the pair creation of massless fermions under
the effect of magnetic field $\vec{B}$ when an electric flux tube $\vec{E}$
parallel to $\vec{B}$ is switched on. The tube is axial symmetric and
infinitely long. In the limit $B\gg E$, we can analytically obtain the spatial
and temporal behaviors of the number density of the fermions, the azimuthal
magnetic field generated by the fermions etc.. We find that the life time $t_c$
of the electric field is shorter as the width of the tube is narrower. Applying
it to the glasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, we find that color
electric field decays fast such as $t_c\simeq Q_s^{-1}$ with saturation
momentum $Q_s$.
