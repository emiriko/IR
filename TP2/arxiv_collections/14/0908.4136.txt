We report direct imaging of standing waves of the nontrivial surface states
of topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ by using a low temperature scanning
tunneling microscope. The interference fringes are caused by the scattering of
the topological states off Ag impurities and step edges on the
Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111) surface. By studying the voltage-dependent standing wave
patterns, we determine the energy dispersion $E(k)$, which confirms the Dirac
cone structure of the topological states. We further show that, very different
from the conventional surface states, the backscattering of the topological
states by nonmagnetic impurities is completely suppressed. The absence of
backscattering is a spectacular manifestation of the time-reversal symmetry,
which offers a direct proof of the topological nature of the surface states.
