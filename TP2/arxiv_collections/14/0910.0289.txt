The quasistationary spreading of a circular liquid drop on a solid substrate
typically obeys the so-called Tanner law, with the instantaneous base radius
R(t) growing with time as R ~ t^{1/10} -- an effect of the dominant role of
capillary forces for a small-sized droplet. However, for droplets of nematic
liquid crystals, a faster spreading law sets in at long times, so that R ~
t^alpha with alpha significantly larger than the Tanner exponent 1/10. In the
framework of the thin film model (or lubrication approximation), we describe
this "acceleration" as a transition to a qualitatively different spreading
regime driven by a strong substrate-liquid interaction specific to nematics
(antagonistic anchoring at the interfaces). The numerical solution of the thin
film equation agrees well with the available experimental data for nematics,
even though the non-Newtonian rheology has yet to be taken into account. Thus
we complement the theory of spreading with a post-Tanner stage, noting that the
spreading process can be expected to cross over from the usual
capillarity-dominated stage to a regime where the whole reservoir becomes a
diffusive film in the sense of Derjaguin.
