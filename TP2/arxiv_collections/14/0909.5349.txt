Non-identical particle femtoscopy probes not only the size of the emitting
system, but also the emission asymmetries between particles of different mass,
which are intimately related with the collective behavior of matter. We apply
the technique to the simulations from the {\tt THERMINATOR}+Lhyquid model of
the heavy-ion collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 AGeV. We present predictions for
all common pair combinations and discuss their interpretation. Emphasis is put
on extracting unique information about collective behavior of matter from the
non-identical particle correlations and understanding the role of particles
coming from decays of hadronic resonances. We also present, in detail, the
technical aspects of the non-identical particle femtoscopy technique applied to
data from the heavy-ion collisions. We list the sources of systematic errors
coming from the method itself and the usual assumptions. We describe robust
analysis methods and discuss their limitations.
