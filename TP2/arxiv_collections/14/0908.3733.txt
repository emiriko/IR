We study many-body contributions to the effective interaction between
fermions in a three-component Fermi mixture. We find that effective
interactions induced by the third component can lead to a phase diagram
different from that predicted if interactions with the third component are
neglected. As a result, in a confining potential a superfluid shell structure
can arise even for equal populations of the components. We also find a critical
temperature for the BCS transition in a 6Li mixture which can deviate strongly
from the one in a weakly interacting two-component system.
