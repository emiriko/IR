The Schrodinger equation for the Manning-Rosen potential with the centrifugal
term is solved approximately to obtain bound states energies. Additionally, the
corresponding wave functions are expressed by the Jacobi polynomials. The
Nikiforov-Uvarov (NU) method is used in the calculations. To show the accuracy
of our results, we calculate the eigenvalues numerically for arbitrary quantum
numbers n and l with two different values of the potential parameter \alpha. It
is shown that the results are in good agreement with the those obtained by
other methods for short potential range, small l and \alpha. This solution
reduces to two cases l=0 and Hulthen potential case.
