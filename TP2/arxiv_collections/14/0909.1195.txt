In order to consistently explain controversial experimental results on
superconducting states observed by different probes in typical iron-based
superconductors, we construct a realistic multi-band $\pm s$-wave pairing model
by combining the quasiclassical formalism with the first-principles
calculation. The model successfully resolves the controversies in contrast to
the fact that simplified models such as two-band $\pm s$-wave one fail to do. A
key in the model is the existence of relatively small gaps which leads to
material-dependent peculiarities.
