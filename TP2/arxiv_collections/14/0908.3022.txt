This paper outlines an approach to manage and quantify the risks associated
with changes made to spreadsheets. The methodology focuses on structural
differences between spreadsheets and suggests a technique by which a risk
analysis can be achieved in an automated environment. The paper offers an
example that demonstrates how contiguous ranges of data can be mapped into a
generic list of formulae, data and metadata. The example then shows that
comparison of these generic lists can establish the structural differences
between spreadsheets and quantify the level of risk that each change has
introduced. Lastly the benefits, drawbacks and limitations of the technique are
discussed in a commercial context.
