In this paper, we will give a sufficient condition for a non-negative random
variable $X$ to be heavy tailed by investigating the Laplace-Stieltjes
transform of the probability distribution function. We focus on the relation
between the singularity at the real point of the axis of convergence and the
asymptotic decay of the tail probability. Our theorem is a kind of Tauberian
theorems.
