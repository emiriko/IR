A chiral-order parameter of spins in a crystal can not be inferred from
measurements of Bragg reflections, although there are several claims in
published literature to the contrary. Appropriate techniques use total
scattering, of x-rays or neutrons, that yield the instantaneous value of a spin
correlation related to an established measure of spin chirality.
