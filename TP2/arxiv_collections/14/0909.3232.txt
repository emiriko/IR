The satellite Hinode has recently revealed penumbral structures with a
magnetic polarity opposite to the main sunspot polarity. They may be a direct
confirmation of magnetic field lines and mass flows returning to the solar
interior throughout the penumbra, a configuration previously inferred from
interpretation of observed Stokes profile asymmetries. The paper points out the
relationship between the reverse polarity features found by Hinode, and the
model Micro-Structured Magnetic Atmospheres (MISMAs) proposed for sunspots. We
show how the existing model MISMAs produce strongly redshifted reverse polarity
structures as found by Hinode. Ad hoc model MISMAs also explain the asymmetric
Stokes profiles observed by Hinode. The same modeling may be consistent with
magnetograms of dark cored penumbral filaments if the dark cores are associated
with the reverse polarity. Such hypothetical relationship will show up only in
the far red wings of the spectral lines.
