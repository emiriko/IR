By means of numerical simulations, we investigate magnetized stellar winds of
pre-main-sequence stars. In particular we analyze under which circumstances
these stars will present elongated magnetic features (e.g., helmet streamers,
slingshot prominences, etc). We focus on weak-lined T Tauri stars, as the
presence of the tenuous accretion disk is not expected to have strong influence
on the structure of the stellar wind. We show that the plasma-beta parameter
(the ratio of thermal to magnetic energy densities) is a decisive factor in
defining the magnetic configuration of the stellar wind. Using initial
parameters within the observed range for these stars, we show that the coronal
magnetic field configuration can vary between a dipole-like configuration and a
configuration with strong collimated polar lines and closed streamers at the
equator (multi-component configuration for the magnetic field). We show that
elongated magnetic features will only be present if the plasma-beta parameter
at the coronal base is beta<<1. Using our self-consistent 3D MHD model, we
estimate for these stellar winds the time-scale of planet migration due to drag
forces exerted by the stellar wind on a hot-Jupiter. In contrast to the
findings of Lovelace et al. (2008), who estimated such time-scales using the
Weber & Davis model, our model suggests that the stellar wind of these
multi-component coronae are not expected to have significant influence on
hot-Jupiters migration. Further simulations are necessary to investigate this
result under more intense surface magnetic field strengths (~2-3 kG) and higher
coronal base densities, as well as in a tilted stellar magnetosphere.
