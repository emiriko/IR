In this paper, we investigate the spectral instability of periodic traveling
wave solutions of the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation to long wavelength
transverse perturbations in the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. By
analyzing high and low frequency limits of the appropriate periodic Evans
function, we derive an orientation index which yields sufficient conditions for
such an instability to occur. This index is geometric in nature and applies to
arbitrary periodic traveling waves with minor smoothness and convexity
assumptions on the nonlinearity. Using the integrable structure of the ordinary
differential equation governing the traveling wave profiles, we are then able
to calculate the resulting orientation index for the elliptic function
solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries and modified Korteweg-de Vries equations.
