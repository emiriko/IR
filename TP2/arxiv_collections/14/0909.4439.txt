We demonstrate through numerical simulations with real data the feasibility
of using compressive sensing techniques for the acquisition of
spectro-polarimetric data. This allows us to combine the measurement and the
compression process into one consistent framework. Signals are recovered thanks
to a sparse reconstruction scheme from projections of the signal of interest
onto appropriately chosen vectors, typically noise-like vectors. The
compressibility properties of spectral lines are analyzed in detail. The
results shown in this paper demonstrate that, thanks to the compressibility
properties of spectral lines, it is feasible to reconstruct the signals using
only a small fraction of the information that is measured nowadays. We
investigate in depth the quality of the reconstruction as a function of the
amount of data measured and the influence of noise. This change of paradigm
also allows us to define new instrumental strategies and to propose
modifications to existing instruments in order to take advantage of compressive
sensing techniques.
