We introduce a new technique, called the Sliding Two-Dimensional Fluctuation
Spectrum, used for detecting and characterising the temporal changes of
drifting subpulses from radio pulsars. The method was tested using simulated
data as well as archived observations made with the WSRT at wavelengths of 92
and 21 cm. The drifting subpulse phenomenon is a well known property of radio
pulsars. However the properties of the temporal behaviour of drifting subpulses
are not fully explored. The drifting can also be non-coherent and the presence
of effects like nulling or drift rate changing can mask the drifting behaviour
of the pulsar. The S2DFS is a robust method for investigating this phenomenon
and by introducing it we aim to expand our knowledge of the temporal drifting
subpulse properties. Our new analysis method uses horizonally collapsed
fluctuation spectra obtained with the Two-Dimensional Fluctuation Spectrum
method. Stacking the collapsed spectra obtained in a 256 pulse window which
slides by a pulse at a time produces a map of the collapsed fluctuation
spectrum. By analysing the maps one can easily determine the presence of any
temporal drift changes. Simulated data showed that the technique can reveal the
presence of any temporal changes in drift behaviour like mode changing or
nulling. We have also analysed data of three pulsars, PSRs B0031-07, B1819-22
and B1944+17, which were selected based on the quality of the data and their
known drift properties. All three sources are known to exhibit mode changes
which could easily be seen in the S2DFS. The results from the analysis of the
data sets used in this paper have shown that the S2DFS method is robust and
complimentary to the 2DFS method in detecting and characterising the temporal
changes in drifting subpulses from radio pulsars.
