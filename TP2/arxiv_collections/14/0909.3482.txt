We propose a simple quantitative model of Schumpeterian economic dynamics.
New goods and services are endogenously produced through combinations of
existing goods. As soon as new goods enter the market they may compete against
already existing goods, in other words new products can have destructive
effects on existing goods. As a result of this competition mechanism existing
goods may be driven out from the market - often causing cascades of secondary
defects (Schumpeterian gales of destruction). The model leads to a generic
dynamics characterized by phases of relative economic stability followed by
phases of massive restructuring of markets - which could be interpreted as
Schumpeterian business `cycles'. Model timeseries of product diversity and
productivity reproduce several stylized facts of economics timeseries on long
timescales such as GDP or business failures, including non-Gaussian fat tailed
distributions, volatility clustering etc. The model is phrased in an open,
non-equilibrium setup which can be understood as a self organized critical
system. Its diversity dynamics can be understood by the time-varying topology
of the active production networks.
