In this paper, we establish a connection between ranking theory and general
equilibrium theory. First of all, we show that the ranking vector of PageRank
or Invariant method is precisely the equilibrium of a special Cobb-Douglas
market. This gives a natural economic interpretation for the PageRank or
Invariant method. Furthermore, we propose a new ranking method, the CES
ranking, which is minimally fair, strictly monotone and invariant to reference
intensity, but not uniform or weakly additive.
