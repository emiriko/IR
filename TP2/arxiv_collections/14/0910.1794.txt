We give a formula of the Donaldson-Futaki invariants for certain type of semi
test configurations, which essentially generalizes Ross-Thomas' slope theory.
The positivity (resp. non-negativity) of those "a priori special"
Donaldson-Futaki invariants implies K-stability (resp. K-semistability). We
show its applicability by proving K-(semi)stability of certain polarized
varieties with semi-log-canonical singularities, generalizing some results by
Ross-Thomas.
