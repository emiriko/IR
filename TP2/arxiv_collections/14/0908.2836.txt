We prove the existence of a large class of one parameter families of
solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations that depend on the singular parameter
$\ep=v_T/c$ $(0<\ep < \ep_0)$, where $c$ is the speed of light, and $v_T$ is a
typical speed of the gravitating fluid. These solutions are shown to exist on a
common spacetime slab $M\cong [0,T)\times \Tbb^3$, and converge as $\ep
\searrow 0$ to a solution of the cosmological Poisson-Euler equations of
Newtonian gravity. Moreover, we establish that these solutions can be expanded
in the parameter $\ep$ to any specified order with expansion coefficients that
satisfy $\ep$-independent (nonlocal) symmetric hyperbolic equations.
