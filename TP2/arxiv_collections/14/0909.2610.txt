Noble gas permeabilities and diffusivities of Kapton, butyl, nylon, and
"Silver Shield" are measured at temperatures between 22C and 115C. The
breakthrough times and solubilities at 22C are also determined. The
relationship of the room temperature permeabilities to the noble gas atomic
radii is used to estimate radon permeability for each material studied. For the
noble gases tested, Kapton and Silver Shield have the lowest permeabilities and
diffusivities, followed by nylon and butyl, respectively.
