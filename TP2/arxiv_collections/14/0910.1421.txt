The Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS) covers the whole sky north of Dec(2000)
= -5 deg. on a fully sampled angular grid. Using state-of-the-art
FPGA-spectrometers we perform a Milky Way and an extragalactic HI survey in
parallel. Moreover, the high dynamic range and short dump time of the HI
spectra allow to overcome the vast majority of all radio-frequency-interference
(RFI) events. The Milky Way data will be corrected for the stray-radiation bias
which warrants a main-beam efficiency of 99%. Towards the whole survey area we
exceed the sensitivity limit of HIPASS, while towards the
Sloan-Digital-Sky-Survey (SDSS) area EBHIS offers an order of magnitude higher
mass sensitivity. The Milky Way data will be a cornerstone for multi-frequency
astrophysics, while the extragalactic part will disclose detailed information
on the structure formation of the local universe.
