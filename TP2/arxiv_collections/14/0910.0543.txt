A heat engine operating on the basis of the Carnot cycle is considered, where
the mechanical work performed is dissipated within the engine at the
temperature of the warmer isotherm and the resulting heat is added to the
engine together with an external heat input. The resulting work performed by
the engine per cycle is increased at the expense of dissipated work produced in
the previous cycle. It is shown that such a dissipative heat engine is
thermodynamically inconsistent violating the first and second laws of
thermodynamics. The existing physical models employing the dissipative heat
engine concept, in particular, the heat engine model of hurricane development,
are physically invalid.
