After an elementary derivation of the "time transformation", mapping a
counting process onto a homogeneous Poisson process with rate one, a brief
review of Ogata's goodness of fit tests is presented and a new test, the
"Wiener process test", is proposed. This test is based on a straightforward
application of Donsker's Theorem to the intervals of time transformed counting
processes. The finite sample properties of the test are studied by Monte Carlo
simulations. Performances on simulated as well as on real data are presented.
It is argued that due to its good finite sample properties, the new test is
both a simple and a useful complement to Ogata's tests. Warnings are moreover
given against the use of a single goodness of fit test.
