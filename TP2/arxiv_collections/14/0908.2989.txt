In this paper we show that the holomorphic representation is appropriate for
description in a consistent way string and string field theories, when the
considered number of component fields of the string field is finite. A new
Lagrangian for the closed string is obtained and shown to be equivalent to
Nambu-Goto's Lagrangian. We give the notion of anti-string, evaluate the
propagator for the string field, and calculate the convolution of two of them.
