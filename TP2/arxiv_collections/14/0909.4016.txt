The Bethe-Salpeter equation is used to comprehensively study mesons with
J=0,1 and equal-mass constituents for quark masses from the chiral limit to the
b-quark mass. The survey contains masses of the ground states in all
corresponding J^{PC} channels including those with "exotic" quantum numbers.
The emphasis is put on each particular state's sensitivity to the low- and
intermediate-momentum, i.e., long-range part of the strong interaction.
