We introduce a fresh scheme based on the local hidden variable models to
quantify nonlocality for arbitrarily high-dimensional quantum systems. Our
scheme explores the minimal amount of white noise that must be added to the
system in order to make the system local and realistic. Moreover, the scheme
has a clear geometric significance and is numerically computable due to
powerful computational and theoretical methods for the class of convex
optimization problems known as semidefinite programs.
