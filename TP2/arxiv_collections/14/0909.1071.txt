We investigate a new thin-shell wormhole constructed by surgically grafting
two regular charged black holes arising from the action using nonlinear
electrodynamics coupled to general relativity. The stress-energy components
within the shell violate the null and weak energy conditions but obey the
strong energy condition. We study the stability in two ways: (i) taking a
specific equation of state at the throat and (ii) analyzing the stability to
linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about a static equilibrium
solution. Various other aspects of this thin-shell wormhole are also analyzed.
