The Semantic Robot Vision Competition provided an excellent opportunity for
our research lab to integrate our many ideas under one umbrella, inspiring both
collaboration and new research. The task, visual search for an unknown object,
is relevant to both the vision and robotics communities. Moreover, since the
interplay of robotics and vision is sometimes ignored, the competition provides
a venue to integrate two communities. In this paper, we outline a number of
modifications to the competition to both improve the state-of-the-art and
increase participation.
