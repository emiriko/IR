Recently, a duality between Liouville theory and four dimensional N=2 gauge
theory has been uncovered by some of the authors. We consider the role of
extended objects in gauge theory, surface operators and line operators, under
this correspondence. We map such objects to specific operators in Liouville
theory. We employ this connection to compute the expectation value of general
supersymmetric 't Hooft-Wilson line operators in a variety of N=2 gauge
theories.
