Fully sampled degree-scale maps of the 13CO 2-1 and CO 4-3 transitions toward
three members of the Lupus Molecular Cloud Complex - Lupus I, III, and IV -
trace the column density and temperature of the molecular gas. Comparison with
IR extinction maps from the c2d project requires most of the gas to have a
temperature of 8-10 K. Estimates of the cloud mass from 13CO emission are
roughly consistent with most previous estimates, while the line widths are
higher, around 2 km/s. CO 4-3 emission is found throughout Lupus I, indicating
widespread dense gas, and toward Lupus III and IV. Enhanced line widths at the
NW end and along the edge of the B228 ridge in Lupus I, and a coherent velocity
gradient across the ridge, are consistent with interaction between the
molecular cloud and an expanding HI shell from the Upper-Scorpius subgroup of
the Sco-Cen OB Association. Lupus III is dominated by the effects of two HAe/Be
stars, and shows no sign of external influence. Slightly warmer gas around the
core of Lupus IV and a low line width suggest heating by the
Upper-Centaurus-Lupus subgroup of Sco-Cen, without the effects of an HI shell.
