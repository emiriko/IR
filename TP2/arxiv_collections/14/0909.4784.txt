We present Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging of the M8+M8 binary
2MASS J2206-2047AB. Together with archival HST, Gemini-North, and VLT data, our
observations span 8.3 years of the binary's 35 year orbital period, and we
determine a total dynamical mass of 0.15 (+0.05,-0.03) Msun, with the
uncertainty dominated by the parallax error. Using the measured total mass and
individual luminosities, the Tucson and Lyon evolutionary models both give an
age for the system of 0.4 (+9.6, -0.2) Gyr, which is consistent with its thin
disk space motion derived from the Besancon Galactic structure model. Our mass
measurement combined with the Tucson (Lyon) evolutionary models also yields
precise effective temperatures, giving 2660+-100 K and 2640+-100K (2550+-100 K
and 2530+-100 K) for components A and B, respectively. These temperatures are
in good agreement with estimates for other M8 dwarfs (from the infrared flux
method and the M8 mass benchmark LHS 2397aA), but atmospheric model fitting of
the NIR spectrum gives hotter temperatures of 2800+-100 K for both components.
This modest discrepancy can be explained by systematic errors in the
atmospheric models or by a slight underestimate of the distance (and thus mass
and age) of the system. We also find the observed near-infrared colors and
magnitudes do not agree with those predicted by the Lyon Dusty models, given
the known mass.
