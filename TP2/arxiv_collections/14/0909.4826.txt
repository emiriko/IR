Motile eukaryotic cells propel themselves in viscous fluids by passing waves
of bending deformation down their flagella. An infinitely long flagellum
achieves a hydrodynamically optimal low-Reynolds number locomotion when the
angle between its local tangent and the swimming direction remains constant
along its length. Optimal flagella therefore adopt the shape of a helix in
three dimensions (smooth) and that of a sawtooth in two dimensions
(non-smooth). Physically, biological organisms (or engineered micro-swimmers)
must expend internal energy in order to produce the waves of deformation
responsible for the motion. Here we propose a physically-motivated derivation
of the optimal flagellum shape. We determine analytically and numerically the
shape of the flagellar wave which leads to the fastest swimming while
minimizing an appropriately-defined energetic expenditure. Our novel approach
is to define an energy which includes not only the work against the surrounding
fluid, but also (1) the energy stored elastically in the bending of the
flagellum, (2) the energy stored elastically in the internal sliding of the
polymeric filaments which are responsible for the generation of the bending
waves (microtubules), and (3) the viscous dissipation due to the presence of an
internal fluid. This approach regularizes the optimal sawtooth shape for
two-dimensional deformation at the expense of a small loss in hydrodynamic
efficiency. The optimal waveforms of finite-size flagella are shown to depend
upon a competition between rotational motions and bending costs, and we observe
a surprising bias towards half-integer wave-numbers. Their final hydrodynamic
efficiencies are above 6%, significantly larger than those of swimming cells,
therefore indicating available room for further biological tuning.
