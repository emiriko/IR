We obtained near-infrared long-baseline interferometry of IRC+10420 with the
AMBER instrument of ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) in low and
high spectral resolution (HR) mode to probe the photosphere and the innermost
circumstellar environment of this rapidly evolving yellow hypergiant. In the HR
observations, the visibilities show a noticeable drop across the Brackett gamma
(BrG) line on all three baselines, and we found differential phases up to -25
degrees in the redshifted part of the BrG line and a non-zero closure phase
close to the line center. The calibrated visibilities were corrected for
AMBER's limited field-of-view to appropriately account for the flux
contribution of IRC+10420's extended dust shell. We derived FWHM Gaussian sizes
of 1.05 +/- 0.07 and 0.98 +/- 0.10 mas for IRC+10420's continuum-emitting
region in the H and K bands, respectively, and the BrG-emitting region can be
fitted with a geometric ring model with a diameter of 4.18 +0.19/-0.09 mas,
which is approximately 4 times the stellar size. The geometric model also
provides some evidence that the BrG line-emitting region is elongated towards a
position angle of 36 degrees, well aligned with the symmetry axis of the outer
reflection nebula. The HR observations were further analyzed by means of
radiative transfer modeling using CMFGEN and the 2-D Busche & Hillier codes.
Our spherical CMFGEN model poorly reproduces the observed line shape,
blueshift, and extension, definitively showing that the IRC+10420 outflow is
asymmetric. Our 2-D radiative transfer modeling shows that the blueshifted BrG
emission and the shape of the visibility across the emission line can be
explained with an asymmetric bipolar outflow with a high density contrast from
pole to equator (8-16), where the redshifted light is substantially diminished.
