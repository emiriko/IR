The Schr\"{o}dinger equation has the property that when changing the length
scale by $\vec{r} \to \epsilon \vec{r}$ and the energy scale by $E \to E /
\epsilon^2$, the shape of the wavefunction remains unchanged. The same
re-scaling leaves the intrinsic hyperpolarizability (as well as higher-order
hyperpolarizabilities) unchanged. As such, the intrinsic hyperpolarizability is
the best quantity for comparing molecules since it re-normalizes for trivial
differences that are due to molecular size and energy gap. Similarly, the
intrinsic hyperpolarizability is invariant to changes in the number of
electrons. In this paper, we review the concept of scale invariance and how it
can be applied to better understand the nonlinear optical response, which can
be used to develop new paradigms for it's optimization.
