We use renormalization as a tool to extract universal features of the NN
interaction in quark and soliton nucleon models, having the same long distance
behaviour but different short distance components. While fine tuning conditions
in the models make difficult to fit NN data, the introduction of suitable
renormalization conditions supresses the short distance sensitivity. Departures
from universality are equivalent to extracting information on the model nucleon
structure.
