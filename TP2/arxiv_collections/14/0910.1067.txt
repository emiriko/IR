We consider the radiation of photons from quarks scattering on color-magnetic
monopoles in the Quark-Gluon Plasma. We consider a temperature regime
$T\gsim2T_c$, where monopoles can be considered as static, rare objects
embedded into matter consisting mostly of the usual "electric" quasiparticles,
quarks and gluons. The calculation is performed in the classical,
non-relativistic approximation and results are compared to photon emission from
Coulomb scattering of quarks, known to provide a significant contribution to
the photon emission rates from QGP. The present study is a first step towards
understanding whether this scattering process can give a sizeable contribution
to dilepton production in heavy-ion collisions. Our results are encouraging: by
comparing the magnitudes of the photon emission rate for the two processes, we
find a dominance in the case of quark-monopole scattering. Our results display
strong sensitivity to finite densities of quarks and monopoles.
