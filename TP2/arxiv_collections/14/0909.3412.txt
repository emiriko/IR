Based on prototypical example of Al.Zamolodchikov's recursion relations for
the four point conformal block and using recently proposed
Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa (AGT) conjecture, recursion relations are derived for
the generalized prepotential of ${\cal N}=2$ SYM with $f=0,1,2,3,4$ (anti)
fundamental or an adjoint hypermultiplets. In all cases the large expectation
value limit is derived explicitly. A precise relationship between generic
1-point conformal block on torus and specific 4-point conformal block on sphere
is established. In view of AGT conjecture this translates into a relation
between partition functions with an adjoint and 4 fundamental hypermultiplets.
