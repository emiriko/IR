Charmonium suppression in hot and dense nuclear matter has been argued to be
a signature for the production of the quark gluon plasma (QGP). In order to
search for this effect in heavy ion collisions one must have a clear
understanding of all the factors that can contribute to such a suppression.
These may include shadowing of the partons in a nuclear environment, breakup of
a correlated $c-\bar{c}$ pair as it traverses the nuclear fragment, suppression
of feed-down from higher mass states as well as other initial state
interactions. In order to disentangle these effects one must measure charmonium
production rates in both proton+proton (p+p) and proton+nucleus (p+A)
collisions. The p+p collisions serve as a baseline for searching for
suppression compared to binary scaling predictions, allow one to quantify the
amount of feed-down from higher states as well as serve as a tool to
distinguish between different theoretical calculations for charmonium
production mechanisms. In order to quantify nuclear effects it is also
necessary to study charmonium production in p+A collisions where the
temperature and density of the system are low compared to a heavy ion
collision. These measurements allow one to determine the influence of nuclear
shadowing and breakup in "cold" nuclear matter which can be extrapolated to
heavy ion collisions in order to determine the amount anomalous suppression. Of
course, extrapolations that rely on a model based technique depend heavily on
the assumption of a production mechanism, a fact that reinforces the importance
of the p+p measurements...
