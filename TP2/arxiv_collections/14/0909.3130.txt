We report on the creation of new lasing modes with spatially nonuniform
distributions of optical gain in a one-dimensional random structure. It is
demonstrated numerically that even without gain saturation and mode
competition, the spatial nonuniformity of gain can cause dramatic and
complicated changes of lasing modes. New modes appear with frequencies in
between those of the lasing modes with uniform gain. We examine some new lasing
modes in detail and find they exhibit high output directionality. Our results
show that the random lasing properties may be modified significantly without
changing the underlying structures.
