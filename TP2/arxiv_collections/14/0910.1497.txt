We present a fluid dynamics video showing simulations of flexible bodies
flapping and falling in an inviscid fluid. Vortex sheets are shed from the
trailing edges of the bodies according to the Kutta condition. For interacting
flags, a sampling of synchronous and asynchronous states are shown. For falling
flexible sheets, the basic behavior is a repeated series of accelerations to a
critical speed at which the sheet buckles, and rapidly decelerates, shedding
large vortices. Examples of persistent circling, quasi-periodic flapping, and
more complex trajectories are shown.
