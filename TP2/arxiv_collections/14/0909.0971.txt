The two most recent and precise measurements of the charged kaon mass use
X-rays from kaonic atoms and report uncertainties of 14 ppm and 22 ppm yet
differ from each other by 122 ppm. We describe the possibility of an
independent mass measurement using the measurement of Cherenkov light from a
narrow-band beam of kaons, pions, and protons. This technique was demonstrated
using data taken opportunistically by the Main Injector Particle Production
experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory which recorded beams of
protons, kaons, and pions ranging in momentum from +37 GeV/c to +63 GeV/c. The
measured value is 491.3 +/- 1.7 MeV/c^2, which is within 1.4 sigma of the world
average. An improvement of two orders of magnitude in precision would make this
technique useful for resolving the ambiguity in the X-ray data and may be
achievable in a dedicated experiment.
