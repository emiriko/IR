We consider the spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat, non-vacuum
Einstein equations, using as matter model a collisionless gas as described by
the Vlasov equation. We find explicit conditions on the initial data which
guarantee the formation of a trapped surface in the evolution which in
particular implies that weak cosmic censorship holds for these data. We also
analyze the evolution of solutions after a trapped surface has formed and we
show that the event horizon is future complete. Furthermore we find that the
apparent horizon and the event horizon do not coincide. This behavior is
analogous to what is found in certain Vaidya spacetimes. The analysis is
carried out in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates.
