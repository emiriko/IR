Supernovae (SNe) are stellar explosions driven by gravitational or
thermonuclear energy, observed as electromagnetic radiation emitted over weeks
or more. In all known SNe, this radiation comes from internal energy deposited
in the outflowing ejecta by either radioactive decay of freshly-synthesized
elements (typically 56Ni), stored heat deposited by the explosion shock in the
envelope of a supergiant star, or interaction between the SN debris and
slowly-moving, hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. Here we report on a new
class of luminous SNe whose observed properties cannot be explained by any of
these known processes. These include four new SNe we have discovered, and two
previously unexplained events (SN 2005ap; SCP 06F6) that we can now identify as
members. These SNe are all ~10 times brighter than SNe Ia, do not show any
trace of hydrogen, emit significant ultra-violet (UV) flux for extended periods
of time, and have late-time decay rates which are inconsistent with
radioactivity. Our data require that the observed radiation is emitted by
hydrogen-free material distributed over a large radius (~10^15 cm) and
expanding at high velocities (>10^4 km s^-1). These long-lived, UV-luminous
events can be observed out to redshifts z>4 and offer an excellent opportunity
to study star formation in, and the interstellar medium of, primitive distant
galaxies.
