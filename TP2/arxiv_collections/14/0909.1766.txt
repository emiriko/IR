R is a numerical computing environment that is widely popular for statistical
data analysis. Like many such environments, R performs poorly for large
datasets whose sizes exceed that of physical memory. We present our vision of
RIOT (R with I/O Transparency), a system that makes R programs I/O-efficient in
a way transparent to the users. We describe our experience with RIOT-DB, an
initial prototype that uses a relational database system as a backend. Despite
the overhead and inadequacy of generic database systems in handling array data
and numerical computation, RIOT-DB significantly outperforms R in many
large-data scenarios, thanks to a suite of high-level, inter-operation
optimizations that integrate seamlessly into R. While many techniques in RIOT
are inspired by databases (and, for RIOT-DB, realized by a database system),
RIOT users are insulated from anything database related. Compared with previous
approaches that require users to learn new languages and rewrite their programs
to interface with a database, RIOT will, we believe, be easier to adopt by the
majority of the R users.
