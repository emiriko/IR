The difference between the CP asymmetries of the $B^0 \to K^+ \pi^-$ and $B^+
\to K^+ \pi^0$ decays has been recently confirmed with an evidence larger than
$5\sigma$'s. We discuss it as a possible signal of new physics associated with
new (large) CP violation in the electroweak penguin contributions. We propose a
supersymmetry breaking scheme where such new sources of CP violation occur in
the flavor non-universal trilinear scalar couplings.
