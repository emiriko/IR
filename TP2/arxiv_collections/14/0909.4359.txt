We present a novel sparse signal reconstruction method "ISD", aiming to
achieve fast reconstruction and a reduced requirement on the number of
measurements compared to the classical l_1 minimization approach. ISD addresses
failed reconstructions of l_1 minimization due to insufficient measurements. It
estimates a support set I from a current reconstruction and obtains a new
reconstruction by solving the minimization problem \min{\sum_{i\not\in
I}|x_i|:Ax=b}, and it iterates these two steps for a small number of times. ISD
differs from the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method, as well as its
variants, because (i) the index set I in ISD is not necessarily nested or
increasing and (ii) the minimization problem above updates all the components
of x at the same time. We generalize the Null Space Property to Truncated Null
Space Property and present our analysis of ISD based on the latter.
  We introduce an efficient implementation of ISD, called threshold--ISD, for
recovering signals with fast decaying distributions of nonzeros from
compressive sensing measurements. Numerical experiments show that
threshold--ISD has significant advantages over the classical l_1 minimization
approach, as well as two state--of--the--art algorithms: the iterative
reweighted l_1 minimization algorithm (IRL1) and the iterative reweighted
least--squares algorithm (IRLS).
