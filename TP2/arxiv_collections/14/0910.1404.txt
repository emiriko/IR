LSCS is a satellite workshop of the international conference on principles
and practice of Constraint Programming (CP), since 2004. It is devoted to local
search techniques in constraint satisfaction, and focuses on all aspects of
local search techniques, including: design and implementation of new
algorithms, hybrid stochastic-systematic search, reactive search optimization,
adaptive search, modeling for local-search, global constraints, flexibility and
robustness, learning methods, and specific applications.
