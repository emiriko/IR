Let $\H^{n+1}$ denote the $n + 1$-dimensional (real) hyperbolic space. Let
$\s^{n}$ denote the conformal boundary of the hyperbolic space. The group of
conformal diffeomorphisms of $\s^n$ is denoted by $M (n)$. Let $M_o (n)$ be its
identity component which consists of all orientation-preserving elements in $M
(n)$. The conjugacy classification of isometries in $M_o (n)$ depends on the
conjugacy of $T$ and $T^{-1}$ in $M_o (n)$. For an element $T$ in $M (n)$, $T$
and $T^{-1}$ are conjugate in $M (n)$, but they may not be conjugate in $M_o
(n)$. In the literature, $T$ is called real if $T$ is conjugate in $M_o (n)$ to
$T^{-1}$. In this paper we classify real elements in $M_o (n)$.
  Let $T$ be an element in $M_o(n)$. Corresponding to $T$ there is an
associated element $T_o$ in $SO(n+1)$. If the complex conjugate eigenvalues of
$T_o$ are given by $\{e^{i\theta_j}, e^{-i\theta_j}\}$, $0 < \theta_j \leq
\pi$, $j=1,...,k$, then $\{\theta_1,...,\theta_k\}$ are called the
\emph{rotation angles} of $T$. If the rotation angles of $T$ are distinct from
each-other, then $T$ is called a \emph{regular} element. After classifying the
real elements in $M_o (n)$ we have parametrized the conjugacy classes of
regular elements in $M_o (n)$. In the parametrization, when $T$ is not
conjugate to $T^{-1}$, we have enlarged the group and have considered the
conjugacy class of $T$ in $M (n)$. We prove that each such conjugacy class can
be induced with a fibration structure.
