We apply tomography, a general method for reconstructing 3-D distributions
from multiple projections, to reconstruct the momentum distribution of
electrons produced via strong field photoionization. The projections are
obtained by rotating the electron distribution via the polarization of the
ionizing laser beam and recording a momentum spectrum at each angle with a 2-D
velocity map imaging spectrometer. For linearly polarized light the tomographic
reconstruction agrees with the distribution obtained using an Abel inversion.
Electron tomography, which can be applied to any polarization, will simplify
the technology of electron imaging. The method can be directly generalized to
other charged particles.
