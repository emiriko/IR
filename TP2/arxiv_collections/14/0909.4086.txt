The combination of the SDSS and the Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP)
currently offers the largest and most homogeneously selected sample of nearby
galaxies for investigating the relation between X-ray nuclear emission, nebular
line-emission, black hole masses, and properties of the associated stellar
populations. We present here novel constraints that both X-ray luminosity Lx
and X-ray spectral energy distribution bring to the galaxy evolutionary
sequence H II -> Seyfert/Transition Object -> LINER -> Passive suggested by
optical data. In particular, we show that both Lx and Gamma, the slope of the
power-law that best fits the 0.5 - 8 keV spectra, are consistent with a clear
decline in the accretion power along the sequence, corresponding to a softening
of their spectra. This implies that, at z ~ 0, or at low luminosity AGN levels,
there is an anti-correlation between Gamma and L/Ledd, opposite to the trend
exhibited by high z AGN (quasars). The turning point in the Gamma -L/Ledd LLAGN
+ quasars relation occurs near Gamma ~ 1.5 and L/Ledd ~ 0.01. Interestingly,
this is identical to what stellar mass X-ray binaries exhibit, indicating that
we have probably found the first empirical evidence for an intrinsic switch in
the accretion mode, from advection-dominated flows to standard (disk/corona)
accretion modes in supermassive black hole accretors, similar to what has been
seen and proposed to happen in stellar mass black hole systems. The
anti-correlation we find between Gamma and L/Ledd may instead indicate that
stronger accretion correlates with greater absorption. Therefore the trend for
softer spectra toward more luminous, high redshift, and strongly accreting
AGN/quasars could simply be the result of strong selection biases reflected in
the dearth of type 2 quasar detections.
