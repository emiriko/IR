The breaking of time-reversal symmetry in a triplet superconductor Josephson
junction is shown to cause a magnetic instability of the tunneling barrier.
Using a Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the free energy, we predict that this novel
functional behaviour reflects the formation of an exotic Josephson state,
distinguished by the existence of fractional flux quanta at the barrier. The
crucial role of the orbital pairing state is demonstrated by studying
complementary microscopic models of the junction. Signatures of the magnetic
instability are found in the critical current of the junction.
