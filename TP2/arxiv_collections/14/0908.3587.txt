Blaster worm of 2003 is still persistent, the infection appears to have
successfully transitioned to new hosts as the original systems are cleaned or
shut off, suggesting that the Blaster worm, and other similar worms, will
remain significant Internet threats for many years after their initial release.
This paper is to propose technique on tracing the Blaster attack from various
logs in different OSI layers based on fingerprint of Blaster attack on victim
logs, attacker logs and IDS alert log. The researchers intended to do a
preliminary investigation upon this particular attack so that it can be used
for further research in alert correlation and computer forensic investigation.
