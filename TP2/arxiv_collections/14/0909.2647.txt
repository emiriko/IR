Following our previous work, we study the quantum phase transitions which
spontaneously develop ferromagnetic spin order in helical fermi liquids which
breaks continuous spin-space rotation symmetry, with application to the edge
states of 3d topological band insulators. With finite fermi surface, the
critical point has both z = 3 over-damped and z = 2 propagating quantum
critical modes, and the z = 3 mode will lead to non-fermi liquid behavior on
the entire fermi surface. In the ordered phase, the Goldstone mode is
over-damped unless it propagates along special directions, and quasiparticle is
ill defined on most parts of the fermi surface except for special points.
Generalizations of our results to other systems with spin-orbit couplings are
also discussed.
