Using a recently developed formalism, we present an in-depth analysis of how
the thermodynamics of the climate system varies with CO2 concentration by
performing experiments with a simplified yet Earth-like climate model. We find
that, in addition to the globally averaged surface temperature, the intensity
of the Lorenz energy cycle, the Carnot efficiency, the entropy production and
the degree of irreversibility of the system are linear with the logarithm of
the CO2 concentration. The generalized sensitivities proposed here suggest that
the climate system becomes less efficient, more irreversible, and features
higher entropy production as it becomes warmer.
