In this paper, we propose a novel approach to group users according to the
VoD user request pattern. We cluster the user requests based on ART1 neural
network algorithm. The knowledge extracted from the cluster is used to prefetch
the multimedia object from each cluster before the users request. We have
developed an algorithm to cluster users according to the users request patterns
based on ART1 neural network algorithm that offers an unsupervised clustering.
This approach adapts to changes in user request patterns over period without
losing previous information. Each cluster is represented as prototype vector by
generalizing the most frequently used URLs that are accessed by all the cluster
members. The simulation results of our proposed clustering and prefetching
algorithm, shows enormous increase in the performance of streaming server. Our
algorithm helps the servers agent to learn user preferences and discover the
information about the corresponding sources and other similar interested
individuals.
