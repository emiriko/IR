Using a high-statistics sample of neutral current elastic neutrino
interactions, MiniBooNE measured the flux-averaged neutral current elastic
differential cross-section on mineral oil ($CH_2$). Using the latter, a
$\chi^2$ test of MC with different values of the axial vector mass has been
performed. Also, a possibility of using a sample of neutral current elastic
proton-enriched events above Cherenkov threshold to measure the ratio $\nu p\to
\nu p /\nu N\to \nu N$ is discussed. This ratio is sensitive to the strange
quark contribution to the nucleon spin, $\Delta s$.
