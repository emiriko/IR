This overview presents a tutorial introduction to the theory of magnetic
plasma confinement in toroidal confinement systems with particular emphasis on
axisymmetric equilibrium geometries, and tokamaks. The discussion covers three
important aspects of plasma physics: Equilibrium, Stability, and Transport. The
section on equilibrium will go through an introduction to ideal
magnetohydrodynamics, curvilinear system of coordinates, flux coordinates,
extensions to axisymmetric equilibrium, Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE), Green's
function formalism, as well as analytical and numerical solutions to GSE. The
section on stability will address topics including Lyapunov Stability in
nonlinear systems, energy principle, modal analysis, and simplifications for
axisymmetric machines. The final section will consider transport in toroidal
systems. We present the flux-surface-averaged system of equations describing
classical and non-classical transport phenomena. Applications to the
small-sized high-aspect-ratio Damavand tokamak will be described.
