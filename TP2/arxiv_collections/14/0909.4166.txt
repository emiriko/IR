We show that the canonical phase measurement is pure in the sense that the
corresponding positive operator valued measure (POVM) is extremal in the convex
set of all POVMs. This means that the canonical phase measurement cannot be
interpreted as a noisy measurement, even if it is not a projection valued
measure.
