Young's and shear moduli and Poisson's ratio of polycrystalline solids
consisting of 2D quadratic and 3D cubic randomly oriented grains of the same
size and shape is studied. Considered polycrystals are initially unstrained. It
is shown that for such polycrystals the division of the mechanical stability
regions into areas of various auxeticity properties is different than for
monocrystalline solids. In particular the regions of complete auxeticity
enlarge.
