Methods to extract information from the tracking of mobile objects/particles
have broad interest in biological and physical sciences. Techniques based on
simple criteria of proximity in time-consecutive snapshots are useful to
identify the trajectories of the particles. However, they become problematic as
the motility and/or the density of the particles increases due to uncertainties
on the trajectories that particles followed during the images' acquisition
time. Here, we report an efficient method for learning parameters of the
dynamics of the particles from their positions in time-consecutive images. Our
algorithm belongs to the class of message-passing algorithms, known in computer
science, information theory and statistical physics as Belief Propagation (BP).
The algorithm is distributed, thus allowing parallel implementation suitable
for computations on multiple machines without significant inter-machine
overhead. We test our method on the model example of particle tracking in
turbulent flows, which is particularly challenging due to the strong transport
that those flows produce. Our numerical experiments show that the BP algorithm
compares in quality with exact Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithms, yet BP is
far superior in speed. We also suggest and analyze a random-distance model that
provides theoretical justification for BP accuracy. Methods developed here
systematically formulate the problem of particle tracking and provide fast and
reliable tools for its extensive range of applications.
