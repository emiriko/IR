This paper discusses advance of the research on Speleothem Paleoluminescence
Records of Environmental Changes after it have been first introduced by the
author 20 years ago. It is demonstrated that most of the progress in this field
was made in result of the operation of the International Program Luminescence
of Cave Minerals of the commission on Physical Chemistry and Hydrogeology of
Karst of UIS of UNESCO. Potential, resolution and limitations of high
resolution luminescence speleothem proxy records of Paleotemperature, Solar
Insolation, Solar Luminosity, Glaciations, Sea Level advances, Past
Precipitation, Plants Populations, Paleosoils, Past Karst Denudation, Chemical
Pollution, Geomagnetic field and Cosmic Rays Flux variations, Cosmogenic
Isotopes production and Supernova Eruptions in the Past, Advances of
Hydrothermal Waters, and Tectonic Uplift are discussed. It is demonstrated that
speleothems allow extremely high resolution (higher than in any other
paleoclimatic terrestrial archives) and long duration of records. Some
speleothems can be used as natural climatic stations for obtaining of
quantitative proxy records of Quaternary climates with annual resolution.
