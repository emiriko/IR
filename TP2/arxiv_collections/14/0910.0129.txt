A ray-optics model is proposed to describe the vector beam transformation in
a strongly focusing optical system. In contrast to usual approaches basing on
the focused field distribution near the focal plane, we employ the transformed
beam pattern formed immediately near the exit pupil. In this cross section,
details of the output field distribution are of minor physical interest but
proper allowance is made for transformation of the incident beam polarization
state. This enables to obtain the spin and orbital angular momentum
representations which are valid everywhere in the transformed beam space.
Simple analytical results are available for the transversely homogeneous
circularly polarized incident beam limited only by the circular aperture.
Behavior of the spin and orbital angular momenta of the output beam and their
dependences on the focusing strength (aperture angle) are analyzed. The
obtained analytical results are in good qualitative and reasonable quantitative
agreement to the calculation performed for the spatially inhomogeneous Gaussian
and Laguerre-Gaussian beams. In application to Laguerre-Gaussian beams, the
model provides possibility for analyzing the angular momentum transformation in
beams already possessing some mixture of the spin and orbital angular momenta.
The model supplies efficient and physically transparent means for qualitative
analysis of the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion. It can be
generalized to incident beams with complicated spatial and polarization
structure.
