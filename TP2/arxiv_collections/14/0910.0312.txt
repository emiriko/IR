Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a secure key generation method between two
distant parties by wisely exploiting properties of quantum mechanics. In QKD,
experimental measurement outcomes on quantum states are transformed by the two
parties to a secret key. This transformation is composed of many logical steps
(as guided by security proofs), which together will ultimately determine the
length of the final secret key and its security. We detail the procedure for
performing such classical post-processing taking into account practical
concerns (including the finite-size effect and authentication and encryption
for classical communications). This procedure is directly applicable to
realistic QKD experiments, and thus serves as a recipe that specifies what
post-processing operations are needed and what the security level is for
certain lengths of the keys. Our result is applicable to the BB84 protocol with
a single or entangled photon source.
