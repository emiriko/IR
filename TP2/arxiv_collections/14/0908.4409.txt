In this note, we explore the relation between crossing symmetry and modular
invariance in conformal field theory and S-duality in gauge theory. It is shown
that partition functions of different S dual theories of N=2 SU(2) gauge theory
with four fundamentals can be derived from the crossing symmetry of the
Liouville four point function. We also show that the partition function of N=4
SU(2) gauge theory can be derived from the Liouville partition function on
torus.
