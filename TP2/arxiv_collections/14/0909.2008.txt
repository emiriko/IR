We are undertaking an astrometric search for gas giant planets and brown
dwarfs orbiting nearby low mass dwarf stars with the 2.5-m du Pont telescope at
the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. We have built two specialized
astrometric cameras, the Carnegie Astrometric Planet Search Cameras (CAPSCam-S
and CAPSCam-N), using two Teledyne Hawaii-2RG HyViSI arrays, with the cameras'
design having been optimized for high accuracy astrometry of M dwarf stars. We
describe two independent CAPSCam data reduction approaches and present a
detailed analysis of the observations to date of one of our target stars, NLTT
48256. Observations of NLTT 48256 taken since July 2007 with CAPSCam-S imply
that astrometric accuracies of around 0.3 milliarcsec per hour are achievable,
sufficient to detect a Jupiter-mass companion orbiting 1 AU from a late M dwarf
10 pc away with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 4. We plan to follow about 100
nearby (primarily within about 10 pc) low mass stars, principally late M, L,
and T dwarfs, for 10 years or more, in order to detect very low mass companions
with orbital periods long enough to permit the existence of habitable,
Earth-like planets on shorter-period orbits. These stars are generally too
faint and red to be included in ground-based Doppler planet surveys, which are
often optimized for FGK dwarfs. The smaller masses of late M dwarfs also yield
correspondingly larger astrometric signals for a given mass planet. Our search
will help to determine whether gas giant planets form primarily by core
accretion or by disk instability around late M dwarf stars.
