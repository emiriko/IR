Recently we proposed a theory of point-contact spectroscopy and argued that
the splitting of zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) in electron-doped cuprate
superconductor point-contact spectroscopy is due to the coexistence of
antiferromagnetic (AF) and d-wave superconducting orders [Phys. Rev. B {\bf
76}, 220504(R) (2007)]. Here we extend the theory to study the tunneling in the
ferromagnetic metal/electron-doped cuprate superconductor (FM/EDSC) junctions.
In addition to the AF order, the effects of spin polarization, Fermi-wave
vector mismatch (FWM) between the FM and EDSC regions, and effective barrier
are investigated. It is shown that there exits midgap surface state (MSS)
contribution to the conductance to which Andreev reflections are largely
modified due to the interplay between the exchange field of ferromagnetic metal
and the AF order in EDSC. Low-energy anomalous conductance enhancement can
occur which could further test the existence of AF order in EDSC. Finally, we
propose a more accurate formula in determining the spin polarization value in
combination with the point-contact conductance data.
