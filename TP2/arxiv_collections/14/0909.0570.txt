Let G be a locally analytic group and H < G - a locally analytic subgroup.
The main result is the condition (similar to Frommer-Orlik-Strauch theorem) for
induction of locally analytic H-representation to G to be irreducible. Also
this paper contains a (new) series of locally analytic representations which do
not arise in this way.
