We present coherent speckled x-ray diffraction patterns obtained from a
monolayer of surface atoms. We measured both the specular anti-Bragg reflection
and the off-specular hexagonal reconstruction peak for the Au (0 0 1) surface
reconstruction. We observed fluctuations of the speckle patterns even when the
integrated intensity appears static. By auto-correlating the speckle patterns,
we were able to identify two qualitatively different surface dynamic behaviors
of the hex reconstruction depending on the sample temperature.
