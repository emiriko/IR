We report the first results of our programme to obtain multi-epoch radial
velocity measurements of stars with a strong far-UV excess to identify post
common-envelope binaries (PCEBs). The targets have been identified using
optical photometry from SDSS DR4, ultraviolet photometry from GALEX GR2 and
proper motion information from SDSS DR5. We have obtained spectra at two or
more epochs for 36 targets. Three of our targets show large radial velocity
shifts (>50km/s) on a timescale of hours or days and are almost certainly
PCEBs. For one of these targets (SDSS J104234.77+644205.4) we have obtained
further spectroscopy to confirm that this is a PCEB with an orbital period of
4.74h and semi-amplitude K =165 km/s. Two targets are rapidly rotating K-dwarfs
which appear to show small radial velocity shifts and have strong Ca II H+K
emission lines. These may be wind-induced rapidly rotating (WIRRing) stars.
These results show that we can use GALEX and SDSS photometry to identify PCEBs
that cannot be identified using SDSS photometry alone, and to identify new
WIRRing stars. A more comprehensive survey of stars identified using the
methods developed in this paper will lead to a much improved understanding of
common envelope evolution.
