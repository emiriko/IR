From 2004 to 2007 the Business In the Grid (BIG) project took place and was
driven by the following goals: Firstly, make business aware of Grid technology
and, secondly, try to explore new business models. We disseminated Grid
computing by mainly concentrating on the central European market and
interviewed several companies in order to gain insights into the Grid
acceptance in industrial environments. In this article we present the results
of the project, elaborate on a critical discussion on business adaptations, and
describe a novel dynamic authorization workflow for business processes in the
Grid.
