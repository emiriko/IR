The Higgs mechanism for gravity, as proposed by 't Hooft in arXiv:0708.3184
[hep-th], can be augmented by including determinantal invariants. We analyze
the effects of determinantal invariants in such a set up. We find that the part
of the potential that depends on the determinantal invariants, if obtains a
specific exponential form in terms of its argument, may not affect the graviton
mass calculated.
