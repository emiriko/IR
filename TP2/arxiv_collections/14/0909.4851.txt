We present a way of experimentally determining the concurrence in terms of
the expectation values of local observables for arbitrary multipartite pure
states. In stead of the joint measurements on two copies of a state in the
experiment for two-qubit systems [S. P. Walborn et al. Nature (London)440,
20(2006)], we only need one copy of the state in every measurement for any
arbitrary dimensional multipartite systems, avoiding the preparation of twin
states or the imperfect copy of the state.
