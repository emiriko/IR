The summation of the small x corrections to hard scattering QCD amplitudes by
collinear factorisation method is reconsidered and the K-factor is derived in
leading log x approximation. The corresponding expression by Catani and
Hautmann (1994) has to be corrected. The significance of the correction is
demonstrated in the examples of structure function F_L and of exclusive
electroproduction.
