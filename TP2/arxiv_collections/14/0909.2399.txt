Spectra of heavy-light meson are studied using potential model and
thermofield dynamics prescription. The mass spectra of different heavy-light
mesons are calculated at different temperatures and compared with those at T=0.
It is found that the binding mass of heavy-light meson decreases as temperature
increases.
