The parity nonconservation effect on the radiative recombination of electrons
with heavy hydrogenlike ions is studied. Calculations are performed for the
recombination into the $2^1S_0$ state of helium-like thorium and gadolinium,
where, due to the near-degeneracy of the opposite-parity $2^1S_0$ and $2^3P_0$
states, the effect is strongly enhanced. Two scenarios for possible experiments
are studied. In the first scenario, the electron beam is assumed to be fully
polarized while the H-like ions are unpolarized and the polarization of the
emitted photons is not detected. In the second scenario, the linearly polarized
photons are detected in an experiment with unpolarized electrons and ions.
Corresponding calculations for the recombination into the $2^3P_0$ state are
presented as well.
