The properties of the phonon-induced interaction between electrons are
studied using the local density approximation (LDA). Restricting the electron
momenta to the Fermi surface we find generally that this interaction has a
pronounced peak for large momentum transfers and that the interband
contributions between bonding and antibonding band are of the same magnitude as
the intraband ones. Results are given for various symmetry averages of this
interaction over the Fermi surface. In particular, we find that the
dimensionless coupling constant in the d-wave channel $\lambda^d$, relevant for
superconductivity, is only 0.022, i.e., even about ten times smaller than the
small value of the s-wave channel. Similarly, the LDA contribution to the
resistivity is about a factor 10 times smaller than the observed resistivity
suggesting that phonons are not the important low-energy excitations in
high-T$_c$ oxides.
