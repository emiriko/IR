We analyse, by doing very simple calculations, the internal degree of freedom
leading to the de Broglie frequency associated to a material particle, as well,
the confinement of quarks provided both by the Cornell potential and by the MIT
bag model.We propose that the driving forces behind these confining models
could be originated in the fluctuations of the metric, namely the particle
interacting self-gravitationally, when its mass fluctuates in position throught
of a distance equal to the Planck length.
