Specific heat studies of CeRhIn5 as functions of pressure and magnetic field
have been used to explore the relationship between magnetism and unconventional
superconductivity, both of which involve the 4f electron of Ce. Results of
these studies cannot be understood as a simple competition for Fermi-surface
states and require a new conceptual framework.
