Effects of correlated disorder on wave localization have attracted
considerable interest. Motivated by the importance of studies of quantum
transport in rough nanowires, here we examine how colored surface roughness
impacts the conductance of two-dimensional quantum waveguides, using direct
scattering calculations based on the reaction matrix approach. The
computational results are analyzed in connection with a theoretical relation
between the localization length and the structure factor of correlated
disorder. We also examine and discuss several cases that have not been treated
theoretically or are beyond the validity regime of available theories. Results
indicate that conductance properties of quantum wires are controllable via
colored surface disorder.
