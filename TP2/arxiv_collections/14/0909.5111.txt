Measuring the muon anomalous magnetic moment g-2 and the rare decays of light
pseudoscalar mesons into lepton pair P \to l+l- serve as important test of the
standard model. To reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the standard model
predictions the data on the transition form factors of light pseudoscalar
mesons play significant role. Recently new data on behavior of these form
factors at large momentum transfer was supplied by the BABAR collaboration. We
comment on the (in)consistency of these data with perturbative QCD expectation.
