The generation of non-classical states of light via photon blockade with
time-modulated input is analyzed. We show that improved single photon
statistics can be obtained by adequately choosing the parameters of the driving
laser pulses. An alternative method, where the system is driven via a
continuous wave laser and the frequency of the dipole is controlled (e.g.
electrically) at very fast timescales is presented.
