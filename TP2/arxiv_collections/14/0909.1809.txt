Outbursts from active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect the hot atmospheres of
isolated giant elliptical galaxies (gE's), as well as those in groups and
clusters of galaxies. Chandra observations of a sample of nearby gE's show that
the average power of AGN outbursts is sufficient to stop their hot atmospheres
from cooling and forming stars, consistent with radio mode feedback models. The
outbursts are intermittent, with duty cycles that increases with size.
