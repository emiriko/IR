Relational particle mechanics is useful for modelling whole-universe issues
such as quantum cosmology or the problem of time in quantum gravity, including
some aspects outside the reach of comparably complex minisuperspace models. In
this article, we consider the mechanics of pure shape and not scale of 4
particles on a line, so that the only physically significant quantities are
ratios of relative separations between the constituents' physical objects. Many
of our ideas and workings extend to the N-particle case. As such models'
configurations resemble depictions of metro lines in public transport maps, we
term them `N-stop metrolands'. This 4-stop model's configuration space is a
2-sphere, from which our metroland mechanics interpretation is via the `cubic'
tessellation. This model yields conserved quantities which are mathematically
SO(3) objects like angular momenta but are physically relative dilational
momenta (i.e. coordinates dotted with momenta). We provide and interpret
various exact and approximate classical and quantum solutions for 4-stop
metroland; from these results one can construct expectations and spreads of
shape operators that admit interpretations as relative sizes and the
`homogeneity of the model universe's contents', and also objects of
significance for the problem of time in quantum gravity (e.g. in the naive
Schrodinger and records theory timeless approaches).
