The role of null-point reconnection in a 3D numerical MHD model of solar
emerging flux is investigated. The model consists of a twisted magnetic flux
tube rising through a stratified convection zone and atmosphere to interact and
reconnect with a horizontal overlying magnetic field in the atmosphere. Null
points appear as the reconnection begins and persist throughout the rest of the
emergence, where they can be found mostly in the model photosphere and
transition region, forming two loose clusters on either side of the emerging
flux tube. Up to 26 nulls are present at any one time, and tracking in time
shows that there is a total of 305 overall, despite the initial simplicity of
the magnetic field configuration. We find evidence for the reality of the nulls
in terms of their methods of creation and destruction, their balance of signs,
their long lifetimes, and their geometrical stability. We then show that due to
the low parallel electric fields associated with the nulls, null-point
reconnection is not the main type of magnetic reconnection involved in the
interaction of the newly emerged flux with the overlying field. However, the
large number of nulls implies that the topological structure of the magnetic
field must be very complex and the importance of reconnection along separators
or separatrix surfaces for flux emergence cannot be ruled out.
