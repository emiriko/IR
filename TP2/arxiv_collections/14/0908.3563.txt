We present comprehensive results on the edge-mode velocities in a quantum
Hall droplet with realistic interaction and confinement at various filling
fractions. We demonstrate that the charge-mode velocity scales roughly with the
valence Landau level filling fraction and the Coulomb energy in the
corresponding Landau level. At Landau level filling fraction nu = 5/2, the
stark difference between the bosonic charge-mode velocity and the fermionic
neutral-mode velocity can manifest itself in the thermal smearing of the
non-Abelian quasiparticle interference. We estimate the dependence of the
coherence temperature on the confining potential strength, which may be tunable
experimentally to enhance the non-Abelian state.
