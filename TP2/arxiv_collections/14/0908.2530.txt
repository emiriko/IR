In this talk we present results on the chiral and the deconfinement
transition of quenched QCD from Dyson-Schwinger equations. We determine the
ordinary quark condensate signaling the chiral transition and the dual quark
condensate signaling the deconfinement transition from the Landau gauge quark
propagator evaluated at generalized boundary conditions. We find only slightly
different transition temperatures at finite quark masses, whereas the
transition temperatures coincide in the chiral limit.
