In this conference proceedings article I summarize the recent work of Murphy
(2009) which presents physically motivated predictions for the evolution of the
Far-Infrared--radio correlation as a function of redshift arising from
variations in the cosmic-ray (CR) electron cooling time-scales as Inverse
Compton (IC) scattering off of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) becomes
increasingly important. Since the non-thermal component of a galaxy's radio
continuum is increasingly suppressed with redshift, radio continuum
measurements at moderately high frequency ($\sim$10 GHz) become one of the
cleanest ways to quantify the star formation activity of galaxies at high
redshifts unbiased by dust. Given the focus of the conference, extra emphasis
placed on what this may mean for deep radio continuum surveys using next
generation radio facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).
