We analyze the surface structure of the planet host star CoRoT-2a using a
consistent model for both the `global' (i.e., rotationally modulated)
lightcurve and the transit lightcurves, using data provided by the CoRoT
mission. Selecting a time interval covering two stellar rotations and six
transits of the planetary companion CoRoT-2b, we adopt a `strip' model of the
surface to reproduce the photometric modulation inside and outside the transits
simultaneously. Our reconstructions show that it is possible to achieve
appropriate fits for the entire sub-interval using a low-resolution surface
model with 36 strips. The surface reconstructions indicate that the brightness
on the eclipsed section of the stellar surface is (6 +/- 1) % lower than the
average brightness of the remaining surface. This result suggests a
concentration of stellar activity in a band around the stellar equator similar
to the behavior observed on the Sun.
