We study the classification of ultrametric spaces based on their small scale
geometry (uniform homeomorphism), large scale geometry (coarse equivalence) and
both (all scale uniform equivalences). We prove that these equivalences can be
characterized with parallel constructions using a combinatoric tool called
common zig-zag chain.
