We establish several results concerning tensor products, q-characters, and
the block decomposition of the category of finite-dimensional representations
of quantum affine algebras in the root of unity setting. In the generic case, a
Weyl module is isomorphic to a tensor product of fundamental representations
and this isomorphism was essential for establishing the block decomposition
theorem. This is no longer true in the root of unity setting. We overcome the
lack of such a tool by utilizing results on specialization of modules.
Furthermore, we establish a sufficient condition for a Weyl module to be a
tensor product of fundamental representations and prove that this condition is
also necessary when the underlying simple Lie algebra is sl(2). We also study
the braid group invariance of q-characters of fundamental representations.
