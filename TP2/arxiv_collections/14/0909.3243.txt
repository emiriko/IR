We report on conductance measurements in carbon nanotube based double quantum
dots connected to two normal electrodes and a central superconducting finger.
By operating our devices as beam splitters, we provide evidence for Crossed
Andreev Reflections \textit{tunable in situ}. This opens an avenue to more
sophisticated quantum optics-like experiments with spin entangled electrons.
