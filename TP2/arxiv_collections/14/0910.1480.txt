We present a set of predictions for weak lensing correlation functions in the
context of modified gravity models, including a prescription for the impact of
the nonlinear power spectrum regime in these models. We consider the DGP and
f(R) models, together with dark energy models with the same expansion history.
We use the requirement that gravity is close to GR on small scales to estimate
the non-linear power for these models. We then calculate weak lensing
statistics, showing their behaviour as a function of scale and redshift, and
present predictions for measurement accuracy with future lensing surveys,
taking into account cosmic variance and galaxy shape noise. We demonstrate the
improved discriminatory power of weak lensing for testing modified gravities
once the nonlinear power spectrum contribution has been included. We also
examine the ability of future lensing surveys to constrain a parameterisation
of the non-linear power spectrum, including sensitivity to the growth factor.
