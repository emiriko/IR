Using the results on the electromagnetic pion Form Factor (FF) obtained in
the $O(\alpha_s)$ QCD sum rules with non-local condensates \cite{BPS09} we
determine the effective continuum threshold for the local duality approach.
Then we apply it to construct the $O(\alpha_s^2)$ estimation of the pion FF in
the framework of the fractional analytic perturbation theory.
