We present a high-resolution spectrum of a microlensed G dwarf in the
Galactic bulge with spectroscopic temperature T_eff = 5600 +/- 180 K. This I~21
mag star was magnified by a factor ranging from 1160 to 1300 at the time of
observation. Its high metallicity ([Fe/H] = 0.33 +/- 0.15) places this star at
the upper end of the bulge giant metallicity distribution. Using a K-S test, we
find a 1.6% probability that the published microlensed bulge dwarfs share an
underlying distribution with bulge giants, properly accounting for a radial
bulge metallicity gradient. We obtain abundance measurements for 15 elements
and perform a rigorous error analysis that includes covariances between
parameters. This star, like bulge giants with the same metallicity, shows no
alpha enhancement. It confirms the chemical abundance trends observed in
previously analyzed bulge dwarfs. At supersolar metallicities, we observe a
discrepancy between bulge giant and bulge dwarf Na abundances.
