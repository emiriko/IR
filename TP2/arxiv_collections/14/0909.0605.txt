The first passage time (FPT) distribution for random walk in complex networks
is calculated through an asymptotic analysis. For network with size $N$ and
short relaxation time $\tau\ll N$, the computed mean first passage time (MFPT),
which is inverse of the decay rate of FPT distribution, is inversely
proportional to the degree of the destination. These results are verified
numerically for the paradigmatic networks with excellent agreement. We show
that the range of validity of the analytical results covers networks that have
short relaxation time and high mean degree, which turn out to be valid to many
real networks.
