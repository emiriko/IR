The Boussinesq model of convection in a flat layer with heating from below is
considered. We analyze the effects of anisotropy caused by rapid rotation in
physical and wave spaces and demonstrate the suppression of energy transfer by
rotation. We also examine the structure of the wave triangle in nonlinear
interaction. The range of parameters is adapted to the models of convection in
the geodynamo.
