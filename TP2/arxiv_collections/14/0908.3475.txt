Given a brane tiling, that is, a bipartite graph on a torus, we can associate
with it a singular 3-Calabi-Yau variety. In this paper we study its commutative
and non-commutative crepant resolutions. We give an explicit toric description
of all its commutative crepant resolutions. We also explain how the McKay
correspondence in dimension 3 can be interpreted using brane tilings.
