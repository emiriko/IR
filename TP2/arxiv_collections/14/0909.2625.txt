We report the nematic and smectic ordering in a new aqueous suspension of
monolayer $\alpha$-Zirconium phosphate platelets possessing a high
polydispersity in diameter but uniform thickness. We observe an
isotropic--nematic transition as the platelet volume fraction increases,
followed by the formation of a smectic, an elusive phase that has been rarely
seen in discotic liquid crystals. The smectic phase is characterized by X-ray
diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and optical
microscopy. The phase equilibria in this highly polydisperse suspension is
rationalized in terms of a theoretical approach based on density--functional
theory.
