We consider the singlet scalar model of dark matter and study the expected
antiproton and positron signals from dark matter annihilations. The regions of
the viable parameter space of the model that are excluded by present data are
determined, as well as those regions that will be probed by the forthcoming
experiment AMS-02. In all cases, different propagation models are investigated,
and the possible enhancement due to dark matter substructures is analyzed. We
find that the antiproton signal is more easily detectable than the positron one
over the whole parameter space. For a typical propagation model and without any
boost factor, AMS-02 will be able to probe --via antiprotons-- the singlet
model of dark matter up to masses of 600 GeV. Antiprotons constitute,
therefore, a promising signal to constraint or detect the singlet scalar model.
