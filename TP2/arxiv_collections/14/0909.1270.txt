We study the hole probability of Gaussian random entire functions. More
specifically, we work with entire functions in Taylor series form with i.i.d
complex Gaussian coefficients. A hole is the event where the function has no
zeros in a disc of radius r. We find exact asymptotics for the rate of decay of
the hole probability for large values of r, outside a small exceptional set
(which is deterministic).
