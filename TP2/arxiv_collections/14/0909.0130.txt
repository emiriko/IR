Surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagation is a powerful method to investigate
2D electron systems. We show how SAW observables are influenced by coupling to
the 2D massless Dirac electrons of graphene and argue that Landau oscillations
can be observed as function of gate voltage for constant field. Contrary to
other transport measurements, the zero-field SAW propagation gives the wave
vector dependence of graphene conductivity for small wave numbers. We predict a
crossover from Schroedinger to Dirac like behaviour as a function of gate
voltage, with no attenuation in the latter for clean samples.
