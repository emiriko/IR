We discuss the fate of diffeomorphism symmetry in discrete gravity.
Diffeomorphism symmetry is typically broken by the discretization. This has
repercussions for the observable content and the canonical formulation of the
theory. It might however be possible to construct discrete actions, so--called
perfect actions, with exact symmetries and we will review first steps towards
this end.
