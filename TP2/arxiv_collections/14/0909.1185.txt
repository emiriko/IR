Substantial developments have been achieved in the synthesis of chemical
vapour deposition (CVD) diamond in recent years, providing engineers and
designers with access to a large range of new diamond materials. CVD diamond
has a number of outstanding material properties that can enable exceptional
performance in applications as diverse as medical diagnostics, water treatment,
radiation detection, high power electronics, consumer audio, magnetometry and
novel lasers. Often the material is synthesized in planar form, however
non-planar geometries are also possible and enable a number of key
applications. This article reviews the material properties and characteristics
of single crystal and polycrystalline CVD diamond, and how these can be
utilized, focusing particularly on optics, electronics and electrochemistry. It
also summarizes how CVD diamond can be tailored for specific applications,
based on the ability to synthesize a consistent and engineered high performance
product.
