We study the effects of spontaneous emission on the entanglement dynamics of
two qubits interacting with a common Lorentzian structured reservoir. We assume
that the qubits are initially prepared in a Bell-like state. We focus on the
strong coupling regime and study the entanglement dynamics for different
regions of the spontaneous emission decay parameter. This investigation allows
us to explore the cross-over between common and independent reservoirs in
entanglement dynamics.
