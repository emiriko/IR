We study the Kondo lattice model with additional attractive interaction
between the conduction electrons within the dynamical mean-field theory using
the numerical renormalization group to solve the effective quantum impurity
problem. In addition to normal-state and magnetic phases we also allow for the
occurrence of a superconducting phase. In the normal phase we observe a very
sensitive dependence of the low-energy scale on the conduction-electron
interaction. We discuss the dependence of the superconducting transition on the
interplay between attractive interaction and Kondo exchange.
