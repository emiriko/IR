We investigate bifurcation phenomena between slow and fast convergences of
synchronization errors arising in the proposed synchronization system
consisting of two identical nonlinear dynamical systems linked by a common
noisy input only. The numerical continuation of the saddle-node bifurcation set
of the primary resonance of moments provides an effective identifier of the
slow convergence of synchronization errors.
