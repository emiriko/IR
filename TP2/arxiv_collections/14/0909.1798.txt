We consider simple models based on core collapse or pair-formation supernovae
to account for the light curve of the transient SCP06F6. A radioactive decay
diffusion model provides estimates of the mass of the required radioactive
nickel and the ejecta as functions of the unknown redshift. An opacity change
such as by dust formation or a recombination front may account for the rapid
decline from maximum. We particularly investigate two specific redshifts:
$z=0.143$, for which Gaensicke et al. (2008) have proposed that the
unidentified broad absorption features in the spectrum of SCP06F6 are C$_{2}$
Swan bands, and $z=0.57$ based on a crude agreement with the Ca H&K and UV
iron-peak absorption features that are characteristic of supernovae of various
types. The ejected masses and kinetic energies are smaller for a more tightly
constrained model invoking envelope recombination. We also discuss the
possibilities of circumstellar matter (CSM) shell diffusion and shock
interaction models. In general, optically-thick CSM diffusion models can fit
the data with the underlying energy coming from an energetic buried supernova.
Models in which the CSM is of lower density so that the shock energy is both
rapidly thermalized and radiated tend not to be self-consistent. We suggest
that a model of SCP06F6 worth futher exploration is one in which the redshift
is $\sim$ 0.57, the spectral features are Ca and iron peak elements, and the
light curve is powered by the diffusive release of a substantial amount of
energy from nickel decay or from an energetic supernova buried in the ejecta of
an LBV-like event.
