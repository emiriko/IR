We present the kinematical properties, distribution of spectroscopic
subtypes, stellar population subcomponents of the white dwarfs within 20 pc of
the sun. We find no convincing evidence of halo white dwarfs in the total 20 pc
sample of 129 white dwarfs nor is there convincing evidence of genuine thick
disk subcomponent members within 20 parsecs. Virtually the entire 20 pc sample
likely belongs to the thin disk. The total DA to non-DA ratio of the 20 pc
sample is 1.6, a manifestation of deepening envelope convection which
transforms DA stars with sufficiently thin H surface layers into non-DAs. The
addition of 5 new stars to the 20 pc sample yields a revised local space
density of white dwarfs of $4.9\pm0.5 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\sun}$/yr and a
corresponding mass density of $3.3\pm0.3 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\sun}$/pc$^{3}$.
We find that at least 15% of the white dwarfs within 20 parsecs of the sun (the
DAZ and DZ stars) have photospheric metals that possibly originate from
accretion of circumstellar material (debris disks) around them. If this
interpretation is correct, this suggests the possibility that the same
percentage have planets or asteroid-like bodies orbiting them.
