We examine annihilation of light bosonic Dark Matter into pair of photons in
model-independent way. We consider the simplest generic Lagrangian describing
such process and then compare results to the available experimental data. Then
we match our results with particular Dark matter models and determine possible
constrains onto parameter space of those models.
