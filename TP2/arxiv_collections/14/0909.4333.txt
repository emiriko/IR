The fidelity, defined as overlap of eigenstates of two slightly different
Hamiltonians, is proposed as an efficient detector of avoided c rossings in the
energy spectrum. This new application of fidelity is motivated for model
systems, and its value for analyzing complex qua ntum spectra is underlined by
applying it to a random matrix model and a tilted Bose-Hubbard system.
