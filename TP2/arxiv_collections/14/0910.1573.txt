The theoretical need to study the properties of the Fe-based high-T_c
superconductors with reliable many-body techniques requires us to determine the
minimum number of orbital degrees of freedom that will capture the physics of
these materials. While the shape of the Fermi surface (FS) obtained with the
local density approximation (LDA) can be reproduced by a two-orbital model, it
has been argued that the bands that cross the chemical potential result from
the strong hybridization of three of the Fe 3d orbitals. For this reason, a
three-orbital Hamiltonian obtained with the Slater-Koster formalism by
considering the hybridization of the As p orbitals with the Fe d_xz,d_yz, and
d_xy orbitals is discussed here. This model reproduces qualitatively the FS
shape and orbital composition obtained by LDA calculations for undoped
pnictides when four electrons per Fe are considered. Within a mean-field
approximation, its magnetic and orbital properties in the undoped case are
described. With increasing Coulomb repulsion, four regimes are obtained: (1)
paramagnetic, (2) magnetic (pi,0) spin order, (3) the same (pi,0) spin order
but now including orbital order, and finally (4) a magnetic and orbital ordered
insulator. The spin-singlet pairing operators allowed by the lattice and
orbital symmetries are also constructed. It is found that for pairs of
electrons involving up to diagonal nearest-neighbors sites, the only fully
gapped and purely intraband spin-singlet pairing operator is given by
Delta(k)=f(k)\sum_{alpha} d_{k,alpha,up}d_{-k,alpha,down} with f(k)=1 or
f(k)=cos(k_x)cos(k_y) which would arise only if the electrons in all different
orbitals couple with equal strength to the source of pairing.
