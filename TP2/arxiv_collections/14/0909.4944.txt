Gravitational perturbations in the geometry of asymptotically flat black hole
solution in the deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz(HL) gravity are considered and the
associated quasinormal mode(QNM) frequencies are evaluated using WKB method.
Black holes are found to be stable against small perturbations. We also find a
significant deviation in the behavior of QNMs in HL theory for low values of HL
parameter $\omega$, from that in the standard General Relativity(GR). QNMs are
long lived in Ho\v{r}ava theory compared with the usual Schwarzschild black
hole case.
