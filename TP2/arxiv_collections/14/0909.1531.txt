With its rapid-response capability and multiwavelength complement of
instruments, the Swift satellite has transformed our physical understanding of
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Providing high-quality observations of hundreds of
bursts, and facilitating a wide range of follow-up observations within seconds
of each event, Swift has revealed an unforeseen richness in observed burst
properties, shed light on the nature of short-duration bursts, and helped
realize the promise of GRBs as probes of the processes and environments of star
formation out to the earliest cosmic epochs. These advances have opened new
perspectives on the nature and properties of burst central engines,
interactions with the burst environment from microparsec to gigaparsec scales,
and the possibilities for non-photonic signatures. Our understanding of these
extreme cosmic sources has thus advanced substantially; yet more than 40 years
after their discovery, GRBs continue to present major challenges on both
observational and theoretical fronts.
