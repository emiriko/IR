On 13 February 2009, a coronal wave -- CME -- dimming event was observed in
quadrature by the STEREO spacecraft. We analyze this event using a
three-dimensional, global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for the solar corona.
The numerical simulation is driven and constrained by the observations, and
indicates where magnetic reconnection occurs between the expanding CME core and
surrounding environment. We focus primarily on the lower corona, extending out
to $3R_{\odot}$; this range allows simultaneous comparison with both EUVI and
COR1 data. Our simulation produces a diffuse coronal bright front remarkably
similar to that observed by STEREO/EUVI at 195 \AA. It is made up of \emph{two}
components, and is the result of a combination of both wave and non-wave
mechanisms.
  The CME becomes large-scale quite low ($<$ 200 Mm) in the corona. It is not,
however, an inherently large-scale event; rather, the expansion is facilitated
by magnetic reconnection between the expanding CME core and the surrounding
magnetic environment. In support of this, we also find numerous secondary
dimmings, many far from the initial CME source region. Relating such dimmings
to reconnecting field lines within the simulation provides further evidence
that CME expansion leads to the "opening" of coronal field lines on a global
scale. Throughout the CME expansion, the coronal wave maps directly to the CME
footprint.
  Our results suggest that the ongoing debate over the "true" nature of diffuse
coronal waves may be mischaracterized. It appears that \emph{both} wave and
non-wave models are required to explain the observations and understand the
complex nature of these events.
