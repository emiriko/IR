Experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) suggest that the
state of matter produced in the experiments has a low shear-viscosity to
entropy-density ratio. We ask here the question what is this ratio in usual
finite nuclei at low temperature. We use the experimental and theoretical
results for the widths of giant vibrational states in nuclei in order to
calculate the above ratio. We find that the values of this ratio are not very
different from the ones found in the RHIC experiments.
