We report on optical spectroscopy (photoluminescence and photoluminescence
excitation) on two-dimensional self-organized layers of
$(C_{6}H_{5}C_{2}H_{4}-NH_{3})_{2}PbI_{4}$ perovskite. Temperature and
excitation power dependance of the optical spectra gives a new insight into the
excitonic and phononic properties of this hybrid organic/inorganic
semiconductor. In particular, exciton-phonon interaction is found to be more
than one order of magnitude higher than in GaAs QWs. As a result,
photoluminescence emission lines have to be interpreted in the framework of a
polaron model.
