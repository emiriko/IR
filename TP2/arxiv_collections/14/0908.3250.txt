Super-resolution (SR) techniques make use of subpixel shifts between frames
in an image sequence to yield higher-resolution images. We propose an original
observation model devoted to the case of non isometric inter-frame motion as
required, for instance, in the context of airborne imaging sensors. First, we
describe how the main observation models used in the SR literature deal with
motion, and we explain why they are not suited for non isometric motion. Then,
we propose an extension of the observation model by Elad and Feuer adapted to
affine motion. This model is based on a decomposition of affine transforms into
successive shear transforms, each one efficiently implemented by row-by-row or
column-by-column 1-D affine transforms.
  We demonstrate on synthetic and real sequences that our observation model
incorporated in a SR reconstruction technique leads to better results in the
case of variable scale motions and it provides equivalent results in the case
of isometric motions.
