The detection of polarized sources in the WMAP 5-year data is a very
difficult task. The maps are dominated by instrumental noise and only a handful
of sources show up as clear peaks in the Q and U maps. Optimal linear filters
applied at the position of known bright sources detect with a high level of
significance a polarized flux P from many more sources, but estimates of P are
liable to biases. Using a new technique, named the "filtered fusion technique",
we have detected in polarization, with a significance level greater than 99.99%
in at least one WMAP channel, 22 objects, 5 of which, however, do not have a
plausible low radio frequency counterpart and are therefore doubtful. Estimated
polarized fluxes P < 400 mJy at 23 GHz were found to be severely affected by
the Eddington bias. The corresponding polarized flux limit for Planck/LFI at 30
GHz, obtained via realistic simulations, is 300 mJy. We have also obtained
statistical estimates of, or upper limits to the mean polarization degrees of
bright WMAP sources at 23, 33, 41, and 61 GHz, finding that they are of a few
percent.
