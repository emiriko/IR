In order to study large variations or fluctuations of finite or infinite
sequences (time series), we bring to light an 1868 paper of Crofton and the
(Cauchy-)Crofton theorem. After surveying occurrences of this result in the
literature, we introduce the inconstancy of a sequence and we show why it seems
more pertinent than other criteria for measuring its variational complexity. We
also compute the inconstancy of classical binary sequences including some
automatic sequences and Sturmian sequences.
