We discuss the problem of universality of the soft, supersymmetry-breaking
terms in the minimal supersymmetric SU(5) model (MSSU(5)) completed with
flavor-dependent nonrenormalizable operators (NROs), or nrMSSU(5). These are
exploited to correct the wrong fermion spectrum and to slow down the too-fast
decay rate of the proton that the MSSU(5) model predicts. In general, the
presence of such operators in the superpotential and K\"ahler potential gives
rise to tree-level flavor- and CP-violating entries in the sfermion mass
matrices at the cutoff scale, even when the mediation of supersymmetry (SUSY)
breaking is generation and field-type independent. We identify the conditions
under which such terms can be avoided.
