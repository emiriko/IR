We present results from a study of proto-globular cluster candidates in the
interacting galaxy system Arp 284 (NGC 7714/5) using data from the Hubble Space
Telescope. Previous studies of the Antennae and M51 have suggested that the
majority of young massive star clusters dissolve within 20 Myr due to mass
loss. We use the evolutionary synthesis code Starburst99 to estimate ages and
extinctions for approximately 175 clusters visible with HST. We also use
lower-resolution GALEX and ground-based H-alpha data to estimate the ages of
the giant HII regions in which these clusters are found, and compare the
Spitzer colours of these HII regions to those of star forming regions in other
interacting systems. The ages are also used to aid in the interpretation of
Chandra X-ray data.
  Clusters in the tidal tails of NGC 7714 are generally found to have ages less
than 20 Myr, though observational limits make the significance of this result
uncertain. Older clusters, though not numerous, have nearly the same spatial
distribution within the imaged portion of NGC 7714 as young clusters. The
cluster population in the bridge connecting the two galaxies appears to be
older, but the data in this part of the system is too limited to draw firm
conclusions. The ages of the giant HII regions in NGC 7714 are generally older
than those of their constituent clusters, possibly indicating that the young
clusters we detect are surrounded by their dispersed predecessors.
