The genetic code has been shown to be very error robust compared to randomly
selected codes, but to be significantly less error robust than a certain code
found by a heuristic algorithm. We formulate this optimisation problem as a
Quadratic Assignment Problem and thus verify that the code found by the
heuristic is the global optimum. We also argue that it is strongly misleading
to compare the genetic code only with codes sampled from the fixed block model,
because the real code space is orders of magnitude larger. We thus enlarge the
space from which random codes can be sampled from approximately 2.433 x 10^18
codes to approximately 5.908 x 10^45 codes. We do this by leaving the fixed
block model, and using the wobble rules to formulate the characteristics
acceptable for a genetic code. By relaxing more constraints three larger spaces
are also constructed. Using a modified error function, the genetic code is
found to be more error robust compared to a background of randomly generated
codes with increasing space size. We point out that these results do not
necessarily imply that the code was optimized during evolution for error
minimization, but that other mechanisms could explain this error robustness.
