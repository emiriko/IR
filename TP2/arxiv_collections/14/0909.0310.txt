We present the results of new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
observations of one of the largest supernova remnants, SNR J0450-709, in the
Local Group of galaxies. We found that this Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) ob
ject exhibits a typical morphology of an old supernova remnant (SNR) with
diameter D=102x75+-1 pc and radio spectral index alpha=-0.43+-0.06. Regions of
high polarisation were detected with peak value of ~40%.
