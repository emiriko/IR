This paper focuses on some issues about condensates and renormalization in
AdS/QCD models. In particular we consider the consistency of the AdS/QCD
approach for scale dependent quantities as the chiral condensate questioned in
some recent papers and the 4D meaning of the 5D cosmological constant in a
model in which the QCD is dual to a 5D gravity theory. We will be able to give
some arguments that the cosmological constant is related to the QCD gluon
condensate.
