We propose an entanglement criterion based on local uncertainty relations
(LURs) in a stronger form than the original LUR criterion introduced in [H. F.
Hofmann and S. Takeuchi, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{68}, 032103 (2003)]. Using
arbitrarily chosen operators $\{\hat{A}_{k}\}$ and $\{\hat{B}_{k}\}$ of
subsystems A and B, the tighter LUR criterion, which may be used not only for
discrete variables but also for continuous variables, can detect more entangled
states than the original criterion.
