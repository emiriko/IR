The adsorption of Ar on substrates of Li is investigated within the framework
of a density functional theory which includes an effective pair potential
recently proposed. This approach yields good results for the surface tension of
the liquid-vapor interface over the entire range of temperatures, T, from the
triple point, T_t, to the critical point, T_c. The behavior of the adsorbate in
the cases of a single planar wall and a slit geometry is analyzed as a function
of temperature. Asymmetric density profiles are found for fluid confined in a
slit built up of two identical planar walls leading to the spontaneous symmetry
breaking (SSB) effect. We found that the asymmetric solutions occur even above
the wetting temperature T_w in a range of average densities rho*_ssb1 <=
rho*_av <= rho*_ssb2, which diminishes with increasing temperatures until its
disappearance at the critical prewetting point T_cpw. In this way a correlation
between the disappearance of the SSB effect and the end of prewetting lines
observed in the adsorption on a one-wall planar substrate is established. In
addition, it is shown that a value for T_cpw can be precisely determined by
analyzing the asymmetry coefficients.
