In spite of significant recent and ongoing research efforts, most of the
early evolution and long-term fate of young massive star clusters remain
clouded in uncertainties. Here, I discuss our understanding of the initial
conditions of star cluster formation and the importance of initial substructure
for the subsequent dynamical-evolution and mass-segregation timescales. I also
assess our current understanding of the (initial) binary fraction in star
clusters and the shape of the stellar initial mass function at the low-mass end
in the low-metallicity environment of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Finally, I
question the validity of our assumptions leading to dynamical cluster mass
estimates. I conclude that it seems imperative that observers, modellers and
theorists combine efforts and exchange ideas and data freely for the field to
make a major leap forward.
