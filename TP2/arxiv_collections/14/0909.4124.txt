We present MIPS 24um and 70um photometry for 205 members of the Upper
Scorpius OB Association. These data are combined with published MIPS photometry
for 15 additional association members to assess the frequency of circumstellar
disks around 5 Myr old stars with spectral types between B0 and M5. Twelve
stars have a detectable 70um excess, each of which also has a detectable 24um
excess. A total of 54 stars are identified with a 24um excess more than 32%
above the stellar photosphere. The MIPS observations reveal 19 excess sources
-- 8 A/F/G stars and 11 K/M stars -- that were not previously identified with
an 8um or 16um excess. The lack of short-wavelength emission and the weak 24um
excess suggests that these sources are debris systems or the remnants of
optically thick primordial disks with inner holes. Despite the wide range of
luminosities of the stars hosting apparent debris systems, the excess
characteristics are consistent with all stars having dust at similar orbital
radii after factoring in variations in the radiation blowout particle size with
spectral type. The results for Upper Sco are compared to similar photometric
surveys from the literature to re-evaluate the evolution of debris emission.
After considering the completeness limits of published surveys and the effects
of stellar evolution on the debris luminosity, we find that the magnitude of
the 24um excess around F-type stars increases between ages of 5 and 17 Myr as
found by previous studies, but at < 2.6 sigma confidence. For B7-A9 and G0-K5
stars, any variations in the observed 24um excess emission over this age range
are significant at less than 2 sigma confidence.
