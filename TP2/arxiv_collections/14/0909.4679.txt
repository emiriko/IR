Recent work based on a global measurement of the ICM properties find evidence
for an increase of the iron abundance in galaxy clusters with temperature
around 2-4 keV. We have undertaken a study of the metal distribution in nearby
clusters in this temperature range, aiming at resolving spatially the metal
content of the ICM. The XMM observation of the first object of the sample, the
cluster Abell 2028, reveals a complex structure of the cluster over scale of ~
300 kpc, showing an interaction between two sub-clusters in a ``cometary''
configuration. We show that a naive one-component fit for the core of Abell
2028 returns a biased high metallicity. This is due to the inverse iron-bias,
which is not related to the presence in the spectrum of both Fe-L and Fe-K
emission lines but to the behavior of the fitting code in shaping the Fe-L
complex of a one temperature component to adjust to the multi-temperature
structure of the projected spectrum.
