Vertex detectors at future hadron colliders will need to cope with large
particle fluences. Diamond is a particularly radiation hard material and
exhibits further properties that makes it an attractive material for such
detectors. Within the RD42 collaboration several chemical vapor deposition
diamond samples are being studied in the form of strip and pixel detectors.
While the quality of the poly-crystalline diamond samples is constantly
increasing and the feasibility of producing wafers has been demonstrated,
recently a single-crystal diamond pixel detector has been assembled and
characterized in a 100 GeV particle beam at CERN. Results on performance,
detection efficiency, spatial resolution and charge collection are reported
here together with the latest radiation damage studies.
