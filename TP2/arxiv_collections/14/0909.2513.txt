Energetic primary cosmic rays entering the Earth's atmosphere generate flux
of secondary particles including neutrinos. Muon neutrinos passed through the
Earth and produced muons via the charged current reaction can be registered by
experimental setups intended for the measurements with colliding beams. Due to
large geometrical size and advanced muon detecting system such detectors as
ATLAS and CMS on LHC have chance to contribute also into the neutrino physics.
The estimation of possible rates of up-going muons produced by neutrinos is
given.
