Recent Halpha surveys such as SHS and IPHAS have improved the completeness of
the Galactic planetary nebula (PN) census. We now know of ~3,000 PNe in the
Galaxy, but this is far short of most estimates, typically ~25,000 or more for
the total population. The size of the Galactic PN population is required to
derive an accurate estimate of the chemical enrichment rates of nitrogen,
carbon, and helium. In addition, a high PN count (~20,000) is strong evidence
that most 1-8 Msun main sequence stars will go through a PN phase, while a low
count (<10,000) argues that special conditions (e.g., a close binary
interaction) are required to form a PN. We describe a technique for finding
hundreds more PNe using the existing data collections of the digital sky
surveys, thereby improving the census of Galactic PNe.
