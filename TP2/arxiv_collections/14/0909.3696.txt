We construct efficient data structures that are resilient against a constant
fraction of adversarial noise. Our model requires that the decoder answers most
queries correctly with high probability and for the remaining queries, the
decoder with high probability either answers correctly or declares "don't
know." Furthermore, if there is no noise on the data structure, it answers all
queries correctly with high probability. Our model is the common generalization
of a model proposed recently by de Wolf and the notion of "relaxed locally
decodable codes" developed in the PCP literature.
  We measure the efficiency of a data structure in terms of its length,
measured by the number of bits in its representation, and query-answering time,
measured by the number of bit-probes to the (possibly corrupted)
representation. In this work, we study two data structure problems: membership
and polynomial evaluation. We show that these two problems have constructions
that are simultaneously efficient and error-correcting.
