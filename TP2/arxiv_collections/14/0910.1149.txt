We propose a novel generalized method for mass measurements based on phase
space singularity structures that can be applied to any event topology with
missing energy. Our method subsumes the well-known end-point and transverse
mass methods and yields new techniques for studying "missing particle" events,
such as the double chain production of stable neutral particles at the LHC.
