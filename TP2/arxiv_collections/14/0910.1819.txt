This paper introduces a new Importance Sampling scheme, called Adaptive
Twisted Importance Sampling, which is adequate for the improved estimation of
rare event probabilities in he range of moderate deviations pertaining to the
empirical mean of real i.i.d. summands. It is based on a sharp approximation of
the density of long runs extracted from a random walk conditioned on its end
value.
