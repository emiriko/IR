We present a study of the intermediate regime between ultra-relativistic and
nonrelativistic flow for gamma-ray burst afterglows. The hydrodynamics of
spherically symmetric blast waves is numerically calculated using the AMRVAC
adaptive mesh refinement code. Spectra and light curves are calculated using a
separate radiation code that, for the first time, links a parametrisation of
the microphysics of shock acceleration, synchrotron self-absorption and
electron cooling to a high-performance hydrodynamics simulation. For the
dynamics we find that the transition to the nonrelativistic regime generally
occurs later than expected, that the Sedov-Taylor solution overpredicts the
late time blast wave radius and that the analytical formula for the blast wave
velocity from Huang (1999) overpredicts the late time velocity by a factor 4/3.
For the radiation we find that the flux may differ up to an order of magnitude
depending on the equation of state that is used for the fluid and that the
counterjet leads to a clear rebrightening at late times for hard-edged jets.
Simulating GRB030329 using predictions for its physical parameters from the
literature leads to spectra and light curves that may differ significantly from
the actual data, emphasizing the need for very accurate modelling. Predicted
light curves at low radio frequencies for a hard-edged jet model of GRB030329
with opening angle 22 degrees show typically two distinct peaks, due to the
combined effect of jet break, non relativistic break and counterjet.
