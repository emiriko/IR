We consider a spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat vacuum solution
of the Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity that is the analog of the general
relativistic Schwarzschild black hole. In the weak-field and slow-motion
approximation, we work out the correction to the third Kepler law of a test
particle induced by such a solution and compare it to the phenomenologically
determined orbital period of the transiting extrasolar planet HD209458b Osiris
to preliminarily obtain an order-of-magnitude lower bound on the KS
dimensionless parameter \omega_0 >= 1.4\times 10^-18. As suggestions for
further analyses, the entire data set of HD209458b should be re-processed by
explicitly modeling KS gravity as well, and one or more dedicated solve-for
parameter(s) should be estimated.
