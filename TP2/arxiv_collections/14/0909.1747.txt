One of the prominent science goal of the ELTs will be to study the physics
and mass assembly of galaxies at very high redshifts. Here, we present the
galaxy evolution science case for EAGLE, which is a NIR multi-integral field
spectrograph for the E-ELT currently under phase A study. We summarize results
of simulations conducted to derive high-level requirements. In particular, we
show how we have derived the specifications for the ensquared energy that the
AO system needs to provide to reach the scientific goals of the instrument.
Finally, we present future strategies to conduct galaxy surveys with EAGLE.
