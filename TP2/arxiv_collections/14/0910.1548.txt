We use linear response analysis and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to
derive the energy loss of a heavy quark in the SU(2) classical Coulomb plasma
in terms of the $l=1$ monopole and non-static structure factor. The result is
valid for all Coulomb couplings $\Gamma=V/K$, the ratio of the mean potential
to kinetic energy. We use the Liouville equation in the collisionless limit to
assess the SU(2) non-static structure factor. We find the energy loss to be
strongly dependent on $\Gamma$. In the liquid phase with $\Gamma\approx 4$, the
energy loss is mostly metallic and soundless with neither a Cerenkov nor a Mach
cone. Our analytical results compare favorably with the SU(2) molecular
dynamics simulations at large momentum and for heavy quark masses.
