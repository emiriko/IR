We construct a model of spontaneous CP violation in E6 supersymmetric grand
unified theory. In the model, we employ an SU(2)F flavor symmetry and an
anomalous U(1)A symmetry. The SU(2)F flavor symmetry is introduced to provide
the origin of hierarchical structures of Yukawa coupling and to ensure the
universality of sfermion soft masses. The anomalous U(1)A symmetry is
introduced to realize the doublet-triplet mass splitting, to provide the origin
of hierarchical structures of Yukawa couplings, and to solve the mu problem. In
the model, CP is spontaneously broken by the SU(2)F breaking in order to
provide a Kobayashi-Maskawa phase and to evade the supersymmetric CP problem.
However, a naive construction of the model generally leads to unwanted outcome,
Arg[mu b*]=O(1), when CP violating effects in the flavor sector are taken into
account. We cure this difficulty by imposing a discrete symmetry and find that
this prescription can play additional roles. It ensures that realistic up-quark
mass and Cabibbo angle are simultaneously realized without cancellation between
O(1) coefficients. Also, severe constraints from the chromo-electric dipole
moment of the quark can be satisfied without destabilizing the weak scale. The
discrete symmetry reduces the number of free parameters, but the model is
capable of reproducing quark and lepton mass spectra, mixing angles, and a
Jarlskog invariant. We obtain characteristic predictions Vub sim O(lambda^4)
(lambda=0.22) and |Vcb Yb| = |Yc| at the grand unified theory scale.
