We study the properties of the turbulence driven by the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) in a stratified shearing box with outflow boundary conditions
and an equation of state determined by self-consistent dissipation and
radiation losses. A series of simulations with increasing resolution are
performed within a fixed computational box. We achieve numerical convergence
with respect to radial and azimuthal resolution. As vertical resolution is
improved, the ratio of stress to pressure increases only slowly, but the
absolute levels of both the stress and the pressure increase noticeably. The
vertical correlation length of the magnetic field within the core of the disk
is highly time-dependent, but averaged over time, it is $\simeq 3$ times larger
than found in previous unstratifed simulations. This correlation length
decreases slowly as vertical resolution increases. We suggest that this greater
degree of correlation in stratified than unstratified disks, even near the
midplane, is due to field buoyancy. We further show that the undulatory Parker
instability drives the magnetic field upwelling at several scaleheights from
the midplane that is characteristic of stratified MHD-turbulent disks.
