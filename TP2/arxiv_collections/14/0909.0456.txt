In the usual Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz cosmological models, the scalar field is
responsible for dark matter. Using an additional scalar field, Saridakis
\cite{sari} has formulated Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz cosmology with an effective dark
energy sector. In the paper \cite{sari} the scalar fields do not interact with
each other, here we extend this work to the interacting case, where matter
scalar field $\phi$ interact with dark energy scalar field $\sigma$. We will
show that in contrast with \cite{sari}, where $\sigma$-filed is absent, we can
obtain $w_d ^{\rm eff}<-1$, that is we result to an effective dark energy
presenting phantom behaviour. This behaviour is pure effect of the interaction.
