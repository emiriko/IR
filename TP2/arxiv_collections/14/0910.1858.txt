Introduced in the late 1960's, the asymmetric exclusion process (ASEP) is an
important model from statistical mechanics which describes a system of
interacting particles hopping left and right on a one-dimensional lattice of n
sites with open boundaries. It has been cited as a model for traffic flow and
protein synthesis. In the most general form of the ASEP with open boundaries,
particles may enter and exit at the left with probabilities alpha and gamma,
and they may exit and enter at the right with probabilities beta and delta. In
the bulk, the probability of hopping left is q times the probability of hopping
right. The first main result of this paper is a combinatorial formula for the
stationary distribution of the ASEP with all parameters general, in terms of a
new class of tableaux which we call staircase tableaux. This generalizes our
previous work for the ASEP with parameters gamma=delta=0. Using our first
result and also results of Uchiyama-Sasamoto-Wadati, we derive our second main
result: a combinatorial formula for the moments of Askey-Wilson polynomials.
Since the early 1980's there has been a great deal of work giving combinatorial
formulas for moments of various other classical orthogonal polynomials (e.g.
Hermite, Charlier, Laguerre, Meixner). However, this is the first such formula
for the Askey-Wilson polynomials, which are at the top of the hierarchy of
classical orthogonal polynomials.
