The Lick AGN Monitoring Project targeted 13 nearby Seyfert 1 galaxies with
the intent of measuring the masses of their central black holes using
reverberation mapping. The sample includes 12 galaxies selected to have black
holes with masses roughly in the range 10^6-10^7 solar masses, as well as the
well-studied AGN NGC 5548. In conjunction with a spectroscopic monitoring
campaign, we obtained broad-band B and V images on most nights from 2008
February through 2008 May. The imaging observations were carried out by four
telescopes: the 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), the 2-m
Multicolor Active Galactic Nuclei Monitoring (MAGNUM) telescope, the Palomar
60-in (1.5-m) telescope, and the 0.80-m Tenagra II telescope. Having
well-sampled light curves over the course of a few months is useful for
obtaining the broad-line reverberation lag and black hole mass, and also allows
us to examine the characteristics of the continuum variability. In this paper,
we discuss the observational methods and the photometric measurements, and
present the AGN continuum light curves. We measure various variability
characteristics of each of the light curves. We do not detect any evidence for
a time lag between the B- and V-band variations, and we do not find significant
color variations for the AGNs in our sample.
