This article reviews the quantum entanglement in Valence-Bond-Solid (VBS)
states defined on a lattice or a graph. The subject is presented in a
self-contained and pedagogical way. The VBS state was first introduced in the
celebrated paper by I. Affleck, T. Kennedy, E. H. Lieb and H. Tasaki
(abbreviation AKLT is widely used). It became essential in condensed matter
physics and quantum information (measurement-based quantum computation). Many
publications have been devoted to the subject. Recently entanglement was
studied in the VBS state. In this review we start with the definition of a
general AKLT spin chain and the construction of VBS ground state. In order to
study entanglement, a block subsystem is introduced and described by the
density matrix. Density matrices of 1-dimensional models are diagonalized and
the entanglement entropies (the von Neumann entropy and Renyi entropy) are
calculated. In the large block limit, the entropies also approach finite
limits. Study of the spectrum of the density matrix led to the discovery that
the density matrix is proportional to a projector.
