This article gives the perturbative NNLO results for the moments of the most
commonly used event shape variables associated to three-jet events in
electron-positron annihilation: Thrust, heavy jet mass, wide jet broadening,
total jet broadening, C parameter and the Durham three-to-two jet transition
variable.
