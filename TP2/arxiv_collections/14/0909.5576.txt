If supersymmetry is discovered at the LHC, the extraction of the fundamental
parameters will be a formidable task. In such a system where measurements
depend on different combinations of the parameters in a highly correlated
system, the identification of the true parameter set in an efficient way
necessitates the development and use of sophisticated methods. A rigorous
treatment of experimental and theoretical errors is necessary to determine the
precision of the measurement of the fundamental parameters. The techniques
developed for this endeavor can also be applied to similar problems such as the
determination of the Higgs boson couplings at the LHC.
