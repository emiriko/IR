The structure and dynamics of small vertical photospheric magnetic flux
concentrations has been often treated in the framework of an approximation
based upon a low-order truncation of the Taylor expansions of all quantities in
the horizontal direction, together with the assumption of instantaneous total
pressure balance at the boundary to the non-magnetic external medium. Formally,
such an approximation is justified if the diameter of the structure (a flux
tube or a flux sheet) is small compared to all other relevant length scales
(scale height, radius of curvature, wavelength, etc.). The advent of realistic
3D radiative MHD simulations opens the possibility of checking the consistency
of the approximation with the properties of the flux concentrations that form
in the course of a simulation.
  We carry out a comparative analysis between the thin flux tube/sheet models
and flux concentrations formed in a 3D radiation-MHD simulation. We compare the
distribution of the vertical and horizontal components of the magnetic field in
a 3D MHD simulation with the field distribution in the case of the thin flux
tube/sheet approximation. We also consider the total (gas plus magnetic)
pressure in the MHD simulation box. Flux concentrations with
super-equipartition fields are reasonably well reproduced by the second-order
thin flux tube/sheet approximation. The differences between approximation and
simulation are due to the asymmetry and the dynamics of the simulated
structures.
