The conjunction of atom-cavity physics and photonic structures (``solid
light'' systems) offers new opportunities in terms of more device functionality
and the probing of designed emulators of condensed matter systems. By analogy
to the canonical one-electron approximation of solid state physics, we propose
a one-polariton approximation to study these systems. Using this approximation
we apply Bloch states to the uniformly tuned Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model to
analytically determine the energy band structure. By analyzing the response of
the band structure to local atom-cavity control we explore its application as a
quantum simulator and show phase transition features absent in mean field
theory. Using this novel approach for solid light systems we extend the
analysis to include detuning impurities to show the solid light analogy of the
semiconductor. This investigation also shows new features with no semiconductor
analog.
