Kaluza-Klein photon in universal extra dimension models is one of the most
attractive dark matter candidates as a weakly interacting massive particle.
Having a characteristic split spectrum in split universal extra dimension the
relic density of Kaluza-Klein photon with 900 GeV mass is in good agreement
with the observed dark matter amount in our Universe. Interestingly
Kaluza-Klein photon in the same mass range also provides excellent fits to the
recently observed excesses in cosmic electron and positron fluxes. The amount
of gamma-ray contributions, mostly from tau decays, can be significant around
300 GeV, thus can be observed or constrained by the forthcoming Fermi-LAT
diffuse gamma-ray data.
