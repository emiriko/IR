We present a brief overview of black hole spacetimes admitting Killing-Yano
tensors. In vacuum these include Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics and certain black brane
solutions. In the presence of matter fields, (conformal) Killing-Yano
symmetries are known to exist for the Plebanski-Demianski solution and
(trivially) for any spacetime with spherical symmetry. Special attention is
devoted to generalized Killing-Yano tensors of black holes in minimal gauged
supergravity. Several aspects directly related to the existence of Killing-Yano
tensors, such as the Kerr-Schild form, algebraic type of spacetimes, and
separability of field equations, are also briefly discussed.
