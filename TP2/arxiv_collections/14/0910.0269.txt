We tested several models in which the Standard Model (SM) gauge group is
extended by an additional U(1) gauge symmetry, against available electroweak
precision data to impose limits on the mass of the neutral Z' boson, M_Z',
predicted in all such models, and on the Z-Z' mixing angle, theta_ZZ', at 95%
C.L. We found lower limits on M_Z' of order 1 TeV in most cases, while
theta_ZZ' was found to be constrained to very small values.
