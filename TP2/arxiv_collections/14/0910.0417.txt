The validity of optimized dynamical decoupling (DD) is extended to
analytically time dependent Hamiltonians. As long as an expansion in time is
possible the time dependence of the initial Hamiltonian does not affect the
efficiency of optimized dynamical decoupling (UDD, Uhrig DD). This extension
provides the analytic basis for (i) applying UDD to effective Hamiltonians in
time dependent reference frames, for instance in the interaction picture of
fast modes and for (ii) its application in hierarchical
  DD schemes with $\pi$ pulses about two perpendicular axes in spin space. to
suppress general decoherence, i.e., longitudinal relaxation and dephasing.
