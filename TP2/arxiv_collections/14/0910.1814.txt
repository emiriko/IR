Three facets of symmetries in neutrino physics are briefly reviewed: i) The
SO(5) symmetry of the neutrino mass and and its connection to the see-saw
mechanism; ii) Flavor SU(N) symmetries of dense, self-interacting neutrino
gases in astrophysical settings; iii) The neutrino mixing angle theta13 and
possible CP-violation in the neutrino sector.
