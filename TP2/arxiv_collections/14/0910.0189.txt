Current transfer is defined as a charge transfer process where the
transferred charge carries information about its original motion. We have
recently suggested that such transfer causes the asymmetry observed in electron
transfer induced by circularly polarized light through helical wires. This
paper presents the steady state theory of current transfer within a tight
binding model of coupled wires systems. The efficiency of current transfer is
quantified in terms of the calculated asymmetry in the system response to a
steady current imposed on one of the wires, with respect to the imposed current
direction.
