The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is intended as the next-generation radio
telescope and will address fundamental questions in astrophysics, physics, and
astrobiology. The international science community has developed a set of Key
Science Programs:
  (1) Emerging from the Dark Ages and the Epoch of Reionization,
  (2) Galaxy Evolution, Cosmology, and Dark Energy,
  (3) The Origin and Evolution of Cosmic Magnetism,
  (4) Strong Field Tests of Gravity Using Pulsars and Black Holes, and
  (5) The Cradle of Life/Astrobiology.
  In addition, there is a design philosophy of "exploration of the unknown," in
which the objective is to keep the design as flexible as possible to allow for
future discoveries. Both a significant challenge and opportunity for the SKA is
to obtain a significantly wider field of view than has been obtained with radio
telescopes traditionally. Given the breadth of coverage of cosmic magnetism and
galaxy evolution in this conference, I highlight some of the opportunities that
an expanded field of view will present for other Key Science Programs.
