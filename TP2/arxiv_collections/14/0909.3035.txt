We propose an experimental setup for the observation of quasi-relativistic
massless Fermions. It is based on a T_3 optical lattice, realized by three
pairs of counter-propagating lasers, filled with fermionic cold atoms. We show
that in the long wavelength approximation the T_3 Hamiltonian generalizes the
Dirac-Weyl Hamiltonian for the honeycomb lattice, however, with a larger value
of the pseudo-spin S=1. In addition to the Dirac cones, the spectrum includes a
dispersionless branch of localized states producing a finite jump in the atomic
density. Furthermore, implications for the Landau levels are discussed.
