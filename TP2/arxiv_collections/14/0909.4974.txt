A large-volume liquid scintillator can be used as a tracking detector to
measure high-energy neutrino events, like atmospheric neutrinos and neutrino
beams. The lepton flavor recognition is almost absolute above 1 GeV. The energy
resolution is 2--5 %, the main uncertainties coming from nuclear physics and
poorly recognized hadrons. At GeV scale antineutrinos may be statistically
distinguishable from neutrinos by neutron and proton signals.
