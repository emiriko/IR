The general prescription for constructing the continuum limit of a field
theory is introduced. We then apply the prescription to construct the O(N)
non-linear sigma model and the Gross-Neveu model in three dimensions using the
large N expansions. We compare these non-linear models with the linearized
models, and show the equivalence.
