We introduce a world vision in which data is endowed with memory. In this
data-centric systems paradigm, data items can be enabled to retain all or some
of their previous values. We call this ability "remembrance" and posit that it
empowers significant leaps in the security, availability, and general
operational dimensions of systems. With the explosion in cheap, fast memories
and storage, large-scale remembrance will soon become practical. Here, we
introduce and explore the advantages of such a paradigm and the challenges in
making it a reality.
