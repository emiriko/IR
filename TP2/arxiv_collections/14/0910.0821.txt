As a step toward a complete theoretical integration of 3D compressible
hydrodynamic simulations into stellar evolution, convection at the surface and
sub-surface layers of the Sun is re-examined, from a restricted point of view,
in the language of mixing-length theory (MLT) . Requiring that MLT use a
hydrodynamically realistic dissipation length gives a new constraint on solar
models. While the stellar structure which results is similar to that obtained
by YREC and Garching models, the theoretical picture differs. A new
quantitative connection is made between macro-turbulence, micro-turbulence, and
the convective velocity scale at the photosphere, which has finite values. The
"geometric parameter" in MLT is found to correspond more reasonably with the
size of the strong downward plumes which drive convection (Stein and Nordlund
1998), and thus has a physical interpretation even in MLT. Use of 3D
simulations of both adiabatic convection and stellar atmospheres will allow the
determination of the dissipation length and the geometric parameter (i.e., the
entropy jump), with no astronomical calibration.
  A physically realistic treatment of convection in stellar evolution will
require additional modifications beyond MLT, including effects of kinetic
energy flux, entrainment (the most dramatic difference from MLT found by Meakin
and Arnett 2007), rotation, and magnetic fields (Balbus 2009}.
