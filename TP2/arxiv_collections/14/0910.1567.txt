Secluded dark matter models, in which WIMPs annihilate first into metastable
mediators, can present novel indirect detection signatures in the form of gamma
rays and fluxes of charged particles arriving from directions correlated with
the centers of large astrophysical bodies within the solar system, such as the
Sun and larger planets. This naturally occurs if the mean free path of the
mediator is in excess of the solar (or planetary) radius. We show that existing
constraints from water Cerenkov detectors already provide a novel probe of the
parameter space of these models, complementary to other sources, with
significant scope for future improvement from high angular resolution gamma-ray
telescopes such as Fermi-LAT. Fluxes of charged particles produced in mediator
decays are also capable of contributing a significant solar system component to
the spectrum of energetic electrons and positrons, a possibility which can be
tested with the directional and timing information of PAMELA and Fermi.
