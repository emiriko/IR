The zodiacal cloud is a thick circumsolar disk of small debris particles
produced by asteroid collisions and comets. Here, we present a zodiacal cloud
model based on the orbital properties and lifetimes of comets and asteroids,
and on the dynamical evolution of dust after ejection. The model is
quantitatively constrained by IRAS observations of thermal emission, but also
qualitatively consistent with other zodiacal cloud observations. We find that
85-95% of the observed mid-infrared emission is produced by particles from the
Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and $<$10% by dust from long period comets.
Asteroidal dust is found to be present at $<$10%. We suggest that spontaneous
disruptions of JFCs, rather than the usual cometary activity driven by
sublimating volatiles, is the main mechanism that librates cometary particles
into the zodiacal cloud. Our results imply that JFC particles represent
$\sim$85% of the total mass influx at Earth. Since their atmospheric entry
speeds are typically low ($\approx$14.5 km s$^{-1}$ mean for D=100-200 $\mu$m
with $\approx$12 km s$^{-1}$ being the most common case), many JFC grains
should survive frictional heating and land on the Earth's surface. This
explains why most micrometeorites collected in antarctic ice have primitive
carbonaceous composition. The present mass of the inner zodiacal cloud at $<$5
AU is estimated to be 1-$2\times10^{19}$ g, mainly in D=100-200 $\mu$m
particles. The inner zodiacal cloud should have been $>10^4$ times brighter
during the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) epoch $\approx$3.8 Gyr ago, when the
outer planets scattered numerous comets into the inner solar system. The bright
debris disks with a large 24-$\mu$m excess observed around mature stars may be
an indication of massive cometary populations existing in those systems.
