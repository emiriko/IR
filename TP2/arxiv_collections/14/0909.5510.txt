We report here on two years of timing of 168 pulsars using the Parkes radio
telescope. The vast majority of these pulsars have spin-down luminosities in
excess of 10^34 erg/s and are prime target candidates to be detected in
gamma-rays by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We provide the ephemerides
for the ten pulsars being timed at Parkes which have been detected by Fermi in
its first year of operation. These ephemerides, in conjunction with the
publicly available photon list, can be used to generate gamma-ray profiles from
the Fermi archive. We will make the ephemerides of any pulsars of interest
available to the community upon request. In addition to the timing ephemerides,
we present the parameters for 14 glitches which have occurred in 13 pulsars,
seven of which have no previously known glitch history. The Parkes timing
programme, in conjunction with Fermi observations, is expected to continue for
at least the next four years.
