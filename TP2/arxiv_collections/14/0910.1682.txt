The PANDA experiment will not use any hardware trigger, i.e. all raw data are
streaming in the data acquisition with a bandwidth of ~280 GB/s. The PANDA
Online System is designed to perform data reduction by a factor of ~800 by
reconstruction algorithms programmed in VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated
Circuit Hardware Description Language) on FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate
Arrays).
