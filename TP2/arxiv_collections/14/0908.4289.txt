We consider 3d Schrodinger operator with long-range potential that has
short-range radial derivative. The long-time asymptotics of non-stationary
problem is studied and existence of modified wave operators is proved. It turns
out, the standard WKB correction should be replaced by the solution to certain
evolution equation.
