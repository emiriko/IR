Proofs, in Ludics, have an interpretation provided by their counter-proofs,
that is the objects they interact with. We follow the same idea by proposing
that sentence meanings are given by the counter-meanings they are opposed to in
a dialectical interaction. The conception is at the intersection of a
proof-theoretic and a game-theoretic accounts of semantics, but it enlarges
them by allowing to deal with possibly infinite processes.
