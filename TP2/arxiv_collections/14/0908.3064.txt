X-ray sources are developing rapidly and their coherent output is growing
extremely rapidly. The increased coherent flux from modern X-ray sources is
being matched with an associated rapid development in experimental methods.
This article reviews the literature describing the ideas that utilise the
increased brilliance from modern X-ray sources. It explores how ideas in
coherent X-ray science are leading to developments in other areas, and vice
versa. The article describes measurements of coherence properties and uses this
discussion as a base from which to describe partially-coherent diffraction and
X-ray phase contrast imaging, with its applications in materials science,
engineering and medicine. Coherent diffraction imaging methods are reviewed
along with associated experiments in materials science. Proposals for
experiments to be performed with the new X-ray free-electron-lasers are briefly
discussed. The literature on X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is described
and the features it has in common with other coherent X-ray methods are
identified. Many of the ideas used in the coherent X-ray literature have their
origins in the optical and electron communities and these connections are
explored. A review of the areas in which ideas from coherent X-ray methods are
contributing to methods for the neutron, electron and optical communities is
presented.
