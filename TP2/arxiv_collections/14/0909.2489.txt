Nowadays people realize that it is difficult to find information simply and
quickly on the bulletin boards. In order to solve this problem, people propose
the concept of bulletin board search engine. This paper describes the
priscrawler system, a subsystem of the bulletin board search engine, which can
automatically crawl and add the relevance to the classified attachments of the
bulletin board. Priscrawler utilizes Attachrank algorithm to generate the
relevance between webpages and attachments and then turns bulletin board into
clear classified and associated databases, making the search for attachments
greatly simplified. Moreover, it can effectively reduce the complexity of
pretreatment subsystem and retrieval subsystem and improve the search
precision. We provide experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the
priscrawler.
