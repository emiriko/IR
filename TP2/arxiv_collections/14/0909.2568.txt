We probe the unification of down quarks and leptons in a supersymmetric
SO(10) GUT. The large atmospheric neutrino mixing angle induces bR-sR
transitions, which can account for the sizeable CP phase measured in Bs-Bsbar
mixing. Corrections to down-quark-lepton unification from higher-dimensional
Yukawa terms translate neutrino mixing also into sR-dR and bR-dR currents. We
find the flavour structure of Yukawa corrections to be strongly constrained by
epsilonK.
