We present a study of atom-wall interactions in non-relativistic quantum
electrodynamics by functional integral methods. The Feynman-Kac path integral
representation is generalized to the case when the particle interacts with a
radiation field, providing an additional effective potential that contains all
the interactions induced by the field. We show how one can retrieve the
standard van der Waals, Casimir-Polder and classical Lifshiftz forces in this
formalism for an atom in its ground state. Moreover, when electrostatic
interactions are screened in the medium, we find low temperature corrections
that are not included in the Lifshitz theory of fluctuating forces and are
opposite to them.
