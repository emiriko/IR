It is discovered theoretically that significant confinement resonances in an
$nl$ photoionization of a \textit{multielectron} atom $A$ encaged in carbon
fullerenes, A@C$_{60}$, may re-appear and be strong at photon energies far
exceeding the $nl$ ionization threshold, as a general phenomenon. The reasons
for this phenomenon are unraveled. The Ne $2p$ photoionization of the
endohedral anion Ne@C$_{60}^{5-}$ in the photon energy region of about a
thousand eV above the $2p$ threshold is chosen as case study.
