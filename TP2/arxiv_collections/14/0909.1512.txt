We show that a combined analysis of $B\to K\nu\bar\nu$ and $B\to Kl^+l^-$
allows for new physics tests practically free of form factor uncertainties.
Residual theory errors are at the level of several percent. Our study
underlines the excellent motivation for measuring these modes at a Super
Flavour Factory.
