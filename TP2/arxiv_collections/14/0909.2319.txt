Quantum Space Time may be characterized by a plethora of novel phenomena,
such as Lorentz violations and non-trivial refractive indices, stochastic
metric fluctuation effects leading to decoherence of quantum matter and
non-commutativity of space-time coordinates. In string theory, which is one of
the major approaches to quantum gravity, such coordinate non-commutativities
arise naturally in many instances. In the talk I review one such instance,
which arises in the modern context of D-brane defects in the background space
time, over which string matter propagates. This serves as a prototype of
space-time foam in this context. I chose this model, over many others, because
it may actually have some unique features that can be falsified experimentally
either by means of high-energy astrophysical observations or in some
particle-interferometers, such as neutral meson factories. In particular, the
model may explain the recent observations of the FERMI Gamma-Ray Telescope on
delayed emission of 30 GeV photons from a distant Gamma-Ray-Burst 090510, in
agreement with previous observations from the MAGIC and HESS Telescopes, but
can also lead to falsifiable predictions for quantum foam effects in
forthcoming upgrades of certain "particle interferometers", such as neutral
meson factories.
