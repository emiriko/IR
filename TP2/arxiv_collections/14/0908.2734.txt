We report on a detailed investigation of the electronic phase diagram of
FeSe_1-x under pressures up to 1.4GPa by means of AC magnetization and
muon-spin rotation. At a pressure \simeq0.8GPa the non-magnetic and
superconducting FeSe_1-x enters a region where long range static magnetic order
is realized above T_c and bulk superconductivity coexists and competes on short
length scales with the magnetic order below T_c. For even higher pressures an
enhancement of both the magnetic and the superconducting transition
temperatures as well as of the corresponding order parameters is observed.
These exceptional properties make FeSe1-x to be one of the most interesting
superconducting systems investigated extensively at present.
