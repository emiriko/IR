In this paper, we obtained a new class of axially symmetric cosmological
mesonic stiff fluid models in the context of Lyra's geometry. Expressions for
the energy, pressure and the massless scalar field are derived by considering
the time dependent displacement field. We found that the mesonic scalar field
depends on only $t$ coordinate. Some physical properties of the obtained models
are discussed.
