The $(K^-,K^+)$ $\Xi^-$ production inclusive spectrum is reinvestigated in
view of the very weak $\Xi$-nucleus potential predicted by microscopic
calculations with the SU$_6$ quark-model baryon-baryon interaction. The
inclusive spectrum is evaluated by the semiclassical distorted wave (SCDW)
method. The explicit comparison of the strength function with that of the
Green-function method demonstrates the quantitative reliability of the SCDW
approximation. It is presumed that the presently available data at the $\Xi$
production threshold region does not necessarily imply the attractive strength
of about 15 MeV for the $\Xi$-nucleus potential in a conventional Woods-Saxon
form. Instead, an almost zero potential is preferable.
