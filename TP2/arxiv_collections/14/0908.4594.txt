Physics from beyond the Standard Model can induce four fermion operators
involving a quark, an anti-quark, a lepton and an anti-lepton. The coefficients
of these operators can be constrained by various observations. We update the
bounds arising from tree level processes (rare lepton and meson decays, atomic
parity violation, contact interaction and mu-e conversion) using experimental
values given in the Particle Data Book 2008.
