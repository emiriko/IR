A pair of two-level systems initially prepared in different thermal states
and coupled to an external reversible work source, do not in general reach a
common temperature at the end of a unitary work extraction process. We define
an effective temperature for the final nonequilibrium but passive state of the
bipartite quantum system and analyse its properties.
