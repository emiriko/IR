To address the problem of unsupervised outlier detection in wireless sensor
networks, we develop an approach that (1) is flexible with respect to the
outlier definition, (2) computes the result in-network to reduce both bandwidth
and energy usage,(3) only uses single hop communication thus permitting very
simple node failure detection and message reliability assurance mechanisms
(e.g., carrier-sense), and (4) seamlessly accommodates dynamic updates to data.
We examine performance using simulation with real sensor data streams. Our
results demonstrate that our approach is accurate and imposes a reasonable
communication load and level of power consumption.
