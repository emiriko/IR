We calculate the finite-temperature shift of the critical wavevector $Q_{c}$
of the Pokrovsky-Talapov model using a renormalization-group analysis.
Separating the Hamiltonian into a part that is renormalized and one that is
not, we obtain the flow equations for the stiffness and an arbitrary potential.
We then specialize to the case of a cosine potential, and compare our results
to well-known results for the sine-Gordon model, to which our model reduces in
the limit of vanishing driving wavevector Q=0. Our results may be applied to
describe the commensurate-incommensurate phase transition in several physical
systems and allow for a more realistic comparison with experiments, which are
always carried out at a finite temperature.
