Answering an informal question of K. Park, we show that by fixing some
irrational alpha to have a particular standard continued fraction expansion, we
may force the associated discrepancy sequences for all x in [0,1), which track
the difference between the number of values in the orbit of x under rotation by
alpha (modulo one) less than one half versus the number larger than one half,
to have maximal values which grow at a prescribed rate.
