Electron gases in metals are described as quantum charged Newtonian viscous
fluids experiencing Ohmic Darcy friction on the solid lattice ions as well. The
dispersion relation of the electron acoustic waves is derived, which shows the
existence of new quantum diffusion processes. The electric double layer near a
metal surface is studied, which exhibits a quantum oscillatory-decaying
behavior different from the Friedel oscillations.
