We evaluate the cross sections for new heavy fermion production at three
Large Hadron Collider energies accurate to next-to-leading order in
perturbative quantum chromodynamics. We treat the cases of pair production of
heavy quarks via strong interactions, single heavy quark production via
electroweak interactions, and the production of heavy leptons. Theoretical
uncertainties associated with the choice of the renormalization scale and the
parton distribution functions are specified. We derive a simple and useful
parameterization of our results which should facilitate phenomenological
studies of new physics models that predict new heavy quarks and/or leptons.
