We report on a CDF measurement of the total cross section and rapidity
distribution, $d\sigma/dy$, for $q\bar{q}\to \gamma^{*}/Z\to e^{+}e^{-}$ events
in the $Z$ boson mass region ($66<M_{ee}<116$GeV/c$^2$) produced in $p\bar{p}$
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$TeV with 2.1fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.
The measured cross section of $257\pm16$pb and $d\sigma/dy$ distribution are
compared with Next-to-Leading-Order(NLO) and
Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Order(NNLO) QCD theory predictions with CTEQ and
MRST/MSTW parton distribution functions (PDFs). There is good agreement between
the experimental total cross section and $d\sigma/dy$ measurements with
theoretical calculations with the most recent NNLO PDFs.
