The paper focuses on the accuracy improvement of stiffness models for
parallel manipulators, which are employed in high-speed precision machining. It
is based on the integrated methodology that combines analytical and numerical
techniques and deals with multidimensional lumped-parameter models of the
links. The latter replace the link flexibility by localized 6-dof virtual
springs describing both translational/rotational compliance and the coupling
between them. There is presented detailed accuracy analysis of the stiffness
identification procedures employed in the commercial CAD systems (including
statistical analysis of round-off errors, evaluating the confidence intervals
for stiffness matrices). The efficiency of the developed technique is confirmed
by application examples, which deal with stiffness analysis of translational
parallel manipulators.
