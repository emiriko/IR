Using observations made with the XMM-Newton Observatory, we report the first
X-ray detection of the high magnetic field radio pulsar PSR B1916+14. We show
that the X-ray spectrum of the pulsar can be well fitted with an absorbed
blackbody with temperature in the range of 0.08-0.23 keV, or a neutron star
hydrogen atmosphere model with best-fit effective temperature of $\sim$0.10
keV, higher than expected from fast cooling models. The origin of the likely
thermal emission is not well constrained by our short observation and is
consistent with initial cooling or return-current heating. We found no
pulsations in these data and set a 1$\sigma$ upper limit on the pulsed fraction
in the 0.1--2 keV band of $\sim$0.7. Implications of these results for our
understanding of the different observational properties of isolated neutron
stars are discussed.
