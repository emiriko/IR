We consider topological invariant describing the vacuum states of superfluid
3He-B, which belongs to the special class of time-reversal invariant
topological insulators and superfluids. Discrete symmetries important for
classification of the topologically distinct vacuum states are discussed. One
of them leads to the additional subclasses of 3He-B states and is responsible
for the finite density of states of Majorana fermions living at some interfaces
between the bulk states. Integer valued topological invariant is expressed in
terms of the Green's function, which allows us to consider systems with
interaction.
