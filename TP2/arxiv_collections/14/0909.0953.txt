I report on the theory, recent calculations and present status of the
hadronic light-by-light contribution to muon g-2. In particular, I report on
work done together with Eduardo de Rafael and Arkady Vainshtein where we get
a^{HLbL} = (10.5 +- 2.6) x 10^{-10} as our present result for this quantity.
