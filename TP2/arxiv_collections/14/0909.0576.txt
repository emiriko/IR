Wireless Sensor networks (WSN) is an emerging technology and have great
potential to be employed in critical situations like battlefields and
commercial applications such as building, traffic surveillance, habitat
monitoring and smart homes and many more scenarios. One of the major challenges
wireless sensor networks face today is security. While the deployment of sensor
nodes in an unattended environment makes the networks vulnerable to a variety
of potential attacks, the inherent power and memory limitations of sensor nodes
makes conventional security solutions unfeasible. The sensing technology
combined with processing power and wireless communication makes it profitable
for being exploited in great quantity in future. The wireless communication
technology also acquires various types of security threats. This paper
discusses a wide variety of attacks in WSN and their classification mechanisms
and different securities available to handle them including the challenges
faced.
