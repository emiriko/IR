A hybrid lattice-statistical model of doubly decorated two-dimensional
lattices, which have localized Ising spins at its nodal sites and itinerant
electrons delocalized over decorating sites, is exactly solved with the help of
a generalized decoration-iteration transformation. Under the assumption of a
quarter filling of each couple of the decorating sites, the ground state
constitutes either spontaneously long-range ordered ferromagnetic or
ferrimagnetic phase in dependence on whether the ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic interaction between the localized Ising spins and itinerant
electrons is considered. The critical temperature of the spontaneously
long-range ordered phases monotonically increases upon strengthening the ratio
between the kinetic term and the Ising-type exchange interaction.
