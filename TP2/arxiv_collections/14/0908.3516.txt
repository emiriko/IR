We demonstrate a source of photon pairs with widely separated wavelengths,
810 nm and 1548 nm, generated through spontaneous four-wave mixing in a
microstructured fiber. The second-order auto-correlation function g^{(2)}(0)
was measured to confirm the non-classical nature of a heralded single photon
source constructed from the fiber. The microstructured fiber presented herein
has the interesting property of generating photon pairs with wavelengths
suitable for a quantum repeater able to link free-space channels with fiber
channels, as well as for a high quality telecommunication wavelength heralded
single photon source. It also has the advantage of straightforward coupling
into optical fiber. These reasons make this photon pair source particularly
interesting for long distance quantum communication.
