We propose to realize quantized discrete kinks with cold trapped ions. We
show that long-lived solitonlike configurations are manifested as deformations
of the zigzag structure in the linear Paul trap, and are topologically
protected in a circular trap with an odd number of ions. We study the
quantum-mechanical time evolution of a high-frequency, gap separated internal
mode of a static kink and find long coherence times when the system is cooled
to the Doppler limit. The spectral properties of the internal modes make them
ideally suited for manipulation using current technology. This suggests that
ion traps can be used to test quantum-mechanical effects with solitons and
explore ideas for the utilization of the solitonic internal-modes as carriers
of quantum information.
