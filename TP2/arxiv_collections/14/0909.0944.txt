The Feynman propagator for a free bosonic scalar field on the discrete
spacetime of a causal set is presented. The formalism includes scalar field
operators and a vacuum state which define a scalar quantum field theory on a
causal set. This work can be viewed as a novel regularisation of quantum field
theory based on a Lorentz invariant discretisation of spacetime.
