It is shown that type I seesaw models based on the standard model Lagrangian
extended with three heavy Majorana right-handed fields do not have leptogenesis
in leading order, if the symmetries of mass matrices are also the residual
symmetry of the Lagrangian. In particular, flavor models that lead to a
mass-independent leptonic mixing have a vanishing leptogenesis CP asymmetry.
Based on symmetry arguments, we prove that in these models the Dirac-neutrino
Yukawa coupling combinations relevant for leptogenesis are diagonal in the
physical basis where the charged leptons and heavy Majorana neutrinos are
diagonal.
