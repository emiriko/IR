A new measurement of the inclusive DIS ep cross section using H1 data from
the year 2000 is performed and combined with published results using 1996/97
data. The new data covers the region of Q2 from 12 to 150 GeV2 at HERA with
unprecedented accuracy. The structure Function F2 is extracted and studied. A
QCD analysis, H1PDF 2009, is performed including the new and published H1
inclusive measurements.
