Poles of solutions to the Painleve-I equation are intimately related to the
theory of the cubic anharmonic oscillator. In particular, poles of integrale
tritronquee are in 1-1 correspondence with cubic oscillators that admit the
simultaneous solutions of two quantization conditions. We analyze this pair of
quantization conditions by means of a suitable version of the complex WKB
method.
