The aim of these proceedings is to present the main predictions of the
Randall-Sundrum model with custodial protection for particle-antiparticle
mixing and rare decays of K and B_(s,d) mesons, putting particular attention on
the testability of the resulting NP effects at future experiments. Before
giving numerical results, we discuss theoretical expectations, residing in the
flavor structure of the model. The high energy scale M_KK is chosen in such a
way that direct searches of new particles at the LHC are possible, still being
consistent with electroweak precision observables.
