We investigate the violation of non-local realism using entangled coherent
states (ECS) under nonlinear operations and homodyne measurements. We address
recently proposed Leggett-type inequalities, including a class of optimized
incompatibility ones and thoroughly assess the effects of detection
inefficiency.
