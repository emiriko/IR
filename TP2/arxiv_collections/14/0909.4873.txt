We give a pedagogical introduction to the basics of deformations of
relativistic symmetries and the Hilbert spaces of free quantum fields built as
their representations. We focus in particular on the example of a
$\kappa$-deformed scalar quantum field for which the generators of spatial
translations that label the field modes act according to a deformed Leibnitz
rule. We explore the richer structure of the $\kappa$-Fock space and point out
possible physical consequences of the deformation.
