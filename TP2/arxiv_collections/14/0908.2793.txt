Metric coinduction is a form of coinduction that can be used to establish
properties of objects constructed as a limit of finite approximations. One can
prove a coinduction step showing that some property is preserved by one step of
the approximation process, then automatically infer by the coinduction
principle that the property holds of the limit object. This can often be used
to avoid complicated analytic arguments involving limits and convergence,
replacing them with simpler algebraic arguments. This paper examines the
application of this principle in a variety of areas, including infinite
streams, Markov chains, Markov decision processes, and non-well-founded sets.
These results point to the usefulness of coinduction as a general proof
technique.
