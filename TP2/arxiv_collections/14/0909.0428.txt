We analyze long range rapidity correlations observed in the STAR experiment
at RHIC. Our goal is to extract properties of the two particle correlation
matrix, accounting for the analysis method of the STAR experiment. We find a
surprisingly large correlation strength for central collisions of gold nuclei
at highest RHIC energies. We argue that such correlations cannot be the result
of impact parameter fluctuations.
