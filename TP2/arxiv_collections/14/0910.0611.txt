We study the phantom-like behavior of a DGP-inspired braneworld scenario
where curvature correction on the brane is taken into account. We include a
possible modification of the induced gravity on the brane by incorporating
higher order curvature terms of Gauss-Bonnet type. We investigate the
cosmological implications of the model and we show that the normal branch of
the scenario self-accelerates in this modified scenario without introducing any
dark energy component. Also, a phantom-like behavior can be realized in this
model without introducing any phantom field that suffers from serious
difficulties such as violation of the null energy condition.
