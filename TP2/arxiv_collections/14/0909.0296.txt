We present calculations of the intensity of polariton-mediated inelastic
light scattering in semiconductor microcavities within a Green's function
framework. In addition to reproducing the strong coupling of light and matter,
this method also enables the inclusion of damping mechanisms in a consistent
way. Our results show excellent agreement with recent Raman scattering
experiments.
