Prediction of a vector of ordered parameters or part of it arises naturally
in the context of Small Area Estimation (SAE). For example, one may want to
estimate the parameters associated with the top ten areas, the best or worst
area, or a certain percentile. We use a simple SAE model to show that
estimation of ordered parameters by the corresponding ordered estimates of each
area separately does not yield good results with respect to MSE. Shrinkage-type
predictors, with an appropriate amount of shrinkage for the particular problem
of ordered parameters, are considerably better, and their performance is close
to that of the optimal predictors, which cannot in general be computed
explicitly.
