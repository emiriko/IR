We present Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS 24mu archival observations for 28 brown
dwarfs in the Upper Scorpius (UppSco) region. We find a disk fraction of
10.7%^(+8.7%)_(-3.3%). One object shows a small excess at 24mu but none at
shorter wavelengths, and may be a candidate transition disk. Three objects show
emission in the 10mu silicate feature and we present compositional fits for
these sources. Flat structures are observed for all disk sources in UppSco.
Also presented are the MIPS/70mu observations for the TW Hydrae Association
brown dwarf 2MASS J1139511-315921. We discuss the structure and chemistry of
brown dwarf disks at ages of ~5-10 Myr, and consider the possible effects of
the brown dwarf densities in these clusters on the disk lifetimes.
