We apply the idea of giant slow wave resonance associated with a degenerate
photonic band edge to gain enhancement of active media. This approach allows to
dramatically reduce the size of slow wave resonator while improving its
performance as gain enhancer for light amplification and lasing. It also allows
to reduce the lasing threshold of the slow wave optical resonator by at least
an order of magnitude.
