In this paper, we study the role of coherent states in the realm of quantum
cosmology, both in a second-quantized single universe and in a third-quantized
quantum multiverse. In particular, most emphasis will be paid to the quantum
description of multiverses made up of accelerated universes. We have shown that
the quantum states involved at a quantum mechanical multiverse whose single
universes are accelerated are given by squeezed states having no classical
analogs.
