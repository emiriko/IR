We study a specific texture of the neutrino mass matrix, namely the models
with one $2\times 2$ subdeterminant equal to zero. We carry out a complete
phenomenological analysis with all possible relevant correlations. Every
pattern of the six possible ones is found able to accommodate the experimental
data, with three cases allowing also for non-invertible mass matrices. We
present symmetry realizations for all the models.
