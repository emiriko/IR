In this work Controlled phase shift gates are implemented on a qaudrupolar
system, by using non-adiabatic geometric phases. A general procedure is given,
for implementing controlled phase shift gates in an 'N' level system. The
utility of such controlled phase shift gates, is demonstrated here by
implementing 3-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on a 7/2 quadrupolar nucleus
oriented in a liquid crystal matrix.
