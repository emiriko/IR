We discuss the applications of Random Matrix Theory in the context of
financial markets and econometric models, a topic about which a considerable
number of papers have been devoted to in the last decade. This mini-review is
intended to guide the reader through various theoretical results (the
Marcenko-Pastur spectrum and its various generalisations, random SVD, free
matrices, largest eigenvalue statistics, etc.) as well as some concrete
applications to portfolio optimisation and out-of-sample risk estimation.
