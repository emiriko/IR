We present a set of low resolution empirical SED templates for AGNs and
galaxies in the wavelength range from 0.03 to 30 microns based on the
multi-wavelength photometric observations of the NOAO Deep-Wide Field Survey
Bootes field and the spectroscopic observations of the AGN and Galaxy Evolution
Survey. Our training sample is comprised of 14448 galaxies in the redshift
range 0<~z<~1 and 5347 likely AGNs in the range 0<~z<~5.58. We use our
templates to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies and AGNs. While they
are relatively accurate for galaxies, their accuracies for AGNs are a strong
function of the luminosity ratio between the AGN and galaxy components.
Somewhat surprisingly, the relative luminosities of the AGN and its host are
well determined even when the photometric redshift is significantly in error.
We also use our templates to study the mid-IR AGN selection criteria developed
by Stern et al.(2005) and Lacy et al.(2004). We find that the Stern et
al.(2005) criteria suffers from significant incompleteness when there is a
strong host galaxy component and at z =~ 4.5, when the broad Halpha emission
line is redshifted into the [3.6] band, but that it is little contaminated by
low and intermediate redshift galaxies. The Lacy et al.(2004) criterion is not
affected by incompleteness at z =~ 4.5 and is somewhat less affected by strong
galaxy host components, but is heavily contaminated by low redshift star
forming galaxies. Finally, we use our templates to predict the color-color
distribution of sources in the upcoming WISE mission and define a color
criterion to select AGNs analogous to those developed for IRAC photometry. We
estimate that in between 640,000 and 1,700,000 AGNs will be identified by these
criteria, but will have serious completeness problems for z >~ 3.4.
