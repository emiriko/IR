Any residual coupling of a quantum computer to the environment results in
computational errors. Encoding quantum information in a so-called
decoherence-free subspace provides means to avoid these errors. Despite
tremendous progress in employing this technique to extend memory storage times
by orders of magnitude, computation within such subspaces has been scarce.
Here, we demonstrate the realization of a universal set of quantum gates acting
on decoherence-free ion qubits. We combine these gates to realize the first
controlled-NOT gate within a decoherence-free, scalable quantum computer.
