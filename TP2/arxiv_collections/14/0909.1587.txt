The Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, based on a slice of warped 5D spacetime, was
originally introduced to explain the apparent hierarchy between the scales of
weak and gravitational interactions. Over the past decade, this model has been
extended to provide a predictive theory of flavor, as well as to address
various constraints from precision data. In this talk, we will present a brief
review of the RS model and some of its extensions. A survey of some key
signatures of realistic warped models and the experimental challenges they pose
will be presented. We will also consider truncated warped scenarios that
address smaller hierarchies and discuss why their discovery can have improved
prospects, at the LHC.
