A solar neutron detector has been launched on the Japan Exposure Module (JEM)
of the International Space Station (ISS) in August 4, 2009. The detector works
satsifactory. The detector comprises scintillation fiber and is designated as
the Space Environment Data Acquisition (SEDA)-FIB. It tracks the recoil protons
induced by neutrons and measurement of the proton energy using the range
method. The energy resolution of the detector was measured using the proton
beam at Riken. Herein, we report the energy resolution of the FIB detector by
two different methods.
