The full counting statistics for the charge transport through an undoped
graphene sheet in the presence of strong potential impurities is studied.
Treating the scattering off the impurity in the s-wave approximation, we
calculate the impurity correction to the cumulant generating function. This
correction is universal provided the impurity strength is tuned to a resonant
value. In particular, the conductance of the sample acquires a correction of
16e^2/(pi^2 h) per resonant impurity.
