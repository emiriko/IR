Let G be the group preserving a nondegenerate sesquilinear form on a vector
space V, and H a symmetric subgroup of G of the type G1 x G2. We explicitly
parameterize the H-orbits in the Grassmannian of r-dimensional isotropic
subspaces of V by a complete set of H-invariants. We describe the Bruhat order
in terms of the majorization relationship over a diagram of these H-invariants.
The inclusion order, the stabilizer, the orbit dimension, the open H-orbits,
the decompositions of an H orbit into H\cap G_0 and H_0 orbits are also
explicitly described.
