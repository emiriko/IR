We report on a set of 5 GHz Urumqi observations of the galaxy M82, made
between August 2005 and May 2009. From the resulting flux densities, we detect
a strong flare, starting in March or April and peaking in June 2008. We
identify this flare with supernova SN 2008iz. The time sampling of the radio
light curve allows us to obtain information on the precursor mass-loss rate,
the strength of the magnetic field in the radiating region, the explosion date,
and the deceleration of the expanding shock. We also check the possible
contribution of Synchrotron Self Absorption (SSA) to the radio light curve and
compare our model with other observations of the supernova at 22 GHz.
