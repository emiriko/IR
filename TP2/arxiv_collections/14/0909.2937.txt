We propose a model of neutrino mass generation in extra dimension. Allowing a
large lepton number violation on a distant brane spatially separated from the
standard model brane, a small neutrino mass is naturally generated due to an
exponential suppression of the messenger field in the 5D bulk. The model
accommodates a large Yukawa coupling with the singlet neutrino (n_R) which may
change the standard Higgs search and can simultaneously accommodate visible
lepton number violation at the electroweak scale, which leads to very
interesting phenomenology at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.
