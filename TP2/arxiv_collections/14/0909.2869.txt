We have completed a pilot survey imaging 15 SDSS selected void galaxies in HI
in local (d=50 to 100 Mpc) voids. This small sample makes up a surprisingly
interesting collection of galaxies, consisting of galaxies with asymmetric and
perturbed HI disks, previously unidentified companions, and ongoing
interactions. One was found to have a polar HI disk with no stellar
counterpart. While our small number statistics so far are limiting, results
support past findings that most void galaxies are typically late type galaxies
with gas rich disks and small scale clustering similar to field galaxies
despite their large scale underdense environment.
