The canonical extension of a lattice is in an essential way a two-sided
completion. Domain theory, on the contrary, is primarily concerned with
one-sided completeness. In this paper, we show two things. Firstly, that the
canonical extension of a lattice can be given an asymmetric description in two
stages: a free co-directed meet completion, followed by a completion by
\emph{selected} directed joins. Secondly, we show that the general techniques
for dcpo presentations of dcpo algebras used in the second stage of the
construction immediately give us the well-known canonicity result for bounded
lattices with operators.
