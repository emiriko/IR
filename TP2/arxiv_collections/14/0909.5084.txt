This talk presents some of the results of the re-analysis of [Graczyk et al.]
of the bubble chamber data for single pion production induced by neutrino
scattering off deuteron. It is shown that ANL and BNL data are statistically
consistent. The validity of the Adler relations (between $P_{33}(1232)$
resonance axial form factors) is also investigated.
