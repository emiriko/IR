We present elemental abundances of 13 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in
the Galactic bulge, which constitute the largest sample to date. We show that
these stars span the full range of metallicity from Fe/H=-0.8 to +0.4, and that
they follow well-defined abundance trends, coincident with those of the
Galactic thick disc.
