Handwriting is an alternative method for entering texts which composed Short
Message Services. However, a whole new language features the texts which are
produced. They include for instance abbreviations and other consonantal writing
which sprung up for time saving and fashion. We have collected and processed a
significant number of such handwritten SMS, and used various strategies to
tackle this challenging area of handwriting recognition. We proposed to study
more specifically three different phenomena: consonant skeleton, rebus, and
phonetic writing. For each of them, we compare the rough results produced by a
standard recognition system with those obtained when using a specific language
model to take care of them.
