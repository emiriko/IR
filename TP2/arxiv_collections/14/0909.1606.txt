The master formula approach to chiral symmetry breaking proposed by Yamagishi
and Zahed is extended to the U_R(3)xU_L(3) group, in which effects of the
U_A(1) anomaly and the flavor symmetry breaking m_u \not= m_d \not= m_s are
properly contained. New identities for the gluon topological susceptibility and
pi^0, eta, eta' -> gamma^(*) gamma^(*) decays are derived, which exactly embody
the consequence from broken chiral symmetry in QCD without relying on any
unphysical limit.
