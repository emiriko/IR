We demonstrate that the dark soliton trains in optical fibers with a zero of
the group velocity dispersion can generate broad spectral distribution
(continuum) associated with the resonant dispersive radiation emitted by
solitons. This radiation is either enhanced or suppressed by the Raman
scattering depending on the sign of the third order dispersion.
