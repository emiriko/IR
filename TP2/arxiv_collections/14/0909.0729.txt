Using density functional theory, we investigate the possible adsorption sites
of CO molecules on the recently discovered Pt induced Ge nanowires on Ge(001).
Calculated STM images are compared to experimental STM images to identify the
experimentally observed adsorption sites. The CO molecules are found to adsorb
preferably onto the Pt atoms between the Ge nanowire dimer segments. This
adsorption site places the CO in between two nanowire dimers, pushing them
outward, blocking the nearest equivalent adsorption sites. This explains the
observed long-range repulsive interaction between CO molecules on these Pt
induced nanowires.
