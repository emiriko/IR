Existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions is studied for a set of
nonlinear fixed point equations which define self-consistent hydrostatic
equilibria of a classical continuum fluid that is confined inside a container
and in contact with either a heat and a matter reservoir, or just a heat
reservoir. The local thermodynamics is furnished by the statistical mechanics
of a system of hard balls, in the approximation of Carnahan-Starling. The
fluid's local chemical potential per particle at is the sum of the matter
reservoir's contribution and a self contribution which is computed by
convoluting the fluid density distribution with a van der Waals, a Yukawa, or a
Newton kernel. We prove the existence of a grand canonical phase transition,
and a petit canonical phase transition which is embedded in the former.
