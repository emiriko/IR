In laser-plasma interactions it is widely accepted that a non-uniform
interaction surface will invariably seed hydrodynamic instabilities and a
growth in the amplitude of the initial modulation. Recent experimental results
[Dromey, Nat. Phys. 2009] have demonstrated that there must be target smoothing
in femtosecond timescale relativistic interactions, contrary to prevailing
expectation. In this paper we develop a theoretical description of the physical
process that underlies this novel phenomena. We show that the surface dynamics
in the few-cycle relativistic regime is dominated by the coherent electron
motion resulting in a smoothing of the electron surface. This stabilization of
plasma surfaces is unique in laser-plasma interactions and demonstrates that
dynamics in the few-cycle regime differ fundamentally from the longer pulse
regimes. This has important consequences for applications such as radiation
pressure acceleration of protons and ions and harmonic generation from
relativistically oscillating surfaces.
