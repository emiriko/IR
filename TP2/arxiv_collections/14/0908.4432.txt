In an earlier article, we presented a method to obtain integrals of motion
and polynomial algebras for a class of two-dimensional superintegrable systems
from creation and annihilation operators. We discuss the general case and
present its polynomial algebra. We will show how this polynomial algebra can be
directly realized as a deformed oscillator algebra. This particular algebraic
structure allows to find the unitary representations and the corresponding
energy spectrum. We apply this construction to a family of caged anisotropic
oscillators. The method can be used to generate new superintegrable systems
with higher order integrals. We obtain new superintegrable systems involving
the fourth Painleve transcendent and present their integrals of motion and
polynomial algebras.
