We present a high resolving power ($\lambda$ / $\Delta\lambda$ = 90,000) and
high signal-to-noise ratio ($\sim$700) spectral atlas of Vega covering the 3850
-- 6860 \AA wavelength range. The atlas is a result of averaging of spectra
recorded with the aid of the echelle spectrograph BOES fed by the 1.8-m
telescope at Bohyunsan observatory (Korea). The atlas is provided only in
machine-readable form (electronic data file) and will be available in the
SIMBAD database upon publication.
