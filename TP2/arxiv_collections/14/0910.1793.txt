Motivated by the observation of spatially anisotropic exchange constants in
the iron pnictide materials, we study the spin-wave spectra of the
$J_{1a}-J_{1b}-J_{2}$ Heisenberg models on a square-lattice with nearest
neighbor exchange $J_{1a}$ along x and $J_{1b}$ along y axis and a second
neighbor exchange $J_2$. We focus on the regime, where the spins order at
($\pi,0$), and compute the spectra by systematic expansions around the Ising
limit. We study both spin-half and spin-one Heisenberg models as well as a
range of parameters to cover various cases proposed for the iron pnictide
materials. The low-energy spectra have anisotropic spin-wave velocities and are
renormalized with respect to linear spin-wave theory by up to 20 percent,
depending on parameters. Extreme anisotropy, consisting of a ferromagnetic
$J_{1b}=- |J_F|$, is best distinguished from a weak anisotropy ($J_{1a}\approx
J_{1b}=J_1$, $J_2>J_1/2$) by the nature of the spin-waves near the wavevectors
($0,\pi$) or ($\pi,\pi$). The reported spectra for the pnictide material
CaFe$_2$As$_2$ clearly imply such an extreme anisotropy.
