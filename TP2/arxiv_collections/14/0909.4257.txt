The quark Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix is a fundamental part of
the Standard Model accurately determined to fit world data analysis. In this
paper the CKM matrix elements are high accurately rendered via simple compact
parameterization by one small dimensionless parameter. Unique value of the KM
CP-violating phase -65.53 deg is derived in agreement with fitting the data
Wolfenstein parameterization. With the three mixing angles and CP-violating
phase quantitatively determined, the complete content of the CKM global fit in
the SM is accurately reproduced within the small relative 1 S.D. ranges in the
form of a united system. Parameterization of the neutrino
Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagava-Sakata mixing matrix by the same parameter in
agreement with available data is related to the quark CKM one by the idea of
quark-neutrino mixing angle complementarity extended to the relation between
Dirac CP-violating phases.
