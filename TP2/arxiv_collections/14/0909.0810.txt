The Nainital-Cape survey is a dedicated research programme to search and
study pulsational variability in chemically peculiar stars in the Northern
Hemisphere. The aim of the survey is to search such chemically peculiar stars
which are pulsationally unstable. The observations of the sample stars were
carried out in high-speed photometric mode using a three-channel fast
photometer attached to the 1.04-m Sampurnanand telescope at ARIES. The new
photometric observations confirmed that the pulsational period of star HD25515
is 2.78-hrs. The repeated time-series observations of HD113878 and HD118660
revealed that previously known frequencies are indeed present in the new data
sets. We have estimated the distances, absolute magnitudes, effective
temperatures and luminosities of these stars. Their positions in the H-R
diagram indicate that HD25515 and HD118660 lie near the main-sequence while
HD113878 is an evolved star. We also present a catalogue of 61 stars classified
as null results, along with the corresponding 87 frequency spectra taken over
the time scale 2002-2008. A statistical analysis of these null results shows,
by comparison with past data, that the power of the noise in the light curves
has slightly increased during the last few years.
