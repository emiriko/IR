We report the detection by the AGILE satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flare
from the powerful gamma-ray quasar PKS 1510-089, during a pointing centered on
the Galactic Center region from 1 March to 30 March 2008. This source has been
continuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the GLAST-AGILE Support
Program (GASP) of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT). Moreover, the
gamma-ray flaring episode triggered three ToO observations by the Swift
satellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 March 2008. In the period
1-16 March 2008, AGILE detected gamma-ray emission from PKS 1510-089 at a
significance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of
(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 MeV.
After a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 March 2008, AGILE
detected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux
(E > 100 MeV) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak level
of (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. During
the observing period January-April 2008, the source also showed an intense and
variable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significant
increase of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. Moreover, in the
X-ray band the Swift/XRT observations seem to show an harder-when-brighter
behaviour of the source spectrum. The spectral energy distribution of mid-March
2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self Compton emission
plus contributions from inverse Compton scattering of external photons from
both the accretion disc and the broad line region. Indeed, some features in the
optical-UV spectrum seem to indicate the presence of Seyfert-like components,
such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.
