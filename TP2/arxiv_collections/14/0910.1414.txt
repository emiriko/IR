Electronic transport characteristics through a single phenalenyl molecule
sandwiched between two metallic electrodes are investigated by the use of
Green's function technique. A parametric approach, based on the tight-binding
model, is used to study the transport characteristics through such molecular
bridge system. The electronic transport properties are significantly influenced
by (a) the molecule-to-electrode interface structure and (b) the
molecule-to-electrode coupling strength.
