In the Israel-Stewart's theory of dissipative hydrodynamics, we have analysed
the STAR data on $\phi$ meson production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=200
GeV. From a simultaneous fit to $\phi$ mesons multiplicity, mean $p_T$ and
integrated $v_2$, we obtain a phenomenological estimate of QGP viscosity,
$\eta/s =0.07 \pm 0.03 \pm 0.14$, the first error is due to the experimental
uncertainty in STAR measurements, the second reflects the uncertainties in
initial and final conditions of the fluid.
