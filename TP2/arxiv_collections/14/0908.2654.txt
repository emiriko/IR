We describe an extension of the cosmological hydrodynamics code ENZO to
include the self-consistent transport of ionizing radiation modeled in the
flux-limited diffusion approximation. A novel feature of our algorithm is a
coupled implicit solution of radiation transport, ionization kinetics, and gas
photoheating, making the timestepping for this portion of the calculation
resolution independent. The implicit system is coupled to the explicit
cosmological hydrodynamics through operator splitting and solved with scalable
multigrid methods. We summarize the numerical method, present a verification
test on cosmological Stromgren spheres, and then apply it to the problem of
cosmological hydrogen reionization.
