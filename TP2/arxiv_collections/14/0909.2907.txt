We show that non-local Popescu-Rohrlich correlations can be observed in the
post-selected results of binned position measurements on a two-party gaussian
state. Our experiment is based on the spatial correlations of entangled photons
and lens systems. We obtain a maximum violation of the CHSH inequality of 3.42,
which corresponds to the implementation of a non-local AND gate with success
probability of 0.93. These results do not conflict with quantum mechanics due
to the post-selection required, and open up the possibility of experimental
investigation of fundamental aspects of Popescu-Rohrlich non-locality with a
reliable and simple experimental setup.
