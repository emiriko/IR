Hard exclusive leptoproduction of real photons from an unpolarized proton
target is studied in an effort to elucidate generalized parton distributions.
The data accumulated during the years 1996--2005 with the HERMES spectrometer
are analyzed to yield asymmetries with respect to the combined dependence of
the cross section on beam helicity and charge, thereby revealing previously
unseparated contributions from deeply virtual Compton scattering and its
interference with the Bethe--Heitler process. The integrated luminosity is
sufficient to show correlated dependences on two kinematic variables, and
provides the most precise determination of the dependence on only the beam
charge.
