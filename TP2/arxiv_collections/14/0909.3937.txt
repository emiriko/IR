It is shown that a simple modification of the geometry in which Raman lasers
are applied to a cold gas in an optical lattice results in transforming the
emerging effective electromagnetic field into a pure gauge. This contrived
gauge-away effect can be observed experimentally by measuring the
Mott-Insulator to Superfluid critical point. The underlying mechanism for this
phenomenon is the ability to engineer the transfer of the transverse component
of the gauge potential into its longitudinal one.
