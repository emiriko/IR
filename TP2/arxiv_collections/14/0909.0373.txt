We study the symmetry of Cooper pair in a two-dimensional Hubbard model with
the Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction as a minimal model of electron gas
generated at a heterointerface of SrTiO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$. Solving the Eliashberg
equation based on the third-order perturbation theory, we find that the gap
function consists of the mixing of the spin-singlet $d_{xy}$-wave component and
the spin-triplet $(p_x\pm ip_y)$-wave one due to the broken inversion symmetry
originating from the Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. The ratio of the
d-wave and the p-wave component continuously changes with the carrier
concentration. We propose that the pairing symmetry is controlled by tuning the
gate voltage.
