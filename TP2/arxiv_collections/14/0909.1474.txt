Optical metamaterials have the potential to control the flow of light at will
which may lead to spectacular applications as the perfect lens or the cloaking
device. Both of these optical elements require invariant effective material
properties (permittivity, permeability) for all spatial frequencies involved in
the imaging process. However, it turned out that due to the mesoscopic nature
of current metamaterials spatial dispersion prevents to meet this requirement;
rendering them far away from being applicable for the purpose of imaging. A
solution to this problem is not straightforwardly at hand since metamaterials
are usually designed in forward direction; implying that the optical properties
are only evaluated for a specific metamaterial. Here we lift these limitations.
Methodically, we suggest a procedure to design metamaterials with a predefined
characteristic of light propagation. Optically, we show that metamaterials can
be optimized such that they exhibit either an isotropic response or permit
diffractionless propagation.
