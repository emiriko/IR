A detailed study of the angular, energy and polarization dependences of the
electric dipolar (E1: 2p->5d) and quadrupolar (E2: 2p->4f) contributions to the
x-ray scattering cross-section is presented for holmium in its basal plane
spiral antiferromagnetic phase at the L3 edge. The corresponding E1 and E2
scattering factors have been extracted from fits to the experimental energy
line shapes taking into account for the first time a split dipole resonance.
Using the imaginary part of the resonant scattering factors to retrieve the
XMCD spectrum, we find qualitative agreement with the dichroic spectrum
measured in transmission through a holmium foil.
