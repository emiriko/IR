Exchange interaction strongly influences the long-range behavior of localized
electron orbitals and quantum tunneling amplitudes.In the Hartree-Fock
approximation the exchange produces a power-law decay instead of the usual
exponential decrease at large distances. To show that this effect is real (i.e.
not a result of the approximation) we consider a simple model where different
effects may be accurately analyzed. Applications include huge enhancement of
inner electron ionization by a static electric field or laser field considered
