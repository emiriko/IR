In this work we discuss the interest of measuring the ratio of of $p\bar p$
annihilation into kaon and pion pairs near the threshold region, where $S$
state dominates. It is shown that a good agreement with existing data on the
ratio of the yields of charged kaon to pion pairs is obtained taking into
account not only quark rearrangement in the incident hadrons, but also vacuum
excitations.
