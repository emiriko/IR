We report on the attainment of Bose-Einstein condensation with ultracold
strontium atoms. We use the 84Sr isotope, which has a low natural abundance but
offers excellent scattering properties for evaporative cooling. Accumulation in
a metastable state using a magnetic-trap, narrowline cooling, and
straightforward evaporative cooling in an optical trap lead to pure condensates
containing 1.5x10^5 atoms. This puts 84Sr in a prime position for future
experiments on quantum-degenerate gases involving atomic two-electron systems.
