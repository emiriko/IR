The potential for a precise measurement of the Unitarity Triangle angle
$\gamma$ in future experiments from the decay $B^0 \to DK^{*0}$ is well-known.
It has recently been suggested that the sensitivity can be significantly
enhanced by analysing the $B^0 \to DK^+\pi^-$ Dalitz plot to extract amplitudes
relative to those of the flavour-specific decay $B^0 \to D_2^{*-}K^+$. An
extension to this method which includes the case where the neutral $D$ meson is
reconstructed in suppressed final states is presented. The sensitivity to
$\gamma$ is estimated using this method and compared to that obtained using the
$B^0 \to DK^{*0}$ decay alone. Experimental effects, such as background
contamination, are also considered. This approach appears to be a highly
attractive addition to the family of methods that can be used to determine
$\gamma$.
