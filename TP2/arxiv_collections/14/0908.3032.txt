We measure the angle between the planetary orbit and the stellar rotation
axis in the transiting planetary system CoRoT-1, with new HIRES/Keck and
FORS/VLT high-accuracy photometry. The data indicate a highly tilted system,
with a projected spin-orbit angle lambda = 77 +- 11 degrees. Systematic
uncertainties in the radial velocity data could cause the actual errors to be
larger by an unknown amount, and this result needs to be confirmed with further
high-accuracy spectroscopic transit measurements.
  Spin-orbit alignment has now been measured in a dozen extra-solar planetary
systems, and several show strong misalignment. The first three misaligned
planets were all much more massive than Jupiter and followed eccentric orbits.
CoRoT-1, however, is a jovian-mass close-in planet on a circular orbit. If its
strong misalignment is confirmed, it would break this pattern. The high
occurence of misaligned systems for several types of planets and orbits favours
planet-planet scattering as a mechanism to bring gas giants on very close
orbits.
