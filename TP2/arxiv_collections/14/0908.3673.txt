We propose the implementation of fast resonant gates in circuit quantum
electrodynamics for quantum information processing. We show how a suitable
utilization of three-level superconducting qubits inside a resonator
constitutes a key tool to perform diverse two-qubit resonant gates, improving
the operation speed when compared to slower dispersive techniques. To
illustrate the benefit of resonant two-qubit gates in circuit QED, we consider
the implementation of a two-dimensional cluster state in an array of N x N
superconducting qubits by using resonant controlled-phase (CPHASE) and
one-qubit gates, where the generation time grows linearly with N. For N=3, and
taking into account decoherence mechanisms, a fidelity over 60% for the
generation of this cluster state is obtained.
