Sufficient conditions are given for a hard implicit function theorem to hold.
The result is established by an application of the Dynamical Systems Method
(DSM). It allows one to solve a class of nonlinear operator equations in the
case when the Fr\'echet derivative of the nonlinear operator is a smoothing
operator, so that its inverse is an unbounded operator.
