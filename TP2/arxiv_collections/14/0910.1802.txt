Using a high-statistics sample of anti-neutrino charged current quasi-elastic
(CCQE) events, MiniBooNE reports the challenges in measuring parameters within
the Relativistic Fermi Gas model. As the CCQE analysis has been completed in
MiniBooNE's neutrino data, particular attention is paid to the differences in
CCQE interactions between the two running modes.
