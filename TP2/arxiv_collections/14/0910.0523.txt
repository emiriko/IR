We prove that the dimension of the Specht module of a forest $G$ is the same
as the normalized volume of the matching polytope of $G$. We also associate to
$G$ a symmetric function $s_G$ (analogous to the Schur symmetric function
$s_\lambda$ for a partition $\lambda$) and investigate its combinatorial and
representation-theoretic properties in relation to the Specht module and Schur
module of $G$. We then use this to define notions of standard and semistandard
tableaux for forests.
