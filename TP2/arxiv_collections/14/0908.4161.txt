A model of inflation is presented where the inflaton field is a complex
scalar field coupled to a U(1) gauge field. Due to the axial symmetry of the
potential, the inflation is driven by the radial direction while the angular
field is gauged by U(1). Due to the coupling of the inflaton to the gauge
field, a time dependent mass term for the gauge field is generated dynamically
and conformal invariance is broken. We study whether a significant amount of
primordial magnetic fields can be generated during inflation by allowing a
time-dependent U(1) gauge kinetic coupling.
