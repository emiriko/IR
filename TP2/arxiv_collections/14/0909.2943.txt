[abridged] We present the analysis of the X-ray brightness and temperature
profiles for six clusters belonging to both the Cool Core and Non Cool Core
classes, in terms of the Supermodel (SM) developed by Cavaliere, Lapi &
Fusco-Femiano (2009). Based on the gravitational wells set by the dark matter
halos, the SM straightforwardly expresses the equilibrium of the IntraCluster
Plasma (ICP) modulated by the entropy deposited at the boundary by standing
shocks from gravitational accretion, and injected at the center by outgoing
blastwaves from mergers or from outbursts of Active Galactic Nuclei. The
cluster set analyzed here highlights not only how simply the SM represents the
main dichotomy Cool vs. Non Cool Core clusters in terms of a few ICP parameters
governing the radial entropy run, but also how accurately it fits even complex
brightness and temperature profiles. For Cool Core clusters like A2199 and
A2597, the SM with a low level of central entropy straightforwardly yields the
characteristic peaked profile of the temperature marked by a decline toward the
center, without requiring currently strong radiative cooling and high mass
deposition rates. Non Cool Core clusters like A1656 require instead a central
entropy floor of a substantial level, and some like A2256 and even more A644
feature structured temperature profiles that also call for a definite floor
extension; in such conditions the SM accurately fits the observations, and
suggests that in these clusters the ICP has been just remolded by a merger
event, in the way of a remnant cool core. The SM also predicts that dark matter
halos with high concentration should correlate with flatter entropy profiles
and steeper brightness in the outskirts; this is indeed the case with A1689.
