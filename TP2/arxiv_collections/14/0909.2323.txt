Non-perturbative charm and bottom quark-pair production is investigated in
the early stage of heavy ion collisions. Following our earlier works, the
time-dependent study is based on a kinetic description of fermion-pair
production in strong non-Abelian fields. We introduce time-dependent
chromo-electric external field with a pulse-like time evolution, which
simulates the overlap of two colliding heavy ions. The calculations is
performed in a SU(2) color model with finite current quark masses. Yields of
heavy quark-pairs are compared to the ones of light and strange quark-pairs. We
show that the small inverse duration time of the field pulse determines the
efficiency of the quark-pair production. Thus we do not see the expected
suppression for heavy quark production, as follows from the Schwinger formula
for constant field, but rather an enhanced heavy quark production at
ultrarelativistic energies. We convert pulse duration time-dependent results
into collisional energy dependence and introduce flavour-dependent energy
string tensions, which can be used in string based model calculations at RHIC
and LHC energies.
