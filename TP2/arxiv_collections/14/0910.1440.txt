The Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the interface in an immiscible
two-component Bose-Einstein condensate is investigated using the mean-field and
Bogoliubov theories. Rayleigh-Taylor fingers are found to grow from the
interface and mushroom patterns are formed. Quantized vortex rings and vortex
lines are then generated around the mushrooms. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability
and mushroom-pattern formation can be observed in a trapped system.
