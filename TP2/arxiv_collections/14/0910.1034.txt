Observations of dense molecular gas lie at the basis of our understanding of
the density and temperature structure of protostellar envelopes and molecular
outflows. We aim to characterize the properties of the protostellar envelope,
molecular outflow and surrounding cloud, through observations of high
excitation molecular lines within a sample of 16 southern sources presumed to
be embedded YSOs. Observations of submillimeter lines of CO, HCO+ and their
isotopologues, both single spectra and small maps were taken with the FLASH and
APEX-2a instruments mounted on APEX to trace the gas around the sources. The
HARP-B instrument on the JCMT was used to map IRAS 15398-3359 in these lines.
HCO+ mapping probes the presence of dense centrally condensed gas, a
characteristic of protostellar envelopes. The rare isotopologues C18O and
H13CO+ are also included to determine the optical depth, column density, and
source velocity. The combination of multiple CO transitions, such as 3-2, 4-3
and 7-6, allows to constrain outflow properties, in particular the temperature.
Archival submillimeter continuum data are used to determine envelope masses.
Eleven of the sixteen sources have associated warm and/or dense quiescent as
characteristic of protostellar envelopes, or an associated outflow. Using the
strength and degree of concentration of the HCO+ 4-3 and CO 4-3 lines as a
diagnostic, five sources classified as Class I based on their spectral energy
distributions are found not to be embedded YSOs. The C18O 3-2 lines show that
for none of the sources, foreground cloud layers are present. Strong molecular
outflows are found around six sources, .. (continued in paper)
