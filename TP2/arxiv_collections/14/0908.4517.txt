We present a structural analysis of the graphene/Ru(0001) system obtained by
surface x-ray diffraction. The data were fit using Fourier-series expanded
displacement fields from an ideal bulk structure, plus the application of
symmetry constraints. The shape of the observed superstructure rods proves a
reconstruction of the substrate, induced by strong bonding of graphene to
ruthenium. Both the graphene layer and the underlying substrate are corrugated,
with peak-to-peak heights of (0.82 +/- 0.15) A and (0.19 +/- 0.02) A for the
graphene and topmost Ru-atomic layer, respectively. The Ru-corrugation decays
slowly over several monolayers into the bulk. The system also exhibits
chirality, whereby in-plane rotations of up to 2.0 degrees in those regions of
the superstructure where the graphene is weakly bound are driven by elastic
energy minimization.
