We propose a suitable substitute for the classical Grothendieck ring of an
algebraically closed field, in which any quasi-projective scheme is
represented, while maintaining its non-reduced structure. This yields a more
subtle invariant, called the schemic Grothendieck ring, in which we can
formulate a form of integration resembling Kontsevich's motivic integration via
arc schemes. In view of its more functorial properties, we can present a
characteristic-free proof of the rationality of the geometric Igusa zeta series
for certain hypersurfaces, thus generalizing the ground-breaking work on
motivic integration by Denef and Loeser. The construction uses first-order
formulae, and some infinitary versions, called formularies.
