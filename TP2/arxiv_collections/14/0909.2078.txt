The fixed-mass sum rules for the deuteron target have been derived by using
the connected matrix element of the current anti-commutation relation on the
null-plane. From these sum rules we obtain the relation between the
pseudo-scalar meson deuteron total cross sections and the structure functions
of the deuteron. We show that the nuclear effect on the mean hypercharge of the
sea quark of the proton can be studied by this relation. Further we obtain the
relation among the Born term, the resonances and the non-resonant background in
the small $Q^2$ region, and as a new aspect of the spin 1 target, explicit
relation of the tensor structure function $b_2$ at small or moderate $Q^2$ to
that at large $Q^2$.
