A new model is proposed for the strong ferromagnetism associated with
partially localized orbitals in the Fe16N2 metallic system which draws
substantially from models of heavy fermion metals. The basic idea is that the
spatially isolated Fe-N clusters generate non-uniform charge density and
increase the d-d electron interaction significantly, leading to a highly spin
polarized configuration for low lying 3d orbitals. Simulation based on LDA+U
method is performed to illustrate the correlation between enhanced U and giant
magnetic moment.
