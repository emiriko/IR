We present a detailed study of the X-ray energy and power spectral properties
of the neutron star transient IGR J17191-2821. We discovered four instances of
pairs of simultaneous kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs). The
frequency difference between these kHz QPOs is between 315 Hz and 362 Hz. We
also report on the detection of five thermonuclear type-I X-ray bursts and the
discovery of burst oscillations at ~294 Hz during three of them. Finally, we
report on a faint and short outburst precursor, which occurred about two months
before the main outburst. Our results on the broadband spectral and variability
properties allow us to firmly establish the atoll source nature of IGR
J17191-2821.
