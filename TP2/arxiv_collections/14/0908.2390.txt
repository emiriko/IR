The results on polarized parton densities (PDFs) obtained using different
methods of QCD analysis of the present polarized DIS data are discussed. Their
dependence on the method used in the analysis, accounting or not for the
kinematic and dynamic 1/Q^2 corrections to spin structure function g_1, is
demonstrated. It is pointed out that the precise data in the preasymptotic
region require a more careful matching of the QCD predictions to the data in
this region in order to determine the polarized PDFs correctly.
