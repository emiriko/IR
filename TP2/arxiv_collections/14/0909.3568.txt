We characterize using the Bergman kernel Carleson measures of Bergman spaces
in strongly pseudoconvex bounded domains in several complex variables,
generalizing to this setting theorems proved by Duren and Weir for the unit
ball. We also show that uniformly discrete (with respect to the Kobayashi
distance) sequences give examples of Carleson measures, and we compute the
speed of escape to the boundary of uniformly discrete sequences in strongly
pseudoconvex domains, generalizing results obtained in the unit ball by
Jevti\'c, Massaneda and Thomas, by Duren and Weir, and by MacCluer.
