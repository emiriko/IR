We consider the subject of self--binding in static, spherically symmetric
objects consisting of a charged fluid. We have shown previously that in the
case of a perfect fluid, only the localized part of the mass contributes to
gravitational self--binding of such objects and that in the limiting case of
objects comprised purely of electromagnetic mass, there is no gravitational
binding. Here, we extend this result to the more general case of an anisotropic
fluid. Our inspection of the Oppenheimer--Volkov equation allows tracking of
both gravitational and non-gravitational contributions to binding of
spherically symmetric objects and shows that those with pure electromagnetic
mass cannot exist.
