We determine the critical strength of the effective electric coupling for the
onset of Bose condensation of stable magnetic monopoles and antimonopoles in
SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics. Two scenarios are considered: infinitely fast
and infinitely slow downward approach of the critical temperature. Our results
support the claim that the first lepton family and the weak interactions emerge
from pure SU(2) gauge dynamics of scale $\sim 0.5 $MeV.
