We investigate, by means of computer simulations, shapes of nonconvex bodies
that maximize resistance to their motion through a rarefied medium, considering
that bodies are moving forward and at the same time slowly rotating. A
two-dimensional geometric shape that confers to the body a resistance very
close to the theoretical supremum value is obtained, improving previous
results.
