We study the dynamical response of a system to a sudden change of the tuning
parameter $\lambda$ starting (or ending) at the quantum critical point. In
particular we analyze the scaling of the excitation probability, number of
excited quasiparticles, heat and entropy with the quench amplitude and the
system size. We extend the analysis to quenches with arbitrary power law
dependence on time of the tuning parameter, showing a close connection between
the scaling behavior of these quantities with the singularities of the
adiabatic susceptibilities of order $m$ at the quantum critical point, where
$m$ is related to the power of the quench. Precisely for sudden quenches the
relevant susceptibility of the second order coincides with the fidelity
susceptibility. We discuss the generalization of the scaling laws to the finite
temperature quenches and show that the statistics of the low-energy excitations
becomes important. We illustrate the relevance of those results for cold atoms
experiments.
