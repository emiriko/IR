In a recent experiment Paoletti et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 154501, 2008)
monitored the motion of tracer particles in turbulent superfluid helium and
inferred that the velocity components do not obey the Gaussian statistics
observed in ordinary turbulence. Motivated by their experiment, we create a
small turbulent state in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, which enables us
to compute directly the velocity field, and we find similar non-classical
power-law tails. Our result thus suggests that non-Gaussian turbulent velocity
statistics describe a fundamental property of quantum fluids. We also track the
decay of the vortex tangle in the presence of the thermal cloud.
