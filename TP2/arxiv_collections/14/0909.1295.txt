Inspired by the Dirac notation, a new set of symbols, the Probability Bracket
Notation (PBN) is proposed for probability modeling. By applying PBN to
discrete and continuous random variables, we show that PBN could play a similar
role in probability spaces as the Dirac notation in Hilbert vector spaces. The
time evolution of homogeneous Markov chains with discrete-time and
continuous-time are discussed in PBN. Our system state p-kets are identified
with the probability vectors, while our system state p-bra can be identified
with the Doi state function or the Peliti standard bra. We also suggest that,
by transforming from the Schrodinger picture to the Heisenberg picture, the
time-dependence of a system p-ket of a homogeneous MC can be shifted to the
observable as a stochastic process.
