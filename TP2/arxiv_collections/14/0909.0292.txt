A set of inclusive cross sections at zero rapidity is presented for p-pbar
interactions at center of mass energy sqrt(s)=1.8 TeV. Six particle cross
sections are corrected for secondary contributions from decays of higher mass
resonances in order to produce a set of primary cross sections. The primary
cross sections per spin state are well described by d(sigma^p)/dy|_(y=0)=
0.721*(pi*lambdabar_(pi)^2)*exp(-m/T), where m is the particle rest mass,
T=hbar*c/r_h, and r_h=0.97 fm. The deuterium production cross section is also
described if r_h is replaced by r_A=r_h*A^(1/3). The same exponential in m and
T describes primary charm fractions in e+e- collisions at least up to the J/Psi
mass. There is no significant evidence for strangeness or charm suppression if
only primary production of light hadrons is considered. There is evidence that
the primary cross section for each particle may have the same value for pp and
pbar-p collisions and that it may have nearly constant values between
sqrt(s)=63 GeV and sqrt(s)=1800 GeV. Fits to the final state transverse momenta
of the particles using a gas model favor a temperature T=132 MeV, a chemical
potential mu=129 MeV, and a transverse flow of the gas with beta_f=0.27.
