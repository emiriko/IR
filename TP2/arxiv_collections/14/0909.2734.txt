The aim of this paper is the study of the propagation of a Bessel beam
through two absorbing layers, limited by two different half-spaces. Our
approach will be based on the scalar analysis, since this analysis was proved
to be an excellent approximation of the vectorial field which describes a
Bessel beam.
