Results from molecular dynamics simulations of simple, structured particles
capable of self-assembling into polyhedral shells are described. The analysis
focuses on the growth histories of individual shells in the presence of an
explicit solvent and the nature of the events along their growth pathways; the
results provide further evidence of the importance of reversibility in the
assembly process. The underlying goal of this approach is the modeling of virus
capsid growth, a phenomenon at the submicroscopic scale that, despite its
importance, is little understood.
