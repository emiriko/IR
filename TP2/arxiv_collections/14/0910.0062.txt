We present a study of exclusive neutral pion production in neutrino-nucleus
Neutral Current interactions using data from the NOMAD experiment at the CERN
SPS. The data correspond to $1.44 \times 10^6$ muon-neutrino Charged Current
interactions in the energy range $2.5 \leq E_{\nu} \leq 300$ GeV. Neutrino
events with only one visible $\pi^0$ in the final state are expected to result
from two Neutral Current processes: coherent $\pi^0$ production, {\boldmath
$\nu + {\cal A} \to \nu + {\cal A} + \pi^0$} and single $\pi^0$ production in
neutrino-nucleon scattering. The signature of coherent $\pi^0$ production is an
emergent $\pi^0$ almost collinear with the incident neutrino while $\pi^0$'s
produced in neutrino-nucleon deep inelastic scattering have larger transverse
momenta. In this analysis all relevant backgrounds to the coherent $\pi^0$
production signal are measured using data themselves. Having determined the
backgrounds, and using the Rein-Sehgal model for the coherent $\pi^0$
production to compute the detection efficiency, we obtain {\boldmath $4630 \pm
522 (stat) \pm 426 (syst)$} corrected coherent-$\pi^0$ events with $E_{\pi^0}
\geq 0.5$ GeV. We measure {\boldmath $\sigma (\nu {\cal A} \to \nu {\cal A}
\pi^0) = [ 72.6 \pm 8.1(stat) \pm 6.9(syst) ] \times 10^{-40} cm^2/nucleus$}.
This is the most precise measurement of the coherent $\pi^0$ production to
date.
