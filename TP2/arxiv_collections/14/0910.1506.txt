We comment on the conclusion by Ma et al. [Appl. Phys. Lett. {\bf 94}, 241112
(2009)] that the Elliott-Yafet mechanism is more important than the
D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism at high carrier density in intrinsic bulk CdTe at
room temperature. We point out that the spin relaxation is solely from the
D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism. The observed peak in the density dependence of spin
relaxation time is exactly what we predicted in a recent work [Phys. Rev. B
{\bf 79}, 125206 (2009)].
