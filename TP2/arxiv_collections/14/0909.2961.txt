We develop a model describing the electrochemical conversion of an organic
semiconductor (specifically, the active material in a light-emitting
electrochemical cell) from the undoped non-conducting state to the doped
conducting state. The model takes into account both strongly
concentration-dependent mobility and diffusion for the electronic charge
carriers and the Nernst equation in the doped conducting regions. It is
demonstrated that the experimentally observed doping front progression in
light-emitting electrochemical cells can be accurately described with this
model.
