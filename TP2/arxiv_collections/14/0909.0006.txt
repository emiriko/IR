We present detailed simulations of the Pan-STARRS-1 (PS1) multi-epoch,
multi-band 3-pi Survey in order to assess its potential yield of transiting
planets and eclipsing binaries. This survey differs from dedicated transit
surveys in that it will cover the entire Northern sky but provide only sparsely
sampled light curves. Since most eclipses would be detected at only a single
epoch, the 3-pi Survey will be most sensitive to deep eclipses (> 0.10 mag)
caused by Jupiters transiting M dwarfs and eclipsing stellar/substellar
binaries. The survey will also provide parallaxes for the ~400,000 stars within
100 pc which will enable a volume-limited eclipse search, reducing the number
of astrophysical false positives compared to previous magnitude-limited
searches. Using the best available empirical data, we constructed a model of
the extended solar neighborhood that includes stars, brown dwarfs, and a
realistic binary population. We computed the yield of deeply eclipsing systems
using both a semi-analytic and a full Monte Carlo approach. We examined
statistical tests for detecting single-epoch eclipses in sparsely sampled data
and assessed their vulnerability to false positives due to stellar variability.
Assuming a short-period planet frequency of 0.5% for M dwarfs, our simulations
predict that about a dozen transiting Jupiters around low-mass stars (M < 0.3
Msun) within 100 pc are potentially detectable in the PS1 3-pi Survey, along
with ~300 low-mass eclipsing binaries (both component masses < 0.5 Msun),
including ~10 eclipsing field brown dwarfs. Extensive follow-up observations
would be required to characterize these candidate eclipsing systems, thereby
enabling comprehensive tests of structural models and novel insights into the
planetary architecture of low-mass stars.
