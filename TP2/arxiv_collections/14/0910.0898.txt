We present details of carrier properties in high quality ${\rm
Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_2As_2}$ single crystals obtained from electronic Raman
scattering. The experiments indicate a strong band and momentum anisotropy of
the electron dynamics above and below the superconducting transition
highlighting the importance of complex band-dependent interactions. The
presence of low energy spectral weight deep in the superconducting state
suggests a gap with accidental nodes which may be lifted by doping and/or
impurity scattering. When combined with other measurements, our observation of
band and momentum dependent carrier dynamics indicate that the iron arsenides
may have several competing superconducting ground states.
