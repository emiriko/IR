Recently a new clustering algorithm called 'affinity propagation' (AP) has
been proposed, which efficiently clustered sparsely related data by passing
messages between data points. However, we want to cluster large scale data
where the similarities are not sparse in many cases. This paper presents two
variants of AP for grouping large scale data with a dense similarity matrix.
The local approach is partition affinity propagation (PAP) and the global
method is landmark affinity propagation (LAP). PAP passes messages in the
subsets of data first and then merges them as the number of initial step of
iterations; it can effectively reduce the number of iterations of clustering.
LAP passes messages between the landmark data points first and then clusters
non-landmark data points; it is a large global approximation method to speed up
clustering. Experiments are conducted on many datasets, such as random data
points, manifold subspaces, images of faces and Chinese calligraphy, and the
results demonstrate that the two approaches are feasible and practicable.
