We discuss the minimization of the Dick effect in an optical lattice clock.
We show that optimizing the time sequence of operation of the clock can lead to
a significant reduction of the clock stability degradation by the frequency
noise of the interrogation laser. By using a non-destructive detection of the
atoms, we are able to recycle most of the atoms between cycles and consequently
to strongly reduce the time spent capturing the atoms in each cycle. With
optimized parameters, we expect a fractional Allan deviation better than
2E-16$\tau^{-1/2}$ for the lattice clock.
