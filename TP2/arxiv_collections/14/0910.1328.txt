The Koch curve is a self-similar object whose length grows unboundedly when
the measuring unit by which is calculated diminishes. If this curve is
considered to be the trajectory of a point corpuscle of mass m (a particle)
rendering it in a time t, while the measuring unit in the kth scale is
associated with the indetermination in the position of the corpuscle, then it
is possible to demonstrate that when the indetermination of the corpuscle
position diminishes, the indetermination in its linear momentum grows
unboundedly. Based on the concept of similarity dimension of a corpuscle
trajectory, from the before stated line of reasoning an alternative deduction
of Heisenberg's uncertainty relation (Delta)x(Delta)p(sub)x (aprox)h is
developed and discussed.
