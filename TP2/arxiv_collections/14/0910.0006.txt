We report the discovery of three new variable stars in Indus: USNO-B1.0
0311-0760061, USNO-B1.0 0309-0771315, and USNO-B1.0 0315-0775167. Light curves
of 3712 stars in a 87' x 58' field centered on the asynchronous polar CD Ind
were obtained using a remotely controlled 150 mm telescope of Tzec Maun
Observatory (Pingelly, Western Australia). The VaST software based on
SExtractor package was used for semi-automatic search for variable stars. We
suggest the following classification for the newly discovered variable stars:
USNO-B1.0 0311-0760061 - RR Lyr-type, USNO-B1.0 0309-0771315 - W UMa-type, and
USNO-B1.0 0315-0775167 - W UMa-type.
