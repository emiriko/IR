The mechanism of string creation for light quarks developed earlier is
considered for nonzero quark chemical potential. A strong modification of the
confining string due to finite quark density (chemical quark potential $\mu$)
is observed. As a surprising result in a multiquark system with a common string
junction an attractive well appears of radius $\mu/\sigma$ and of an average
depth equal to $\mu$, which induces formation of multiquark hadrons.
Preliminary estimates predict a new phase transition to multiquark hadron phase
at rather high densities (in heavy ion collisions or in neutron stars) when
neutron matter is compressed to 3-4 normal nuclear densities.
