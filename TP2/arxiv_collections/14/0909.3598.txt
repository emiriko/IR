Let $M^{2n+1}$ ($n \geq 2$) be a compact pseudoconvex CR manifold of finite
commutator type whose $\dbarb$ has closed range in $L^2$ and whose Levi form
has comparable eigenvalues. We prove a sharp $L^1$ Sobolev inequality for the
$\dbarb$ complex for $(0,q)$ forms when $q \ne 1$ nor $n-1$. We also prove an
analogous $L^1$ inequality when $M$ satisfies condition $Y(q)$. The main
technical ingredient is a new kind of $L^1$ duality inequality for vector
fields that satisfy Hormander's condition.
