We show that the addition of a topological Gauss-Bonnet term to the
gravitational action can greatly increase the instability of four-dimensional
de Sitter space, by favoring the nucleation of black holes. The pair-production
rate given by the Euclidean action for the instanton takes the form exp(Delta
S) where S is the entropy in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. The coefficient of
the Gauss-Bonnet term in the action sets a stability bound on the curvature of
empty de Sitter space. For that coefficient in the low-energy effective action
of heterotic string theory, the maximal curvature of de Sitter space is in
general much lower than the Planck scale.
