BZ UMa is a cataclysmic variable star whose specific classification has
eluded researchers since its discovery in 1968. It has outburst and spectral
properties consistent with both U Gem class dwarf novae and intermediate
polars. We present new photometric and polarimetric measurements of recent
outbursts, including the first detected superoutburst of the system.
Statistical analysis of these and archival data from outbursts over the past 40
years present a case for BZ UMa as a non-magnetic, U Gem class, SU-UMa subclass
dwarf novae.
