We present a high-resolution, multi-wavelength study of the massive
protostellar cluster NGC 6334I(N) that combines new spectral line data from the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) and VLA with a reanalysis of archival VLA continuum
data, 2MASS and Spitzer images. As shown previously, the brightest 1.3 mm
source SMA1 contains substructure at subarcsecond resolution, and we report the
first detection of SMA1b at 3.6 cm along with a new spatial component at 7 mm
(SMA1d). We find SMA1 (aggregate of sources a, b, c, and d) and SMA4 to be
comprised of free-free and dust components, while SMA6 shows only dust
emission. Our 1.5" resolution 1.3 mm molecular line images reveal substantial
hot-core line emission toward SMA1 and to a lesser degree SMA2. We find CH3OH
rotation temperatures of 165\pm 9 K and 145\pm 12 K for SMA1 and SMA2,
respectively. We estimate a diameter of 1400 AU for the SMA1 hot core emission,
encompassing both SMA1b and SMA1d, and speculate that these sources comprise a
>800 AU separation binary that may explain the previously-suggested precession
of the outflow emanating from the SMA1 region. The LSR velocities of SMA1,
SMA2, and SMA4 all differ by 1-2 km/s. Outflow activity from SMA1, SMA2, SMA4,
and SMA6 is observed in several molecules including SiO(5--4) and IRAC 4.5
micron emission; 24 micron emission from SMA4 is also detected. Eleven water
maser groups are detected, eight of which coincide with SMA1, SMA2, SMA4, and
SMA6. We also detect a total of 83 Class I CH3OH 44GHz maser spots which likely
result from the combined activity of many outflows. Our observations paint the
portrait of multiple young hot cores in a protocluster prior to the stage where
its members become visible in the near-infrared.
