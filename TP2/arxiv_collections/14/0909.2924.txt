The near-horizon geometry of the extremal four-dimensional Kerr black hole
and certain generalizations thereof has an SL(2,R) x U(1) isometry group.
Excitations around this geometry can be controlled by imposing appropriate
boundary conditions. For certain boundary conditions, the U(1) isometry is
enhanced to a Virasoro algebra. Here, we propose a free-field construction of
this Virasoro algebra.
