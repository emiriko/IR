We have considered a cosmological model of the FRW universe with variable $G$
and $\Lambda$. The solutions have been obtained for flat model with particular
form of cosmological constant. The cosmological parameters have also been
obtained for dust, radiation and stiff matter. The statefinder parameters are
analyzed and have shown that these depends only on $w$ and $\epsilon$. Further
the lookback time, proper distance, luminosity distance and angular diameter
distance have also been calculated for our model.
