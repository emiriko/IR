Motivated essentially by the success of the applications of the
Mittag-Leffler functions in many areas of science and engineering, the authors
present in a unified manner, a detailed account or rather a brief survey of the
Mittag- Leffler function, generalized Mittag-Leffler functions, Mittag-Leffler
type functions, and their interesting and useful properties. Applications of
Mittag-Leffler functions in certain areas of physical and applied sciences are
also demonstrated. During the last two decades this function has come into
prominence after about nine decades of its discovery by a Swedish mathematician
G.M. Mittag-Leffler, due its vast potential of its applications in solving the
problems of physical, biological, engineering and earth sciences etc. In this
survey paper, nearly all types of Mittag-Leffler type functions existing in the
literature are presented. An attempt is made to present nearly an exhaustive
list of references concerning the Mittag-Leffler functions to make the reader
familiar with the present trend of research in Mittag-Leffler type functions
and their applications.
