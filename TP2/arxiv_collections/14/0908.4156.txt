In this paper, we have provided an overview of cosmic ray effects on
terrestrial processes such as electrical properties, global electric circuit,
lightning, cloud formation, cloud coverage, atmospheric temperature, space
weather phenomena, climate, etc. It is suggested that cosmic rays control short
term and long term variation in climate. There are many basic phenomena which
need further study and require new and long term data set. Some of these have
been pointed out.
