It is shown that the 33 complex rays in three dimensions used by Penrose to
prove the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem have the same orthogonality relations as
the 33 real rays of Peres, and therefore provide an isomorphic proof of the
theorem. It is further shown that the Peres and Penrose rays are just two
members of a continuous three-parameter family of unitarily inequivalent rays
that prove the theorem.
