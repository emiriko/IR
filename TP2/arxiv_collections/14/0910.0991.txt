The Broad Emission Lines (BELs) in spectra of type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) can be very complex, indicating a complex Broad Line Region (BLR)
geometry. According to the standard unification model one can expect an
accretion disk around a supermassive black hole in all AGN. Therefore, a disk
geometry is expected in the BLR. However, a small fraction of BELs show
double-peaked profiles which indicate the disk geometry. Here, we discuss a
two-component model, assuming an emission from the accretion disk and one
additional emission from surrounding region. We compared the modeled BELs with
observed ones (mostly broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ profiles) finding that the
model can well describe single-peaked and double-peaked observed broad line
profiles.
