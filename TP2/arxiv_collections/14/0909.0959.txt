We construct a massive non-abelian N= 1 SYM theory on R^3. This is achieved
by using a non-local gauge and Poincare invariant mass term for gluons due to
Nair. The underlying supersymmetry algebra is shown to be a non-central
extension of the Poincare algebra by the spacetime rotation group so(3). The
incorporation of Chern-Simons couplings in the formalism is also presented. The
dimensional reduction of the gauge theory and the SUSY algebra is related to a
massive N=2 massive matrix quantum mechanics based on euclidean
$Clifford_2(R)$.
