Complete one-loop results, supplemented by two-loop Higgs propagator-type
corrections, are obtained for the class of processes chi^0_i->chi^0_j h_a in
the MSSM with CP-violating phases for parameters entering the process beyond
lowest order. The parameter region of the CPX benchmark scenario where a very
light Higgs boson is unexcluded by present data is analysed in detail. We find
that the decay chi^0_2->chi^0_1 h_1 may offer good prospects to detect such a
light Higgs boson.
