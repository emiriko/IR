Entropy is a concept that has traditionally been reliant on a definite notion
of causality. However, without a definite notion of causality, the concept of
entropy is not all lost. Indefinite causal structure results from combining
probabilistic predictions and dynamical space-time. Combining the probabilistic
nature of quantum theory and dynamical treatment space-time from general
relativity is an approach to the problem of quantum gravity. The causaloid
framework lays the mathematical groundwork to be able to treat indefinite
causal structure. In this paper, we build on the causaloid mathematics and
define a causally-unbiased entropy for an indefinite causal structure. In
defining a causally-unbiased entropy, there comes about an emergent idea of
causality in the form of a measure of causal connectedness, termed the Q
factor.
