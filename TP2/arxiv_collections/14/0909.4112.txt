A recent result of ours [GM] shows that all Hopf algebra liftings of a given
diagram in the sense of Andruskiewitsch and Schneider are cocycle deformations
of each other. Here we develop a "non-abelian" cohomology theory, which gives a
method for an explicit description of cocycles relevant to the lifting process.
