This paper is devoted to the proof of a structural theorem, concerning
certain homomorphic images of Artin braid group on $n$ strands in finite
symmetric groups. It is shown that any one of these permutation groups is an
extension of the symmetric group on $n$ letters by an appropriate abelian
group, and in "half" of the cases this extension splits.
