For natural and artificial systems with some symmetry structure,
computational understanding and manipulation can be achieved without learning
by exploiting the algebraic structure. Here we describe this algebraic
coordinatization method and apply it to permutation puzzles. Coordinatization
yields a structural understanding, not just solutions for the puzzles.
