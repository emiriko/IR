We present a quantitative estimate of the relative AGN/starburst content in a
sample of 59 nearby (z<0.15) infrared bright ULIRGs taken from the 1 Jy sample,
based on infrared L-band (3-4 micron) spectra. By using diagnostic diagrams and
a simple deconvolution model, we show that at least 60% of local ULIRGs contain
an active nucleus, but the AGN contribution to the bolometric luminosity is
relevant only in ~15-20% of the sources. Overall, ULIRGs appear to be powered
by the starburst process, responsible for >85% of the observed infrared
luminosity. The subsample of sources optically classified as LINERs (31
objects) shows a similar AGN/starburst distribution as the whole sample,
indicating a composite nature for this class of objects. We also show that a
few ULIRGs, optically classified as starbursts, have L-band spectral features
suggesting the presence of a buried AGN.
