We search for correlations between the spin in pairs of spiral galaxies, to
study if the angular momentum gain for each galaxy was the result of tidal
torques imprint by the same tidal field. To perform our study we made use of a
sample of galaxy pairs identified using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find a
weak, but statistically significant correlation between the spin magnitude of
neighbouring galaxies, but no clear alignment between their orientation. We
show that events such as interactions with close neighbours play an important
role in the value of the spin for the final configuration, as we find these
interactions tend to reduce the value of the $\lambda$ spin parameter of
late-type galaxies considerably, with dependence on the morphology of the
neighbour. This implies that the original tidal field for each pair could have
been similar, but the redistribution of angular momentum at later stages of
evolution is important.
