We present a condition which guarantees spatial uniformity for the asymptotic
behavior of the solutions of a reaction-diffusion PDE with Neumann boundary
conditions. This condition makes use of the Jacobian matrix of the reaction
terms and the second Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplacian operator on the given
spatial domain, and replaces the global Lipschitz assumptions commonly used in
the literature with a less restrictive Lyapunov inequality. We then present
numerical procedures for the verification of this Lyapunov inequality and
illustrate them on models of several biochemical reaction networks. Finally, we
derive an analog of this PDE result for the synchronization of a network of
identical ODE models coupled by diffusion terms.
