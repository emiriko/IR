We report on a new collective phenomenon in metamaterials: spectral line
collapse with increasing number of the unit cell resonators (meta-molecules).
Resembling the behaviour of exotic states of matter, such as Bose-Einstein
condensates of excitons and magnons, this new effect is linked to the
suppression of radiation losses in periodic arrays. We demonstrate
experimentally spectral line collapse at microwave, terahertz and optical
frequencies. It emerges as a universal and truly scalable effect underpinned by
classical electromagnetic interactions between the excited meta-molecules.
