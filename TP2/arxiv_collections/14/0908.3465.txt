We report the discovery of supersonic downflows in a sunspot light bridge
using measurements taken with the spectropolarimeter on board the Hinode
satellite. The downflows occur in small patches close to regions where the
vector magnetic field changes orientation rapidly, and are associated with
anomalous circular polarization profiles. An inversion of the observed Stokes
spectra reveals velocities of up to 10 km/s, making them the strongest
photospheric flows ever measured in light bridges. Some (but not all) of the
downflowing patches are cospatial and cotemporal with brightness enhancements
in chromospheric Ca II H filtergrams. We suggest that these flows are due to
magnetic reconnection in the upper photosphere/lower chromosphere, although
other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.
