In the final stages of stellar evolution low- to intermediate-mass stars lose
their envelope in increasingly massive stellar winds. Such winds affect the
interstellar medium and the galactic chemical evolution as well as the
circumstellar envelope where planetary nebulae form subsequently.
Characteristics of this mass loss depend on both stellar properties and
properties of gas and dust in the wind formation region. In this paper we
present an approach towards studies of mass loss using both observations and
models, focusing on the stage where the stellar envelope is nearly empty of
mass. In a recent study we measure the mass-loss evolution, and other
properties, of four planetary nebulae in the Galactic Disk. Specifically we use
the method of integral field spectroscopy on faint halos, which are found
outside the much brighter central parts of a planetary nebula. We begin with a
brief comparison between our and other observational methods to determine
mass-loss rates in order to illustrate how they differ and complement each
other. An advantage of our method is that it measures the gas component
directly requiring no assumptions of properties of dust in the wind. Thereafter
we present our observational approach in more detail in terms of its validity
and its assumptions. In the second part of this paper we discuss capabilities
and assumptions of current models of stellar winds. We propose and discuss
improvements to such models that will allow meaningful comparisons with our
observations. Currently the physically most complete models include too little
mass in the model domain to permit a formation of winds with as high mass-loss
rates as our observations show.
