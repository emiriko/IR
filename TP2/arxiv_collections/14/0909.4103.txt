We report molecular dynamics simulations of a system of repulsive,
polymer-tethered colloidal particles. We use an explicit polymer model to
explore how the length and the behavior of the polymer (ideal or self-avoiding)
affect the ability of the particles to organize into ordered structures when
the system is compressed to moderate volume fractions. We find a variety of
different phases whose origin can be explained in terms of the configurational
entropy of polymers and colloids. Finally, we discuss and compare our results
to those obtained for similar systems using simplified coarse-grained polymer
models, and set the limits of their applicability.
