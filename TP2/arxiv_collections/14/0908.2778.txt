Linyphiid spiders have evolved the ability to disperse long distances by a
process known as ballooning. It has been hypothesized that ballooning may allow
populations to persist in the highly disturbed agricultural areas that the
spiders prefer. In this study, I develop a stochastic population model to
explore how the propensity for this type of long distance dispersal influences
long term population persistence in a heterogeneous landscape where
catastrophic mortality events are common. Analysis of this model indicates that
although some dispersal does indeed decrease the probability of extinction of
the population, the frequency of dispersal is only important in certain
extremes. Instead, both the mean population birth and death rates, and the
landscape composition, are much more important in determining the probability
of extinction than the dispersal process. Thus, in order to develop effective
conservation strategies for these spiders, better understanding of life history
processes should be prioritized over an understanding of dispersal strategies.
