Low temperature dependence of specific heat of one- dimensional
multicomponent systems at the commensurate- incommensurate phase transition
point is studied. It is found that for canonical systems, with a fixed total
number of particles, low temperature specific heat linearly depends on
temperature with a diverging prefactor.
