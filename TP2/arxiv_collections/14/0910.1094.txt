We use new large area far infrared maps ranging from 65 - 500 microns
obtained with the AKARI and the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter
Telescope (BLAST) missions to characterize the dust emission toward the
Cassiopeia A supernova remnant (SNR). Using the AKARI high resolution data we
find a new "tepid" dust grain population at a temperature of ~35K and with an
estimated mass of 0.06 solar masses. This component is confined to the central
area of the SNR and may represent newly-formed dust in the unshocked supernova
ejecta. While the mass of tepid dust that we measure is insufficient by itself
to account for the dust observed at high redshift, it does constitute an
additional dust population to contribute to those previously reported. We fit
our maps at 65, 90, 140, 250, 350, and 500 microns to obtain maps of the column
density and temperature of "cold" dust (near 16 K) distributed throughout the
region. The large column density of cold dust associated with clouds seen in
molecular emission extends continuously from the surrounding interstellar
medium to project on the SNR, where the foreground component of the clouds is
also detectable through optical, X-ray, and molecular extinction. At the
resolution available here, there is no morphological signature to isolate any
cold dust associated only with the SNR from this confusing interstellar
emission. Our fit also recovers the previously detected "hot" dust in the
remnant, with characteristic temperature 100 K.
