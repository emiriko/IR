The SuperNEMO experiment is being designed to search for neutrinoless double
beta decay to test if neutrinos are Majorana particles. The experimental
technique follows that of the currently running NEMO-3 experiment, which
successfully combines tracking and calorimetry to measure the topology and
energy of the final state electrons. Unique particle identification
capabilities of SuperNEMO will be employed with about 100 kg of 82 Se and will
reach sensitivity to a half-life of about 2 x 10^26 years, which corresponds to
Majorana neutrino masses of about 50 meV, depending on the calculated value of
the nuclear matrix element. In this poster, the current status of the SuperNEMO
project is presented.
