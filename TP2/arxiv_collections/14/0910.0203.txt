A few inconsistencies remain after it has been ascertained that LMA is the
dominant solution to the solar neutrino problem: why is the SuperKamiokande
spectrum flat and why is the Chlorine rate prediction over two standard
deviations above the data. There also remains the ananswered and important
question of whether the active neutrino flux is constant or time varying. We
propose a scenario involving spin flavour precession to sterile neutrinos with
three active flavours that predicts a flat SuperK spectrum and a Chlorine rate
prediction more consistent with data. We also argue that running the Borexino
experiment during the next few years may provide a very important clue as to
the possible variability of the solar neutrino flux.
