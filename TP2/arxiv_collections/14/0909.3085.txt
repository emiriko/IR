We derive the universal collapse law of degree 1 equivariant wave maps
(solutions of the sigma-model) from the 2+1 Minkowski space-time,to the
2-sphere. To this end we introduce a nonlinear transformation from original
variables to blowup ones. Our formal derivations are confirmed by numerical
simulations.
