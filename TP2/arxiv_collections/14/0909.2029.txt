We have studied the electronic structure of the two-dimensional Heisenberg
antiferromagnet VOCl using photoemission spectroscopy and density functional
theory including local Coulomb repulsion. From calculated exchange integrals
and the observed energy dispersions we argue that the degree of
one-dimensionality regarding both the magnetic and electronic properties is
noticeably reduced compared to the isostructural compounds TiOCl and TiOBr.
Also, our analysis provides conclusive justification to classify VOCl as a
multi-orbital Mott insulator. In contrast to the titanium based compounds
density functional theory here gives a better description of the electronic
structure. However, a quantitative account of the low-energy features and
detailed line shapes calls for further investigations including dynamical and
spatial correlations.
