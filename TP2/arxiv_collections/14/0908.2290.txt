We consider the optimal dynamics in the infinite population evolution models
with general symmetric fitness landscape. The search of optimal evolution
trajectories are complicated due to sharp transitions (like shock waves) in
evolution dynamics with smooth fitness landscapes, which exist even in case of
popular quadratic fitness. We found exact analytical solutions for
discontinuous dynamics at the large genome length limit.
  We found the optimal mutation rates for the fixed fitness landscape. The
single peak fitness landscape gives the fastest dynamics to send the vast
majority of the population from the initial sequence to the neighborhood of the
final sequence.
