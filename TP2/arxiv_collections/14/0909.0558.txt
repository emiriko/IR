We consider three-loop radiative-recoil corrections to hyperfine splitting in
muonium due to insertions of one-loop polarization operator in the muon factor.
The contribution produced by electron polarization insertions are enhanced by
the large logarithm of the electron-muon mass ratio. We obtained all
single-logarithmic and nonlogarithmic radiative-recoil corrections of order
$\alpha^3(m/M)E_F$ generated by the diagrams with electron and muon
polarization insertions.
