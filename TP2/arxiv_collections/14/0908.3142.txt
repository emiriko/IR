Among various parent compounds of iron pnictide superconductors, EuFe2As2
stands out due to the presence of both spin density wave of Fe and
antiferromagnetic ordering (AFM) of the localized Eu2+ moment. Single crystal
neutron diffraction studies have been carried out to determine the magnetic
structure of this compound and to investigate the coupling of two magnetic
sublattices. Long range AFM ordering of Fe and Eu spins was observed below 190
K and 19 K, respectively. The ordering of Fe2+ moments is associated with the
wave vector k = (1,0,1) and it takes place at the same temperature as the
tetragonal to orthorhombic structural phase transition, which indicates the
strong coupling between structural and magnetic components. The ordering of Eu
moment is associated with the wave vector k = (0,0,1). While both Fe and Eu
spins are aligned along the long a axis as experimentally determined, our
studies suggest a weak coupling between the Fe and Eu magnetism.
