The Belle detector at the KEKB electron-positron collider has collected
approximately 800 million Upsilon(4S) events in its decade of operation. The
KEKB group has proposed Super-KEKB, an upgrade of KEKB to increase the
luminosity by two orders of magnitude during a three-year shutdown, with an
ultimate goal of 8E35/cm^2/s luminosity. To exploit the increased luminosity,
an upgrade of the Belle detector has been proposed. A new international
collaboration Belle-II, is being formed, with a broader participation of
European institutes. Super-KEKB and Belle-II were officially placed on the KEK
5-year Roadmap in early 2008. The paper presents physics motivation, basic
methods of the accelerator upgrade, as well as key improvements of the
detector. More details are given on the DEPFET pixel detector that will be
completely built in Europe.
