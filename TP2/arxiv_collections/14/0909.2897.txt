We study the effect of quantum noise on history dependent quantum Parrondo's
games by taking into account different noise channels. Our calculations show
that entanglement can play a crucial role in quantum Parrondo's games. It is
seen that for the maximally entangled initial state in the presence of
decoherence, the quantum phases strongly influence the payoffs for various
sequences of the game. The effect of amplitude damping channel leads to winning
payoffs. Whereas the depolarizing and phase damping channels lead to the losing
payoffs. In case of amplitude damping channel, the payoffs are enhanced in the
presence of decoherence for the sequence AAB. This is because the quantum
phases interfere constructively which leads to the quantum enhancement of the
payoffs in comparison to the undecohered case. It is also seen that the quantum
phase angles damp the payoffs significantly in the presence of decoherence.
Furthermore, it is seen that for multiple games of sequence AAB, under the
influence of amplitude damping channel, the game still remains a winning game.
However, the quantum enhancement reduces in comparison to the single game of
sequence AAB because of the destructive interference of phase dependent terms.
In case of depolarizing channel, the game becomes a loosing game. It is seen
that for the game sequence B the game is loosing one and the behavior of
sequences B and BB is similar for amplitude damping and depolarizing channels.
In addition, the repeated games of A are only influenced by the amplitude
damping channel and the game remains a losing game. Furthermore, it is also
seen that for any sequence when played in series, the phase damping channel
does not influence the game.
