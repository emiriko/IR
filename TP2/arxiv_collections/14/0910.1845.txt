The study deals with the parallelization of 2D and 3D finite element based
Navier-Stokes codes using direct solvers. Development of sparse direct solvers
using multifrontal solvers has significantly reduced the computational time of
direct solution methods. Although limited by its stringent memory requirements,
multifrontal solvers can be computationally efficient. First the performance of
MUltifrontal Massively Parallel Solver (MUMPS) is evaluated for both 2D and 3D
codes in terms of memory requirements and CPU times. The scalability of both
Newton and modified Newton algorithms is tested.
