In order to understand the source and extent of the greater-than-classical
information processing power of quantum systems, one wants to characterize both
classical and quantum mechanics as points in a broader space of possible
theories. One approach to doing this, pioneered by Abramsky and Coecke, is to
abstract the essential categorical features of classical and quantum mechanics
that support various information-theoretic constraints and possibilities, e.g.,
the impossibility of cloning in the latter, and the possibility of
teleportation in both. Another approach, pursued by the authors and various
collaborators, is to begin with a very conservative, and in a sense very
concrete, generalization of classical probability theory--which is still
sufficient to encompass quantum theory--and to ask which "quantum"
informational phenomena can be reproduced in this much looser setting. In this
paper, we review the progress to date in this second programme, and offer some
suggestions as to how to link it with the categorical semantics for quantum
processes developed by Abramsky and Coecke.
