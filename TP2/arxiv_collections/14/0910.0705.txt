We discuss the predictions of a constrained version of the exceptional
supersymmetric standard model (cE6SSM), with a universal high energy soft
scalar mass, soft trilinear coupling and soft gaugino mass. The spectrum
includes a light gluino, a light wino-like neutralino and chargino pair and a
light bino-like neutralino, with other sparticle masses except the lighter stop
being much heavier. We also discuss scenarios with an extra light exotic colour
triplet of fermions and scalars and a TeV scale Z', which lead to early exotic
physics signals at the LHC.
