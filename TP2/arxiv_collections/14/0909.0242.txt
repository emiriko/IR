Systematic measurements on the rate capability of thin MWPCs operated in
Xenon, Argon and Neon mixtures using CO2 as UV-quencher are presented. A good
agreement between data and existing models has been found, allowing us to
present the rate capability of MWPCs in a comprehensive way and ultimately
connect it with the mobilities of the drifting ions.
