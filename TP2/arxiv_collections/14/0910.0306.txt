This paper elaborates the problem of energy-momentum in the framework of
teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity. For this purpose, we consider
energy-momentum prescription derived from the integral form of the constraint
equations developed in the Hamiltonian formulation of the teleparallel
equivalent of General Relativity. We use this technique to investigate
energy-momentum of stationary axisymmetric Einstein-Maxwell solutions and
cosmic string spacetimes. The angular momentum, gravitational and matter
energy-momentum fluxes of these spacetimes are also evaluated. It is concluded
that the results of teleparallel theory are relatively analogous to the results
of General Relativity.
