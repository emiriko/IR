For the realisation of scalable solid-state quantum-bit systems, spins in
semiconductor quantum dots are promising candidates. A key requirement for
quantum logic operations is a sufficiently long coherence time of the spin
system. Recently, hole spins in III-V-based quantum dots were discussed as
alternatives to electron spins, since the hole spin, in contrast to the
electron spin, is not affected by contact hyperfine interaction with the
nuclear spins. Here, we report a breakthrough in the spin coherence times of
hole ensembles, confined in so called natural quantum dots, in narrow
GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells at temperatures below 500 mK. Consistently,
time-resolved Faraday rotation and resonant spin amplification techniques
deliver hole-spin coherence times, which approach in the low magnetic field
limit values above 70 ns. The optical initialisation of the hole spin
polarisation, as well as the interconnected electron and hole spin dynamics in
our samples are well reproduced using a rate equation model.
