Motivated by recent experiments on Ba$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$O$_8$, a new spin-dimer
compound with spin-1/2 moments of Cr$^{5+}$ ions, we theoretically investigate
the field-induced magnetic ordering in this material in view of the
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of triplet excitations (triplons). We apply
the self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Popov (HFP) approach to a microscopic
Hamiltonian, using the realistic triplon dispersion measured in an inelastic
neutron scattering experiment. In particular, we ask to what extent the BEC of
dilute triplons near the critical field can explain the magnetic ordering in
this material. For example, we investigate the temperature range where the BEC
picture of triplons can be applied via the HFP approach. We also determine the
temperature regime where a quadratic approximation of the triplon dispersion
works. It is found that the strength of the effective repulsive interaction
between triplons is much weaker in Ba$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$O$_8$ than in the canonical
spin-dimer compound TlCuCl$_{3}$. Small effective repulsive interaction in
combination with the narrow band of triplons leads to higher density of
triplons $n_{cr}$ at the critical point. It turns out that the combined effect
points to a bigger HFP correction $U n_{cr}$ in Ba$_3$Cr$_2$O$_8$ than in
TlCuCl$_{3}$. Nonetheless, the HFP approach provides a reasonable explanation
of the transverse magnetization and the specific heat data of
Ba$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$O$_8$.
