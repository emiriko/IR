IRPF90 is a Fortran programming environment which helps the development of
large Fortran codes. In Fortran programs, the programmer has to focus on the
order of the instructions: before using a variable, the programmer has to be
sure that it has already been computed in all possible situations. For large
codes, it is common source of error. In IRPF90 most of the order of
instructions is handled by the pre-processor, and an automatic mechanism
guarantees that every entity is built before being used. This mechanism relies
on the {needs/needed by} relations between the entities, which are built
automatically. Codes written with IRPF90 execute often faster than Fortran
programs, are faster to write and easier to maintain.
