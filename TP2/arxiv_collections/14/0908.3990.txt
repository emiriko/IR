We examine the orbital and magnetic order of the two orbital Hubbard model
within dynamical mean field theory. The model describes the low energy physics
of a partially filled $e_g$-band as can be found in some transition metal
compounds. The model shows antiferromagnetic as well as ferromagnetic phases.
For stabilizing ferromagnetism we find that Hund's coupling is particularly
important. Quarter filling represents a very special situation in the phase
diagram, where the coupling of spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom are
involved. Exactly at quarter filling we find a metal insulator transition (MIT)
between two almost fully polarized ferromagnetic states. This MIT can be tuned
by changing the local interaction strength and seems to be a first order
transition at zero temperature. Apart from these ferromagnetic states we were
also able to stabilize antiferromagnetic and charge ordered phases at quarter
filling, depending on the interaction parameters.
