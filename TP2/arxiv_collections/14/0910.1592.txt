Here we show that the overabundance of ultra-luminous, compact X-ray sources
(ULXs) associated with moderately young clusters in interacting galaxies such
as the Antennae and Cartwheel can be given an alternative explanation that does
not involve the presence of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). We argue
that gas density within these systems is enhanced by the collective potential
of the cluster prior to being accreted onto the individual cluster members and,
as a result, the aggregate X-ray luminosity arising from the neutron star
cluster members can exceed $>10^{39} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. Various observational
tests to distinguish between IMBHs and accreting neutron star cusps are
discussed.
