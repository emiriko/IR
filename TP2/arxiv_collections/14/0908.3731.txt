We assemble and reorganize the recent work in the area of hyperelliptic
pairings: We survey the research on constructing hyperelliptic curves suitable
for pairing-based cryptography. We also showcase the hyperelliptic pairings
proposed to date, and develop a unifying framework. We discuss the techniques
used to optimize the pairing computation on hyperelliptic curves, and present
many directions for further research.
