The positivity of the energy in relativistic quantum mechanics implies that
wave functions can be continued analytically to the forward tube T in complex
spacetime. For Klein-Gordon particles, we interpret T as an extended (8D)
classical phase space containing all 6D classical phase spaces as symplectic
submanifolds. The evaluation maps $e_z: f\to f(z)$ of wave functions on T are
relativistic coherent states reducing to the Gaussian coherent states in the
nonrelativistic limit. It is known that no covariant probability interpretation
exists for Klein-Gordon particles in real spacetime because the time component
of the conserved "probability current" can attain negative values even for
positive-energy solutions. We show that this problem is solved very naturally
in complex spacetime, where $|f(x-iy)|^2$ is interpreted as a probability
density on all 6D phase spaces in T which, when integrated over the "momentum"
variables y, gives a conserved spacetime probability current whose time
component is a positive regularization of the usual one. Similar results are
obtained for Dirac particles, where the evaluation maps $e_z$ are spinor-valued
relativistic coherent states. For free quantized Klein-Gordon and Dirac fields,
the above formalism extends to n-particle/antiparticle coherent states whose
scalar products are Wightman functions. The 2-point function plays the role of
a reproducing kernel for the one-particle and antiparticle subspaces.
