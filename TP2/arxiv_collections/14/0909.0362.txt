What is the period of the Fibonacci sequence modulo a prime? The purpose of
our brief expository paper is to illustrate an accessible, motivated treatment
of this classical topic using only ideas from linear and abstract algebra
(rather than the case-by-case analysis found in many papers on the subject, or
techniques from graduate number theory). Our methods extend to general
recurrences with prime moduli and provide some new insights. And our treatment
highlights a nice application of the use of splitting fields that might be
suitable to present in undergraduate course in abstract algebra or Galois
theory.
