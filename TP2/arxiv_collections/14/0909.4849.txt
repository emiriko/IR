An analysis of different dispersion sum rules (DSRs) for the dipole and
quadrupole pion polarizabilities is carried out. We prove the absence of
additional spurious singularities in these approaches. The results of the
calculations of the polarizabilities in the framework of DSRs are compared with
ChPT predictions and with data obtained in different experiments.
