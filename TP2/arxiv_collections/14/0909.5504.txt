Expectation values of physical quantities may accurately be obtained by the
evaluation of integrals within Many-Body Quantum mechanics, and these
multi-dimensional integrals may be estimated using Monte Carlo methods. In a
previous publication it has been shown that for the simplest, most commonly
applied strategy in continuum Quantum Monte Carlo, the random error in the
resulting estimates is not well controlled. At best the Central Limit theorem
is valid in its weakest form, and at worst it is invalid and replaced by an
alternative Generalised Central Limit theorem and non-Normal random error. In
both cases the random error is not controlled. Here we consider a new `residual
sampling strategy' that reintroduces the Central Limit Theorem in its strongest
form, and provides full control of the random error in estimates. Estimates of
the total energy and the variance of the local energy within Variational Monte
Carlo are considered in detail, and the approach presented may be generalised
to expectation values of other operators, and to other variants of the Quantum
Monte Carlo method.
