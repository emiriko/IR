This series of papers is devoted to an open-ended project aimed at the
solution of Hilbert's sixth problem (concerning joint axiomatization of physics
and probability theory) proposed to be constructed in the framework of an
all-embracing mechanics. In this first paper, the bare skeleton of such a
mechanics is constructed in the form of noncommutative Hamiltonian mechanics
(NHM) which combines elements of noncommutative symplectic geometry and
noncommutative probability in the framework of topological superalgebras; it
includes, besides NHM basics, a treatment of Lie group actions in NHM and
noncommutative analogues of the momentum map, Poincar$\acute{e}$-Cartan form
and the symplectic version of Noether's theorem. Canonically induced symplectic
structure on the (skew) tensor product of two symplectic superalgebras (needed
in the description of interaction between systems) is shown to exist if and
only if either both system superalgebras are supercommutative or both
non-supercommutative with a `quantum symplectic structure' characterized by a
\emph{universal} Planck type constant; the presence of such a universal
constant is, therefore, \emph{dictated} by the formalism. This provides proper
foundation for an autonomous development of quantum mechanics as a universal
mechanics.
