We establish the phase diagram of the disordered three-dimensional
Bose-Hubbard model at unity filling, which has been controversial for many
years. The theorem of inclusions, proven in Ref. [1], states that the Bose
glass phase always intervenes between the Mott insulating and superfluid
phases. Here, we note that assumptions on which the theorem is based exclude
phase transitions between gapped (Mott insulator) and gapless phases (Bose
glass). The apparent paradox is resolved through a unique mechanism: such
transitions have to be of the Griffiths type when the vanishing of the gap at
the critical point is due to a zero concentration of rare regions where extreme
fluctuations of disorder mimic a {\it regular} gapless system. An exactly
solvable random transverse field Ising model in one dimension is used to
illustrate the point. A highly non-trivial overall shape of the phase diagram
is revealed with the worm algorithm. The phase diagram features a long
superfluid finger at strong disorder and on-site interaction. Moreover, bosonic
superfluidity is extremely robust against disorder in a broad range of
interaction parameters; it persists in random potentials nearly 50 (!) times
larger than the particle half-bandwidth. Finally, we comment on the feasibility
of obtaining this phase diagram in cold-atom experiments, which work with
trapped systems at finite temperature.
