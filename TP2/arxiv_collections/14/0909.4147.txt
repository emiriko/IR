The generation of heralded pure Fock states via spontaneous parametric down
conversion (PDC) relies on perfect photon-number correlations in the output
modes. Correlations in any other degree of freedom, however, degrade the purity
of the heralded state. In this paper, we investigate spectral entanglement
between the two output modes of a periodically poled waveguide. With the intent
of generating heralded 1- and 2-photon Fock states, we expand the output state
of the PDC to second order in photon number. We explore the effects of spectral
filtering and inefficient detection, of the heralding mode, on the count rate,
g(2) and purity of the heralded state, as well as the fidelity between the
resulting state and an ideal Fock state. We find that filtering can decrease
spectral correlations, however, at the expense of the count rate and increased
photon-number mixedness in the heralded output state. As a physical example, we
model a type II PP-KTP waveguide pumped by lasers at wavelengths of 400 nm, 788
nm and 1930 nm. The latter two allow the fulfillment of extended phase matching
conditions in an attempt to eliminate spectral correlations in the PDC output
state without the use of filtering, however, we find that even in these cases,
some filtering is needed to achieve states of very high purity.
