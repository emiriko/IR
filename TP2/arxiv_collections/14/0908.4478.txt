We carried out visual and parametric searches for dwarf galaxies in five
loose groups of galaxies. Follow-up spectroscopy with the HET has shown a 50%
success rate of morphological selection. The evolutionary status of the studied
groups differs: while the NGC 6962 group has a partially relaxed core,
surrounded by an infall region, the NGC 5005/5033 group and the IC 65 group,
which consist only of late-type galaxies, are probably still assembling.
