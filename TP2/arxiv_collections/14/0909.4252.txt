In this work, we consider the stochastic background of gravitational waves
(SBGWs) produced by pre-galactic stars, which form black holes in scenarios of
structure formation. The calculation is performed in the framework of
hierarchical structure formation using a Press-Schechter-like formalism. Our
model reproduces the observed star formation rate at redshifts z < 6.5. The
signal predicted in this work is below the sensitivity of the first generation
of detectors but could be detectable by the next generation of ground-based
interferometers. Specifically, correlating two coincident advanced LIGO
detectors (LIGO III interferometers), the expected signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N)
could be as high as 90 (10) for stars forming at redshift z ~ 20 with a
Salpeter initial mass function with slope x=0.35 (1.35), and if the efficiency
of generation of gravitational waves is close to the maximum value ~ 7 x
10^{-4}. However, the sensitivity of the future third generation of detectors
as, for example, the European antenna EGO could be high enough to produce
(S/N)}>3 same with efficiency ~ 2 x 10^{-5}. We also discuss what astrophysical
information could be derived from a positive (or even negative) detection of
the SBGWs investigated here.
