A general non-linear response theory is derived for an arbitrary
time-dependent Hamiltonian, not necessarily obeying time-reversal symmetry.
This allows us to obtain a greatly generalized Kubo type formula. Applied to a
mesoscopic system with any type of interactions, and coupled to multiple probes
and gates with arbitrarily time-dependent voltages, we derive
current-conserving differential conductance and current fluctuation matrices
obeying a generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. This relation provides a
common explanation for asymmetries of the excess noise in several non-linear
mesoscopic systems, as well as of its surprising negative sign.
