In this paper we first provide a brief history of the handful of X-ray
polarization measurements that have been accomplished to date. We then outline
new technological developments that indicate more detailed polarization
measurements in this important band of the spectrum can, and should be,
accomplished in the near future. Finally, we depart somewhat from our original
assignment and mention a preliminary result of the most recent observation of
the Crab with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and compare measurement of the
X-ray spectral index as a function of pulse phase with optical polarization
measurements that will be presented in detail elsewhere in these proceedings.
