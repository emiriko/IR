Sneutrino-antisneutrino oscillation can be observed at the LHC by studying a
charge asymmetry of the leptons in the final states. In this talk, we
demonstrate this in the context of an anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking
model which can give rise to a large oscillation probability. The preferred
region of the parameter space is characterized by the presence of a sneutrino
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle and a stau lightest supersymmetric
particle. We show that the signals studied here have certain correlations with
the pattern of the sneutrino oscillation.
