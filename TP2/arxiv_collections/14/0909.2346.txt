We introduce a dynamical matrix model where the matrix $X$ is interpreted as
a Hamiltonian representing interaction of a bosonic system with a single
fermion. We show how a system of second-quantized fermions influences the
ground state of the whole system by producing a gap between the highest
occupied eigenvalue and the lowest unoccupied eigenvalue. We describe the
development of the gap in both, strong and weak coupling regime, while for the
intermediate coupling strength we expect formation of homolumo "kinks".
