Solar coronal loops show significant plasma motions during their formation
and eruption stages. Dynamic cool coronal structures, on the other hand, are
often observed to propagate along coronal loops. In this paper, we report on
the discovery of two types of dynamic cool coronal structures, and characterize
their fundamental properties. Using the EUV 304 angstrom images from the
Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) telescope on the Solar TErrestrial RElation
Observatory (STEREO) and the Ca II filtergrams from the Solar Optical Telescope
(SOT) instrument on HINODE, we study the evolution of an EUV arch and the
kinematics of cool coronal structures. The EUV 304 angstrom observations show
that a missile-like plasmoid moves along an arch-shaped trajectory, with an
average velocity of 31 km/s. About three hours later, a plasma arch forms along
the trajectory, subsequently the top part of the arch fades away and
disappears, meanwhile the plasma belonging to the two legs of the arch flows
downward to the arch feet. During the arch formation and disappearance, SOT Ca
II images explore dynamic cool coronal structures beneath the arch. By tracking
these structures, we classify them into two types. Type I is threadlike in
shape and flows downward with a greater average velocity of 72 km/s, finally it
combines a loop fibril at chromospheric altitude. Type II is
shape-transformable and sometimes rolling as it flows downward with a smaller
velocity of 37 km/s, then disappears insularly in the chromosphere. It is
suggested that the two types of structures are possibly controlled by different
magnetic configurations.
