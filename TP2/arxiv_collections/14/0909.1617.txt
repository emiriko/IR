We calculate emission rates of a massless state from a highly excited
rotating string in perturbative bosonic open string theory. By averaging huge
degeneracies of initial string states with specifying the mass and a single
component of the angular momentum, we find thermal spectrum in a wide range of
the angular momentum. We derive the temperature that characterizes the thermal
spectrum from the partition function of a single rotating string from which we
also find the entropy and the angular velocity of rotating strings. We also
argue based on these quantities the Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence
principle between rotating strings/Kerr black holes for non-extremal as well as
extremal cases. In the parameter region where the Kerr black holes exist, the
thermal spectrum is comparable to scalar emissions from a rotating black hole.
