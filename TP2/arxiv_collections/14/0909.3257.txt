Much work has been devoted, during the past twenty years, to using complexity
to protect elections from manipulation and control. Many results have been
obtained showing NP-hardness shields, and recently there has been much focus on
whether such worst-case hardness protections can be bypassed by frequently
correct heuristics or by approximations. This paper takes a very different
approach: We argue that when electorates follow the canonical political science
model of societal preferences the complexity shield never existed in the first
place. In particular, we show that for electorates having single-peaked
preferences, many existing NP-hardness results on manipulation and control
evaporate.
