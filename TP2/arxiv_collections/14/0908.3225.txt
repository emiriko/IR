For dynamic background models of Goldreich & Weber and Lou & Cao, we examine
3-dimensional perturbation properties of oscillations and instabilities in a
general polytropic homologously collapsing stellar core of a relativistic hot
medium with a polytropic index of 4/3. We identify acoustic p-modes and surface
f-modes as well as internal gravity g$^{+}-$ and g$^{-}-$modes. We demonstrate
that the global energy criterion of Chandrasehkar is insufficient to warrant
the stability of general polytropic equilibria. We confirm the acoustic p-mode
stability of Goldreich & Weber, even though their p-mode eigenvalues appear in
systematic errors. Unstable modes include g$^{-}-$modes and high-order
g$^{+}-$modes. Such instabilities occur before the stellar core bounce, in
contrast to instabilities in other models of supernova explosions. The
breakdown of spherical symmetry happens earlier than expected in numerical
simulations so far. The formation and motion of the central compact object are
speculated to be much affected by such g-mode instabilities. By estimates of
typical parameters, unstable low-order l=1 g-modes may produce initial kicks of
the central compact object.
