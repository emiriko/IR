We report theoretical and experimental results of on-going feasibility
studies to detect cosmic neutrinos acoustically in Lake Baikal. In order to
examine ambient noise conditions and to develop respective pulse detection
techniques a prototype device was created. The device is operating at a depth
of 150 m at the site of the Baikal Neutrino Telescope and is capable to detect
and classify acoustic signals with different shapes, as well as signals from
neutrino-induced showers.
