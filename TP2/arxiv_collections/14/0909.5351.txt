We have performed shell-model calculations for the even- and odd-mass N=82
isotones, focusing attention on low-energy states. The single-particle energies
and effective two-body interaction have been both determined within the
framework of the time-dependent degenerate linked-diagram perturbation theory,
starting from a low-momentum interaction derived from the CD-Bonn
nucleon-nucleon potential. In this way, no phenomenological input enters our
effective Hamiltonian, whose reliability is evidenced by the good agreement
between theory and experiment.
