The relevance of the electronic swap in the stopping process of proton by
hydrogen is investigated. To this end, the Classical Trajectory Monte-Carlo
method is used to calculate the k-stopping cross-section, i.e. the stopping
cross-section given the occurrence of k-swaps during the collision. It is found
that electron swaps can be used to label electron trajectories, as it seems to
describe fairly well the extent of the electron-ion interaction during the
collision. Depending on the ion energy, the number of swaps entering the
stopping cross section may vary. In the keV range the number of swaps can be as
large as five or more, whereas, at larger energies, only three or less electron
swaps may take place in collisions of relevance to stopping.
