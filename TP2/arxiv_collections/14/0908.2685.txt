Results from high resolution spectroscopic analysis of HD 77361 are reported.
The LTE analysis shows that HD 77361 is a K giant of atmospheric parameters:
Teff = 4580 +/- 75 K, log$g$ = 2.5 +/- 0.1, and \xi_{t} = 1.40 +/-0.5 km/s. We
found that the atmosphere of HD 77361 is highly enriched in Li with log
\epsilon (Li) = 3.82 +/- 0.1. With this finding the total number of super
Li-rich K giants (log \epsilon(Li) >= 3.3 ISM value) known till date reached
six. Contrary to first dredge-up, extra-deep mixing and the associated cool
bottom processing, and other recent predictions for K giants on the RGB
luminosity bump phase, HD 77361 shows very low value of 12C/13C = 4.3 +/- 0.5
having, simultaneously, very large amount of Li. Also, HD 77361 is the only
population I low luminosity (log L/L_sun = 1.66 +/- 0.1) low mass K giant (M =
1.5 +/- 0.2M_sun) among the known super Li-rich K giants that has a very low
12C/13C ratio. Results of HD 77361 further constrain our theoretical
understanding of Li enhancement in the atmospheres of RGB stars.
