The master formulae of the CB model of long durations gamma ray bursts (GRBs)
which reproduce very well the light curves and spectral evolution of their
prompt emission pulses and their smooth afterglows, also reproduce very well
the lightcurves and spectral evolution of their X-ray and optical flares. Here
we demonstrate that for GRB090812
