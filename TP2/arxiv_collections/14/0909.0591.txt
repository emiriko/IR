We aim to present a tutorial on the detection, parameter estimation and
statistical analysis of compact sources (far galaxies, galaxy clusters and
Galactic dense emission regions) in cosmic microwave background observations.
The topic is of great relevance for current and future cosmic microwave
background missions because the presence of compact sources in the data
introduces very significant biases in the determination of the cosmological
parameters that determine the energy contain, origin and evolution of the
universe and because compact sources themselves provide us with important
information about the large scale structure of the universe.
