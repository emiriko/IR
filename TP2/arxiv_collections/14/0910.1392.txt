New algorithms are devised for finding the maxima of multidimensional point
samples, one of the very first problems studied in computational geometry. The
algorithms are very simple and easily coded and modified for practical needs.
The expected complexity of some measures related to the performance of the
algorithms is analyzed. We also compare the efficiency of the algorithms with a
few major ones used in practice, and apply our algorithms to find the maximal
layers and the longest common subsequences of multiple sequences.
