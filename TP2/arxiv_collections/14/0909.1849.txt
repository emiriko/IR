Let A be the N\'eron model of an abelian variety A_K over the fraction field
K of a discrete valuation ring R. Due to work of Mazur-Messing, there is a
functorial way to prolong the universal extension of A_K by a vector group to a
smooth and separated group scheme over R, called the canonical extension of A.
In this paper, we study the canonical extension when A_K=J_K is the Jacobian of
a smooth proper and geometrically connected curve X_K over K. Assuming that X_K
admits a proper flat regular model X over R that has generically smooth closed
fiber, our main result identifies the identity component of the canonical
extension with a certain functor Pic^{\natural,0}_{X/R} classifying line
bundles on X that have partial degree zero on all components of geometric
fibers and are equipped with a regular connection. This result is a natural
extension of a theorem of Raynaud, which identifies the identity component of
the N\'eron model J of J_K with the functor Pic^0_{X/R}. As an application of
our result, we prove a comparison isomorphism between two canonical integral
structures on the de Rham cohomology of X_K.
