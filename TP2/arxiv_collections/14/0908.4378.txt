Inelastic neutron scattering measurements on a CePd3 single crystal show a
magnetic response at 300 K that is independent of momentum transfer with a
Lorentzian quasielastic energy spectrum with a half width of 23 meV. This is in
agreement with the Anderson impurity model (AIM), that predicts local moment
relaxational behavior in this temperature regime. The 7 K magnetic response has
an inelastic Lorentzian spectrum, with characteristic energy of 53 meV and half
width 32 meV at the (h, 1/2, 0) zone boundary. Such an inelastic spectrum is
expected for the AIM at low temperature. Unlike the Q-independence of the
impurity model, a variation of intensity with momentum transfer, including
intensity maxima at the zone boundary, is observed in the data. However, this
variation is only of order 20 percent, which is much smaller than that
predicted by the Anderson lattice model (ALM). The large shifts in spectral
weight expected for the ALM as Q varies from zone boundary to zone center are
not observed in the experimental spectra.
