We report successful manipulation of non-classical atomic spin states. We
generate squeezed spin states by a spin quantum nondemolition measurement, and
apply an off-resonant circularly-polarized light pulse to the atoms. By
changing the pulse duration, we have clearly observed a rotation of anisotropic
quantum noise distribution in good contrast with the case of manipulation of a
coherent spin state where the quantum noise distribution is always isotropic.
This is an important step for quantum state tomography, quantum swapping, and
precision spectroscopic measurement.
