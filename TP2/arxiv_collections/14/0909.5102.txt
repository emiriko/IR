We discuss acceleration measurements for a large sample of extragalactic
radio jets from the MOJAVE program which studies the parsec-scale jet structure
and kinematics of a complete, flux-density-limited sample of Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN). Accelerations are measured from the apparent motion of individual
jet features or "components" which may represent patterns in the jet flow. We
find that significant accelerations are common both parallel and perpendicular
to the observed component velocities. Parallel accelerations, representing
changes in apparent speed, are generally larger than perpendicular acceleration
that represent changes in apparent direction. The trend for larger parallel
accelerations indicates that a significant fraction of these changes in
apparent speed are due to changes in intrinsic speed of the component rather
than changes in direction to the line of sight. We find an overall tendency for
components with increasing apparent speed to be closer to the base of their
jets than components with decreasing apparent speed. This suggests a link
between the observed pattern motions and the underlying flow which, in some
cases, may increase in speed close to the base and decrease in speed further
out; however, common hydro-dynamical processes for propagating shocks may also
play a role. About half of the components show "non-radial" motion, or a
misalignment between the component's structural position angle and its velocity
direction, and these misalignments generally better align the component motion
with the downstream emission. Perpendicular accelerations are closely linked
with non-radial motion. When observed together, perpendicular accelerations are
usually in the correct direction to have caused the observed misalignment.
