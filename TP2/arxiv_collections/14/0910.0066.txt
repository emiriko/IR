We investigate the spin relaxation due to the random Rashba spin-orbit
coupling in symmetric GaAs (110) quantum wells from the fully microscopic
kinetic spin Bloch equation approach. All relevant scatterings, such as the
electron-impurity, electron--longitudinal-optical-phonon,
electron--acoustic-phonon, as well as electron-electron Coulomb scatterings are
explicitly included. It is shown that our calculation reproduces the
experimental data by M\"uller {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 206601
(2008)] for a reasonable choice of parameter values. We also predict that the
temperature dependence of spin relaxation time presents a peak in the case with
low impurity density, which originates from the electron-electron Coulomb
scattering.
