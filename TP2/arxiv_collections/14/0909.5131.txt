Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRM) is a sensitive non-invasive
technique to measure the interaction potentials between a colloidal particle
and a wall with femtonewton resolution. The equilibrium distribution of the
particle-wall separation distance z is sampled monitoring the intensity I
scattered by the Brownian particle under evanescent illumination. Central to
the data analysis is the knowledge of the relation between I and the
corresponding z, which typically must be known a priori. This poses
considerable constraints to the experimental conditions where TIRM can be
applied (short penetration depth of the evanescent wave, transparent surfaces).
Here, we introduce a method to experimentally determine I(z) by relying only on
the distance-dependent particle-wall hydrodynamic interactions. We demonstrate
that this method largely extends the range of conditions accessible with TIRM,
and even allows measurements on highly reflecting gold surfaces where multiple
reflections lead to a complex I(z).
