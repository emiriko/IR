Emission from the 6.7 GHz methanol maser transition is very strong, is
relatively stable, has small internal motions, and is observed toward numerous
massive star-forming regions in the Galaxy. Our goal is to perform
high-precision astrometry using this maser transition to obtain accurate
distances to their host regions. Eight strong masers were observed during five
epochs of VLBI observations with the European VLBI Network between 2006 June,
and 2008 March. We report trigonometric parallaxes for five star-forming
regions, with accuracies as good as $\sim22 \mathrm{\mu}$as. Distances to these
sources are $2.57^{+0.34}_{-0.27}$ kpc for ON 1, $0.776^{+0.104}_{-0.083}$ kpc
for L 1206, $0.929^{+0.034}_{-0.033}$ kpc for L 1287, $2.38^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$
kpc for NGC 281-W, and $1.59^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ kpc for S 255. The distances and
proper motions yield the full space motions of the star-forming regions hosting
the masers, and we find that these regions lag circular rotation on average by
$\sim$17 km s$^{-1}$, a value comparable to those found recently by similar
studies.
