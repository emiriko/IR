We report on the first investigation of the quasiparticle local density of
states and superconducting gap in the iron chalcogenide superconductor
Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ ($T_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 14$ K). The surface of
a cleaved crystal revealed an atomic square lattice, superimposed on the
inhomogeneous background, with a lattice constant of $\sim 3.8$ \AA without any
reconstruction. Tunneling spectra measured at 4.2 K exhibit the superconducting
gap, which completely disappears at 18 K, with a magnitude of $\sim 2.3$ meV,
corresponding to $2\Delta / k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{\mathrm{c}}=3.8$.In stark contrast
to the cuprate superconductors, the value of the observed superconducting gap
is relatively homogeneous, following a sharp distribution with a small standard
deviation of 0.23 meV. Conversely, the normal-state local density of states
observed above $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ shows spatial variation over a wide energy
range of more than 1 eV, probably due to the excess iron present in the
crystal.
