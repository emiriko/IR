We prove a conjecture of Kontsevich regarding the solutions of rank two
recursion relations for non-commutative variables which, in the commutative
case, reduce to rank two cluster algebras of affine type. The conjecture states
that solutions are positive Laurent polynomials in the initial cluster
variables. We prove this by use of a non-commutative version of the path models
which we used for the commutative case.
