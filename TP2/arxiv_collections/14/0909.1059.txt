Based on a wide systematics of fission-fragment distributions measured in
low-energy fission, the even-odd staggering in the fission-fragment element
yields is investigated. The well-established evolution of the global even-odd
effect with the fissioning system is found to be only a partial aspect of the
even-odd structure. Indeed, it is shown that the global even-odd effect is
varying systematically with the mean asymmetry of the fission-fragment
distribution, and that the general increase of the even-odd staggering with
asymmetry is depending on the fissioning system. Thus, the dependency of the
even-odd effect with the fissioning system is accredited in part to the
asymmetry evolution of the charge distribution, and not solely related to the
dissipated energy as it has been done earlier. This interpretation is strongly
supported by data measured in inverse kinematics, which cover the complete
charge distribution and include precise yields at symmetry. The relevance of
the order parameter to describe the even-odd effect in fission-fragment yields
as a general property is explored.
