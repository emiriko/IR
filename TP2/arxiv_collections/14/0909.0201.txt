We investigate the characteristic length scales associated with the glass
transition phenomenon. By studying an atomic glass-forming liquid in negatively
curved space, for which the local order is well identified and the amount of
frustration opposing the spatial extension of this order is tunable, we provide
insight into the structural origin of the main characteristics of the dynamics
leading to glass formation. We find that the structural length and the
correlation length characterizing the increasing heterogeneity of the dynamics
grow together as temperature decreases. However, the system eventually enters a
regime in which the former saturates as a result of frustration whereas dynamic
correlations keep building up.
