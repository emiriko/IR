The unitary isobar model MAID2007 has been used to analyze the recent data of
pion electroproduction. The model contains all four-star resonances in the
region below W=2 GeV and both single-Q^2 and Q^2 dependent transition form
factors could be obtained for the Delta, Roper, D13(1520), S11(1535),
S31(1620), S11(1650), D15(1675), F15(1680) and P13(1720). From the complete
world data base, including also pi- data on the neutron, also Q^2 dependent
neutron form factors are obtained. For all transition form factors we also give
convenient numerical parameterizations that can be used in other reactions.
Furthermore, we show how the transition form factors can be used to obtain
empirical transverse charge densities and our first results are given for the
Roper, the S11 and D13 resonances.
