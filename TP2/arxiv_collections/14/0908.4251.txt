We propose a general class of interacting models in which the interaction
between the CDM component and $\Lambda$ is parameterized by an arbitrary
function of the cosmic scale factor $\epsilon(a)$. Differently from other
dynamical $\Lambda$ scenarios in which the final stage of cosmic expansion is a
de Sitter phase, we find solutions of transient acceleration, in which the
$\Lambda$-dark matter interaction will drive the Universe to a new dark
matter-dominated era in the future. We investigate some cosmological
consequences of this model and discuss some constraints on its parameters from
current SNe Ia, BAO, CMB and $H_0$ data.
