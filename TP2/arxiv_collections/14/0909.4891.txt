We construct binary-star population nucleosynthesis models of carbon-enhanced
metal poor (CEMP) stars. We compare the CEMP to EMP (extremely metal poor)
ratio of our models to the observed ratio and find it is an order of magnitude
too small. Through an increase in the efficiency of third dredge-up in
low-mass, low-metallicity thermally-pulsing asymptotic-giant branch (TPAGB)
stars our models better match the observations.
