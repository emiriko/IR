We construct domain-wall brane models based on the grand-unification group
SO(10), generalising the SU(5) model of Davies, George and Volkas. Motivated by
the Dvali-Shifman proposal for the dynamical localisation of gauge bosons, the
SO(10) symmetry is spontaneously broken inside the wall. We present two
scenarios: in the first, the unbroken subgroup inside the wall is SU(5) x
U(1)X, and in the second it is the left-right symmetry group SU(3) x SU(2)L x
SU(2)R x U(1)B-L. In both cases we demonstrate that the
phenomenologically-correct fermion zero modes can be localised to the wall, and
we briefly discuss how the symmetry-breaking dynamics may be extended to induce
breaking to the standard model group with subsequent electroweak breaking.
Dynamically localised gravity is realised through the type 2 Randall-Sundrum
mechanism.
