We have explored the possibility of driving pulsation modes in models of sdO
stars in which the effects of element diffusion, gravitational settling and
radiative levitation have been neglected so that the distribution of iron-peak
elements remains uniform throughout the evolution. The stability of these
models was determined using a non-adiabatic oscillations code. We analysed 27
sdO models from 16 different evolutionary sequences and discovered the first
ever sdO models capable of driving high-radial order g-modes. In one model, the
driving is by a classical kappa-mechanism due to the opacity bump from
iron-peak elements at temperature ~200,000 K. In a second model, the driving
result from the combined action of kappa-mechanisms operating in three distinct
regions of the star: (i) a carbon-oxygen partial ionization zone at temperature
~2 10^6 K, (ii) a deeper region at temperature ~2 10^7 K, which we attribute to
ionization of argon, and (iii) at the transition from radiative to conductive
opacity in the core of the star.
