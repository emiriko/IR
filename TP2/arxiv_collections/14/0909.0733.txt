We propose a reaction-transport model for CTRW with non-linear reactions and
non-exponential waiting time distributions. We derive non-linear evolution
equation for mesoscopic density of particles. We apply this equation to the
problem of fronts propagation into unstable state of reaction-transport systems
with anomalous diffusion. We have found an explicit expression for the speed of
propagating front in the case of subdiffusion transport.
