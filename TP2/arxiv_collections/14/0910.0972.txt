We review our recent achievements in the construction of microscopic mass
tables based on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method with Skyrme effective
interactions. In the latest of our series of HFB-mass models, we have obtained
our best fit ever to essentially all the available mass data, by treating the
pairing more realistically than in any of our earlier models. The rms deviation
on the 2149 measured masses of nuclei with N and Z>8 has been reduced for the
first time in a mean field approach to 0.581 MeV. With the additional
constraint on the neutron-matter equation of state, this new force is thus very
well-suited for the study of neutron-rich nuclei and for the description of
astrophysical environments like supernova cores and neutron-star crusts.
