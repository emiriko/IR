In its all-sky survey, the ESA global astrometry mission Gaia will perform
high-precision astrometry and photometry for 1 billion stars down to $V = 20$
mag. The data collected in the Gaia catalogue, to be published by the end of
the next decade, will likely revolutionize our understanding of many aspects of
stellar and Galactic astrophysics. One of the relevant areas in which the Gaia
observations will have great impact is the astrophysics of planetary systems.
This summary focuses on a) the complex technical problems related to and
challenges inherent in correctly modelling the signals of planetary systems
present in measurements collected with a space-borne observatory poised to
carry out precision astrometry at the micro-arcsecond ($\mu$as) level, and b)
on the potential of Gaia $\mu$as astrometry for important contributions to the
astrophysics of planetary systems.
