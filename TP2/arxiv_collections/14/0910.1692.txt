We present the International Lattice Data Grid (ILDG), a loosely federated
grid of grids for sharing data from Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD)
simulations. The ILDG comprises of metadata, file format and web-service
standards, which can be used to wrap regional data-grid interfaces, allowing
seamless access to catalogues and data in a diverse set of collaborating
regional grids. We discuss the technological underpinnings of the ILDG,
primarily the metadata and the middleware, and offer a critique of its various
aspects with the hindsight of the design work and the first full year of
production.
