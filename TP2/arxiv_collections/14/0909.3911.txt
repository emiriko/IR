A method to extract and recognize isolated characters in license plates is
proposed. In extraction stage, the proposed method detects isolated characters
by using Difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) function, The DOG function, similar to
Laplacian of Gaussian function, was proven to produce the most stable image
features compared to a range of other possible image functions. The candidate
characters are extracted by doing connected component analysis on different
scale DOG images. In recognition stage, a novel feature vector named
accumulated gradient projection vector (AGPV) is used to compare the candidate
character with the standard ones. The AGPV is calculated by first projecting
pixels of similar gradient orientations onto specific axes, and then
accumulates the projected gradient magnitudes by each axis. In the experiments,
the AGPVs are proven to be invariant from image scaling and rotation, and
robust to noise and illumination change.
