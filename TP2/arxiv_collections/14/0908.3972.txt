We propose a new method for evaluating incomplete and complete fusion cross
sections separately using the Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels method.
This method is applied to analysis of the deuteron induced reaction on a 7Li
target up to 50 MeV of the deuteron incident energy. Effects of deuteron
breakup on this reaction are explicitly taken into account. Results of the
method are compared with those of the Glauber model, and the difference between
the two is discussed. It is found that the energy dependence of the incomplete
fusion cross sections obtained by the present calculation is almost the same as
that obtained by the Glauber model, while for the complete fusion cross
section, the two models give markedly different energy dependence. We show also
that a prescription for evaluating incomplete fusion cross sections proposed in
a previous study gives much smaller result than an experimental value.
