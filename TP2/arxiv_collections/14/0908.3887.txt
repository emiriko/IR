Although the Kondo effect and the Kondo ground state of a magnetic impurity
have been investigated for more than forty years it was until recently
difficult if not impossible to calculate spatial properties of the ground
state. In particular the calculation of the spatial distribution of the
so-called Kondo cloud or even its existence have been elusive. In recent years
a new method has been introduced to investigate the properties of magnetic
impurities, the FAIR method, where the abbreviation stands for Friedel
Artificially Inserted Resonance. The FAIR solution of the Friedel-Anderson and
the Kondo impurity problems consists of only eight or four Slater states.
Because of its compactness the spatial electron density and polarization can be
easily calculated. In this article a short review of the method is given. A
comparison with results from the large N-approximation, the Numerical
Renormalization Group theory and other methods shows excellent agreement. The
FAIR solution yields (for the first time) the electronic polarization in the
Kondo cloud.
