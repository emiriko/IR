The paper proposes an integrated approach to the design optimization of
parallel manipulators, which is based on the concept of the workspace grid and
utilizes the goal-attainment formulation for the global optimization. To
combine the non-homogenous design specification, the developed optimization
technique transforms all constraints and objectives into similar performance
indices related to the maximum size of the prescribed shape workspace. This
transformation is based on the dedicated dynamic programming procedures that
satisfy computational requirements of modern CAD. Efficiency of the developed
technique is demonstrated via two case studies that deal with optimization of
the kinematical and stiffness performances for parallel manipulators of the
Orthoglide family.
