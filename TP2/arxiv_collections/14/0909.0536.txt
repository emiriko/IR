We present a rigorous analysis of the Landau-Zener linear-in-time term
crossing problem for quadratic-nonlinear systems relevant to the coherent
association of ultracold atoms in degenerate quantum gases. Our treatment is
based on an exact third-order nonlinear differential equation for the molecular
state probability. Applying a variational two-term ansatz, we construct a
simple approximation that accurately describes the whole-time dynamics of
coupled atom-molecular system for any set of involved parameters. Ensuring an
absolute error less than for the final transition probability, the resultant
solution improves by several orders of magnitude the accuracy of the previous
approximations by A. Ishkhanyan et al. developed separately for the weak
coupling [J. Phys. A 38, 3505 (2005)] and strong interaction [J. Phys. A 39,
14887 (2006)] limits. In addition, the constructed approximation covers the
whole moderate-coupling regime, providing for this intermediate regime the same
accuracy as for the two mentioned limits. The obtained results reveal the
remarkable observation that for the strong-coupling limit the resonance
crossing is mostly governed by the nonlinearity, while the coherent
atom-molecular oscillations arising soon after the resonance has been crossed
are basically of linear nature. This observation is supposed to be of a general
character due to the basic attributes of the resonance crossing processes in
the nonlinear quantum systems of the discussed type of involved quadratic
nonlinearity.
