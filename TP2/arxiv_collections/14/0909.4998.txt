Due to the intrinsic properties of neutrinos, the gravitational lens effect
for neutrino should be more colorful and meaningful than the normal lens effect
of photon. Other than the oscillation experiments operated at terrestrial
laboratory, in principle, we can propose a completely new astrophysical method
to determine not only the nature of gravity and spacetime of lens objects but
also the mixing parameters of neutrinos by analyzing neutrino trajectories near
the central objects. However, compared with the contemporaneous telescopes
through the observation of the electromagnetic radiation, the angular, energy
and time resolution of the neutrino telescopes are still comparatively poor, we
just concentrate on the two classical tests of general relativity, i.e. the
angular deflection and time delay of neutrino by a lens object as a preparative
work in this paper. In addition, some simple properties of neutrino lensing are
investigated.
