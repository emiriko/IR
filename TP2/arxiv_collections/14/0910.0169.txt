The essentials of quantum theory, the Schr\"odinger equation and the Planck
constant, are derived using classical statistical mechanics within the
non-local Machan model. The appearance of complex wave function is connected
with the necessity of quantization condition when one neglects the existence of
the preferred frame and assumes Galilean symmetry of the model.
