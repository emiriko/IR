We present results of our study of tan(beta)-enhanced loop corrections in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with Minimal Flavour Violation
(MFV). We demonstrate that these corrections induce flavour changing neutral
current (FCNC) gluino couplings which have a large impact on the Wilson
coefficient C_8 of the chromomagnetic operator. To illustrate the
phenomenological consequences of this gluino-squark contribution to C_8, we
briefly discuss its effect on the mixing-induced CP asymmetry in the decay B_d
-> phi K_S.
