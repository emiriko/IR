A method to extract B-physics parameters (b-quark mass and fB, fBs decay
constants) from currently available lattice data is presented and tested. The
approach is based on the idea of constructing appropriate ratios of heavy-light
meson masses and decay constants, respectively, possessing a precisely known
static limit, and evaluating them at various pairs of heavy quark masses around
the charm. Via a smooth interpolation in the heavy quark mass from the easily
accessible charm region to the asymptotic point, B-physics parameters are
computed with a few percent (statistical + systematic) error using recently
produced Nf=2 maximally twisted Wilson fermions data.
