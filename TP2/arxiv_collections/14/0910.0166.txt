Our recent neutron scattering measurements of phonons and other
quasi-particle excitations in solid deuterium (sD$_2$) and the extraction of
the density of states for phonons and rotational transitions in sD2 have led us
to a new understanding of the production of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) in sD2.
This new picture is somehow different to earlier published results for sD2. The
cross section for UCN production in sD2 has been determined by using the
density of states G1(E) in combination with the incoherent approximation and by
a direct calibration of our measured neutron cross sections with the known
cross section of the J=1 -> 0 rotational transition in deuterium. Both methods
deliver new data on this cross section and agree quite well with direct
measurements of this energy averaged UCN production cross section.
