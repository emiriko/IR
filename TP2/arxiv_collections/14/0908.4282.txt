We show that the infrared dynamics of string modes dual to $q\bar q$ states
within a Dynamical AdS/QCD model of coupled dilaton-gravity background gives
the Reggelike spectrum of $f0's$ scalars and higher spin mesons consistent with
experimental data. The pion mass and its trajectory were also described with a
scale deformation of the metric and a rescaled string mass. The available
experimental decay widths of the $S\to PP$ decays provided a complementary
check of the proposed classification scheme for$f_0(980)$, $f_0(1370)$,
$f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$ as radial excitations of $f_0(600)$. For $f_0(980)$
we estimated a mixing angle of $\pm 20^o$ with other structures.
