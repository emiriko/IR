In this paper I discuss analytic and numerical calculations of the
magnetic-field and sheet-current distributions in superconducting strips of
width 2a and arbitrary thickness 2b at the center when the cross section is an
ellipse, a rectangle, and a shape intermediate between these limits. Using
critical-state theory, I use several methods to determine the functional
dependence of the ac transport-current losses upon F = I/Ic, where I is the
peak alternating current and Ic is the critical current, and I discuss how this
dependence can be affected by the cross-sectional shape, aspect ratio, and a
flux-density-dependent critical current density Jc(B).
