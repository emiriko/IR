We develop a model anisotropy best-fitting to the two-dimensional sky-map of
multi-TeV galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity observed with the Tibet III air
shower (AS) array. By incorporating a pair of intensity excesses in the
hydrogen deflection plane (HDP) suggested by Gurnett et al., together with the
uni-directional and bi-directional flows for reproducing the observed global
feature, this model successfully reproduces the observed sky-map including the
"skewed" feature of the excess intensity from the heliotail direction, whose
physical origin has long remained unknown. These additional excesses are
modeled by a pair of the northern and southern Gaussian distributions, each
placed ~50 degree away from the heliotail direction. The amplitude of the
southern excess is as large as ~0.2 %, more than twice the amplitude of the
northern excess. This implies that the Tibet AS experiment discovered for the
first time a clear evidence of the significant modulation of GCR intensity in
the heliotail and the asymmetric heliosphere.
