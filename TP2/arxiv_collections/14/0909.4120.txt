Current statistics can be calculated in various ways. Event-based approaches
use the statistics of the number of events occuring during a given time.
Time-based approaches use the statistics of the time needed to reach a given
number of events. By analyzing normal as well as anomalous statistics of
nonequilibrium currents through a two level system in contact with two
different reservoirs, we investigate the conditions under which these different
statistics do or do not yield identical predictions. We rely on the continuous
time random walk formulation introduced in our earlier work [Phys. Rev. E 77,
051119 (2008)].
