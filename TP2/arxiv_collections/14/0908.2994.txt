By studying phase transitions in supersymmetric gauge theories with
Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation, a natural relation is found between sigma
models on certain non-Kahler manifolds with intrinsic torsion and asymmetric
Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. In these orbifold limits, a quantum anomaly of the
orbifold action is cancelled by discrete phases in the partition function.
These intrinsic torsion phases are derived by blowing down cycles supporting
non-trivial H-flux in the linear model. This correspondence extends the CY-LG
correspondence to special non-Kahler manifolds and provides computational tools
with which to study the spectra of associated heterotic flux vacua.
