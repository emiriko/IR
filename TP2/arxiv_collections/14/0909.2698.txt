We discuss the simplest models for the generation of neutrinos masses at tree
level and one-loop level. The realization of the different seesaw mechanisms in
the context of renormalizable SU(5) and SO(10) theories is reviewed. A new
mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses at one-loop level is presented.
We discuss the first realization of the Type III seesaw mechanism in the
context of a renormalizable SU(5) theory, called "Adjoint SU(5)".
