Flare ribbons are always dynamic, and sometimes sweep across sunspots.
Examining 588 (513 M-class and 75 X-class) flare events observed by Transition
Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) satellite and Hinode Solar Optical
Telescope (SOT) from 1998 May to 2009 May, we choose the event displaying that
one of the flare ribbons completely sweeps across the umbra of a main sunspot
of the corresponding active region, and finally obtain 20 (7 X-class and 13
M-class) events as our sample. In each event, we define the main sunspot
completely swept across by the flare ribbon as A-sunspot, and its nearby
opposite polarity sunspots, B-sunspot. Observations show that the A-sunspot is
a following polarity sunspot in 18 events, and displays flux emergence in 13
cases. All the B-sunspots are relatively simple, exhibiting either one main
sunspot or one main sunspot and several small neighboring sunspots (pores). In
two days prior to the flare occurrence, the A-sunspot rotates in all the cases,
while the B-sunspot, in 19 events. The total rotating angle of the A-sunspot
and B-sunspot is 193 degrees on average, and the rotating directions, are the
same in 12 events. In all cases, the A-sunspot and B-sunspot manifest shear
motions with an average shearing angle of 28.5 degrees, and in 14 cases, the
shearing direction is opposite to the rotating direction of the A-sunspot. We
suggest that the emergence, the rotation and the shear motions of the A-sunspot
and B-sunspot result in the phenomenon that flare ribbons sweep across sunspots
completely.
