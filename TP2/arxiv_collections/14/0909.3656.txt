We study noise-induced switching of a system close to bifurcation parameter
values where the number of stable states changes. For non-Gaussian noise, the
switching exponent, which gives the logarithm of the switching rate, displays a
non-power-law dependence on the distance to the bifurcation point. This
dependence is found for Poisson noise. Even weak additional Gaussian noise
dominates switching sufficiently close to the bifurcation point, leading to a
crossover in the behavior of the switching exponent.
