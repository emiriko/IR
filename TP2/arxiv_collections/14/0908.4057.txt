We present experimental studies on ion acceleration from ultra-thin
diamond-like carbon (DLC) foils irradiated by ultra-high contrast laser pulses
of energy 0.7 J focussed to peak intensities of 5*10^{19} W/cm^2. A reduction
in electron heating is observed when the laser polarization is changed from
linear to circular, leading to a pronounced peak in the fully ionized carbon
spectrum at the optimum foil thickness of 5.3 nm. Two-dimensional
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations reveal, that those C^{6+} ions are for the
first time dominantly accelerated in a phase-stable way by the laser radiation
pressure.
