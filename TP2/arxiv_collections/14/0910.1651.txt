Let $(X, J)$ be a compact Kahler manifold with a non-zero holomorphic Poisson
structure $\beta$. If the obstruction space for deformations of generalized
complex structures on $(X, J)$ vanishes, we obtain a family of deformations of
non-trivial bihermitian structures $(J, J^-_t, h_t)$ on $X$ by using $\beta$.
In addition, if the class $[\beta\cdot \omega]$ does not vanish for a K\"ahler
form $\omega$, then the complex structure $J_t^-$ is not equivalent to $J$ for
small $t\neq 0$ under diffeomorphisms.
  Our method is based on the construction of generalized complex and Kahler
structures developed in \cite{Go1} and \cite{Go2}.
  As applications, we obtain such deformations of bihermitian structures on del
Pezzo surfaces, the Hirtzebruch surfaces $F_2, F_3$ and degenerate del Pezzo
surfaces. Further we show that del Pezzo surfaces $S_n (5\leq n\leq 8)$, $F_2$
and degenerate del Pezzo surfaces admit bihermitian structures for which $(X,
J^-_t)$ is not biholomorphic to $(X, J)$ for small $t\neq 0$.
