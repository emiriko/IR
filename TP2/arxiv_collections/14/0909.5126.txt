Rare decays of B mesons, such as B \to K^*\gamma and B\to K^{(*)}\ell^+\ell^-
are loop suppressed in the Standard Model and sensitive to new physics. The
final state meson in heavy-light decays at large recoil has sizeable momentum
in the rest frame of the decaying meson. To reduce the resulting discretization
errors we formulate the nonrelativistic heavy quark action in a moving frame.
We discuss the perturbative renormalization of the leading order heavy-light
operators in the resulting theory which is known as m(oving)NRQCD.
  We also present radiative corrections to the NRQCD action computed using
automated lattice perturbation theory. By combining this technique with
high-beta simulations in the weak coupling regime of the theory higher order
loop corrections can be calculated very efficiently.
