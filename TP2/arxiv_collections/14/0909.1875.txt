Gamow-Teller(GT) transitions in the $\beta$ decays of $^9$Li and $^{11}$Li
are investigated with theoretical calculations of antisymmetrized molecular
dynamics. The calculated $B(GT)$ values are small for transitions to low-lying
states in Be isotopes, while relatively large $B(GT)$ values are found for
excited states at excitation energy $E_x\ge 10$ MeV. Sum of the $B(GT)$ values
are discussed for each spin parity of final states. The calculated results seem
to be inconsistent with the experimental report of the strongest GT-transition
from $^9$Li to the $5/2^-$ state at 11.8 MeV of $^9$Be.
