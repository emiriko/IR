The exchange interaction and correlations may produce a power-law decay
instead of the usual exponential decrease of the wave function under potential
barrier. The exchange-assisted tunneling vanishes in the classical limit,
however, the dependence on the Planck constant h is different from that for a
conventional single-particle tunneling.
