Aims: The launch of Swift has allowed many more novae to be observed
regularly over the X-ray band. Such X-ray observations of novae can reveal
ejecta shocks and the nuclear burning white dwarf, allowing estimates to be
made of the ejecta velocity. Methods: We analyse XMM-Newton and Swift X-ray and
UV observations of the nova V598 Pup, which was initially discovered in the
XMM-Newton slew survey. These data were obtained between 147 and 255 days after
the nova outburst, and are compared with the earlier, brighter slew detection.
Results: The X-ray spectrum consists of a super-soft source, with the soft
emission becoming hotter and much fainter between days ~147 and ~172 after the
outburst, and a more slowly declining optically thin component, formed by
shocks with kT ~ 200-800 eV (corresponding to velocities of 400-800 km s^-1).
The main super-soft phase had a duration of less than 130 days. The Reflection
Grating Spectrometer data show evidence of emission lines consistent with
optically thin emission of kT ~100 eV and place a limit on the density of the
surrounding medium of log(n_e/cm^-3) < 10.4 at the 90 % level. The UV emission
is variable over short timescales and fades by at least one magnitude (at
lambda ~ 2246-2600 angstrom) between days 169 and 255.
