We calculate the entropic part of partition function of a bubble embedded in
a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) by considering the total weights of possible
configurations of a system of two single stranded DNA (ssDNA) of given length
which start from a point along the contour of dsDNA and reunite at a position
vector {\bf r} measured from the first point and the distribution function of
the position vector {\bf r} which separates the two zipper forks of the bubble
in dsDNA. For the distribution function of position vector {\bf r} we use the
distribution of the end-to-end vector {\bf r} of strands of given length of
dsDNA found from the wormlike chain model. We show that when the chains forming
the bubble are assumed to be Gaussian the so called loop closure exponent $c$
is 3 and when we made correction by including self avoidence in each chain the
value of $c$ becames 3.2.
