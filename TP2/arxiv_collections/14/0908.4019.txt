We report on the linear and nonlinear optical response of metamaterials
evoked by first and second order multipoles. The analytical ground on which our
approach bases permits for new insights into the functionality of
metamaterials. For the sake of clarity we focus here on a key geometry, namely
the split-ring resonator, although the introduced formalism can be applied to
arbitrary structures. We derive the equations that describe linear and
nonlinear light propagation where special emphasis is put on second harmonic
generation. This contribution basically aims at stretching versatile and
existing concepts to describe light propagation in nonlinear media towards the
realm of metamaterials.
