We have performed high-resolution hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy for
the metal-insulator transition (MIT) system (V(1-x)Cr(x))2O3 in the
paramagnetic metal, paramagnetic insulator and antiferromagentic insulator
phases. The quality of the spectra enables us to conclude that the on-site
Coulomb energy U does not change through the MIT, which eliminate all but one
theoretical MIT scenario in this paradigm material.
