Epitaxial graphene films were formed on the Si-face of semi-insulating 4H-SiC
substrates by a high temperature sublimation process. A high-k gate stack on
epitaxial graphene is realized by inserting a fully oxidized nanometer thin
aluminum film as a seeding layer followed by an atomic-layer deposition
process. The electrical properties of epitaxial graphene films are sustained
after gate stack formation without significant degradation. At low
temperatures, the quantum-Hall effect in Hall resistance is observed along with
pronounced Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations in diagonal magneto-resistance of
gated epitaxial graphene on SiC (0001).
