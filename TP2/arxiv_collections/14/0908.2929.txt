A dynamic process of repeating collisions of a pair of trapped neutral
particles with weak spin-dependent interaction is designed and studied. Related
theoretical derivation and numerical calculation have been performed to study
the inherent coordinate-spin and momentum-spin correlation. Due to the
repeating collisions the effect of the weak interaction can be accumulated and
enlarged, and therefore can be eventually detected. Numerical results suggest
that the Cr-Cr interaction, which has not yet been completely clear, could be
thereby determined. The design can be in general used to determine various
interactions among neutral atoms and molecules, in particular for the
determination of very weak forces.
