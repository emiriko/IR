We report observations of the eclipsing classical nova V368 Aql (Nova Aql
1936 No. 2). These data reveal that the orbital period previously published by
Diaz & Bruch is an alias of the true orbital period. A total of 14 eclipses (12
complete and 2 partial) over 25 nights of observation have established that the
orbital period of V368 Aql is 0.6905093(1) d (16.57 hr), which is roughly twice
the previously published period. With its revised orbital period, V368 Aql now
joins other nova systems with periods in excess of 0.5 day that dominate the
long end of the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variables.
