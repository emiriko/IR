In this paper we report on results of our investigation into the algebraic
structure supported by the combinatorial geometry of the cyclohedron. Our new
graded algebra structures lie between two well known Hopf algebras: the
Malvenuto-Reutenauer algebra of permutations and the Loday-Ronco algebra of
binary trees. Connecting algebra maps arise from a new generalization of the
Tonks projection from the permutohedron to the associahedron, which we discover
via the viewpoint of the graph associahedra of Carr and Devadoss. At the same
time that viewpoint allows exciting geometrical insights into the
multiplicative structure of the algebras involved. Extending the Tonks
projection also reveals a new graded algebra structure on the simplices.
Finally this latter is extended to a new graded Hopf algebra (one-sided) with
basis all the faces of the simplices.
