Several liters of an organic liquid scintillator (LS) loaded with Nd have
been made. We report on performances of this scintillator in terms of optical
properties, radiopurity and light yield for a Nd concentration of 6.5 g/l. A
possible application to search for the 150Nd neutrinoless double beta decay
with a 10-ton scale LS detector is discussed together with further
improvements.
