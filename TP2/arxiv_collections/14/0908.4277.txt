We present ugriz light curves for 146 spectroscopically confirmed or
spectroscopically probable Type Ia supernovae from the 2005 season of the
SDSS-II Supernova survey. The light curves have been constructed using a
photometric technique that we call scene modelling, which is described in
detail here; the major feature is that supernova brightnesses are extracted
from a stack of images without spatial resampling or convolution of the image
data. This procedure produces accurate photometry along with accurate estimates
of the statistical uncertainty, and can be used to derive photometry taken with
multiple telescopes. We discuss various tests of this technique that
demonstrate its capabilities. We also describe the methodology used for the
calibration of the photometry, and present calibrated magnitudes and fluxes for
all of the spectroscopic SNe Ia from the 2005 season.
