The quark-gluon medium described by QCD equations is considered at high
energies. Within the assumptions of the linear response theory the
chromopermittivity of the medium is introduced and it is argued that it exceeds
1 at TeV energies. The dispersion equations show that the proper modes of the
medium reveal instability and the parton currents traversing it induce the
emission of Cherenkov gluons. Their distributions at LHC can differ from those
typical for lower energies of RHIC because they are determined by the high
energy dependence of the chromopermittivity while the latter ones arise due to
collective resonance excitations. The distinction between Cherenkov gluons and
Mach waves is discussed.
