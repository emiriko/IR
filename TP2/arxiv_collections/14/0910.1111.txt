We study large deviations of the dynamical activity in the random orthogonal
model (ROM). This is a fully connected spin-glass model with one-step replica
symmetry breaking behaviour, consistent with the random first-order transition
scenario for structural glasses. We show that this model displays dynamical
(space-time) phase-transitions between active and inactive phases, as
demonstrated by singularities in large deviation functions. We argue that such
transitions are generic in systems with long-lived metastable states.
