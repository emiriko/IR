It is shown that the jump in the momentum distribution of Fermi gases evolves
smoothly for small and intermediate times once an interaction between the
fermions is suddenly switched on. The jump does not vanish abruptly. The loci
in momentum space where the jumps occur are those of the noninteracting Fermi
sea. No relaxation of the Fermi surface geometry takes place.
