Recent results on the QCD phase diagram are reviewed. We begin with a
detailed introduction of lattice techniques. Then results at vanishing chemical
potential are presented. The order of the phase transition, the transition
temperature and the equation of state are discussed. At non-vanishing chemical
potential we study the mu-T phase line, the critical point as well as the
equation of state.
