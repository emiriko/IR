According to experimental data at GSI, the rates of the number of daughter
ions, produced by the nuclear K-shell electron capture (EC) decays of the
H-like 140Pr58+, 142Pm60+ and 122I52+ ions, are modulated in time with periods
T_{EC} of the order of a few seconds, obeying an A-scaling T_{EC} = A/20 s,
where A is the mass number of the mother nuclei, and with amplitudes a^{EC}_d ~
0.21. In turn, the positron decay mode of the H-like 142Pm60+ ions showed no
time modulation of the decay rates. As has been shown in Phys. Rev. Lett. 103,
062502 (2009) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 182501 (2008), these data can be
explained by the interference of two neutrino mass-eigenstates. In this letter
we give a reply on the comments on our paper Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 062502
(2009) by V. Flambaum (arXiv: 0908.2039 [nucl-th]).
