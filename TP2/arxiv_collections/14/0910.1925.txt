We present a study of the mixing properties of the simulated intra cluster
Medium, using tracers particles that are advected by the gas flow during the
evolution of cosmic structures. Using a sample of seven galaxy clusters (with
masses in the range of M=2-3 10^14Msol/h) simulated with a peak resolution of
25kpc/h up to the distance of two virial radii from their centers, we
investigate the application of tracers to some important problems concerning
the mixing of the ICM. The transport properties of the evolving ICM are studied
through the analysis of pair dispersion statistics and mixing distributions. As
an application, we focus on the transport of metals in the ICM. We adopt simple
scenarios for the injection of metal tracers in the ICM, and find remarkable
differences of metallicity profiles in relaxed and merger systems, also through
the analysis of simulated emission from Doppler-shifted Fe XXIII lines.
