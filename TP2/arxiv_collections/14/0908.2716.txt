The Randall-Sundrum framework provides an appealing solution to both the
gauge hierarchy and the flavour problem. The model with enlarged custodial
symmetry is consistent with electroweak precision observables for Kaluza-Klein
(KK) scales as low as 2-3 TeV, so that the lowest-lying KK modes could be
observed at the LHC. The presence of the heavy KK gauge bosons induces new tree
level contributions to flavour violating observables. We summarise the main
results for K and B physics observables in the Delta F = 2 and Delta F = 1
sectors. The specific pattern of new physics effects can be used to distinguish
this model from other new physics frameworks.
