We have used the GALEX ultraviolet telescope to study stellar populations and
star formation morphology in a well-defined sample of more than three dozen
nearby optically-selected pre-merger interacting galaxy pairs. We have combined
the GALEX NUV and FUV images with broadband optical maps from the Sloan
Digitized Sky Survey to investigate the ages and extinctions of the tidal
features and the disks. We have identified a few new candidate tidal dwarf
galaxies in this sample, as well as other interesting morphologies such as
accretion tails, `beads on a string', and `hinge clumps'. In only a few cases
are strong tidal features seen in HI maps but not in GALEX.
