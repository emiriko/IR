As a sister work of Ref.[1], we incorporate the color-screening effect due to
light quark pair creation into the heavy quark-antiquark potential, and
investigate the effects of screened potential on the spectrum of bottomonium.
We calculate the masses, electromagnetic decays, and E1 transitions of
bottomonium states. We find that the fine splittings between $\chi_{bJ}$
(J=0,1,2) states are in good agreement with experimental data, and the E1
transition rates of $\Upsilon(2S)\to\gamma\chi_{bJ}(1P)$ and
$\Upsilon(3S)\to\gamma\chi_{bJ}(2P)$ (J=0,1,2) all agree with data within
experimental errors. In particular, the mass of $\Upsilon(6S)$ is lowered down
to match that of the $\Upsilon(11020)$, which is smaller than the predictions
of the linear potential models by more than 100 MeV. Comparison between
charmonium and bottomonium in some related problems is also discussed.
