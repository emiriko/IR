Polycrystalline samples of ternary rare earth germanides
R$_{2}$Co$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$(R = La, Ce and Pr) have been prepared and investigated
by means of magnetic susceptibility, isothermal magnetization, electrical
resistivity and specific heat measurements. All these compounds crystallize in
orthorhombic U$_{2}$Co$_{3}$Si$_{5}$ structure (space group \textit{Ibam}). No
evidence of magnetic or superconducting transition is observed in any of these
compounds down to 2 K. The unit cell volume of Ce$_{2}$Co$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$
deviates from the expected lanthanide contraction, indicating non trivalent
state of Ce ions in this compound. The reduced value of effective moment
($\mu_{eff}$ $\approx$ 0.95 $\mu_{B}$) compared to that expected for trivalent
Ce ions further supports valence fluctuating nature of Ce in
Ce$_{2}$Co$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$. The observed temperature dependence of magnetic
susceptibility is consistent with ionic interconfiguration fluctuation (ICF)
model. Although no sharp anomaly due to a phase transition is seen, a broad
Schottky-type anomaly is observed in the magnetic part of specific heat of
Pr$_{2}$Co$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$. An analysis of $C_{mag}$ data suggests a singlet
ground state in Pr$_{2}$Co$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ separated from the singlet first
excited state by 22 K and a doublet second excited state at 73 K.
