We derive measurable lower bounds on concurrence of arbitrary mixed states,
for both bipartite and multipartite cases. First, we construct measurable lower
bonds on the purely algebraic bounds of concurrence [F. Mintert et al. (2004),
Phys. Rev. lett., 92, 167902]. Then, using the fact that the sum of the square
of the algebraic bounds is a lower bound of the squared concurrence, we sum
over our measurable bounds to achieve a measurable lower bound on concurrence.
With two typical examples, we show that our method can detect more entangled
states and also can give sharper lower bonds than the similar ones.
