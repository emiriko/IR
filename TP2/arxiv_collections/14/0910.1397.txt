Using simple 6D junction conditions, we describe two surprising geometries.
First in a case of transitions between dS4xS2 vacua, the S2 can be stretched
significantly larger than the vacuum values both before and after the
transition. Then we discover that the naive instability to decompactification
is actually a bubble of nothing instead.
