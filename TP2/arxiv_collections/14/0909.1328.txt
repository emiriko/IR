We study the dynamic efficiency of conversion of kinetic-to-thermal/magnetic
energy of internal shocks in relativistic magnetized outflows. We model
internal shocks as being caused by collisions of shells of plasma with the same
energy flux and a non-zero relative velocity. The contact surface, where the
interaction between the shells takes place, can break up either into two
oppositely moving shocks (in the frame where the contact surface is at rest),
or into a reverse shock and a forward rarefaction. We find that for moderately
magnetized shocks (magnetization $\sigma\simeq 0.1$), the dynamic efficiency in
a single two-shell interaction can be as large as 40%. Thus, the dynamic
efficiency of moderately magnetized shocks is larger than in the corresponding
unmagnetized two-shell interaction. If the slower shell propagates with a
sufficiently large velocity, the efficiency is only weakly dependent on its
Lorentz factor. Consequently, the dynamic efficiency of shell interactions in
the magnetized flow of blazars and gamma-ray bursts is effectively the same.
These results are quantitatively rather independent on the equation of state of
the plasma. The radiative efficiency of the process is expected to be a
fraction $f_r<1$ of the estimated dynamic one, the exact value of $f_r$
depending on the particularities of the emission processes which radiate away
the thermal or magnetic energy of the shocked states.
