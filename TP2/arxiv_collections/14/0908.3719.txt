We develop a scalable architecture for quantum computation using controllable
electrons of double-dot molecules coupled to a microwave stripline resonator on
a chip, which satisfies all Divincenzo criteria. We analyze the performance and
stability of all required operations and emphasize that all techniques are
feasible with current experimental technologies.
