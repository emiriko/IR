We apply a recently proposed criterion for the existence of phase
transitions, which is based on the properties of the saddles of the energy
landscape, to a simplified model of a system with gravitational interactions,
referred to as the self-gravitating ring model. We show analytically that the
criterion correctly singles out the phase transition between a homogeneous and
a clustered phase and also suggests the presence of another phase transition,
not previously known. On the basis of the properties of the energy landscape we
conjecture on the nature of the latter transition.
