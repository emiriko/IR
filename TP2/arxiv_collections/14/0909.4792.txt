We present progenitor-star detections, light curves, and optical spectra of
SN2009ip and the 2009 optical transient in UGC2773 (U2773-OT), which were not
genuine SNe. Precursor variability in the decade before outburst indicates that
both of the progenitor stars were LBVs. Their pre-outburst light curves
resemble the S Doradus phases that preceded giant eruptions of eta Carinae and
SN1954J (V12 in NGC2403), with intermediate progenitor luminosities. HST
detections a decade before discovery indicate that the SN2009ip and U2773-OT
progenitors were supergiants with likely initial masses of 50-80 Msun and
$\ga$20 Msun, respectively. Both outbursts had spectra befitting known LBVs,
although in different physical states. SN 2009ip exhibited a hot LBV spectrum
with characteristic speeds of 550 km/s, plus faster material up to 5000 km/s,
resembling the slow Homunculus and fast blast wave of eta Carinae. U2773-OT
shows a forest of narrow absorption and emission lines comparable to that of S
Dor in its cool state, plus [CaII] emission and an IR excess indicative of
dust, similar to SN2008S and N300-OT. [CaII] emission is probably tied to a
dusty pre-outburst environment, and not the outburst mechanism. SN2009ip and
U2773-OT may provide a critical link between historical LBV eruptions, while
U2773-OT may provide a link between LBVs and SN2008S and N300-OT. Future
searches will uncover more examples of precursor LBV variability of this kind,
providing key clues that may help unravel the instability driving LBVs.
