This paper concerns integral varifolds of arbitrary dimension in an open
subset of Euclidean space with its first variation given by either a Radon
measure or a function in some Lebesgue space. Pointwise decay results for the
quadratic tilt-excess are established for those varifolds. The results are
optimal in terms of the dimension of the varifold and the exponent of the
Lebesgue space in most cases, for example if the varifold is not
two-dimensional.
