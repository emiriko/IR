We implement Dirac neutrinos in the minimal custodial Randall-Sundrum setting
via the Krauss-Wilczek mechanism. We demonstrate by giving explicit lepton mass
matrices that with neutrinos in the normal hierarchy, lepton mass and mixing
patterns can be naturally reproduced at the scale set by the constraints from
electroweak precision measurements, and at the same time without violating
bounds set by lepton flavour violations. Our scenario generically predicts a
nonzero neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, as well as the existence of
sub-TeV right-handed Kaluza-Klein neutrinos, which partner the right-handed
Standard Model charged leptons. These relatively light KK neutrinos may be
searched for at the LHC.
