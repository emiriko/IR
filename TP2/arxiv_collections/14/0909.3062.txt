The observed distribution of globular cluster binary radio pulsars in the
eccentricity versus orbital period plane can be explained as a result of
binary-single star interactions. Our numerical and analytical study hints that
the highest eccentricity binaries in clusters are likely to be from exchange
and/or merger of a single star with a binary component, while the intermediate
eccentricity systems are probably results of fly-by interactions.
