The search for the Higgs boson at the Tevatron and the LHC relies on detailed
calculations of the kinematics of Higgs boson production and decay. In this
paper, we improve the calculation of the distribution in transverse momentum,
$Q_T$, of the Higgs boson in the gluon fusion production process, $gg\to H$, by
matching the resummed distribution at small $Q_T$ with the ${\cal
O}(\alpha_{s}^4)$ fixed-order perturbative calculation at high $Q_T$ in the
ResBos Monte Carlo program. The distribution is higher at large $Q_T$ than with
the old ${\cal O}(\alpha_{s}^3)$ fixed-order perturbative calculation, and the
matching with the resummed calculation is much smoother. The total cross
section is also increased, more in line with next-to-next-to-leading-order
calculations. We also study the effect of the new calculation on the
distribution of $\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}$ in the overall process $gg\to H\to
W^{+} W^{-}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}$, and the effect of PDF
uncertainties on the distributions at the Tevatron and the LHC.
