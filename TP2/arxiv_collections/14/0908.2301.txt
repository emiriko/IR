Four-point functions of R-currents are discussed within Anti-de Sitter
supergravity. In particular, we compute Witten diagrams with graviton and gauge
boson exchange in the high energy Regge limit. Assuming validity of the AdS/CFT
correspondence, our results apply to R-current four-point functions of N=4
super Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling.
