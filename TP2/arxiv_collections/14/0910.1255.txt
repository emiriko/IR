This paper presents a new method and a constraint-based objective function to
solve two problems related to the design of optical telecommunication networks,
namely the Synchronous Optical Network Ring Assignment Problem (SRAP) and the
Intra-ring Synchronous Optical Network Design Problem (IDP). These network
topology problems can be represented as a graph partitioning with capacity
constraints as shown in previous works. We present here a new objective
function and a new local search algorithm to solve these problems. Experiments
conducted in Comet allow us to compare our method to previous ones and show
that we obtain better results.
