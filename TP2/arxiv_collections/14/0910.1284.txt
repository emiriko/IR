Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations of hot fission in $^{240}\textrm{Pu}$
have been performed with a newly-implemented code that uses the D1S
finite-range effective interaction. The hot-scission line is identified in the
quadrupole-octupole-moment coordinate space. Fission-fragment shapes are
extracted from the calculations. A benchmark calculation for
$^{226}\textrm{Th}$ is obtained and compared to results in the literature. In
addition, technical aspects of the use of HFB calculations for fission studies
are examined in detail. In particular, the identification of scission
configurations, the sensitivity of near-scission calculations to the choice of
collective coordinates in the HFB iterations, and the formalism for the
adjustment of collective-variable constraints are discussed. The power of the
constraint-adjustment algorithm is illustrated with calculations near the
critical scission configurations with up to seven simultaneous constraints.
