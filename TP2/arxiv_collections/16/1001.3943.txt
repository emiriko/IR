We study the effect of spatially dependent mass function over the solution of
the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential in the (3+1)-dimensions for any
arbitrary spin-orbit $\kappa $ state$.$ In the framework of the spin and
pseudospin symmetry concept, the analytic bound state energy eigenvalues and
the corresponding upper and lower two-component spinors of the two Dirac
particles are obtained by means of the Nikiforov-Uvarov method, in closed form.
This physical choice of the mass function leads to an exact analytical solution
for the pseudospin part of the Dirac equation. The special cases $% \kappa =\pm
1$ ($l=\widetilde{l}=0,$ i.e., s-wave)$,$ the constant mass and the
non-relativistic limits are briefly investigated.
