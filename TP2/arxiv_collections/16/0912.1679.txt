Using the Two-dimensional Oscillation Program (TOP), we have explored the
effects of rapid rotation on gravity modes in polytropic stars. Coriolis force,
centrifugal distortion as well as compressible effects have been taken into
account. Thanks to our complete calculation, we have first studied the validity
domain of perturbative methods and started to explore properties of these
modes. We focus on l=1 in this analysis.
