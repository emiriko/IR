We use multifrequency matched filters to estimate, in the WMAP 5-year data,
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) fluxes of 893 ROSAT NORAS/REFLEX clusters spanning
the luminosity range Lx,[0.1-2.4]keV = 2 10^{41} - 3.5 10^{45} erg s^{-1}. The
filters are spatially optimised by using the universal pressure profile
recently obtained from combining XMM-Newton observations of the REXCESS sample
and numerical simulations. Although the clusters are individually only
marginally detected, we are able to firmly measure the SZ signal (>10 sigma)
when averaging the data in luminosity/mass bins. The comparison between the
bin-averaged SZ signal versus luminosity and X-ray model predictions shows
excellent agreement, implying that there is no deficit in SZ signal strength
relative to expectations from the X-ray properties of clusters. Using the
individual cluster SZ flux measurements, we directly constrain the Y500-Lx and
Y500-M500 relations, where Y500 is the Compton y-parameter integrated over a
sphere of radius r500. The Y500-M500 relation, derived for the first time in
such a wide mass range, has a normalisation Y*500=[1.60 pm 0.19] 10^{-3}
arcmin^2 at M500=3 10^{14} h^{1} Msun, in excellent agreement with the X-ray
prediction of 1.54 10^{-3} arcmin^2, and a mass exponent of alpha=1.79 pm 0.17,
consistent with the self-similar expectation of 5/3. Constraints on the
redshift exponent are weak due to the limited redshift range of the sample,
although they are compatible with self-similar evolution.
