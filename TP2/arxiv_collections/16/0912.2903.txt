The effects of ultrasound on the dynamics of an air-water meniscus in a
planar micro-geometry are investigated experimentally. The sonicated meniscus
exhibits harmonic traveling waves or standing waves, the latter corresponding
to a higher ultrasound level. Standing capillary waves with subharmonic and
superharmonic frequencies are also observed, and are explained in the framework
of parametric resonance theory, using the Mathieu equation.
