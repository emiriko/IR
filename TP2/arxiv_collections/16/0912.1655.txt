In cellular Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) networks,
Co-Channel Interference (CCI) leads to severe degradation in the BER
performance. To solve this problem, Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE) CCI
cancellation scheme has been proposed in the literature. MLE CCI cancellation
scheme generates weighted replicas of the transmitted signals and selects
replica with the smallest Euclidean distance from the received signal. When the
received power of the desired and interference signals are nearly the same, the
BER performance is degraded. In this paper, we propose an improved MLE CCI
canceler with closed-loop Power Control (PC) scheme capable of detecting and
combating against the equal received power situation at the Mobile Station (MS)
receiver by using the newly introduced parameter Power Ratio (PR). At cell edge
where Signal to Interferer Ratio (SIR) is considered to have average value
between -5 and 10 dB, computer simulations show that the proposed closed-loop
PC scheme has a gain of 7 dB at 28 km/h and about 2 dB at 120 km/h.
