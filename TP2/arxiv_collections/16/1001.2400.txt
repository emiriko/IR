We review our recent results of Alfven wave-driven winds. First, we present
the result of a self-consistent 1D MHD simulations for solar winds from the
photosphere to interplanetary region. Here, we emphasize the importance of the
reflection of Alfven waves in the density stratified corona and solar winds. We
also introduce the recent HINODE observation that might detect the reflection
signature of transverse (Alfvenic) waves by Fujimura & Tsuneta (2009). Then, we
show the results of Alfven wave-driven winds from red giant stars. We explain
the change of the atmosphere properties from steady coronal winds to
intermittent chromospheric winds and discuss how the wave reflection is
affected by the decrease of the surface gravity with stellar evolution. We also
discuss similarities and differences of accretion disk winds by MHD turbulence.
