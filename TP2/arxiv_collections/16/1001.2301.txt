We examine cosmological perturbations in a dynamical theory of inflation in
which an Abelian gauge field couples directly to the inflaton, breaking
conformal invariance. When the coupling between the gauge field and the
inflaton takes a specific form, inflation becomes anisotropic and anisotropy
can persist throughout inflation, avoiding Wald's no-hair theorem. After
discussing scenarios in which anisotropy can persist during inflation, we
calculate the dominant effects of a small persistent anisotropy on the
primordial gravitational wave and curvature perturbation power spectra using
the "in-in" formalism of perturbation theory. We find that the primordial power
spectra of cosmological perturbations gain significant direction dependence and
that the fractional direction dependence of the tensor power spectrum is
suppressed in comparison to that of the scalar power spectrum.
