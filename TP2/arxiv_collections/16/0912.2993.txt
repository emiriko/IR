According to the standard cosmology, near the last scattering surface, the
photons scattered via Compton scattering are just linearly polarized and then
the primordial circular polarization of the CMB photons is zero. In this work
we show that CMB polarization acquires a small degree of circular polarization
when a background magnetic field is considered or the quantum electrodynamic
sector of standard model is extended by Lorentz-noninvariant operators as well
as noncommutativity. The existence of circular polarization for the CMB
radiation may be verified during future observation programs and it represents
a possible new channel for investigating new physics effects.
