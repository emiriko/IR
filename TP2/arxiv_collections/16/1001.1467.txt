Two-body scattering of neutral particles in a trap is studied theoretically.
The control of the initial state is realized by using optical traps. The
collisions inside the trap occur repeatedly; thereby the effect of interaction
can be accumulated. Two periodic phenomena with a shorter and a much longer
period, respectively, are found. The latter is sensitive to the interaction.
Instead of measuring the differential cross section as usually does, the
measurement of the longer period and the details of the periodic behavior might
be a valid source of information on weak interactions among neutral particles.
