A R&D project has been recently launched to investigate Geant4 architectural
design in view of addressing new experimental issues in HEP and other related
physics disciplines. In the context of this project the use of generic
programming techniques besides the conventional object oriented is
investigated. Software design features and preliminary results from a new
prototype implementation of Geant4 electromagnetic physics are illustrated.
Performance evaluations are presented. Issues related to quality assurance in
Geant4 physics modelling are discussed.
