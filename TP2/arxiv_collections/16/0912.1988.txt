The statistical mechanics of 1D and 2D Ginzburg-Landau systems is evaluated
analytically, via the transfer matrix method, using an expression of the ground
state energy of the quartic anharmonic oscillator in an external field. In the
2D case, the critical temperature of the order/disorder phase transition is
expressed as a Lambert function of the inverse inter-chain coupling constant.
