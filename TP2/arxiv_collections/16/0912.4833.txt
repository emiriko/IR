Differential cross sections of the reaction gamma d to K+ Sigma- (p) have
been measured with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab using incident photons
with energies between 1.1 and 3.6 GeV. This is the first complete set of
strangeness photoproduction data on the neutron covering a broad angular range.
At energies close to threshold and up to E_gamma ~ 1.8 GeV, the shape of the
angular distribution is suggestive of the presence of s-channel production
mechanisms. For E_gamma > 1.8 GeV, a clear forward peak appears and becomes
more prominent as the photon energy increases, suggesting contributions from
t-channel production mechanisms. These data can be used to constrain future
analysis of this reaction.
