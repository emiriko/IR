We present a theoretical study of time-dependent quantum transport in a
resonant tunnel junction coupled to a nanomechanical oscillator within the
non-equilibrium Green's function technique. An arbitrary voltage is applied to
the tunnel junction and electrons in the leads are considered to be at zero
temperature. The transient and the steady state behavior of the system is
considered here in order to explore the quantum dynamics of the oscillator as a
function of time. The properties of the phonon distribution of the
nanomechnical oscillator strongly coupled to the electrons on the dot are
investigated using a non-perturbative approach. We consider both the energy
transferred from the electrons to the oscillator and the Fano factor as a
function of time. We discuss the quantum dynamics of the nanomechanical
oscillator in terms of pure and mixed states. We have found a significant
difference between a quantum and a classical oscillator. In particular, the
energy of a classical oscillator will always be dissipated by the electrons
whereas the quantum oscillator remains in an excited state. This will provide
useful insight for the design of experiments aimed at studying the quantum
behavior of an oscillator.
