In this paper, we present measurements of the ortho-positronium emission
energy in vacuum from mesoporous films using the time of flight technique. We
show evidence of quantum mechanical confinement in the mesopores that defines
the minimal energy of the emitted Ps. Two samples with different effective pore
sizes, measured with positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, are compared
for the data collected in the temperature range 50-400 K. The sample with
smaller pore size exhibits a higher minimal energy ($73\pm$5 meV), compared to
the sample with bigger pores ($48\pm$5 meV), due to the stronger confinement.
The dependence of the emission energy with the temperature of the target is
modeled as ortho-positronium being confined in rectangular boxes in
thermodynamic equilibrium with the sample. We also measured that the yield of
positronium emitted in vacuum is not affected by the temperature of the target.
