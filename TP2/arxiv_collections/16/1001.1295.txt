We investigate low-temperature coherence properties of the Z_2 quantum memory
which is capable of storing the information of a single logical qubit. We show
that the memory has superposition of macroscopically distinct states for some
values of a control parameter and at sufficiently low temperature, and that the
code states of this memory have no instability except for the inevitable one.
However, we also see that the coherence power of this memory is limited by
space and time. We also briefly discuss the RVB memory, which is an improvement
of the Z_2 quantum memory, and the relations of our results to the obscured
symmetry breaking in statistical physics.
