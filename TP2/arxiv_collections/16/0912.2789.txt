This article is a local analysis of integrable GL(2)-structures of degree 4.
A GL(2)-structure of degree n corresponds to a distribution of rational normal
cones over a manifold M of dimension (n+1). Integrability corresponds to the
existence of many submanifolds that are spanned by lines in the cones. These
GL(2)-structures are important because they naturally arise from a certain
family of second-order hyperbolic PDEs in three variables that are integrable
via hydrodynamic reduction. Familiar examples include the wave equation, the
first flow of the dKP equation, and the Boyer--Finley equation. The main
results are a structure theorem for integrable GL(2)-structures, a
classification for connected integrable GL(2)-structures, and an equivalence
between local integrable GL(2)-structures and Hessian hydrodynamic hyperbolic
PDEs in three variables. This yields natural geometric characterizations of the
wave equation, the first flow of the dKP hierarchy, and several others. It also
provides an intrinsic, coordinate-free infrastructure to describe a large class
of hydrodynamic integrable systems in three variables.
