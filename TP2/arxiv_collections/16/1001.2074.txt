A recent paper [M.B. Voloshin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 201801 (2010)] pointed
out that our earlier derivations of atomic ionization cross-section due to
neutrino magnetic moments (arXiv:1001.2074v2) involved unjustified assumptions.
We confirm and elaborate on this comment with these notes. We caution that the
results of the sum-rule approach in this paper contradict the expected
behaviour in atomic transitions.
