A search for the standard model Higgs boson is presented using events with
two charged leptons and large missing transverse energy selected from 5.4 fb-1
of integrated luminosity in p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV collected
with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. No significant excess
of events above background predictions is found, and observed (expected) upper
limits at 95% confidence level on the rate of Higgs boson production are
derived that are a factor of 1.55 (1.36) above the predicted standard model
cross section at Higgs boson mass of 165 GeV.
