Cloud computing represents a shift away from computing as a product that is
purchased, to computing as a service that is delivered to consumers over the
internet from large-scale data centers - or "clouds". This paper discusses some
of the research challenges for cloud computing from an enterprise or
organizational perspective, and puts them in context by reviewing the existing
body of literature in cloud computing. Various research challenges relating to
the following topics are discussed: the organizational changes brought about by
cloud computing; the economic and organizational implications of its utility
billing model; the security, legal and privacy issues that cloud computing
raises. It is important to highlight these research challenges because cloud
computing is not simply about a technological improvement of data centers but a
fundamental change in how IT is provisioned and used. This type of research has
the potential to influence wider adoption of cloud computing in enterprise, and
in the consumer market too.
