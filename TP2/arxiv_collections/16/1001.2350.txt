We introduce a new computationally efficient and accurate classical
density-functional theory for water and apply it to hydration of hard spheres
and inert gas atoms. We find good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations
for the hydration of hard spheres and promising agreement for the solvation of
inert gas atoms in water. Finally, we explore the importance of the
orientational ambiguity in state-of-the-art continuum theories of water, which
are based on the molecular density only.
