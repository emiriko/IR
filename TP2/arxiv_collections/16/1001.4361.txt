We investigate a reconstruction limit of compressed sensing for a
reconstruction scheme based on the L1-norm minimization utilizing a correlated
compression matrix with a statistical mechanics method. We focus on the
compression matrix modeled as the Kronecker-type random matrix studied in
research on multi-input multi-output wireless communication systems. We found
that strong one-dimensional correlations between expansion bases of original
information slightly degrade reconstruction performance.
