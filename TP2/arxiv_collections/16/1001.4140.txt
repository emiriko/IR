Identity verification of authentic persons by their multiview faces is a real
valued problem in machine vision. Multiview faces are having difficulties due
to non-linear representation in the feature space. This paper illustrates the
usability of the generalization of LDA in the form of canonical covariate for
face recognition to multiview faces. In the proposed work, the Gabor filter
bank is used to extract facial features that characterized by spatial
frequency, spatial locality and orientation. Gabor face representation captures
substantial amount of variations of the face instances that often occurs due to
illumination, pose and facial expression changes. Convolution of Gabor filter
bank to face images of rotated profile views produce Gabor faces with high
dimensional features vectors. Canonical covariate is then used to Gabor faces
to reduce the high dimensional feature spaces into low dimensional subspaces.
Finally, support vector machines are trained with canonical sub-spaces that
contain reduced set of features and perform recognition task. The proposed
system is evaluated with UMIST face database. The experiment results
demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed system with high
recognition rates.
