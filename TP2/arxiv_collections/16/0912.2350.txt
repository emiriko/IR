We compute models of the transmission spectra of planets HD 209458b, HD
189733b, and generic hot Jupiters. We examine the effects of temperature,
surface gravity, and metallicity for the generic planets as a guide to
understanding transmission spectra in general. We find that carbon dioxide
absorption at 4.4 and 15 microns is prominent at high metallicity, and is a
clear metallicity indicator. For HD 209458b and HD 189733b, we compute spectra
for both one-dimensional and three-dimensional model atmospheres and examine
the differences between them. The differences are usually small, but can be
large if atmospheric temperatures are near important chemical abundance
boundaries. The calculations for the 3D atmospheres, and their comparison with
data, serve as constraints on these dynamical models that complement the
secondary eclipse and light curve data sets. For HD 209458b, even if TiO and VO
gases are abundant on the day side, their abundances can be considerably
reduced on the cooler planetary limb. However, given the predicted limb
temperatures and TiO abundances, the model's optical opacity is too high. For
HD 189733b we find a good match with some infrared data sets and constrain the
altitude of a postulated haze layer. For this planet, substantial differences
can exist between the transmission spectra of the leading and trailing
hemispheres, which is an excellent probe of carbon chemistry. In thermochemical
equilibrium, the cooler leading hemisphere is methane-dominated, and the hotter
trailing hemisphere is CO-dominated, but these differences may be eliminated by
non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing. It may be possible to
constrain the carbon chemistry of this planet, and its spatial variation, with
JWST.
