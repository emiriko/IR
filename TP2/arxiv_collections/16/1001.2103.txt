The spectral line shapes for hydrogen-like heavy ion emitters embedded in
strongly correlated two-component electron-ion plasmas are investigated with
numerical simulations. For that purpose the microfield fluctuations are
calculated by molecular dynamics simulations where short range quantum effects
are taken into account by using a regularized Coulomb potential for the
electron-ion interaction. The microfield fluctuations are used as input in a
numerical solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation for the
radiating electron. In distinction to the standard impact and quasistatic
approximations the method presented here allows to account for the correlations
between plasma ions and electrons. The shapes of the Ly-alpha line in Al are
investigated in the intermediate regime. The calculations are in good agreement
with experiments on the Ly-alpha line in laser generated plasmas.
