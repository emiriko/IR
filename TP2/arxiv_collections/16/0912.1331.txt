A recently introduced separable pairing force for relativistic
Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) calculations, adjusted in nuclear matter to the
pairing gap of the Gogny force, is employed in the 3D RHB model for triaxial
shapes. The pairing force is separable in momentum space but, when transformed
to coordinate space in calculations of finite nuclei, it is no longer separable
because of translational invariance. The corresponding pairing matrix elements
are represented as a sum of a finite number of separable terms in the basis of
a 3D harmonic oscillator. The 3D RHB model is applied to the calculation of
binding energy surfaces and pairing energy maps for a sequence of even-A Sm
isotopes.
