We show how solutions to many recursive arena equations can be computed in a
natural way by allowing loops in arenas. We then equip arenas with winning
functions and total winning strategies. We present two natural winning
conditions compatible with the loop construction which respectively provide
initial algebras and terminal coalgebras for a large class of continuous
functors. Finally, we introduce an intuitionistic sequent calculus, extended
with syntactic constructions for least and greatest fixed points, and prove it
has a sound and (in a certain weak sense) complete interpretation in our game
model.
