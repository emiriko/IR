We study stability and distortions of liquid crystal nematic order in a cell
with a random heterogeneous substrate. Modeling this system as a bulk xy model
with quenched disorder confined to a surface, we find that nematic order is
marginally unstable to such surface pinning. We compute the length scale beyond
which nematic distortions become large and calculate orientational correlation
functions using the functional renormalization-group and matching methods,
finding universal logarithmic and double-logarithmic distortions in two and
three dimensions, respectively. We extend these results to a finite-thickness
liquid crystal cell with a second homogeneous substrate, detailing crossovers
as a function of random pinning strength and cell thickness. We conclude with
analysis of experimental signatures of these distortions in a conventional
crossed-polarizer-analyzer light microscopy.
