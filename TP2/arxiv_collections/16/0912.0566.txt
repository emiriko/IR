We present a theoretical description of the interlayer magnetoresistance in
the layered Dirac fermion system with the application to the organic conductor
\alpha-(BEDT-TTF)_2I_3 under pressure. Assuming a non-vertical interlayer
tunneling and including higher Landau level effects we calculate the interlayer
conductivity using the Kubo formula.We propose a physical picture of the
experimentally observed crossover from the negative interlayer
magnetoresistance, where the Dirac fermion zero-energy Landau level plays a
central role, to the positive interlayer magnetoresistance that is the
consequence of the Landau level mixing effect upon non-vertical interlayer
hopping. The crossover magnetic field depends on the Landau level broadening
factor and can be used to determine the Dirac fermion Landau level energy
spectrum.
