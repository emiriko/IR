We present the c-axis optical reflectance measurement on single crystals of
BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and SrFe$_2$As$_2$, the parent compounds of FeAs based
superconductors. Different from the ab-plane optical response where two
distinct energy gaps were observed in the SDW state, only the smaller energy
gap could be seen clearly for \textbf{E}$\parallel$c-axis. The very pronounced
energy gap structure seen at a higher energy scale for
\textbf{E}$\parallel$ab-plane is almost invisible. We propose a novel picture
for the band structure evolution across the SDW transition and suggest
different driving mechanisms for the formation of the two energy gaps.
