We study black-hole binaries in the intermediate-mass-ratio regime 0.01 < q <
0.1 with a new technique that makes use of nonlinear numerical trajectories and
efficient perturbative evolutions to compute waveforms at large radii for the
leading and nonleading modes. As a proof-of-concept, we compute waveforms for
q=1/10. We discuss applications of these techniques for LIGO/VIRGO data
analysis and the possibility that our technique can be extended to produce
accurate waveform templates from a modest number of fully-nonlinear numerical
simulations.
