Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation typically form the spheroidal
components of galaxies ("bulges"), solely through galactic major mergers.
However, it is possible that non-merger events (e.g. a "fly-by" by a smaller
halo) can perturb a galaxy--halo system sufficiently to form a bulge. We
present a preliminary investigation into the frequency of major changes in halo
and galaxy spin direction, which could be signatures of such events.
