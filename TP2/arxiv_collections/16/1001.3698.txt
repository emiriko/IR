We have performed real and momentum space spectroscopy of exciton polariton
condensates in a GaAs-based microcavity under non-resonant excitation with an
intensity stabilized laser. An effective trapping mechanism is revealed, which
is due to the stimulated scattering gain inside the finite excitation spot
combined with the short lifetime. We observe several quantized modes while the
lowest state shows Heisenberg-limited real and momentum space distributions.
The experimental findings are qualitatively reproduced by an open dissipative
Gross-Pitaevskii equation model.
