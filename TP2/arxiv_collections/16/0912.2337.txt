We report the testing of a charcoal-based Kr-83m source for use in
calibrating a low background two-phase liquid xenon detector. Kr-83m atoms
produced through the decay of Rb-83 are introduced into a xenon detector by
flowing xenon gas past the Rb-83 source. 9.4 keV and 32.1 keV transitions from
decaying 83Krm nuclei are detected through liquid xenon scintillation and
ionization. The characteristics of the Kr-83m source are analyzed and shown to
be appropriate for a low background liquid xenon detector. Introduction of
Kr-83m allows for quick, periodic calibration of low background noble liquid
detectors at low energy.
