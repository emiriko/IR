The standard model of the strong and electroweak interactions is transformed
from the ordinary path integral with the Lagrangians of quarks and leptons and
with the Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields to corresponding self-energies.
We apply the precise formulation in terms of massless Majorana Fermi fields
with 'Nambu' doubling which naturally leads to the appropriate HST's of the
self-energies and to the subsequent coset decomposition for the SSB. The total
coset decomposition of the Fermi fields is given by the dimension N0=90 for the
symmetry breaking SO(N0,N0)/U(N0)xU(N0) where the densities of fermions,
related to the invariant subgroup U(N0), are contained in a background
functional for the remaining SO(N0,N0)/U(N0) coset field degrees of freedom.
