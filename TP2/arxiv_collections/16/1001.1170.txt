We performed a set of cosmological simulations of major mergers in galaxy
clusters to study the evolution of merger shocks and the subsequent injection
of turbulence in the post-shock region and in the intra-cluster medium (ICM).
The computations were done with the grid-based, adaptive mesh refinement hydro
code Enzo, using an especially designed refinement criteria for refining
turbulent flows in the vicinity of shocks. A substantial amount of turbulence
energy is injected in the ICM due to major merger. Our simulations show that
the shock launched after a major merger develops an ellipsoidal shape and gets
broken by the interaction with the filamentary cosmic web around the merging
cluster. The size of the post-shock region along the direction of shock
propagation is about 300 kpc h^-1, and the turbulent velocity dispersion in
this region is larger than 100 km s^-1. Scaling analysis of the turbulence
energy with the cluster mass within our cluster sample is consistent with
M^(5/3), i.e. the scaling law for the thermal energy in the self-similar
cluster model. This clearly indicates the close relation between virialization
and injection of turbulence in the cluster evolution. We found that the ratio
of the turbulent to total pressure in the cluster core within 2 Gyr after the
major merger is larger than 10%, and it takes about 4 Gyr to get relaxed, which
is substantially longer than typically assumed in the turbulent re-acceleration
models, invoked to explain the statistics of observed radio halos. Striking
similarities in the morphology and other physical parameters between our
simulations and the "symmetrical radio relics" found at the periphery of the
merging cluster A3376 are finally discussed. In particular, the interaction
between the merger shock and the filaments surrounding the cluster could
explain the presence of "notch-like" features at the edges of the double
relics.
