Solution growth of single crystals of the recently reported new compound
Ce2PdIn8 was investigated. When growing from a stoichiometry in a range 2:1:20
- 2:1:35, single crystals of CeIn3 covered by a thin (~50 um)
single-crystalline layer of Ce2PdIn8 were mostly obtained. Using palladium
richer compositions the thickness of the Ce2PdIn8 layers were increased, which
allowed mechanical extraction of single-phase slabs of the desired compound
suitable for a thorough study of magnetism and superconductivity. In some
solution growth products also CePd3In6 (LaNi3In6 - type of structure) and
traces of phases with the stoichiometry CePd2In7, Ce1.5Pd1.5In7 (determined
only by EDX) have been identified. Magnetic measurements of the Ce2PdIn8 single
crystals reveal paramagnetic behaviour of the Ce3+ ions with significant
magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Above 70 K the magnetic susceptibility follows
the Curie-Weiss law with considerably different values of the paramagnetic
Curie temperature, for the magnetic field applied along the a- (-90 K) and
c-(-50 K) axis. Below the reported critical temperature for superconductivity
Tc (0.69 K) the electrical resistivity drops to zero. Comparative measurements
of the electrical resistivity, heat capacity and AC susceptibility of several
crystals reveal that the superconducting transition is strongly
sample-dependent.
