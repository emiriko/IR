We have investigated the (n,gamma) cross sections of p-process isotopes with
the activation technique. The measurements were carried out at the Karlsruhe
Van de Graaff accelerator using the 7Li(p,n)7Be source for simulating a
Maxwellian neutron distribution of kT = 25 keV. Stellar cross section
measurements are reported for the light p-process isotopes 102Pd, 120Te,
130,132Ba, and 156Dy. In a following paper the cross sections of 168Yb, 180W,
184Os, 190Pt, and 196Hg will be discussed. The data are extrapolated to
p-process energies by including information from evaluated nuclear data
libraries. The results are compared to standard Hauser-Feshbach models
frequently used in astrophysics.
