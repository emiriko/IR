We prove a computable version of de Finetti's theorem on exchangeable
sequences of real random variables. As a consequence, exchangeable stochastic
processes expressed in probabilistic functional programming languages can be
automatically rewritten as procedures that do not modify non-local state. Along
the way, we prove that a distribution on the unit interval is computable if and
only if its moments are uniformly computable.
