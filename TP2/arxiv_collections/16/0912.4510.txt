We take the recent result from the CDMS collaboration as a hint that the dark
matter has an elastic scattering cross section with the nucleon in the vicinity
of 10^-7 pb. By crossing symmetry such a cross section implies annihilation of
dark matter into hadrons inside the halo, resulting in an anti-proton flux that
could be constrained by data from the PAMELA collaboration if one includes a
large boost factor necessary to explain the PAMELA excess in the positron
fraction. As an illustration, we present a model-independent analysis for a
fermionic dark matter and study the upper bound on the boost factor using the
PAMELA anti-proton flux.
