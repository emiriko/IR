Land use choices and activity prevalence in a selected territory are
determined by individual preferences constrained by the characteristic of the
analysed zone: population density, soil properties, urbanization level and
other similar factors can drive individuals to make different kind of decisions
about their occupations. Different approaches can be used to describe land use
change, occupation prevalence and their reciprocal inter-relation. In this
paper we describe two different kinds of approaches: an agent based model,
centred on individual choices and an aggregated model describing the evolution
of activity prevalence in terms of coupled differential equation. We use and we
compare the two models to analyse the effect of territorial constraints, like
the lack of employment in determined sectors, on the possible activity
prevalence scenarios.
