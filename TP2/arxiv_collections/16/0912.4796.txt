Comprehensive experimental studies by magnetic, thermal and neutron
measurements have clarified that Rb4Mn(MoO4)3 is a model system of a quasi-2D
triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet with an easy-axis anisotropy, exhibiting
successive transitions across an intermediate collinear phase. As a rare case
for geometrically frustrated magnetism, quantitative agreement between
experiment and theory is found for complete, anisotropic phase diagrams as well
as magnetic properties.
