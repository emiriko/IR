In this article, we study the masses and pole residues of the ${1\over
2}^\pm$ flavor antitriplet heavy baryon states ($\Lambda_c^+$,
$\Xi_c^+,\Xi_c^0)$ and ($\Lambda_b^0$, $\Xi_b^0,\Xi_b^-)$ by subtracting the
contributions from the corresponding ${1\over 2}^\mp$ heavy baryon states with
the QCD sum rules, and observe the masses are in good agreement with the
experimental data and make reasonable predictions for the unobserved ${1\over
2}^-$ bottom baryon states. Once reasonable values of the pole residues
$\lambda_{\Lambda}$ and $\lambda_{\Xi}$ are obtained, we can take them as basic
parameters to study the revelent hadronic processes with the QCD sum rules.
