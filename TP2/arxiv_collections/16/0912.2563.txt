Understanding predator-prey relationships among insects is a challenging task
in the domain of insect-colony research. This is due to several factors
involved, such as determining whether a particular behavior is the result of a
predator-prey interaction, a friend-foe interaction or another kind of
interaction. In this paper, we analyze a series of predator-prey and friend-foe
interactions in two colonies of carpenter ants to better understand and predict
such behavior. Using the data gathered, we have also come up with a preliminary
model for predicting such behavior under the specific conditions the experiment
was conducted in. In this paper, we present the results of our data analysis as
well as an overview of the processes involved.
