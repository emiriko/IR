We present a model for a system involving a photon gauge field and a scalar
field at quantum criticality in the frame of a Lifthitz-type non-relativistic
Maxwell theory. We will show this model gives rise to Lorentz and CPT violation
which leads to a frequency-dependent rotation of polarization plane of
radiations, and so leaves potential signals on the cosmic microwave background
temperature and polarization anisotropies.
