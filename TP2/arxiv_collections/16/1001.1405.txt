The electronic and magnetic properties of Sr$_2$CoO$_4$ compound have been
studied using $\emph{ab initio}$ electronic structure calculations. As opposed
to GGA calculation, which gives ferromagnetic metallic solution, GGA+$U$
calculations provide two kind of ferromagnetic solutions: (i) half-metallic and
(ii) metallic. The half-metallic solution is a ground state of the system and
the metallic one is a metastable state. The strong hybridization between Co
3$d$ and O 2$p$ orbitals decides the electronic and magnetic properties of the
compound. The total magnetic moment per formula unit is found to be $\sim$ 3
$\mu_B$ ($S$ = 3/2). Our calculations give the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy of $\sim$ 2.7 meV, which provides a good description of experimentally
observed large magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The Heisenberg exchange
parameters up to fourth nearest neighbours are also calculated. The mean-field
theory gives the $T_C$ = 887 K. The possible physical implications of the
ferromagnetic half-metallic ground state are also discussed.
