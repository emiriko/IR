We study transport coefficients of strongly coupled gauge theory in the
presence of multiple chemical potential which are dual to rotating D3, M2 and
M5 brane. Using the general form of the perturbation equations, we compute
DC-electrical conductivity at finite temperature as well as at zero
temperature. We also study thermal conductivity for the same class of black
holes and show that thermal conductivity and viscosity obeys Wiedemann-Franz
like law even in the presence of multiple chemical potential.
