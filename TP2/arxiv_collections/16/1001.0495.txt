For translationally shape invariant potentials, the exact quantization rule
proposed by Ma and Xu is a direct consequence of exactness of the modified WKB
quantization condition proved by Barclay. We propose here a very direct
alternative way to calculate the appropriate correction for the whole class of
translationally shape invariant potentials.
