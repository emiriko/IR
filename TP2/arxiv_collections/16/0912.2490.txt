We show that the dynamical Wigner functions for noninteracting fermions and
bosons can have complex singularity structures with a number of new solutions
accompanying the usual mass-shell dispersion relations. These new shell
solutions are shown to encode the information of the quantum coherence between
particles and antiparticles, left and right moving chiral states and/or between
different flavour states. Analogously to the usual derivation of the Boltzmann
equation, we impose this extended phase space structure on the full interacting
theory. This extension of the quasiparticle approximation gives rise to a
self-consistent equation of motion for a density matrix that combines the
quantum mechanical coherence evolution with a well defined collision integral
giving rise to decoherence. Several applications of the method are given, for
example to the coherent particle production, electroweak baryogenesis and study
of decoherence and thermalization.
