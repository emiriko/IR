Ferroelectric domains were investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy
in superlattices composed of multiferroic BiFeO3 and SrTiO3 layers. Compared to
single BiFeO3 thin films, a reduction in the domains size and a suppression of
the in-plane orientation of domains are observed in a superlattice of
(BiFeO3)4(SrTiO3)8, suggesting a constrained ferroelectric domain orientation
along the out-of-plane <001> direction. Such modification of domain size and
orientation in BiFeO3-based heterostructures could play a vital role on
engineering the domains and domain wall mediated functional properties
necessary for device applications
