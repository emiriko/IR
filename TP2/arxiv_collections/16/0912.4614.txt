In the second part of our series we suggest new definitions of credit bond
duration and convexity that remain consistent across all levels of credit
quality including deeply distressed bonds and introduce additional risk
measures that are consistent with the survival-based valuation framework. We
then show how to use these risk measures for the construction of market neutral
portfolios.
