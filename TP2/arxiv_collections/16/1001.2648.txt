We present a method to derive implicit solvent models of electrolyte
solutions from all-atom descriptions; providing analytical expressions of the
thermodynamic and structural properties of the ions consistent with the
underlying explicit solvent representation. Effective potentials between ions
in solution are calculated to perform perturbation theory calculations, in
order to derive the best possible description in terms of charged hard spheres.
Applying this method to NaCl solutions yields excellent agreement with the
all-atom model, provided ion association is taken into account.
