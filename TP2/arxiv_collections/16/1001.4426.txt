In the MICE experiment at RAL the upstream time-of-flight detectors are used
for particle identification in the incoming muon beam, for the experiment
trigger and for a precise timing (sigma_t ~ 50 ps) with respect to the
accelerating RF cavities working at 201 MHz. The construction of the upstream
section of the MICE time-of-flight system and the tests done to characterize
its individual components are shown. Detector timing resolutions ~50-60 ps were
achieved. Test beam performance and preliminary results obtained with beam at
RAL are reported.
