Analysis of state reconstruction both classical and quantum mechanical on
equal footing is outlined. The meaning of "mutual unbiased bases" (MUB) of
Hilbert spaces is explained in detail. An alternative quantum state
reconstruction, that utilizes mutual unbiased bases (MUB), is given. The MUB
approach is then used for state reconstruction in a finite, d, dimensional
Hilbert spaces.
