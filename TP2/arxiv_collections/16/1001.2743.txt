New near-infrared large-area sky surveys (e.g. UKIDSS, CFBDS, WISE) go deeper
than 2MASS and aim at detecting brown dwarfs lurking in the Solar neighbourhood
which are even fainter than the latest known T-type objects, so-called Y
dwarfs. Using UKIDSS data, we have found a faint brown dwarf candidate with
very red optical-to-near-infrared but extremely blue near-infrared colours next
to the recently discovered nearby L dwarf SDSS J141624.08$ + $134826.7. We
check if the two objects are co-moving by studying their parallactic and proper
motion and compare the new object with known T dwarfs. The astrometric
measurements are consistent with a physical pair ($sep$$\approx$75 AU) at a
distance $d$$\approx$8 pc. The extreme colour ($J$$-$$K$$\approx$$-$1.7) and
absolute magnitude ($M_J$=17.78$\pm$0.46 and $M_K$=19.45$\pm$0.52) make the new
object appear as one of the coolest (T$_{eff}$$\approx$600 K) and nearest brown
dwarfs, probably of late-T spectral type and possibly with a high surface
gravity (log $g$$\approx$5.0).
