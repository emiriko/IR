Using a semiclassical approach to Gravitoelectromagnetic Inflation (GEMI), we
study the origin and evolution of seminal inflaton and electromagnetic fields
in the early inflationary universe from a 5D vacuum state. The difference with
other previous works is that in this one we use a Lorentz gauge. Our formalism
is naturally not conformal invariant on the effective 4D de Sitter metric,
which make possible the super adiabatic amplification of magnetic field modes
during the early inflationary epoch of the universe on cosmological scales.
