We have considered the possibility of using coherent Smith-Purcell radiation
for the single-shot determination of the longitudinal profile of 50 fs (FWHM)
long electron bunches. This length is typical for the bunches currently
produced by Laser Wakefield Acceleration and is at the limit of what is
achievable by alternative techniques, such as Electro-Optic sampling. It is
concluded that there are no obstacles, either theoretical or experimental, in
the implementation of this technique. A set of three gratings, with periods of
15, 85 and 500 micrometres, will produce detectable energy in the wavelength
region 10-1000 micrometres, which should be adequate for the reconstruction of
the bunch shape by the Kramers-Kronig technique. For bunch charges of 109
electrons, or more, the radiated energy can be detected by room temperature
pyroelectric detectors. The limits of possible extension of the technique to
even shorter lengths are also considered.
