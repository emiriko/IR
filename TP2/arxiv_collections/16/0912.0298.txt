Cluster-tilted algebras are trivial extensions of tilted algebras. This
correspondence induces a surjective map from tilted algebras to cluster-tilted
algebras. If B is a cluster-tilted algebra, we use the fibre of B under this
map to study the module category of B. In particular, we introduce the notion
of reflections of tilted algebras and define an algorithm that constructs the
transjective component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of cluster-tilted
algebras of tree type.
