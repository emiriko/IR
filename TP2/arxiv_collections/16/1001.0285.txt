Interactions between silver nanoparticles and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate
(EGCG) have been investigated. Prior to the addition of EGCG molecules the
silver particles are stabilized by borate ions. Studies on the surface plasmon
resonance band of silver particles suggest that the EGCG molecules remove the
borate ions from the surface of the metal particles due to the chelating
property of the ions. The complex formation by EGCG and borate ions has been
confirmed by NMR studies and pH titration. A possible scheme of interaction
between the two has been proposed.
