An overview on the physics of spinor and dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs) is given. Mean-field ground states, Bogoliubov spectra, and many-body
ground and excited states of spinor BECs are discussed. Properties of
spin-polarized dipolar BECs and those of spinor-dipolar BECs are reviewed. Some
of the unique features of the vortices in spinor BECs such as fractional
vortices and non-Abelian vortices are delineated. The symmetry of the order
parameter is classified using group theory, and various topological excitations
are investigated based on homotopy theory. Some of the more recent developments
in a spinor BEC are discussed.
