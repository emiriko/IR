We develop calculational tools to determine higher loop superstring
correlators involving massless fermionic and spin fields in four space time
dimensions. These correlation functions are basic ingredients for the
calculation of loop amplitudes involving both bosons and fermions in D=4
heterotic and superstring theories. To obtain the full amplitudes in Lorentz
covariant form the loop correlators of fermionic and spin fields have to be
expressed in terms of SO(1,3) tensors. This is one of the main achievements in
this work.
