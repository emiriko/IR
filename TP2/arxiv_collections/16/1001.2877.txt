We demonstrate that charge-qubit cluster state generation by capacitive
coupling is anisotropic. Specifically, horizontal vs vertical nearest-neighbor
inter-qubit coupling differs in a rectangular lattice. We show how to
ameliorate this anisotropy by applying potential biases to the array of double
dots.
