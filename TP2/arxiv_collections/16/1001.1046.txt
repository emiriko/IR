We introduce and test an expression for calculating the variance of a
physical field in three dimensions using only information contained in the
two-dimensional projection of the field. The method is general but assumes
statistical isotropy. To test the method we apply it to numerical simulations
of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds, and
demonstrate that it can recover the 3D normalised density variance with ~10%
accuracy if the assumption of isotropy is valid. We show that the assumption of
isotropy breaks down at low sonic Mach number if the turbulence is
sub-Alfvenic. Theoretical predictions suggest that the 3D density variance
should increase proportionally to the square of the Mach number of the
turbulence. Application of our method will allow this prediction to be tested
observationally and therefore constrain a large body of analytic models of star
formation that rely on it.
