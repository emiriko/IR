We introduce a model that accounts for the bipolar resistive switching
phenomenom observed in transition metal oxides. It qualitatively describes the
electric field-enhanced migration of oxygen vacancies at the nano-scale. The
numerical study of the model predicts that strong electric fields develop in
the highly resistive dielectric-electrode interfaces, leading to a spatially
inhomogeneous oxygen vacancies distribution and a concomitant resistive
switching effect. The theoretical results qualitatively reproduce non-trivial
resistance hysteresis experiments that we also report, providing key validation
to our model.
