We aim to examine the detailed disc structure that arises in a misaligned
binary system as a function of the disc aspect ratio h, viscosity parameter
alpha, disc outer radius R, and binary inclination angle gamma_F. We also aim
to examine the conditions that lead to an inclined disc being disrupted by
strong differential precession. We use a grid-based hydrodynamic code to
perform 3D simulations. This code has a relatively low numerical viscosity
compared with the SPH schemes that have been used previously to study inclined
discs. This allows the influence of viscosity on the disc evolution to be
tightly controlled. We find that for thick discs (h=0.05) with low alpha,
efficient warp communication in the discs allows them to precess as rigid
bodies with very little warping or twisting. Such discs are observed to align
with the binary orbit plane on the viscous evolution time. Thinner discs with
higher viscosity, in which warp communication is less efficient, develop
significant twists before achieving a state of rigid-body precession. Under the
most extreme conditions we consider (h=0.01, alpha=0.005 and alpha=0.1), we
find that discs can become broken or disrupted by strong differential
precession. Discs that become highly twisted are observed to align with the
binary orbit plane on timescales much shorter than the viscous timescale,
possibly on the precession time. We find agreement with previous studies that
show that thick discs with low viscosity experience mild warping and precess
rigidly. We also find that as h is decreased substantially, discs may be
disrupted by strong differential precession, but for disc thicknesses that are
significantly less (h=0.01) than those found in previous studies (h=0.03).
