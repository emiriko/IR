The Wheeler-DeWitt equation arising from a Kantowski-Sachs model is
considered for a Schwarzschild black hole under the assumption that the scale
factors and the associated momenta satisfy a noncanonical noncommutative
extension of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. An integral of motion is used to
factorize the wave function into an oscillatory part and a function of a
configuration space variable. The latter is shown to be normalizable using
asymptotic arguments. It is then shown that on the hypersufaces of constant
value of the argument of the wave function's oscillatory piece, the probability
vanishes in the vicinity of the black hole singularity.
