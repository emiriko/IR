We present high time-resolution multicolour optical observations of the
quiescent X-ray transients GRS1124-684 (=GU Mus) and Cen X-4 (=V822 Cen)
obtained with ULTRACAM. Superimposed on the secondary stars' ellipsoidal
modulation in both objects are large flares on time-scales of 30-60 min, as
well as several distinct rapid flares on time-scales of a few minutes, most of
which show further variability and unresolved structure. Not significant
quasi-periodic oscillations are observed and the power density spectra of
GRS1124-684 and Cen X-4 can be described by a power-law. From the colour-colour
diagrams of the flare events, for GRS1124-684 we find that the flares can be
described by hydrogen gas with a density of N_H~10^24 nucleons cm^-2, a
temperature of ~8000 K and arising from a radius of ~0.3 Rsun. Finally we
compile the values for the transition radius (the radius of the hot
advection-dominated accretion flow) estimated from quasi-periodic oscillations
and/or breaks in the power density spectrum for a variety of X-ray transients
in different X-ray states. As expected, we find a strong correlation between
the bolometric luminosity and the transition radius.
