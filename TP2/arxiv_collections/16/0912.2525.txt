We demonstrate experimentally a quantum memory scheme for the storage of weak
coherent light pulses in an inhomogeneously broadened optical transition in a
Pr^{3+}: YSO crystal at 2.1 K. Precise optical pumping using a frequency stable
(about 1kHz linewidth) laser is employed to create a highly controllable Atomic
Frequency Comb (AFC) structure. We report single photon storage and retrieval
efficiencies of 25%, based on coherent photon echo type re-emission in the
forward direction. The coherence property of the quantum memory is proved
through interference between a super Gaussian pulse and the emitted echo.
Backward retrieval of the photon echo emission has potential for increasing
storage and recall efficiency.
