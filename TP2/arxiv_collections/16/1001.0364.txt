The temperature dependence of the lifetime of the thermally isolated
metastable N8 cubane up to its decay into N2 molecules has been calculated by
the molecular dynamics method. It has been demonstrated that this dependence
significantly deviates from the Arrhenius law. The applicability of the finite
heat bath theory to the description of thermally isolated atomic clusters has
been proved using statistical analysis of the results obtained.
