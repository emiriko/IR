Various phenomena related to inhomogeneous magnetoelectric interaction are
considered. The interrelation between spatial modulation of order parameter and
electric polarization, known as flexoelectric effect in liquid crystals, in the
case of magnetic media appears in a form of electric polarization induced by
spin modulation and vice versa. This flexomagnetoelectric interaction is also
related to the influence of ferroelectric domain structure on antiferromagnetic
vector distribution, and to the magnetoelectric properties of micromagnetic
structures. The influence of inhomogeneous magnetoelectric interaction on
dynamic properties of multiferroics, particularly magnon spectra is also
considered.
