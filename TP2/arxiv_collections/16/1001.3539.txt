Microprocessor roadmaps clearly show a trend towards multiple core CPUs.
Modern operating systems already make use of these CPU architectures by
distributing tasks between processing cores thereby increasing system
performance. This review article highlights a brief introduction of what a
multicore system is, the various methods adopted to program these systems and
also the industrial application of these high speed systems.
