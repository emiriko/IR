We use the mathematical framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG) to study the
quantization of three dimensional (Riemannian) gravity with positive
cosmological constant (Lambda>0). We show that the usual regularization
techniques (successful in the Lambda=0 case and widely applied in four
dimensional LQG) lead to a deformation of the classical constraint algebra (or
anomaly) proportional to the local strength of the curvature squared. We argue
that this is an unavoidable consequence of the non-local nature of generalized
connections.
