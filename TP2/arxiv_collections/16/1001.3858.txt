According to the dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) - matched to reproduce
lattice QCD results in thermodynamic limit, - the constituents of the strongly
interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) are massive and off-shell quasi-particles
(quarks and gluons) with broad spectral functions. In order to address the
electromagnetic radiation of the sQGP, we derive off-shell cross sections of
q+qbar->gamma*, q+qbar->gamma*+glue and q+glue->gamma*+q(qbar+glue->gamma*qbar)
reactions taking into account the effective propagators for quarks and gluons
from the DQPM. Dilepton production in In+In collisions at 158 AGeV is studied
by implementing these processes into the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD)
transport approach. The microscopic PHSD transport approach describes the full
evolution of the heavy-ion collision: from the dynamics of quasi-particles in
the sQGP phase (when the local energy density is above ~1 GeV/fm^3) through
hadronization and to the following hadron interactions and off-shell
propagation after the hadronization. A comparison to the data of the NA60
Collaboration shows that the low mass dilepton spectra are well described by
including a collisional broadening of vector mesons, while the spectra in the
intermediate mass range are dominated by off-shell quark-antiquark
annihilation, quark Bremsstrahlung and gluon-Compton scattering in the
nonperturbative QGP. In particular, the observed softening of the mT spectra at
intermediate masses (1 GeV < M < 3 GeV) is approximately reproduced.
