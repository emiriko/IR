We present an acceleration of the well-established Krylov-Ritz methods to
compute the sign function of large complex matrices, as needed in lattice QCD
simulations involving the overlap Dirac operator at both zero and nonzero
baryon density. Krylov-Ritz methods approximate the sign function using a
projection on a Krylov subspace. To achieve a high accuracy this subspace must
be taken quite large, which makes the method too costly. The new idea is to
make a further projection on an even smaller, nested Krylov subspace. If
additionally an intermediate preconditioning step is applied, this projection
can be performed without affecting the accuracy of the approximation, and a
substantial gain in efficiency is achieved for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian
matrices. The numerical efficiency of the method is demonstrated on lattice
configurations of sizes ranging from 4^4 to 10^4, and the new results are
compared with those obtained with rational approximation methods.
