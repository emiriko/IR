We focus on two approaches that have been proposed in recent years for the
explanation of the so-called FPU paradox, i.e. the persistence of energy
localization in the `low-q' Fourier modes of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam nonlinear
lattices, preventing equipartition among all modes at low energies. In the
first approach, a low-frequency fraction of the spectrum is initially excited
leading to the formation of `natural packets' exhibiting exponential stability,
while in the second, emphasis is placed on the existence of `q-breathers', i.e
periodic continuations of the linear modes of the lattice, which are
exponentially localized in Fourier space. Following ideas of the latter, we
introduce in this paper the concept of `q-tori' representing exponentially
localized solutions on low-dimensional tori and use their stability properties
to reconcile these two approaches and provide a more complete explanation of
the FPU paradox.
