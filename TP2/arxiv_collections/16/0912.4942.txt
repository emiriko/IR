Based on the fact that both hardness and vibrational Raman spectrum depend on
the intrinsic property of chemical bonds, we propose a new theoretical model
for predicting hardness of a covalent crystal. The quantitative relationship
between hardness and vibrational Raman frequencies deduced from the typical
zincblende covalent crystals is validated to be also applicable for the complex
multicomponent crystals. This model enables us to nondestructively and
indirectly characterize the hardness of novel superhard materials synthesized
under ultra-high pressure condition with the in situ Raman spectrum
measurement.
