We investigate the influence of nucleon superfluidity on the neutrino
emissivity of non-equilibrium beta processes. Calculations are performed of the
reduction factors for direct and modified Urca processes with three types of
nucleon superfluidity in $npe$ matter. The numerical results are given since
the analytical solution is impossible. We find that the behavior of the
superfluid influence is closely related to the chemical departure from beta
equilibrium. For small chemical departure, the superfluid reduction factor
almost only depends on the gap but is hardly affected by the departure. While
for the departure large enough, it rapidly enhances the neutrino emissivity.
The onset of the "enchanced" emission has some corresponding thresholds which
seem to be linked to the ratio of the energy gap to the chemical departure.
