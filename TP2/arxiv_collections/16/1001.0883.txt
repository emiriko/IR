To the integral symplectic group Sp(2g,Z) we associate two posets of which we
prove that they have the Cohen-Macaulay property. As an application we show
that the locus of marked decomposable principally polarized abelian varieties
in the Siegel space of genus g has the homotopy type of a bouquet of
(g-2)-spheres. This, in turn, implies that the rational homology of moduli
space of (unmarked) principal polarized abelian varieties of genus g modulo the
decomposable ones vanishes in degree g-2 or lower. Another application is an
improved stability range for the homology of the symplectic groups over
Euclidean rings. But the original motivation comes from envisaged applications
to the homology of groups of Torelli type.
  The proof of our main result rests on a refined nerve theorem for posets that
may have an interest in its own right.
