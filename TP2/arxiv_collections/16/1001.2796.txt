We utilize high-resolution (R~60,000), high S/N (~100) spectroscopy of 17
cool Pleiades dwarfs to examine the confounding star-to-star scatter in the
6707 Li I line strengths in this young cluster. Our Pleiads, selected for their
small projected rotational velocity and modest chromospheric emission, evince
substantial scatter in the linestrengths of 6707 Li I feature that is absent in
the 7699 K I resonance line. The Li I scatter is not correlated with that in
the high-excitation 7774 O I feature, and the magnitude of the former is
greater than the latter despite the larger temperature sensitivity of the O I
feature. These results suggest that systematic errors in linestrength
measurements due to blending, color (or color-based T_eff) errors, or line
formation effects related to an overlying chromosphere are not the principal
source of Li I scatter in our stars. There do exist analytic spot models that
can produce the observed Li scatter without introducing scatter in the K I line
strengths or the color-magnitude diagram. However, these models predict factor
of >3 differences in abundances derived from the subordinate 6104 and resonance
6707 Li I features; we find no difference in the abundances determined from
these two features. These analytic spot models also predict CN line strengths
significantly larger than we observe in our spectra. The simplest explanation
of the Li, K, CN, and photometric data is that there must be a real abundance
component to the Pleiades Li dispersion. We suggest that this real abundance
component is the manifestation of relic differences in erstwhile
pre-main-sequence Li burning caused by effects of surface activity on stellar
structure. We discuss observational predictions of these effects.
