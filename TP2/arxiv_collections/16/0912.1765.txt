The value of the nucleon's flavour-singlet axial-charge extracted from
polarised deep inelastic scattering is sensitive to the value of the octet
axial-charge g_A^8 which is usually taken from an analysis of hyperon
beta-decays within the framework of SU(3) symmetry, namely 0.58 \pm 0.03. Using
the Cloudy Bag model we find that the value of g_A^8 is reduced by as much as
20% below the usual phenomenological value. This increases the value of the
flavour singlet axial charge (g_A^0|_inv) derived from deep inelastic data and
significantly reduces the difference between it and g_A^8.
