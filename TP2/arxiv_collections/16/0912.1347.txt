Transiting planet discoveries have yielded a plethora of information towards
understanding the structure and atmospheres of extra-solar planets. These
discoveries have been restricted to the short-period or low-periastron distance
regimes due to the bias inherent in the geometric transit probability. Through
the refinement of planetary orbital parameters, and hence reducing the size of
transit windows, long-period planets become feasible targets for photometric
follow-up. Here we describe the TERMS project which is monitoring these host
stars at predicted transit times.
