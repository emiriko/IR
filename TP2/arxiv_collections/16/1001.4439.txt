We perform a numerical study of the systematic effects involved in the
determination of the critical line at real baryon chemical potential by
analytic continuation from results obtained at imaginary chemical potentials.
We present results obtained in a theory free of the sign problem, three-color
QCD with finite isospin chemical potential, and comment on general features
which could be relevant also to the continuation of the critical line in real
QCD at finite baryon density.
