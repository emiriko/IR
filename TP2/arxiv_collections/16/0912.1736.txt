The structure and thermodynamic state of a system changes under the influence
of external electric fields. Neutral systems are characterized by their
dielectric constant epsilon, while charged ones also by their charge
distribution. In this Colloquium several phenomena occurring in soft-matter
systems in spatially uniform and nonuniform fields are surveyed and the role of
the conductivity sigma and the linear or nonlinear dependency of epsilon on
composition are identified. Uniform electric fields are responsible for
elongation of droplets, for destabilization of interfaces between two liquids,
and for mixing effects in liquid mixtures. Electric fields, when acting on
phases with mesoscopic order, also give rise to block copolymer orientation, to
destabilization of polymer-polymer interfaces, and to order-order phase
transitions. The role of linear and nonlinear dependences of epsilon on
composition will be elucidated in these systems. In addition to the dielectric
anisotropy, existence of a finite conductivity leads to appearance of large
stresses when these systems are subject to external fields and usually to a
reduction in the voltages required for the instabilities or phase transitions
to occur. Finally, phase transitions which occur in nonuniform fields are
described and emphasis on the importance of epsilon and sigma is given.
