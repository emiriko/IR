We study theoretically the charged current above a topological insulator (TI)
separated by a ferromagnetic insulating layer. An unconventional Hall response
occurs in the conducting layer on top of the TI which approaches to a constant
value independent of R for R<<l and decays with R^{-1} for R>>l, where R is the
separation between TI and conducting layer and l is the screening length. In
the comoving frame, it can be interpreted as a monopole current attached to the
TI surface. The same mechanism gives the Hall response and deflection of the
electron beam injected to the surface of insulating ferromagnet. A realistic
estimate of an order of magnitude shows that both effects give reasonably large
signal experimentally accessible.
