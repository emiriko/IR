We use a binary Darboux transformation to obtain exact multisoliton solutions
of the principal chiral model and its noncommutative generalization. We also
show that the exact multisolitons of the noncommutative principal chiral model
in two dimensions and noncommutative (anti) self dual Yang Mills equations in
four dimensions can be expressed explicitly in terms of quasi-determinants.
