When an electron probes another elementary particle Q, the wave function of
the electron can be separated into two independent parts, the first part
represents the electronic motion, the second part represents the
electromagnetic field mode around the particle Q. In analogy with optical modes
$TEM_{nlm}$ for a laser resonator, when the electromagnetic field around the
particle Q forms into a mode, the quantum numbers of the mode satisfy the
Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula, these quantum numbers are recognized as the charge
number, baryon number and strangeness number. The modes are used as a visual
model to understand the abstract baryon number and strangeness number of
hadrons.
