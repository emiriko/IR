Raman spectra from silicon nanostructures, recorded using excitation laser
power density of 1.0 kW/cm^2, is employed here to reveal the dominance of
thermal effects at temperatures higher than the room temperature. Room
temperature Raman spectrum shows only phonon confinement and Fano effects.
Raman spectra recorded at higher temperatures show increase in FWHM and
decrease in asymmetry ratio with respect to its room temperature counterpart.
Experimental Raman scattering data are analyzed successfully using theoretical
Raman line-shape generated by incorporating the temperature dependence of
phonon dispersion relation. Experimental and theoretical temperature dependent
Raman spectra are in good agreement. Although quantum confinement and Fano
effects persists, heating effects start dominating at higher temperatures than
room tempaerature.
