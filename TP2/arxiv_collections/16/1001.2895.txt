A resonant enhancement of the neutron standing waves is proposed to use in
order to increase the magnetic neutron scattering from a
"superconductor/ferromagnet"(S/F) bilayer. The model calculations show that
usage of this effect allows to increase the magnetic scattering intensity by
factor of hundreds. Aspects related to the growth procedure (order of
deposition, roughness of the layers etc) as well as experimental conditions
(resolution, polarization of the neutron beam, background etc) are also
discussed.
  Collected experimental data for the S/F heterostructure
Cu(32nm)/V(40nm)/Fe(1nm)/MgO confirmed the presence of a resonant 60-fold
amplification of the magnetic scattering.
