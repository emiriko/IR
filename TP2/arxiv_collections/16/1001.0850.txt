Charge equilibration between two colliding nuclei can take place in the early
stage of heavy-ion collisions. A basic mechanism of charge equilibration is
presented in terms of the extension of single-particle motion from one nucleus
to the other, from which the upper energy-limit of the bombarding energy is
introduced for significant charge equilibration at the early stage of the
collision. The formula for this limit is presented, and is compared to various
experimental data. It is examined also by comparison to three-dimensional
time-dependent density functional calculations. The suppression of charge
equilibration, which appears in collisions at the energies beyond the upper
energy-limit, gives rise to remarkable effects on the synthesis of exotic
nuclei with extreme proton-neutron asymmetry.
