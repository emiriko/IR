We investigate with exact numerical calculation coherent control of a
two-level quantum system's decay by subjecting the two-level system to many
periodic ideal $2\pi$ phase modulation pulses. For three spectrum intensities
(Gaussian, Lorentzian, and exponential), we find both suppression and
acceleration of the decay of the two-level system, depending on difference
between the spectrum peak position and the eigen frequency of the two-level
system. Most interestingly, the decay of the two-level system freezes after
many control pulses if the pulse delay is short. The decay freezing value is
half of the decay in the first pulse delay.
