Employing an approach based on the Green functions of Landau-gauge QCD, some
selected results from a calculation of meson and baryon properties are
presented. A rainbow-ladder truncation to the quark Dyson-Schwinger equation is
used to arrive at a unified description of mesons and baryons by solving
Bethe-Salpeter and covariant Faddeev equations, respectively.
