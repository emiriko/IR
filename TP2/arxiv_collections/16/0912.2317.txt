I describe an approach to fitting and comparison of radio spectra based on
Bayesian analysis and realised using a new implementation of the nested
sampling algorithm. Such an approach improves on the commonly used
maximum-likelihood fitting of radio spectra by allowing objective model
selection, calculation of the full probability distributions of the model
parameters and provides a natural mechanism for including information other
than the measured spectra through priors. In this paper I cover the theoretical
background, the algorithms used and the implementation details of the computer
code. I also briefly illustrate the method with some previously published data
for three near-by galaxies. In forthcoming papers we will present the results
of applying this analysis larger data sets, including some new observations,
and the physical conclusions that can be made. The computer code as well as the
overall approach described here may also be useful for analysis of other
multi-chromatic broad-band observations and possibly also photometric redshift
estimation. All of the code is publicly available, licensed under the GNU
