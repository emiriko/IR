It is shown, that criticism, presented in [arXiv:0912.4963], is based on an
elementary error in the calculation of the collision frequency of an atom in a
gas with walls of a container and misunderstanding of the method used in
[arXiv:0902.1682v2] for obtaining constraints on new short-range spin-dependent
interactions.
