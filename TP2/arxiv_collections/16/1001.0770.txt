The VERITAS array of four 12-m diameter imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov
telescopes in southern Arizona is used to study very high energy (VHE; E>100
GeV) gamma-ray emission from astrophysical objects. VERITAS is currently the
most sensitive VHE gamma-ray observatory in the world and one of the VERITAS
collaboration's Key Science Projects (KSP) is the study of blazars. These
active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the most numerous class of identified VHE
sources, with ~30 known to emit VHE photons. More than 70 AGN, almost all of
which are blazars, have been observed with the VERITAS array since 2007, in
most cases with the deepest-ever VHE exposure. These observations have resulted
in the detection of VHE gamma-rays from 16 AGN (15 blazars), including 8 for
the first time at these energies. The VERITAS blazar KSP is summarized in this
proceeding and selected results are presented.
