The study of the conditions and the kinematics of the gas in the central
region of AGN provides important information on the relevance of feedback
effects connected to the nuclear activity. Quantifying these effects is key for
constraining galaxy evolution models. Here we present a short summary of our
recent efforts to study the occurrence and the impact of gas outflows in
radio-loud AGN that are in their first phase of their evolution. Clear evidence
for AGN-induced outflows have been found for the majority of these young radio
sources. The outflows are detected both in (warm) ionized as well in (cold)
atomic neutral gas and they are likely to be driven (at least in most of the
cases) by the interaction between the expanding jet and the medium. The mass
outflow rates of the cold gas (HI) appear to be systematically higher than
those of the ionized gas. The former reach up to ~50 Msun/yr, and are in the
same range as "mild" starburst-driven superwinds in ULIRGs, whilst the latter
are currently estimated to be a few solar masses per year. However, the kinetic
powers associated with these gaseous outflow are a relatively small fraction (a
few x 10^-4) of the Eddington luminosity of the galaxy. Thus, they do not
appear to match the requirements of the galaxy evolution feedback models.
