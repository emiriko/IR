We describe an improved method of mapping the gamma-ray sky by applying the
Linear Radon Transform to data from BATSE on NASA's CGRO. Based on a method
similar to that used in medical imaging, we use the relatively sharp (~0.25
deg) limb of the Earth to collimate BATSE's eight Large Area Detectors (LADs).
Coupling this to the ~51-day precession cycle of the CGRO orbit, we can
complete a full survey of the sky, localizing point sources to < 1 deg
accuracy. This technique also uses a physical model for removing many sources
of gamma-ray background, which allows us to image strong gamma-ray sources such
as the Crab up to ~2 MeV with only a single precession cycle. We present the
concept of the Radon Transform technique as applied to the BATSE data for
imaging the gamma-ray sky and show sample images in three broad energy bands
(23-98 keV, 98-230 keV, and 230-595 keV) centered on the positions of selected
sources from the catalog of 130 known sources used in our Enhanced BATSE
Occultation Package (EBOP) analysis system. Any new sources discovered during
the sky survey will be added to the input catalog for EBOP allowing daily light
curves and spectra to be generated. We also discuss the adaptation of
tomographic imaging to the Fermi GBM occultation project.
