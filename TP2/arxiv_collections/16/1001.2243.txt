Results on the lowest-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the
muon magnetic anomaly are presented. They are based on the latest published
experimental data used as input to the dispersion integral. Thus recent results
on tau to nutau pi pi0 decays from Belle and on e+ e- annihilation to pi+ pi-
from BABAR and KLOE are included. The new data, together with improved
isospin-breaking corrections for tau decays, result into a much better
consistency among the different results. A discrepancy between the Standard
Model prediction and the direct g-2 measurement is found at the level of 3
sigma.
