We completely classify the computational complexity of the list H-colouring
problem for graphs (with possible loops) in combinatorial and algebraic terms:
for every graph H the problem is either NP-complete, NL-complete, L-complete or
is first-order definable; descriptive complexity equivalents are given as well
via Datalog and its fragments. Our algebraic characterisations match important
conjectures in the study of constraint satisfaction problems.
