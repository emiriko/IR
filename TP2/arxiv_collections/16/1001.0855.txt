We report the electronic structure of the iron-chalcogenide superconductor,
Fe1.04(Te0.66Se0.34), obtained with high resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and density functional calculations. In
photoemission measurements, various photon energies and polarizations are
exploited to study the Fermi surface topology and symmetry properties of the
bands. The measured band structure and their symmetry characters qualitatively
agree with our density function theory calculations of Fe(Te0.66Se0.34),
although the band structure is renormalized by about a factor of three. We find
that the electronic structures of this iron-chalcogenides and the
iron-pnictides have many aspects in common, however, significant differences
exist near the Gamma-point. For Fe1.04(Te0.66Se0.34), there are clearly
separated three bands with distinct even or odd symmetry that cross the Fermi
energy (EF) near the zone center, which contribute to three hole-like Fermi
surfaces. Especially, both experiments and calculations show a hole-like
elliptical Fermi surface at the zone center. Moreover, no sign of spin density
wave was observed in the electronic structure and susceptibility measurements
of this compound.
