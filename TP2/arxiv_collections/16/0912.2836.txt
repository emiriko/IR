The KAM theorem for analytic quasi-integrable anisochronous Hamiltonian
systems yields that the perturbation expansion (Lindstedt series) for
quasi-periodic solutions with Diophantine frequency vector converges. If one
studies the Lindstedt series, one finds that convergence is ultimately related
to the presence of cancellations between contributions of the same perturbation
order. In turn, this is due to symmetries in the problem. Such symmetries are
easily visualised in action-angle coordinates, where KAM theorem is usually
formulated, by exploiting the analogy between Lindstedt series and perturbation
expansions in quantum field theory and, in particular, the possibility of
expressing the solutions in terms of tree graphs, which are the analogue of
Feynman diagrams. If the unperturbed system is isochronous, Moser's modifying
terms theorem ensures that an analytic quasi-periodic solution with the same
Diophantine frequency vector as the unperturbed Hamiltonian exists for the
system obtained by adding a suitable constant (counterterm) to the vector
field. Also in this case, one can follow the alternative approach of studying
the perturbation expansion for both the solution and the counterterm, and again
convergence of the two series is obtained as a consequence of deep
cancellations between contributions of the same order. We revisit Moser's
theorem, by studying the perturbation expansion one obtains by working in
Cartesian coordinates. We investigate the symmetries giving rise to the
cancellations which makes possible the convergence of the series. We find that
the cancellation mechanism works in a completely different way in Cartesian
coordinates. The interpretation of the underlying symmetries in terms of tree
graphs is much more subtle than in the case of action-angle coordinates.
