In this talk, I present my personal view on the status of lattice QCD
calculations. I emphasize the role played by the chiral perturbation theory
(ChPT) in analyzing the lattice data of various physical quantities, including
chiral condensate, topological susceptibility, and pion mass and decay
constant. I then discuss on the status of determination of fundamental
parameters and other quantities of phenomenological interest.
