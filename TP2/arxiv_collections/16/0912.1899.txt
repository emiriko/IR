In the theory of testing for Markovian processes developed so far,
exponentially timed internal actions are not admitted within processes. When
present, these actions cannot be abstracted away, because their execution takes
a nonzero amount of time and hence can be observed. On the other hand, they
must be carefully taken into account, in order not to equate processes that are
distinguishable from a timing viewpoint. In this paper, we recast the
definition of Markovian testing equivalence in the framework of a Markovian
process calculus including exponentially timed internal actions. Then, we show
that the resulting behavioral equivalence is a congruence, has a sound and
complete axiomatization, has a modal logic characterization, and can be decided
in polynomial time.
