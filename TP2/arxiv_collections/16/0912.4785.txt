Measurements at B factories have provided important constraints on new
physics in several rare processes involving the B meson. New Physics, if
present in the b quark sector may also affect the top sector. In an effective
Lagrangian approach, we write down operators where effects in the bottom and
the top sector are related. Assuming the couplings of the operators to be of
the same size as the weak coupling g of the Standard Model and taking into
account constraints on new physics from the bottom sector as well as top
branching ratios, we make predictions for the rare top decays t -> cV where V =
\gamma, Z. We find branching fractions for these decays within possible reach
of the LHC. Predictions are also made for t -> sW.
