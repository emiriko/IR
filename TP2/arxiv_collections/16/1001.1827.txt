A modified Beltrametti-Cassinelli-Lahti model of measurement apparatus that
satisfies both the probability reproducibility condition and the
objectification requirement is constructed. Only measurements on microsystems
are considered. The cluster separability forms a basis for the first working
hypothesis: the current version of quantum mechanics leaves open what happens
to systems when they change their separation status. New rules that close this
gap can therefore be added without disturbing the logic of quantum mechanics.
The second working hypothesis is that registration apparatuses for microsystems
must contain detectors and that their readings are signals from detectors. This
implies that separation status of a microsystem changes during both preparation
and registration. A new rule that specifies what happens at these changes and
that guarantees the objectification is formulated and discussed. A part of our
result has certain similarity with 'collapse of the wave function'.
