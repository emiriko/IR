Polarimetry of extrasolar planets becomes a new tool for their investigation,
which requires the development of diagnostic techniques and parameter case
studies. Our goal is to develop a theoretical model which can be applied to
interpret polarimetric observations of extrasolar planets. Here we present a
theoretical parameter study that shows the influence of the various involved
parameters on the polarization curves. Furthermore, we investigate the
robustness of the fitting procedure. We employ the physics of Rayleigh
scattering to obtain polarization curves of an unresolved extrasolar planet.
Calculations are made for two cases: (i) assuming an angular distribution for
the intensity of the scattered light as from a Lambert sphere and for
polarization as from a Rayleigh-type scatterer, and (ii) assuming that both the
intensity and polarization of the scattered light are distributed according to
the Rayleigh law. We show that the difference between these two cases is
negligible for the shapes of the polarization curves. In addition, we take the
size of the host star into account, which is relevant for hot Jupiters orbiting
giant stars.
