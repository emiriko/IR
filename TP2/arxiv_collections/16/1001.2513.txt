We have searched for time-reversal symmetry breaking fields in the
non-centrosymmetric superconductor Mg$_{10}$Ir$_{19}$B$_{16}$ via muon spin
relaxation in zero applied field, and we measured the temperature dependence of
the superfluid density by muon spin rotation in transverse field to investigate
the superconducting pairing symmetry in two polycrystalline samples of
signficantly different purities. In the high purity sample, we detected no
time-reversal symmetry breaking fields greater than 0.05 G. The superfluid
density was also found to be exponentially-flat as T$\to $0, and so can be fit
to a single-gap BCS model. In contrast, the lower purity sample showed an
increase in the zero-field $\mu$SR relaxation rate below T$_c$ corresponding to
a characteristic field strength of 0.6 G. While the temperature-dependence of
the superfluid density was also found to be consistent with a single-gap BCS
model, the magnitude as T$\to $0 was found to be much lower for a given applied
field than in the case of the high purity sample. These findings suggest that
the dominant pairing symmetry in high quality Mg$_{10}$Ir$_{19}$B$_{16}$
samples corresponds to the spin-singlet channel, while sample quality
drastically affects the superconducting properties of this system.
