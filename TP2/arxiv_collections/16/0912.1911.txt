Collective human behaviors are analyzed using the time series of word
appearances in blogs. As expected, we confirm that the number of fluctuations
is approximated by a Poisson distribution for very-low-frequency words. A
non-trivial scaling roperty is confirmed for more-frequent words. We propose a
simple model that shows that the fluctuations in the number of contributors is
playing the central role in this non-Poissonian behavior.
