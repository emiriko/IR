Recent measurements of the branching fraction for D_s -> l nu disagree with
the Standard Model by around 2sigma. In this case the key aspect of the
Standard Model is the calculation of the decay constant, f_{D_s}, with lattice
QCD. This talk surveys the experimental measurements, and explains how the
lattice QCD calculations are done. Should the discrepancy strengthen again (it
was earlier 3.8sigma), it would be a signal of new physics. Models that could
explain such an effect are also discussed.
