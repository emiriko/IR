We emphasize and demonstrate that, besides using the usual recursion
relations involving successive layers, generalized Fresnel coefficients of a
multilayer can equivalently be calculated using the recursion relations
involving stacks of layers, as introduced some time ago [M. S. Tomas, Phys.
Rev. A 51, 2545 (1995)]. Moreover, since the definition of the generalized
Fresnel coefficients employed does not imply properties of the stacks, these
nonstandard recursion relations can be used to calculate Fresnel coefficients
not only for local systems but also for a general multilayer consisting of
various types (local, nonlocal, inhomogeneous etc.) of layers. Their utility is
illustrated by deriving a few simple algorithms for calculating the
reflectivity of a Bragg mirror and extending the formula for the Casimir force
in a planar cavity to arbitrary media.
