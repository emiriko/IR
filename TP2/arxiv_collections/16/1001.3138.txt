Many of the fundamental properties of early-type galaxies (ellipticals and
lenticulars) can only be accessed by venturing beyond their oft-studied centers
into their large-radius halo regions. Advances in observations of kinematical
tracers allow early-type halos to be increasingly well probed. This review
focuses on recent findings on angular momentum and dark matter content, and
discusses some possible implications for galaxy structure and formation.
