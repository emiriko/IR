We consider the formation of chiral density waves in Quarkyonic matter, which
is a phase where cold, dense quarks experience confining forces. We model
confinement following Gribov and Zwanziger, taking the gluon propagator, in
Coulomb gauge and momentum space, as 1/(p^2)^2. We assume that the number of
colors, N, is large, and that the quark chemical potential, mu, is much larger
than renormalization mass scale, Lambda_QCD. To leading order in 1/N and
Lambda_QCD/mu, a gauge theory with Nf flavors of massless quarks in 3+1
dimensions naturally reduces to a gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions, with an
enlarged flavor symmetry of SU(2Nf). Through an anomalous chiral rotation, in
two dimensions a Fermi sea of massless quarks maps directly onto the
corresponding theory in vacuum. A chiral condensate forms locally, and varies
with the spatial position, z, as < psibar exp(2 i mu z gamma^0 gamma^z) psi >.
Following Schon and Thies, we term this two dimensional pion condensate a
(Quarkyonic) chiral spiral. Massive quarks also exhibit chiral spirals, with
the magnitude of the oscillations decreasing smoothly with increasing mass. The
power law correlations of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model in 1+1
dimensions then generate strong infrared effects in 3+1 dimensions.
