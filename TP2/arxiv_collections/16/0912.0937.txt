This article classifies Little Higgs models that have collective quartic
couplings. There are two classes of collective quartics: Special Cosets and
Special Quartics. After taking into account dangerous singlets, the smallest
Special Coset models are SU(5)/SO(5) and SU(6)/Sp(6). The smallest Special
Quartic model is SU(5)/SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) and has not previously been
considered as a candidate Little Higgs model.
