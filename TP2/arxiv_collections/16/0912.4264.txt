We perform a global fit to data from Dark Matter (DM) direct detection
experiments, including the recent CDMS-II results. We discuss possible
interpretations of the DAMA annual modulation signal in terms of
spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleus interactions, both for elastic
and inelastic scattering. We find that in the spin-dependent inelastic
scattering off protons a good fit to all data is obtained. We present a simple
toy model realizing such a scenario. In all the remaining cases the DAMA
allowed regions are disfavored by other experiments or suffer from severe fine
tuning of DM parameters with respect to the galactic escape velocity. Finally,
we also entertain the possibility that the two events observed in CDMS-II are
an actual signal of elastic DM scattering, and we compare the resulting CDMS-II
allowed regions to the exclusion limits from other experiments.
  In this arXiv version of the manuscript we also provide in appendix A the
updated fits including recent CoGeNT results.
