The strength distributions of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance have
been calculated in $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr, $^{112-124}$Sn, $^{144}$Sm,
and $^{208}$Pb nuclei within the self-consistent random phase approximation and
its extensions which include pairing correlations and quasiparticle-phonon
coupling. The results are compared with the available experimental data. The
problem of the nuclear matter incompressibility is discussed.
