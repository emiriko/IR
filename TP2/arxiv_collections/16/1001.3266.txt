The Hubbard model describes interacting electrons on a lattice,a situation
which occurs in various solid state materials and devices. The aim of the
present paper is to briefly discuss this model and its applications in the
study of transport properties of Q1D and Q2D systems. Several examples are
taken from materials and fields that have been intensively studied in recent
years.
