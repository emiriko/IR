We consider the applications of functional renormalisation group to few and
many-body systems. As an application to the few-body dynamics we study the
ratio between the fermion-fermion scattering length and the dimer-dimer
scattering length for systems of few nonrelativistic fermions.
  We find a strong dependence on the cutoff function used in the
renormalisation flow for a two-body truncation of the action. Adding a simple
three-body term substantially reduces this dependence. In the context of
many-body physics we study the dynamics of both symmetric and asymmetric
many-fermion systems using the same functional renormalisation technique. It is
demonstrated that functional renormalisation group gives sensible and reliable
results and provides a solid theoretical ground for the future studies. Open
questions as well as lines of further developments are discussed.
