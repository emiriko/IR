Spin transfer torque from spin-polarized electrical current can excite
large-amplitude magnetization dynamics in metallic ferromagnets of nanoscale
dimensions. Since magnetic anisotropy energies of nanomagnets are comparable to
the thermal energy scale, temperature can have a profound effect on the
dynamics of a nanomagnet driven by spin transfer torque. Here we report the
observation of unusual types of microwave-frequency nonlinear magnetization
dynamics co-excited by alternating spin transfer torque and thermal
fluctuations. In these dynamics, temperature amplifies the amplitude of
GHz-range precession of magnetization and enables excitation of highly
nonlinear dynamical states of magnetization by weak alternating spin transfer
torque. We explain these thermally activated dynamics in terms of non-adiabatic
stochastic resonance of magnetization driven by spin transfer torque. This type
of magnetic stochastic resonance may find use in sensitive nanometer-scale
microwave signal detectors.
