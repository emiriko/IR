The compact binary system in OJ287 is modelled to contain a spinning primary
black hole with an accretion disk and a non-spinning secondary black hole.
Using Post Newtonian (PN) accurate equations that include 2.5PN accurate
non-spinning contributions, the leading order general relativistic and
classical spin-orbit terms, the orbit of the binary black hole in OJ287 is
calculated and as expected it depends on the spin of the primary black hole.
Using the orbital solution, the specific times when the orbit of the secondary
crosses the accretion disk of the primary are evaluated such that the record of
observed outbursts from 1913 up to 2007 is reproduced. The timings of the
outbursts are quite sensitive to the spin value. In order to reproduce all the
known outbursts, including a newly discovered one in 1957, the Kerr parameter
of the primary has to be $0.28 \pm 0.08$. The quadrupole-moment contributions
to the equations of motion allow us to constrain the `no-hair' parameter to be
$1.0\:\pm\:0.3$ where 0.3 is the one sigma error. This supports the `black hole
no-hair theorem' within the achievable precision.
  It should be possible to test the present estimate in 2015 when the next
outburst is due. The timing of the 2015 outburst is a strong function of the
spin: if the spin is 0.36 of the maximal value allowed in general relativity,
the outburst begins in early November 2015, while the same event starts in the
end of January 2016 if the spin is 0.2
