The LHCb experiment at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)
is dedicated to precision measurements of CP violation and rare decays of B
hadrons. Its most sensitive components are protected by means of a Beam
Conditions Monitor (BCM), based on polycrystalline CVD diamond sensors. Its
configuration, operation and decision logics to issue or remove the beam permit
signal for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are described in this paper.
