We study transformations of coordinates on a Lorentzian Einstein manifold
with a parallel distribution of null lines and show that the general Walker
coordinates can be simplified. In these coordinates, the full Lorentzian
Einstein equation is reduced to equations on a family of Einstein Riemannian
metrics.
