We study an inflation model that inflaton field is non-minimally coupled to
the induced scalar curvature on the Randall-Sundrum (RS) II brane. We
investigate the effects of the non-minimal coupling on the inflationary
dynamics of this braneworld model. Our study shows that the number of e-folds
decreases by increasing the value of the non-minimal coupling. We compare our
model parameters with the minimal case and also with recent observational data.
In comparison with recent observation, we obtain a constraint on the values
that the non-minimal coupling attains.
