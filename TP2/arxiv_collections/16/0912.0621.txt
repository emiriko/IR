We present polarization measurements at 8.4, 22, and 43 GHz made with the VLA
of a complete sample of extragalactic sources stronger than 1 Jy in the 5-year
WMAP catalogue and with declinations north of -34 degrees. The observations
were motivated by the need to know the polarization properties of radio sources
at frequencies of tens of GHz in order to subtract polarized foregrounds for
future sensitive Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. The total
intensity and polarization measurements are generally consistent with
comparable VLA calibration measurements for less-variable sources, and within a
similar range to WMAP fluxes for unresolved sources. A further paper will
present correlations between measured parameters and derive implications for
CMB measurements.
