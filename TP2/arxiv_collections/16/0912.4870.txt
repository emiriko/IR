The Gaia satellite, to be launched in 2012, will offer an unprecedented
survey of the whole sky down to magnitude 20. The multi-epoch nature of the
mission provides a unique opportunity to study variable sources with their
astrometric, photometric, spectro-photometric and radial velocity measurements.
Many tens of millions of classical variable objects are expected to be
detected, mostly stars but also QSOs and asteroids. The high number of objects
observed by Gaia will enable statistical studies of populations of variable
sources and of their properties. But Gaia will also allow the study of
individual objects to some depth depending on their variability types, and the
identification of potentially interesting candidates that would benefit from
further ground based observations by the scientific community. Within the Gaia
Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), which is subdivided into 9
Coordination Units (CU), one (CU7) is dedicated to the variability analysis.
Its goal is to provide information on variable sources for the Gaia
intermediate and final catalogue releases.
