Using EW-MSSM field theory, so the EWPT is first order, we derive the
equations of motion for the gauge fields. With an isospin ansatz we derive
e.o.m. for the electrically charged W fields uncoupled from all other fields.
These and the lepton currents serve as the current for the Maxwell-like e.o.m.
for the electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field arising during EWPT
bubble nucleation without leptons is found. We then calculate the electron
current contribution, which is seen to be quite large. This provides the basis
for determinining the magnetic field created by EWPT bubble collisions, which
could seed galactic and extra-galactic magnetic fields.
