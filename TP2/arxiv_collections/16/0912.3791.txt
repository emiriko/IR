The process of measurement of a phase qubit by a resonant microwave cavity is
considered for various interactions between the qubit and the cavity. A novel
quasiclassical approach is described based on adiabatic reversals of the qubit
state by an effective field. A similar approach was implemented earlier for the
detection of electron and nuclear spins using magnetic resonance force
microscopy (MRFM), but this approach has not previously been used for the
measurement of a quantum state. Quasiclassical and quantum regimes are
described. We consider both linear and nonlinear resonators. The effects of the
environment on the process of measurement are also analyzed.
