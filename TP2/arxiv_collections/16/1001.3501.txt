New experimental information has been recently obtained on the odd-odd
nucleus 134-I. We interpret the five observed excited states up to the energy
of ~3 MeV on the basis of a realistic shell-model calculation, and make
spin-parity assignments accordingly. A very good agreement is found between the
experimental and calculated energies.
