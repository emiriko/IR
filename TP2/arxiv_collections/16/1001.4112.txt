The recent experiment [Science \textbf{321}, 385 (2008)] on the Young's
modulus and third-order elastic stiffness of graphene are well explained in a
very simple approach, where the graphene is described by a simplified system
and the force constant for the non-linear interaction is estimated from the
Tersoff-Brenner potential.
