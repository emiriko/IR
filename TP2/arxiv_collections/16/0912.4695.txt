We study the effects of next-nearest neighbor (NNN) interaction on the
dynamic phase transition (DPT) and hysteresis loop area law in the
two-dimensional ferromagnetic kinetic Ising model. We find that inclusion of
the NNN interaction causes the DPT boundary of the NN kinetic Ising model to
shift to larger values of magnetic field and temperature. The NNN kinetic Ising
model can therefore exhibit an interaction induced DPT. Also in the low
frequency limit (f$\to$0) the hysteresis loop area law, A(h$_{o}$,f), changes
from h$^{0.70}_{o}$f$^{0.36}$ (NN) to h$^{0.14\pm 0.01}_{o}$f$^{0.13\pm0.01}$
(NNN) where h$_o$ is the external field amplitude and f is the frequency. DPT
and hysteresis in the kinetic Ising model arises as a competition between the
system's metastable lifetime and the time period of the external field.
Including the NNN interaction changes the system's metastable lifetime. This
causes the DPT and the hysteretic properties to change. We conclude that the
systems metastable lifetime is sensitive not only to the lattice size, external
field amplitude, and temperature but also to additional interactions present in
the system. Furthermore by tracking the probability density P(Q) of the dynamic
order parameter Q we conclude that the DPT is of second order.
