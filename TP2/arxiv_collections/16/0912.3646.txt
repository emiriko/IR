Over the last years the exciting developments in the field of ultracold atoms
confined in optical lattices have led to numerous theoretical proposals devoted
to the quantum simulation of problems e.g. known from condensed matter physics.
Many of those ideas demand for experimental environments with non-cubic lattice
geometries. In this paper we report on the implementation of a versatile
three-beam lattice allowing for the generation of triangular as well as
hexagonal optical lattices. As an important step the superfluid-Mott insulator
(SF-MI) quantum phase transition has been observed and investigated in detail
in this lattice geometry for the first time. In addition to this we study the
physics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the presence of the
triangular optical lattice potential, especially spin changing dynamics across
the SF-MI transition. Our results suggest that below the SF-MI phase
transition, a well-established mean-field model describes the observed data
when renormalizing the spin-dependent interaction. Interestingly this opens new
perspectives for a lattice driven tuning of a spin dynamics resonance occurring
through the interplay of quadratic Zeeman effect and spin-dependent
interaction. We finally discuss further lattice configurations which can be
realized with our setup.
