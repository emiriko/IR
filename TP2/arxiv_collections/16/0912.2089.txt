This paper presents an algorithm for approximating certain types of dynamical
systems given by a system of ordinary delay differential equations by a Boolean
network model. Often Boolean models are much simpler to understand than complex
differential equations models. The motivation for this work comes from
mathematical systems biology. While Boolean mechanisms do not provide
information about exact concentration rates or time scales, they are often
sufficient to capture steady states and other key dynamics. Due to their
intuitive nature, such models are very appealing to researchers in the life
sciences. This paper is focused on dynamical systems that exhibit bistability
and are desc ribedby delay equations. It is shown that if a certain motif
including a feedback loop is present in the wiring diagram of the system, the
Boolean model captures the bistability of molecular switches. The method is
appl ied to two examples from biology, the lac operon and the phage lambda
lysis/lysogeny switch.
