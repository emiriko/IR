We discuss our current understanding of the interior structure and thermal
evolution of giant planets. This includes the gas giants, such as Jupiter and
Saturn, that are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, as well as the "ice
giants," such as Uranus and Neptune, which are primarily composed of elements
heavier than H/He. The effect of different hydrogen equations of state
(including new first-principles computations) on Jupiter's core mass and heavy
element distribution is detailed. This variety of the hydrogen equations of
state translate into an uncertainty in Jupiter's core mass of 18 M_Earth. For
Uranus and Neptune we find deep envelope metallicities up to 0.95, perhaps
indicating the existence of an eroded core, as also supported by their low
luminosity. We discuss the results of simple cooling models of our solar
system's planets, and show that more complex thermal evolution models may be
necessary to understand their cooling history. We review how measurements of
the masses and radii of the ~50 transiting extrasolar giant planets are
changing our understanding of giant planets. In particular a fraction of these
planets appear to be larger than can be accommodated by standard models of
planetary contraction. We review the proposed explanations for the radii of
these planets. We also discuss very young giant planets, which are being
directly imaged with ground- and space-based telescopes.
