We suggest and theoretically study the local field enhancement in a
metamaterial sample shaped as a pyramid and formed by plasmonic nanoplates
alternating with dielectric ones in parallel to the pyramid base. Due to very
small thickness of metal nanoplates and different transversal sizes of them the
structure not only offers the efficient conversion of the light wave field
impinging the pyramid base into hot spots near the pyramid apex, but also a
large number of plasmonic resonances at which the field enhancement holds.
These resonances cover the whole visible range.
