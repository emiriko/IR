Vehicular communication (VC) systems have recently drawn the attention of
industry, authorities, and academia. A consensus on the need to secure VC
systems and protect the privacy of their users led to concerted efforts to
design security architectures. Interestingly, the results different project
contributed thus far bear extensive similarities in terms of objectives and
mechanisms. As a result, this appears to be an auspicious time for setting the
corner-stone of trustworthy VC systems. Nonetheless, there is a considerable
distance to cover till their deployment. This paper ponders on the road ahead.
First, it presents a distillation of the state of the art, covering the
perceived threat model, security requirements, and basic secure VC system
components. Then, it dissects predominant assumptions and design choices and
considers alternatives. Under the prism of what is necessary to render secure
VC systems practical, and given possible non-technical influences, the paper
attempts to chart the landscape towards the deployment of secure VC systems.
