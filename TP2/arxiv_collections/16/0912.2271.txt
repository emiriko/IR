Motivated by cosmological first-order phase transitions we examine the
nucleation and evolution of vacuum bubbles in non-vacuum environments.
Non-standard backgrounds can be relevant in the context of rapid tunneling
processes on the landscape. Utilising complex time methods, we show that
tunneling rates can be notably modified in the case of dynamical FRW
backgrounds. We give a classification of the importance of the effect in terms
of the relevant dynamical time scales. For both the bubble nucleation and
evolution analysis we make use of the thin-wall approximation. From the
classical bubble evolution on homogeneous matter backgrounds via the junction
method, we find that the inflation of vacuum bubbles is very sensitive to the
presence of ambient matter and quantify this statement. We also employ
inhomogeneous matter models (LTB) and models that undergo a rapid phase
transition (FRW) as a background and discuss in which cases potentially
observable imprints on the bubble trajectory can remain.
