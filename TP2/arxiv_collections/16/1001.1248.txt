In this letter we present an expression relating the cohesive energy for the
A3B5 and A2B6 semiconductors with the product of their ionic charges and
nearest neighbor distance. The cohesive energy values of these solids exhibits
a linear relationship when plotted on a log-log scale against the nearest
neighbor distance, but fall on different straight lines according to the ionic
charge product of the solids. A good agreement has been found between the
experimental and calculated values of the cohesive energy for A3B5 and A2B6
semiconductors.
