We present an experimental demonstration of simultaneous above-threshold
oscillations of the Stokes and anti-Stokes fields together with the single
pumping beam with rubidium atoms inside an optical standing-wave cavity. The
triple resonant conditions can be achieved easily by making use of the large
dispersions due to two-photon transitions in the three-level atomic system.
This work provides a way to achieve high efficient nonlinear frequency
conversion and the generated bright Stokes and anti-Stokes cavity output beams
are potential resource for applications in quantum information science.
