Mixing processes such as convection, overshooting and rotational mixing have
long been known to affect the evolutionary properties of low-mass stars. While
modeling a 1.2 Msun star, we encountered a semiconvective region outside the
fully convective core, reminiscent of the well-known situation for massive
stars. In this study we focus on low-mass stars presenting convective cores
and, by applying different prescriptions for the determination of the
convective boundaries and using different mixing descriptions for the dynamical
processes in the core, we look for the effects of semiconvective mixing in the
interior structure of the stars and its observable quantities. With this
purpose, we have constructed different sets of evolutionary models using a
stellar evolution code (GARSTEC), and analyzed the models looking for imprints
of these processes.
