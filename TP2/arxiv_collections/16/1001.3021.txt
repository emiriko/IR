We discuss the interplay of low-x physics and QCD scaling violations by
extending the unified approach describing inclusive structure functions and
diffractive production in $\gamma* p$ interactions proposed in previous papers,
to large values of Q2. We describe the procedure of extracting, from the
non-perturbative model, initial conditions for the QCD evolution that respect
unitarity. Assuming Regge factorization of the diffractive structure function,
a similar procedure is proposed for the calculation of hard diffraction. The
results are in good agreement with experimental data on the proton structure
function $F_2$ and the most recent data on the reduced diffractive cross
section, $x_P \sigma_r^{\D(3)}$. Predictions for both $F_2$ and $F_L$ are
presented in a wide kinematical range and compared to calculations within
high-energy QCD.
