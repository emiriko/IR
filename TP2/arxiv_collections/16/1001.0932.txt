We examine the status of massive gauge theories, such as those usually
obtained by spontaneous symmetry breakdown, from the viewpoint of causal
(Epstein-Glaser) renormalization. The BRS formulation of gauge invariance in
this framework, starting from canonical quantization of massive (as well as
massless) vector bosons as fundamental entities, and proceeding perturbatively,
allows one to rederive the reductive group symmetry of interactions, the need
for scalar fields in gauge theory, and the covariant derivative. Thus the
presence of higgs particles is explained without recourse to a
Higgs(-Englert-Brout-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble) mechanism. Along the way, we dispel
doubts about the compatibility of causal gauge invariance with grand unified
theories.
