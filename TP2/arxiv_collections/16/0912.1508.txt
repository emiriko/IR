The hadronic decays of $\chi_{c1}\to VV$ and $\chi_{c2}\to VP$ are supposed
to be suppressed by the helicity selection rule in the pQCD framework. With an
effective Lagrangian method, we show that the intermediate charmed meson loops
can provide a mechanism for the evasion of the helicity selection rule, and
result in sizeable decay branching ratios in some of those channels. The
theoretical predictions can be examined by the forthcoming BES-III data in the
near future.
