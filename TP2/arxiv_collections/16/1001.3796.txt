We present lattice QCD results along the freezeout curve of heavy-ion
collisions for the ongoing RHIC energy scan as well as the LHC heavy-ion runs
planned for this year. The skew and kurtosis of the event distribution of
baryon number are positive at all energies studied, We predict three ratios of
non-linear susceptibilities along the freezeout curve as functions of the
colliding energy, Sqrt[S_{NN}]. They have smooth behaviour except in the
vicinity of a critical point; this can have multiple benefits.
