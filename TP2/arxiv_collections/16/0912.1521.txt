Looking for an observable manifestation of the so-called unnaturalness of
scalar fields we introduce a seemingly new set of differential equations for
connected Green functions. These equations describe the momentum dependence of
the Green functions and are close relatives to the previously known
renormalization group equations. Applying the new equations to the theory of
scalar field with $\phi^4$ interaction we identify a relation between the
four-point Green function and the propagator which expresses the unnaturalness
of the scalar field. Possible manifestations of the unnaturalness at low
momenta are briefly discussed.
