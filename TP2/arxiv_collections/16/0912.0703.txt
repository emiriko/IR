In a recent paper, the hydrodynamic code NEXSPheRIO was used in conjunction
with STAR analysis methods to study two-particle correlations as function of
Delta-eta and Delta-phi. The various structures observed in data were
reproduced. In this work, we discuss the origin of these structures as well as
present new results.
