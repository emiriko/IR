The ever increasing level of precision achieved by present and future
radial-velocity instruments is opening the way to discovering very low-mass,
long-period planets (e.g. solar-system analogs). These systems will be
detectable as low-amplitude signals in radial-velocity (RV). However, an
important obstacle to their detection may be the existence of stellar magnetic
cycles on similar timescales. Here we present the results of a long-term
program to simultaneously measure radial-velocities and stellar-activity
indicators (CaII, H_alpha, HeI) for a sample of stars with known activity
cycles. Our results suggest that all these stellar activity indexes can be used
to trace the stellar magnetic cycle in solar-type stars. Likewise, we find
clear indications that different parameters of the HARPS cross-correlation
function (BIS, FWHM, and contrast) are also sensitive to activity level
variations. Finally, we show that, although in a few cases slight correlations
or anti-correlations between radial-velocity and the activity level of the star
exist, their origin is still not clear. We can, however, conclude that for our
targets (early-K dwarfs) we do not find evidence of any radial-velocity
variations induced by variations of the stellar magnetic cycle with amplitudes
significantly above ~1 m/s.
