Jets have been detected in only a few symbiotic binaries to date, and CH Cyg
is one of them. In 2001, a non-relativistic jet was detected in CH Cyg for the
first time in X-rays. We carried out coordinated Chandra, HST, and VLA
observations in 2008 to study the propagation of this jet and its interaction
with the circumbinary medium. We detected the jet with Chandra and HST and
determined that the apex has expanded to the South from about 300 AU to about
1400 AU, with the shock front propagating with velocity < 100 km/s. The shock
front has significantly slowed down since 2001. Unexpectedly, we also
discovered a powerful jet in the NE-SW direction, in the X-ray, optical and
radio. This jet has a multi-component structure, including an inner jet and a
counter-jet at about 170 AU, and a SW component ending in several clumps
extending out to approximately 750 AU. The structure of the jet and the
curvature of the outer portion of the SW jet suggest an episodically powered
precessing jet, or a continuous precessing jet with occasional mass ejections
or pulses. We carried out detailed spatial mapping of the X-ray emission and
correlation with the optical and radio emission. X-ray spectra were extracted
of the central source, inner NE counter jet, and the brightest clump at a
distance of approximately 500 AU from the central source. We discuss the
initial results of our analyses, including the multi-component spectral fitting
of the jet-components and of the central source.
