In this comment, we show that the solutions of the-wave Dirac equation for
deformed generalized P\"{o}schl-Teller potential obtained by Wei et al are
valid only for $q\geq1$ and $\frac{1}{2\alpha}\ln{q}<r<\infty$. When $0<q<1$,
we prove that the energy eigenvalues for the bound states are given by the
solution of a transcendental equation involving the hypergeometric function. To
test our results, the Morse potential is considered as limiting case.
