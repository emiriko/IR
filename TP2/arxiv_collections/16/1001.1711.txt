This paper presents a new protocol for Internet voting based on implicit data
security. This protocol allows recasting of votes, which permits a change of
mind by voters either during the time window over which polling is open or
during a shorter period over which recasting is permitted. The security of
votes depends on multiple servers such that each vote is divided into
partitions and these partitions are distributed among the servers, all of which
need to be brought together to reconstruct the votes. Such a protocol has
potential applications in bargaining and electronic commerce.
