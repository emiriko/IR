Magnetization measurements reveal that NdCoAsO undergoes three magnetic phase
transitions below room temperature. The crystal and magnetic structures of
NdCoAsO have been determined by powder neutron diffraction, and the effects of
the phase transitions on physical properties are reported. Near 69 K a
ferromagnetic state emerges with a small saturation moment of about 0.2 Bohr
magnetons, likely on Co atoms. At 14 K the material enters an antiferromagnetic
state with propagation vector (0 0 1/2) and small ordered moments (~0.4 Bohr
magnetons) on Co and Nd. Near 3.5 K a third transition is observed, and
corresponds to the antiferromagnetic ordering, with the same propagation
vector, of larger moments on Nd reaching 1.30(2) Bohr magnetons at 1.4 K. In
addition, transport properties and heat capacity results are presented, and
show anomalies at all three phase transitions.
