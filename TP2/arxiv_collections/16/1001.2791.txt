Focusing properties of a novel type photoresist microlens are studied. A
specific character of the microlens is its mushroom shape. Recently it was
predicted and experimentally revealed that such a lens integrated with a
light-emitting diode is capable of enhancing its output efficiency and
directivity. In our paper we describe the true electromagnetic performance of a
mushroom lens by applying a mathematically rigorous method of boundary integral
equations. Numerical results are presented for the mushroom lens illuminated
with a plane E-polarized wave and include figures describing the evolution of
the lens focal spot and near field maps.
