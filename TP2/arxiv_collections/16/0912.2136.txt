Using a calix[4]arene-benzene complex as a test system we compare the
potential of mean force for when the calix[4]arene is tethered versus free.
When the complex is in vacuum our results show that the difference between
tethered and free is primarily due to the entropic contribution to the
potential of mean force resulting in a binding free energy difference of 6.5
kJ/mol. By contrast, when the complex is in water our results suggest that the
difference between tethered and free is due to the enthalpic contribution
resulting in a binding free energy difference of 1.6 kJ/mol. This study
elucidates the roles of entropy and enthalpy for this small molecule system and
emphasizes the point that tethering the receptor has the potential to
dramatically impact the binding properties. These findings should be taken into
consideration when using calixarene molecules in nanosensor design.
