The framework of relativistic energy density functionals is extended to
include correlations related to the restoration of broken symmetries and to
fluctuations of collective variables. The generator coordinate method is used
to perform configuration mixing of angular-momentum projected wave functions,
generated by constrained self-consistent relativistic mean-field calculations
for triaxial shapes. The effects of triaxial deformation and of $K$-mixing is
illustrated in a study of spectroscopic properties of low-spin states in
$^{24}$Mg.
