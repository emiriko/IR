Segmenting a MRI images into homogeneous texture regions representing
disparate tissue types is often a useful preprocessing step in the
computer-assisted detection of breast cancer. That is why we proposed new
algorithm to detect cancer in mammogram breast cancer images. In this paper we
proposed segmentation using vector quantization technique. Here we used Linde
Buzo-Gray algorithm (LBG) for segmentation of MRI images. Initially a codebook
of size 128 was generated for MRI images. These code vectors were further
clustered in 8 clusters using same LBG algorithm. These 8 images were displayed
as a result. This approach does not leads to over segmentation or under
segmentation. For the comparison purpose we displayed results of watershed
segmentation and Entropy using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix along with this
method.
