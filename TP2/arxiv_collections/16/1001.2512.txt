We have developed a new procedure to search for carbon-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars from the Hamburg/ESO (HES) prism-survey plates. This method
employs an extended line index for the CH G-band, which we demonstrate to have
superior behavior when compared to the narrower G-band index formerly employed
to estimate G-band strengths for these spectra. Although CEMP stars have been
found previously among candidate metal-poor stars selected from the HES, the
selection on metallicity undersamples the population of
intermediate-metallicity CEMP stars (-2.5<=[Fe/H]<=-1.0); such stars are of
importance for constraining the onset of the s-process in metal-deficient
asymptotic giant-branch stars (thought to be associated with the origin of
carbon for roughly 80% of CEMP stars). The new candidates also include
substantial numbers of warmer carbon-enhanced stars, which were missed in
previous HES searches for carbon stars due to selection criteria that
emphasized stars with cooler temperatures.
  A first subsample, biased towards brighter stars (B<15.5), has been extracted
from the scanned HES plates. After visual inspection, a list of 669 previously
unidentified candidate CEMP stars was compiled. Follow-up spectroscopy for a
pilot sample of 132 candidates was obtained with the Goodman spectrograph on
the SOAR 4.1m telescope. Our results show that most of the observed stars lie
in the targeted metallicity range, and possess prominent carbon absorption
features at 4300A. The success rate for the identification of new CEMP stars is
43% (13 out of 30) for [Fe/H]<-2.0. For stars with [Fe/H]<-2.5, the ratio
increases to 80% (4 out of 5 objects), including one star with [Fe/H]<-3.0.
