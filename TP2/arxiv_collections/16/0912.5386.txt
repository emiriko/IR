We introduce an investigation about M dimers through half-filled two-site
Hubbard model, that is, with two electrons. We utilize the third version of
nonextensive statistical mechanics as tool for cal-culating thermodynamical and
magnetic parameters as entropy, internal energy and specific heat. By making
computer simulations, we vary the q entropic index values between 1 and 2:
q=1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7 and 2.0. These values are interesting to study magnetic
small systems. We find that the addition of intersite interaction term causes a
shifting of all simulated curves in relation to simple Hubbard model.
