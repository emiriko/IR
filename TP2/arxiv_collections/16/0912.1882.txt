We study spin-rotation effects in a magnetic molecule bridged between two
conducting leads. Dynamics of the total angular momentum couples spin tunneling
to the mechanical rotations. Landau-Zener spin transition produced by the
time-dependent magnetic field generates a unique pattern of mechanical
oscillations that can be detected by measuring the electronic tunneling current
through the molecule.
