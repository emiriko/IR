The emphasis of observational and theoretical flare studies in the last
decade or two has been on the flare corona, and attention has shifted
substantially away from the flare's chromospheric aspects. However, although
the pre-flare energy is stored in the corona, the radiative flare is primarily
a chromospheric phenomenon, and its chromospheric emission presents a wealth of
diagnostics for the thermal and non-thermal components of the flare. I will
here review the chromospheric signatures of flare energy release and the
problems thrown up by the application of these diagnostics in the context of
the standard flare model. I will present some ideas about the transport of
energy to the chromosphere by other means, and calculations of the electron
acceleration that one might expect in one such model.
