We review the results from multi-dimensional, time-dependent simulations of
gas dynamics in AGN. We will focus on two types of outflows powered by
radiation emitted from the AGN central engine: (i) outflows driven from the
innermost part of an accretion disk and (2) outflows driven from a large-scale
inflow that is likely the main supplier of material to the central engine. We
discuss the relevance of both types of outflows to the so-called AGN feedback
problem. However, the AGN feedback should not be considered separately from the
AGN physics. Therefore, we also discuss the issue whether the properties of the
same outflows are consistent with the gas properties in broad- and narrow-line
regions.
