The Web is the largest human information construct in history transforming
our society. How can we understand, measure and model the Web evolution in
order to design effective policies and optimize its social benefit? Early
measurements of the Internet traffic and the Web graph indicated the scale-free
structure of the Web and other Complex Networks. Going a step further
Kouroupas, Koutsoupias, Papadimitriou and Sideri (KKPS) presented an
economic-inspired model which explains the scale-free behavior as the
interaction of Documents, Users and Search engines. The purpose of this paper
is to clarify the open issues arising within the KKPS model through analysis
and simulations and to highlight future research developments in Web modeling,
which is the backbone of Web Science.
