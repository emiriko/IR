We propose a method to control the thermal stability of a sapphire dielectric
transducer made with two dielectric disks separated by a thin gap and
resonating in the whispering gallery (WG) modes of the electromagnetic field.
The simultaneous measurement of the frequencies of both a WGH mode and a WGE
mode allows one to discriminate the frequency shifts due to gap variations from
those due to temperature instability. A simple model, valid in quasi
equilibrium conditions, describes the frequency shift of the two modes in terms
of four tuning parameters. A procedure for the direct measurement of them is
presented.
