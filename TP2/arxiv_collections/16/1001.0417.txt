We present the first results of our analyses of selected RR Lyrae stars for
which data have been obtained by the Kepler Mission. As expected, we find a
significant fraction of the RRab stars to show the Blazhko effect, a still
unexplained phenomenon that manifests itself as periodic amplitude and phase
modulations of the light curve, on time scales of typically tens to hundreds of
days. The long time span of the Kepler Mission of 3.5 yrs, and the
unprecedentedly high precision of its data provide a unique opportunity for the
study of RR Lyrae stars.
  Using data of a modulated star observed in the first roll as a showcase, we
discuss the data, our analyses, findings, and their implications for our
understanding of RR Lyrae stars and the Blazhko effect. With at least 40% of
the RR Lyrae stars in our sample showing modulation, we confirm the high
incidence rate that was only found in recent high-precision studies. Moreover,
we report the occurrence of additional frequencies, beyond the main pulsation
mode and its modulation components. Their half-integer ratio to the main
frequency is reminiscent of a period doubling effect caused by resonances,
observed for the first time in RR Lyrae stars.
