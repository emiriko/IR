The Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC), which is associated with the
Theory Group at Jefferson Laboratory, was initiated in 2006. Its main goal is
to extract and interpret properties of nucleon resonances (N*) from the world
data of meson production reactions induced by pions, photons and electrons. We
review the main accomplishments of the center since then and sketch its near
future perspectives.
