The chiral phase transition in the conventional random matrix model is the
second order in the chiral limit, irrespective of the number of flavors N_f,
because it lacks the U_A(1)-breaking determinant interaction term. Furthermore,
it predicts an unphysical value of zero for the topological susceptibility at
finite temperatures. We propose a new chiral random matrix model which resolves
these difficulties by incorporating the determinant interaction term within the
instanton gas picture. The model produces a second-order transition for N_f=2
and a first-order transition for N_f=3, and recovers a physical temperature
dependence of the topological susceptibility.
