In this work, we analyze the behavior of statistical complexity in several
systems where two identical densities that travel in opposite direction cross
each other. The crossing between two Gaussian, rectangular and triangular
densities is studied in detail. For these three cases, the shape of the total
density presenting an extreme value in complexity is found.
