We determine the radiative decay amplitudes for decay into $D^*$ and $\bar{D}
\gamma$, or $D^*_s$ and $\bar{D}_s \gamma$ of some of the charmonium like
states classified as X,Y,Z resonances, plus some other hidden charm states
which are dynamically generated from the interaction of vector mesons with
charm. The mass distributions as a function of the $\bar{D} \gamma$ or
$\bar{D}_s \gamma$ invariant mass show a peculiar behavior as a consequence of
the $D^* \bar{D}^*$ nature of these states. The experimental search of these
magnitudes can shed light on the nature of these states.
