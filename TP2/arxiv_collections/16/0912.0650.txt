In this work we suggest very simple solution of the two capacitors paradox in
the completely ideal (without any electrical resistance or inductive)
electrical circuit. Namely, it is shown that electrical field energy loss
corresponds to works done by electrical fields of both capacitors by movement
of the electrical charge. It is all and nothing more (some dissipation
processes, e.g. Joule heating and electromagnetic wave emission effects) is
necessary. Additionally, we shortly demonstrate a simple mechanical analogy of
mentioned paradox and its solution. Concretely we consider two water buckets
connected by a valve where is a seeming loss of the gravitational potential
energy that can be explained by the work in the gravitational field.
