We extend the antenna subtraction method to include initial states containing
one hadron at NNLO. We present results for all the necessary subtraction terms,
antenna functions, for the master integrals required to integrate them over the
relevant phase space and finally for the integrated antennae themselves. Where
applicable, our results are cross-checked against the known NNLO coefficient
functions for deep inelastic scattering processes.
