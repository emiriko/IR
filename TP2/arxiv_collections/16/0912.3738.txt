For regulated exocytosis, we model the morphology and dynamics of the making
of the fusion pore or porosome as a cup-shaped lipoprotein structure (a dimple
or pit) on the cytosol side of the plasma membrane. We describe the forming of
the dimple by a free boundary problem. We discuss the various forces acting and
analyze the magnetic character of the wandering electromagnetic field wave
produced by intracellular spatially distributed pulsating (and well observed)
release and binding of calcium ions anteceding the bilayer membrane vesicle
fusion of exocytosis. Our approach explains the energy efficiency of the
observed dimple forming prior to hemifusion and fusion pore, and the observed
flickering in secretion. It provides a frame to relate characteristic time
length of exocytosis to the frequency, amplitude and direction of propagation
of the underlying electromagnetic field wave.
