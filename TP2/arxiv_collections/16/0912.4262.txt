Observations of distant bright quasars suggest that billion solar mass
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were already in place less than a billion
years after the Big Bang. Models in which light black hole seeds form by the
collapse of primordial metal-free stars cannot explain their rapid appearance
due to inefficient gas accretion. Alternatively, these black holes may form by
direct collapse of gas at the center of protogalaxies. However, this requires
metal-free gas that does not cool efficiently and thus is not turned into
stars, in contrast with the rapid metal enrichment of protogalaxies. Here we
use a numerical simulation to show that mergers between massive protogalaxies
naturally produce the required central gas accumulation with no need to
suppress star formation. Merger-driven gas inflows produce an unstable, massive
nuclear gas disk. Within the disk a second gas inflow accumulates more than 100
million solar masses of gas in a sub-parsec scale cloud in one hundred thousand
years. The cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, which eventually leads to
the formation of a massive black hole. The black hole can grow to a billion
solar masses in less than a billion years by accreting gas from the surrounding
disk.
