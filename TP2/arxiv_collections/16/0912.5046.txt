The energy-momentum relationship of electrons on the surface of an ideal
"Hydrogen-Atom" Topological Insulator forms a cone - a Dirac cone, which, when
warped and distorted (no longer described by the Dirac equation), can lead to
unusual phenomena such as enhanced electronic interference around defects
(observed in STM) and a magnetically ordered broken symmetry surface with lost
topological protection. A detailed spin-texture and hexagonal warping maps on
Bi2Te3 are presented in this context as a Viewpoint on L.Fu, Phys. Rev. Lett.
