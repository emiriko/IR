This technical report summarizes the preliminary findings of a project that
has been developed in 2007 by an Italian company (Datanet, based in Siracusa,
Italy) togheter with two Italian research institutions: Universita' degli Studi
di Milano and Universita' Bocconi. The main aim of the OS4E (Open Source for
Enterprises) project, has been to investigate if and how open source solutions
could be profitabily and effectively exploited by an IT company based in the
South of Italy, whose core business is IT systems integration and which
operates in the market of Italian SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises). Beside
this goal, the project also aimed at developing effective tools and
methodologies to support decision making processes while evaluating different
