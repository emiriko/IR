We present a computation of elastic energy loss of hard partons traversing
the bulk hydrodynamical medium created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions. The model is based on perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD)
cross sections for $2\to 2$ processes in which a hard incoming parton is
assumed to interact with a thermal parton from the medium. We model the
interactions of this type in a Monte-Carlo framework to account properly for
exact energy-momentum conservation, non-eikonal parton propagation, parton
conversion reactions and the possibility to create additional hard recoiling
partons from the medium. For the thermodynamical properties of the medium we
use a hydrodynamical evolution model. We do not aim at a full description of
high transverse momentum ($P_T$) observables at this point. Rather, we view the
model as a starting point in obtaining a baseline of what to expect under the
assumptions that the medium is describable by thermal quasifree partons and
that their pQCD interactions with the high-energy partons are independent.
Deviations from this baseline then call for more sophisticated medium
description, as well as inclusion of higher-order processes and coherence
effects in the pQCD scatterings.
