Folded single layer graphene forms a system of two decoupled monolayers being
only a few Angstroms apart. Using magnetotransport measurements we investigate
the electronic properties of the two layers conducting in parallel. We show a
method to obtain the mobilities for the individual layers despite them being
jointly contacted. The mobilities in the upper layer are significantly larger
than in the bottom one indicating weaker substrate influence. This is confirmed
by larger transport and quantum scattering times in the top layer. Analyzing
the temperature dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations effective
masses and corresponding Fermi velocities are obtained yielding reduced values
down to 66 percent in comparison to monolayers.
