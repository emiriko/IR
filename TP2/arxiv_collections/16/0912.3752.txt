We investigate the scale-locality of cascades of conserved invariants at high
kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers in the ``inertial-inductive range'' of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, where velocity and magnetic field
increments exhibit suitable power-law scaling. We prove that fluxes of total
energy and cross-helicity--or, equivalently, fluxes of Els\"asser energies--are
dominated by the contributions of local triads. Corresponding spectral
transfers are also scale-local when defined using octave wavenumber bands. Flux
and transfer of magnetic helicity may be dominated by non-local triads. The
magnetic stretching term also may be dominated by non-local triads but we prove
that it can convert energy only between velocity and magnetic modes at
comparable scales. We explain the disagreement with numerical studies that have
claimed conversion nonlocally between disparate scales. We present supporting
data from a $1024^3$ simulation of forced MHD turbulence.
