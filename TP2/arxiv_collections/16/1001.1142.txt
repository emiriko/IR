We present analytical results for the biased diffusion of particles moving
under a constant force in a randomly layered medium. The influence of this
medium on the particle dynamics is modeled by a piecewise constant random
force. The long-time behavior of the particle position is studied in the frame
of a continuous-time random walk on a semi-infinite one-dimensional lattice. We
formulate the conditions for anomalous diffusion, derive the diffusion laws and
analyze their dependence on the particle mass and the distribution of the
random force.
