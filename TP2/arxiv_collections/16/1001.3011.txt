Traditional methods for covariate adjustment of treatment means in designed
experiments are inherently conditional on the observed covariate values. In
order to develop a coherent general methodology for analysis of covariance, we
propose a multivariate variance components model for the joint distribution of
the response and covariates. It is shown that, if the design is orthogonal with
respect to (random) blocking factors, then appropriate adjustments to treatment
means can be made using the univariate variance components model obtained by
conditioning on the observed covariate values. However, it is revealed that
some widely used models are incorrectly specified, leading to biased estimates
and incorrect standard errors. The approach clarifies some issues that have
been the source of ongoing confusion in the statistics literature.
