Coalescence overgrowth of pattern-grown GaN nanocolumns (NC) on c-plane
sapphire substrate with metal organic chemical vapour deposition is
demonstrated. The subsequent coalescence overgrowth opens a possibility for
dislocation reduction due to the lateral strain relaxation in columnar
geometry. We present further growth optimization and innovative
characterization of MOCVD layers, overgrown on the columnar structure with
varying diameter of colums. Nanoimprint lithography was applied to open
circular holes of 250, 300, 450, 600 nm in diameter on the SiO2 layer,
deposited on the GaN layer on c-plane sapphire template.
