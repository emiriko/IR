Compact modeling of MOSFETs from a 0.35 micron SOI technology node operating
at 4 K is presented. The Verilog-A language is used to modify device equations
for BSIM models and more accurately reproduce measured DC behavior, which is
not possible with the standard BSIM model set. The Verilog-A approach also
allows the embedding of nonlinear length, width and bias effects into BSIM
calculated curves beyond those that can be achieved by the use of different
BSIM parameter sets. Nonlinear dependences are necessary to capture effects
particular to 4 K behavior, such as current kinks. The 4 K DC behavior is
reproduced well by the compact model and the model seamlessly evolves during
simulation of circuits and systems as the simulator encounters SOI MOSFETs with
different lengths and widths. The incorporation of various length/width and
bias dependent effects into one Verilog-A / BSIM4 library, therefore, produces
one model for all sets of devices for this technology node.
