The rationale behind recent calibrations of the Cepheid PL relation using the
Wesenheit formulation is reviewed and reanalyzed, and it is shown that recent
conclusions regarding a possible change in slope of the PL relation for
short-period and long-period Cepheids are tied to a pathological distribution
of HST calibrators within the instability strip. A recalibration of the
period-luminosity relation is obtained using Galactic Cepheids in open clusters
and groups, the resulting relationship, described by log L/L_sun =
2.415(+-0.035) + 1.148(+-0.044)log P, exhibiting only the moderate scatter
expected from color spread within the instability strip. The relationship is
confirmed by Cepheids with HST parallaxes, although without the need for
Lutz-Kelker corrections, and in general by Cepheids with revised Hipparcos
parallaxes, albeit with concerns about the cited precisions of the latter. A
Wesenheit formulation of Wv = -2.259(+-0.083) - 4.185(+-0.103)log P for
Galactic Cepheids is tested successfully using Cepheids in the inner regions of
the galaxy NGC 4258, confirming the independent geometrical distance
established for the galaxy from OH masers. Differences between the extinction
properties of interstellar and extragalactic dust may yet play an important
role in the further calibration of the Cepheid PL relation and its application
to the extragalactic distance scale.
