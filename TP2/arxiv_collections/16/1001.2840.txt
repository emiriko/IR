An "exact" method for scalar one-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws is
presented. The approach is based on the evolution of shock particles, separated
by local similarity solutions. The numerical solution is defined everywhere,
and is as accurate as the applied ODE solver. Furthermore, the method is
extended to stiff balance laws. A special correction approach yields a method
that evolves detonation waves at correct velocities, without resolving their
internal dynamics. The particle approach is compared to a classical finite
volume method in terms of numerical accuracy, both for conservation laws and
for an application in reaction kinetics.
