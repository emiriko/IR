We consider the 2-dimensional Toda lattice tau functions
$\tau_n(t,s;\eta,\theta)$ deforming the probabilities $\tau_n(\eta,\theta)$
that a randomly chosen matrix from the unitary group U(n), for the Haar
measure, has no eigenvalues within an arc $(\eta,\theta)$ of the unit circle.
We show that these tau functions satisfy a centerless Virasoro algebra of
constraints, with a boundary part in the sense of Adler, Shiota and van
Moerbeke. As an application, we obtain a new derivation of a differential
equation due to Tracy and Widom, satisfied by these probabilities, linking it
to the Painleve VI equation.
