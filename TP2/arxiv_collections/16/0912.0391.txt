This review is focused on the application of specific fluctuation relations,
such as the Gallavotti-Cohen relation, to ratchet models of a molecular motor.
A special emphasis is placed on two-states models such as the flashing ratchet
model. We derive the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation for these models and
we discuss some of its implications.
