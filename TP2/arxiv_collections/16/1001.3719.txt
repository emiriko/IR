Magnetization, x-ray diffraction and specific-heat measurements reveal that
SmCoAsO undergoes three magnetic phase transitions. A ferromagnetic transition
attributed to the Co ions, emerges at TC=57 K with a small saturation moment of
0.15muB/Co. Reorientation of the Co moment to an antiferromagnetic state is
obtained at TN2=45 K. The relative high paramagnetic effective moment Peff=1.57
MuB/Co indicates an itinerant ferromagnetic state of the Co sublattice. The
third magnetic transition at TN1=5 K is observed clearly in the specific-heat
study only. Both magnetic and 57Fe Mossbauer studies show that substitution of
small quantities of Fe for Co was unsuccessful.
