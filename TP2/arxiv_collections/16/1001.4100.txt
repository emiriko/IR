The method of Taylor series expansion is used to develop a numerical solution
to the reactor point kinetics equations. It is shown that taking a first order
expansion of the neutron density and precursor concentrations at each time step
gives results that are comparable to those obtained using other popular and
more complicated methods. The algorithm developed using a Taylor series
expansion is simple, completely transparent, and highly accurate. The procedure
is tested using a variety of initial conditions and input data, including step
reactivity, ramp reactivity, sinusoidal, and zigzag reactivity. These results
are compared to those obtained using other methods.
