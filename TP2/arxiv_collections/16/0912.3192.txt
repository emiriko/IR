We develop a quantum field theoretical framework to analytically study the
three-body constrained Bose-Hubbard model beyond mean field and non-interacting
spin wave approximations. It is based on an exact mapping of the constrained
model to a theory with two coupled bosonic degrees of freedom with polynomial
interactions, which have a natural interpretation as single particles and
two-particle states. The procedure can be seen as a proper quantization of the
Gutzwiller mean field theory. The theory is conveniently evaluated in the
framework of the quantum effective action, for which the usual symmetry
principles are now supplemented with a ``constraint principle'' operative on
short distances. We test the theory via investigation of scattering properties
of few particles in the limit of vanishing density, and we address the
complementary problem in the limit of maximum filling, where the low lying
excitations are holes and di-holes on top of the constraint induced insulator.
This is the first of a sequence of two papers. The application of the formalism
to the many-body problem, which can be realized with atoms in optical lattices
with strong three-body loss, is performed in a related work [14].
