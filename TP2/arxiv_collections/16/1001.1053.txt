A pure spin current formed by opposite spins moving in opposite directions is
a rank-2 axial tensor which breaks the inversion symmetry. Thus a spin current
has a second-order optical susceptibility, with unique polarization-dependence
determined by the symmetry properties of the current. In particular, a
longitudinal spin current, in which the spin polarization directions are
parallel or anti-parallel to the moving directions, being a chiral quantity,
leads to a chiral sum-frequency effect. Microscopic calculations based on the
eight-band model of a III-V compound semiconductor confirm the symmetry
analysis and show that the susceptibility is quite measurable under realistic
conditions. The second-order nonlinear optical effects may be used for in-situ
and non-destructive detection of spin currents, as a standard spectroscopy tool
in research of spintronics.
