We introduce a new method to reconstruct unknown quantum states out of
incomplete and noisy information. The method is a linear convex optimization
problem, therefore with a unique minimum, which can be efficiently solved with
Semidefinite Programs. Numerical simulations indicate that the estimated state
does not overestimate purity, and neither the expectation value of optimal
entanglement witnesses. The convergence properties of the method are similar to
compressed sensing approaches, in the sense that, in order to reconstruct low
rank states, it needs just a fraction of the effort correspondig to an
informationally complete measurement.
