We study utility maximization for power utility random fields with and
without intermediate consumption in a general semimartingale model with closed
portfolio constraints. We show that any optimal strategy leads to a solution of
the corresponding Bellman equation. The optimal strategies are described
pointwise in terms of the opportunity process, which is characterized as the
minimal solution of the Bellman equation. We also give verification theorems
for this equation.
