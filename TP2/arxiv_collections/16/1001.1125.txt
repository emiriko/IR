We construct a novel scattering theory to investigate magnetoelectrically
induced spin polarizations. Local spin polarizations generated by electric
currents passing through a spin-orbit coupled mesoscopic system are measured by
an external probe. The electrochemical and spin-dependent chemical potentials
on the probe are controllable and tuned to values ensuring that neither charge
nor spin current flow between the system and the probe, on time-average. For
the relevant case of a single-channel probe, we find that the resulting
potentials are exactly independent of the transparency of the contact between
the probe and the system. Assuming that spin relaxation processes are absent in
the probe, we therefore identify the local spin-dependent potentials in the
sample at the probe position, and hence the local current-induced spin
polarization, with the spin-dependent potentials in the probe itself. The
statistics of these local chemical potentials is calculated within random
matrix theory. While they vanish on spatial and mesoscopic average, they
exhibit large fluctuations, and we show that single systems typically have spin
polarizations exceeding all known current-induced spin polarizations by a
parametrically large factor. Our theory allows to calculate quantum
correlations between spin polarizations inside the sample and spin currents
flowing out of it. We show that these large polarizations correlate only weakly
with spin currents in external leads, and that only a fraction of them can be
converted into a spin current in the linear regime of transport, which is
consistent with the mesoscopic universality of spin conductance fluctuations.
We numerically confirm the theory.
