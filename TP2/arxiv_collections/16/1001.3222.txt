In a Stark decelerator, polar molecules are slowed down and focussed by an
inhomogeneous electric field which switches between two configurations. For the
decelerator to work, it is essential that the molecules follow the changing
electric field adiabatically. When the decelerator switches from one
configuration to the other, the electric field changes in magnitude and
direction, and this can cause molecules to change state. In places where the
field is weak, the rotation of the electric field vector during the switch may
be too rapid for the molecules to maintain their orientation relative to the
field. Molecules that are at these places when the field switches may be lost
from the decelerator as they are transferred into states that are not focussed.
We calculate the probability of nonadiabatic transitions as a function of
position in the periodic decelerator structure and find that for the
decelerated group of molecules the loss is typically small, while for the
un-decelerated group of molecules the loss can be very high. This loss can be
eliminated using a bias field to ensure that the electric field magnitude is
always large enough. We demonstrate our findings by comparing the results of
experiments and simulations for the Stark deceleration of LiH and CaF
molecules. We present a simple method for calculating the transition
probabilities which can easily be applied to other molecules of interest.
