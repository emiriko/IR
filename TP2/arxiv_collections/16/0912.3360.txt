We analyze to what extent the complex Langevin method, which is in principle
capable of solving the so-called sign problems, can be considered as reliable.
We give a formal derivation of the correctness and then point out various
mathematical loopholes. The detailed study of some simple examples leads to
practical suggestions about the application of the method.
