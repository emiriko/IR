We established a sample of millimeter-wave and gamma-ray bright active
galactic nuclei matching the WMAP catalog with the EGRET catalog, highest
energy photons and the Fermi bright source list. We have monitored over 80 of
these objects in the near infrared, obtaining over 2000 JHKs data points
directly comparable with Fermi data. We present examples of correlated near
infrared and gamma-ray activity of known blazars and recently identified
sources.
