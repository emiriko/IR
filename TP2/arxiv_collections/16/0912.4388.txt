The transformation rules for the basic electrodynamical quantities are
routinely derived from the hypothesis that the relativity principle (RP)
applies for Maxwell's electrodynamics. These derivations leave open several
questions: (1) Is the RP a true law of nature for electrodynamical phenomena?
(2) Are, at least, the transformation rules of the fundamental electrodynamical
quantities, derived from the RP, true? (3) Is the RP consistent with the laws
of electrodynamics in one single inertial frame of reference? (4) Are, at
least, the derived transformation rules consistent with the laws of
electrodynamics in one single frame of reference? (1) and (2) are empirical
questions; we will investigate problems (3) and (4). First we will develop a
formalism of the RP. In the second part, we will deal with the operational
definitions of the fundamental quantities. In the third part of the paper we
will show that the proper transformation rules are indeed identical with the
ones obtained by presuming the covariance, and that the covariance is indeed
satisfied. Problem (3) raises conceptual problems to which there seems no
satisfactory solution in electrodynamics; thus, contrary to the widespread
views, the question we asked in the title has no obvious answer.
