We study quantum coherence of elastically scattered lattice fermions. We
calculate vertex corrections to the electrical conductivity of electrons
scattered either on thermally equilibrated or statically distributed random
impurities. We demonstrate that the sign of the vertex corrections to the Drude
conductivity is in both cases negative. Quantum coherence due to elastic
back-scatterings always leads to diminution of diffusion.
