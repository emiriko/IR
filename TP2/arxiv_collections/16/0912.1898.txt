We consider a quantum dot embedded in a three-dimensional nanowire with
tunable aspect ratio a. A configuration interaction theory is developed to
calculate the energy spectra of the finite 1D quantum dot systems charged with
two electrons in the presence of magnetic fields B along the wire axis.
Fruitful singlet-triplet transition behaviors are revealed and explained in
terms of the competing exchange interaction, correlation interaction, and spin
Zeeman energy. In the high aspect ratio regime, the singlet-triplet transitions
are shown designable by tuning the parameters a and B. The transitions also
manifest the highly correlated nature of long nanowire quantum dots.
