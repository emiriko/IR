How to rank web pages, scientists and online resources has recently attracted
increasing attention from both physicists and computer scientists. In this
paper, we study the ranking problem of rating systems where users vote objects
by discrete ratings. We propose an algorithm that can simultaneously evaluate
the user reputation and object quality in an iterative refinement way.
According to both the artificially generated data and the real data from
MovieLens and Amazon, our algorithm can considerably enhance the ranking
accuracy. This work highlights the significance of reputation systems in the
Internet era and points out a way to evaluate and compare the performances of
different reputation systems.
