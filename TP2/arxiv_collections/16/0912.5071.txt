An optical analogue of Zitterbewegung (ZB), i.e. of the trembling motion of
Dirac electrons caused by the interference between positive and negative energy
states, is proposed for spatial beam propagation in binary waveguide arrays. In
this optical system ZB is simply observable as a quiver spatial oscillatory
motion of the beam center of mass around its mean trajectory.
