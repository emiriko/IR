Models of quantum computation are important because they change the physical
requirements for achieving universal quantum computation (QC). For example,
one-way QC requires the preparation of an entangled "cluster" state followed by
adaptive measurement on this state, a set of requirements which is different
from the standard quantum circuit model. Here we introduce a model based on
one-way QC but without measurements (except for the final readout), instead
using adiabatic deformation of a Hamiltonian whose initial ground state is the
cluster state. This opens the possibility to use the copious results from
one-way QC to build more feasible adiabatic schemes.
