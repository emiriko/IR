The first stage of the proposed polarization program SPASCHARM includes the
measurements of the single-spin asymmetry (SSA) in exclusive and inclusive
reactions with production of stable hadrons and the light meson and baryon
resonances.In this study we foresee of using the variety of the unpolarized
beams (pions, kaons, protons and antiprotons) in the energy range of 30-60 GeV.
The polarized proton and deuteron targets will be used for revealing the flavor
and isotopic spin dependencies of the polarization phenomena. The neutral and
charged particles in the final state will be detected.
