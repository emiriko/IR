The micromagnetic distribution in a dielectric nanoparticle is theoretically
considered. It is shown that the existence of inhomogeneous magnetoelectric
interaction in magnetic dielectrics provides the possibility to stabilize the
vortex and antivortex state. The estimation of the critical voltage necessary
for vortex/antivortex nucleation in bismuth ferrite and iron garnet
nanoparticles yields a value of +/-150 V. This system can be considered as
electrically switchable two state-logic magnetic element.
