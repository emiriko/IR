We demonstrate the existence of a large number of exact solutions of plane
Couette flow, which share the topology of known periodic solutions but are
localized in space. Solutions of different size are organized in a
snakes-and-ladders structure strikingly similar to that observed for simpler
pattern-forming PDE systems. These new solutions are a step towards extending
the dynamical systems view of transitional turbulence to spatially extended
flows.
