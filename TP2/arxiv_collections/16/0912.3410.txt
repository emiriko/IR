The effect of tunneling on the transport properties of} quantum Hall double
layers in the regime of the excitonic condensate at total filling factor one is
studied in counterflow experiments. If the tunnel current $I$ is smaller than a
critical $I_C$, tunneling is large and is effectively shorting the two layers.
For $I > I_C$ tunneling becomes negligible. Surprisingly, the transition
between the two tunneling regimes has only a minor impact on the features of
the filling-factor one state as observed in magneto-transport, but at currents
exceeding $I_C$ the resistance along the layers increases rapidly.
