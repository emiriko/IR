In this paper, an approach to facilitate the treatment with variabilities in
system families is presented by explicitly modelling variants. The proposed
method of managing variability consists of a variant part, which models
variants and a decision table to depict the customisation decision regarding
each variant. We have found that it is easy to implement and has advantage over
other methods. We present this model as an integral part of modelling system
families.
