We propose and evaluate an immuno-inspired approach to misbehavior detection
in ad hoc wireless networks. Node misbehavior can be the result of an
intrusion, or a software or hardware failure. Our approach is motivated by
co-stimulatory signals present in the Biological immune system. The results
show that co-stimulation in ad hoc wireless networks can both substantially
improve energy efficiency of detection and, at the same time, help achieve low
false positives rates. The energy efficiency improvement is almost two orders
of magnitude, if compared to misbehavior detection based on watchdogs.
  We provide a characterization of the trade-offs between detection approaches
executed by a single node and by several nodes in cooperation. Additionally, we
investigate several feature sets for misbehavior detection. These feature sets
impose different requirements on the detection system, most notably from the
energy efficiency point of view.
