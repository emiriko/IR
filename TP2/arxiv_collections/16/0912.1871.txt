Charged-particle spectra associated with direct photon ($\gamma_{dir} $) and
$\pi^0$ are measured in $p$+$p$ and Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV with the STAR detector at RHIC. A hower-shape
analysis is used to partially discriminate between $\gamma_{dir}$ and $\pi^0$.
Assuming no associated charged particles in the $\gamma_{dir}$ direction (near
side) and small contribution from fragmentation photons ($\gamma_{frag}$), the
associated charged-particle yields opposite to $\gamma_{dir}$ (away side) are
extracted. At mid-rapidity ($|\eta|<0.9$) in central Au+Au collisions,
charged-particle yields associated with $\gamma_{dir}$ and $\pi^0$ at high
transverse momentum ($8< p_{T}^{trig}<16$ GeV/$c$) are suppressed by a factor
of 3-5 compared with $p$ + $p$ collisions. The observed suppression of the
associated charged particles, in the kinematic range $|\eta|<1$ and $3<
p_{T}^{assoc} < 16$ GeV/$c$, is similar for $\gamma_{dir}$ and $\pi^0$, and
independent of the $\gamma_{dir}$ energy within uncertainties. These
measurements indicate that the parton energy loss, in the covered kinematic
range, is insensitive to the parton path length.
