Terahertz electromagnetic excitations in the multiferroic TbMnO3 at the
field-induced magnetic transition are investigated for different orientations
of the magnetic cycloid. In addition to the electromagnon along the a-axis, the
detailed polarization analysis of the experimental spectra suggests the
existence of an electro-active excitation for ac electric fields along the
crystallographic c-axis. This excitation is possibly the electro-active
eigenmode of the spin cycloid in TbMnO3, which has been predicted within the
inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism of magnetoelectric coupling.
