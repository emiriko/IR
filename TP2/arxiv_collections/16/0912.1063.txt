MHD turbulence has long been proposed as a mechanism for the heating of
coronal loops in the framework of the Parker scenario for coronal heating. So
far most of the studies have focused on its dynamical properties without
considering its thermodynamical and radiative features, because of the very
demanding computational requirements. In this paper we extend this previous
research to the compressible regime, including an energy equation, by using
HYPERION, a new parallelized, viscoresistive, three-dimensional compressible
MHD code. HYPERION employs a Fourier collocation -- finite difference spatial
discretization, and uses a third-order Runge-Kutta temporal discretization. We
show that the implementation of a thermal conduction parallel to the DC
magnetic field induces a radiative emission concentrated at the boundaries,
with properties similar to the chromosphere--transition region--corona system.
