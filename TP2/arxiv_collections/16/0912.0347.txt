Here we report the optimized magneto-transport properties of polycrystalline
La0.70Ca0.3-xSrxMnO3 and their composites with Ag. The optimization was carried
out by varying the Sr and Ag contents simultaneously to achieve large
temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) as well as low field
magneto-resistance (MR) at room temperature. Sharpest paramagnetic
(PM)-ferromagnetic (FM) and insulator-metal (IM) transition is observed in the
vicinity of the room temperature (TC=300 K=TIM) for the composition
La0.70Ca0.20Sr00.10MnO3:Ag0.20. Partial substitution of larger Sr2+ ions at the
Ca2+ ions sites controls the magnitude of the FM and IM transition
temperatures, while the Ag induces the desired sharpness in these transitions.
For the optimized composition, maximum TCR and MR are tuned to room temperature
(300 K) with the former being as high as 9% and the later being 20 and 30
percent at 5 and 10 kOe magnetic fields respectively. Such sharp single peak
(TCR= 9 percent) at room temperature can be used for the bolometric and
infrared detector applications. The achievement of large TCR and low field MR
at T~300K in polycrystalline samples is encouraging and we believe that further
improvements can be achieved in thin films, which, by virtue of their low
conduction noise, are more suitable for device applications.
