We present a study of the intermediate regime between ultra-relativistic and
nonrelativistic flow for gamma-ray burst afterglows. The hydrodynamics of
spherically symmetric blast waves is numerically calculated using the AMRVAC
adaptive mesh refinement code. Spectra and light curves are calculated using a
separate radiation code that, for the first time, links a parametrisation of
the microphysics of shock acceleration, synchrotron self-absorption and
electron cooling to a high-performance hydrodynamics simulation.
