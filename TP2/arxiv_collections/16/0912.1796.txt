We study a class of nonsupersymmetric SO(10) grand unified scenarios where
the first stage of the symmetry breaking is driven by the vacuum expectation
values of the 45-dimensional adjoint representation. Three decade old results
claim that such a Higgs setting may lead exclusively to the flipped SU(5) x
U(1) intermediate stage. We show that this conclusion is actually an artifact
of the tree level potential. The study of the accidental global symmetries
emerging in various limits of the scalar potential offers a simple
understanding of the tree level result and a rationale for the drastic impact
of quantum corrections. We scrutinize in detail the simplest and paradigmatic
case of the 45_{H} + 16_{H} Higgs sector triggering the breaking of SO(10) to
the standard electroweak model. We show that the minimization of the one-loop
effective potential allows for intermediate SU(4)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_R and
SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} symmetric stages as well. These are
the options favoured by gauge unification. Our results, that apply whenever the
SO(10) breaking is triggered by <45_H>, open the path for hunting the simplest
realistic scenario of nonsupersymmetric SO(10) grand unification.
