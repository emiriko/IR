Electrons and electron neutrinos in the inner core of the core-collapse
supernova are highly degenerate and therefore numerous during a few seconds of
explosion. In contrast, leptons of other flavors are non-degenerate and
therefore relatively scarce. This is due to lepton flavor conservation. If this
conservation law is broken by some non-standard interactions, electron
neutrinos are converted to muon and tau-neutrinos, and electrons - to muons.
This affects the supernova dynamics and the supernova neutrino signal. We
consider lepton flavor violating interactions mediated by scalar bileptons,
i.e. heavy scalars with lepton number 2. It is shown that in case of TeV-mass
bileptons the electron fermi gas is equilibrated with non-electron species
inside the inner supernova core at a time-scale of order of (1-100) ms. In
particular, a scalar triplet which generates neutrino masses through the
see-saw type II mechanism is considered. It is found that supernova core is
sensitive to yet unprobed values of masses and couplings of the triplet.
