We study vibrational states localized at the edges of graphene nanoribbons.
Such surface oscillations can be considered as a phonon analog of Tamm states
well known in the electronic theory. We consider both armchair and zigzag
graphene stripes and demonstrate that surface modes correspond to phonons
localized at the edges of the graphene nanoribbon, and they can be classified
as in-plane and out-of-plane modes. In addition, in armchair nanoribbons
anharmonic edge modes can experience longitudinal localization in the form of
self-localized nonlinear modes, or surface breather solitons.
