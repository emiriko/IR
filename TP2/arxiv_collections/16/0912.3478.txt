Loop I is a nearby giant radio loop spanning over 100 degrees and centered on
the Sco-Cen OB association. It may correspond to a superbubble formed by the
joint action of stellar winds and supernova remnants. ROSAT observations
revealed that the region is filled with a hot gas possibly reheated by
successive supernova explosions. The brightest rim of Loop I, called the North
Polar Spur (NPS), extends to the north along 30 degrees in longitude, at a
distance of about 100 pc from the Sun. Early searches for high-energy gamma
rays associated with electrons or protons accelerated by Loop I were performed
with SAS-II, COSB and EGRET. But a detector with better performance and higher
statistics is required to distinguish the faint signal from the NPS from broad
structures in the Galactic interstellar emission, such as the inverse Compton
emission from cosmic-ray electrons scattering the interstellar radiation field.
We modelled the gamma-ray emission of the Galaxy and compared it to the
Fermi-LAT photons detected above 300 MeV. We observe an excess of photons in
the direction of Loop I. This excess exhibit a large arc-shaped structure
similar to those seen in synchrotron emission.
