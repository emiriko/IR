We employ the phenomenological theory of the quasiparticle relaxation based
on the simplified two-band description and the spin-fluctuation induced
interband coupling to analyze recent normal-state transport data in
electron-doped iron pnictides, in particular the Ba(Fe_1-x Co_x)_2As_2 family.
Temperature dependence of the resistivity, thermopower and the Hall constant
are evaluated. It is shown that their anomalous behavior emerging from
experiments can be consistently described within the same framework assuming
also non-Fermi-liquid spin fluctuations.
