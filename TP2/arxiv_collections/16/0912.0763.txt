For optical Raman coherent effect we introduce the atomic coherent state (or
the angular momentum coherent state with various angular momemtum values) in
Schwinger bosonic realization, they are the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian
describing the Raman effect. Similar to the fact that the photon coherent state
describes laser light, the atomic coherent state is related to Raman process.
