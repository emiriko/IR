I review the theoretical and experimental status of proton decay theory and
experiment. Regarding theory, I focus mostly, but not only, on grand
unification. I discuss only the minimal, well established SU(5) and SO(10)
models, both ordinary and supersymmetric. I show how the minimal realistic
extensions of the original Georgi - Glashow model can lead to interesting LHC
physics, and I demonstrate that the minimal supersymmetric SU(5) theory is in
perfect accord with experiment. Since no universally accepted model has of yet
emerged, I discuss the effective operator analysis of proton decay and some
related predictions from a high scale underlying theory. A strong case is made
for the improvement of experimental limits, or better the search of, two body
neutron decay modes into charged kaons and charged leptons. Their discovery
would necessarily imply a low energy physics since they practically vanish in
any theory with a desert in energies between M_W and M_GUT.
