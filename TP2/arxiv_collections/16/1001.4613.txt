We have investigated non-Gaussianity of our early Universe by comparing the
parity asymmetry of the WMAP power spectrum with simulations. We find that
odd-parity preference of the WMAP data (2<= l <=18) is anomalous at 4-in-1000
level. We find it likely that low quadrupole power is part of this parity
asymmetry rather than an isolated anomaly. Futher investigation is required to
find out whether the origin of this anomaly is cosmological or systematic
effect. The data from Planck surveyor, which has systematics distinct from the
WMAP, will help us to resolve the origin of the anomalous odd-parity
preference.
