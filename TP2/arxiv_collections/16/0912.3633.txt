This work presents the derivation of the large time and distance asymptotic
behavior of the field-field correlation functions of impenetrable
one-dimensional anyons at finite temperature. In the appropriate limits of the
statistics parameter, we recover the well-known results for impenetrable bosons
and free fermions. In the low-temperature (usually expected to be the
"conformal") limit, and for all values of the statistics parameter away from
the bosonic point, the leading term in the correlator does not agree with the
prediction of the conformal field theory, and is determined by the singularity
of the density of the single-particle states at the bottom of the
single-particle energy spectrum.
