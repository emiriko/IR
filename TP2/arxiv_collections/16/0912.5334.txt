Existing anomaly and intrusion detection schemes of wireless sensor networks
have mainly focused on the detection of intrusions. Once the intrusion is
detected, an alerts or claims will be generated. However, any unidentified
malicious nodes in the network could send faulty anomaly and intrusion claims
about the legitimate nodes to the other nodes. Verifying the validity of such
claims is a critical and challenging issue that is not considered in the
existing cooperative-based distributed anomaly and intrusion detection schemes
of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a validation algorithm
that addresses this problem. This algorithm utilizes the concept of
intrusion-aware reliability that helps to provide adequate reliability at a
modest communication cost. In this paper, we also provide a security resiliency
analysis of the proposed intrusion-aware alert validation algorithm.
