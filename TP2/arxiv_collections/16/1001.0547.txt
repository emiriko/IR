We propose and experimentally demonstrate that, contrary to what it was
thought up to now, BB84 operation is feasible using the double phase modulator
(PM-PM) configuration in frequency coded systems. This is achieved by
exploiting the phase to intensity conversion due to the chromatic dispersion
provided by the fiber linking Alice and Bob. Thus, we refer to this system as
dispersion supported or DS BB84 PM-PM configuration.
