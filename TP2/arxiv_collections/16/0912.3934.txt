The speed of laser light pulses launched from Earth and returned by a
retro-reflector on the Moon was calculated from precision round-trip
time-of-flight measurements and modeled distances. The measured speed of light
(c) in the moving observers rest frame was found to exceed the canonical value
c = 299,792,458 m/s by 200+/-10 m/s, just the speed of the observatory along
the line-of-sight due to the rotation of the Earth during the measurements.
This is a first-order violation of local Lorentz invariance; the speed of light
seems to depend on the motion of the observer after all, as in classical wave
theory, and implies that a preferred reference frame exists for the propagation
of light. However, the present experiment cannot identify the physical system
to which such a reference frame might be tied.
