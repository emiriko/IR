The spectra of high-energy protons and nuclei accelerated by supernova
remnant shocks are calculated taking into account magnetic field amplification
and Alfvenic drift for different types of SNRs during their evolution. The
overall energy spectrum and elemental composition of cosmic rays after
propagation through the Galaxy are found.
