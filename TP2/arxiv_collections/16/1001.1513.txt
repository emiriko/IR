Future high-precision flavor experiments may discover a pattern of deviations
from the standard model predictions for flavor-changing neutral current
processes. One of the interesting questions that can be answered then will be
whether the flavor structure of the new physics is related to that of the
standard model or not. We analyze this aspect of flavor physics within a
specific framework: supersymmetric models where the soft breaking terms are
dominated by gauge-mediation but get non-negligible contributions from
gravity-mediation. We compare the possible patterns of non-minimally
flavor-violating effects that arise if the gravity-mediated contributions are
anarchical vs. the case that they are structured by a Froggatt-Nielsen
symmetry. We show that combining information on flavor and CP violation from
meson mixing and electric dipole moments is indicative for the flavor structure
of gravity-mediation.
