We consider the wave equation in a bounded domain (eventually convex). Two
kinds of inequality are described when occurs trapped ray. Applications to
control theory are given. First, we link such kind of estimate with the damped
wave equation and its decay rate. Next, we describe the design of an
approximate control function by an iterative time reversal method.
