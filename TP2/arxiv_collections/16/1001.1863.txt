A novel functional integral formulation of quantum mechanics for
non-Lagrangian systems is presented. The new approach, which we call "stringy
quantization," is based solely on classical equations of motion and is free of
any ambiguity arising from Lagrangian and/or Hamiltonian formulation of the
theory. The functionality of the proposed method is demonstrated on several
examples. Special attention is paid to the stringy quantization of systems with
a general A-power friction force $-\kappa[\dot{q}]^A$. Results for $A = 1$ are
compared with those obtained in the approaches by Caldirola-Kanai, Bateman and
Kostin. Relations to the Caldeira-Leggett model and to the Feynman-Vernon
approach are discussed as well.
