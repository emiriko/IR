The solar contribution to global mean air surface temperature change is
analyzed by using an empirical bi-scale climate model characterized by both
fast and slow characteristic time responses to solar forcing: $\tau_1 =0.4 \pm
0.1$ yr, and $\tau_2= 8 \pm 2$ yr or $\tau_2=12 \pm 3$ yr. Since 1980 the solar
contribution to climate change is uncertain because of the severe uncertainty
of the total solar irradiance satellite composites. The sun may have caused
from a slight cooling, if PMOD TSI composite is used, to a significant warming
(up to 65% of the total observed warming) if ACRIM, or other TSI composites are
used. The model is calibrated only on the empirical 11-year solar cycle
signature on the instrumental global surface temperature since 1980. The model
reconstructs the major temperature patterns covering 400 years of solar induced
temperature changes, as shown in recent paleoclimate global temperature
records.
