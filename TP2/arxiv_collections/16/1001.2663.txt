The global dynamics of a homogeneous universe in Loop Quantum Cosmology is
viewed as a scattering process of its geometrodynamical equivalent. This
picture is applied to build a flexible (easy to generalize) and not restricted
just to exactly solvable models method of verifying the preservation of the
semiclassicality through the bounce. The devised method is next applied to two
simple examples: (i) the isotropic Friedman Robertson Walker universe, and (ii)
the isotropic sector of the Bianchi I model. For both of them we show, that the
dispersions in the logarithm of the volume ln(v) and scalar field momentum
ln(p_phi) in the distant future and past are related via strong triangle
inequalities. This implies in particular a strict preservation of the
semiclassicality (in considered degrees of freedom) in both the cases (i) and
(ii). Derived inequalities are general: valid for all the physical states
within the considered models.
