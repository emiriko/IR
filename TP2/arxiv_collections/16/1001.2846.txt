We consider evolution of multichannel excitations in longitudinally modulated
waveguide arrays where refractive index either oscillates out-of-phase in all
neighboring waveguides or when it is modulated in phase in several central
waveguides surrounded by out-of-phase oscillating neighbors. Both types of
modulations allow resonant inhibition of light tunneling, but only the
modulation of latter type conserves the internal structure of multichannel
excitations. We show that parameter regions where light tunneling inhibition is
possible depend on the symmetry and structure of multichannel excitations.
Antisymmetric multichannel excitations are more robust than their symmetric
counterparts and experience nonlinearity-induced delocalization at higher
amplitudes.
