For the first time, we show that unipolar fatigue does occur in
antiferroelectric capacitors, confirming the predictions of a previous work
[Appl. Phys. Lett., 94, 072901 (2009)]. We also show that unipolar fatigue in
antiferroelectrics is less severe than bipolar fatigue if the driving field is
of the same magnitude. This phenomenon has been attributed to the
switching-induced charge injection, the main cause for polarization fatigue in
ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials. Other evidences for polarization
fatigue caused by the switching-induced charge injection from the nearby
electrode rather than the charge injection during stable/quasi-stable leakage
current stage are also discussed.
