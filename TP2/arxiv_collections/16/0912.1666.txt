New experiments for water at the surface of proteins at very low temperature
display intriguing dynamic behaviors. The extreme conditions of these
experiments make it difficult to explore the wide range of thermodynamic state
points needed to offer a suitable interpretation. Detailed simulations suffer
the same problem, where equilibration times at low temperature become
unreasonably long. We show how Monte Carlo simulations and mean field
calculations of a tractable model of water help interpret the experimental
results. Here we summarize the results for bulk water and investigate the
thermodynamic and dynamic properties of supercooled water at an interface.
