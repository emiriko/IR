An ability to describe quantum states directly by average values of
measurement outcomes is provided by the Bloch vector. For an informationally
complete set of measurements one can construct unique Bloch vector for any
quantum state. However, not every Bloch vector corresponds to a quantum state.
It seems that only for two dimensional quantum systems it is easy to
distinguish proper Bloch vectors from improper ones, i.e. the ones
corresponding to quantum states from the other ones. I propose an alternative
approach to the problem in which more than one vector is used. In particular, I
show that a state of the qutrit can be described by the three qubit-like Bloch
vectors.
