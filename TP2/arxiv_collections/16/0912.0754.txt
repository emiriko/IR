In this paper we demonstrate atomic-scale lithography on hydrogen terminated
Ge(001. The lithographic patterns were obtained by selectively desorbing
hydrogen atoms from a H resist layer adsorbed on a clean, atomically flat
Ge(001) surface with a scanning tunneling microscope tip operating in
ultra-high vacuum. The influence of the tip-to-sample bias on the lithographic
process have been investigated. Lithographic patterns with feature-sizes from
200 nm to 1.8 nm have been achieved by varying the tip-to-sample bias. These
results open up the possibility of a scanning-probe lithography approach to the
fabrication of future atomic-scale devices in germanium.
