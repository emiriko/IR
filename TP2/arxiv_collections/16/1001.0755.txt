We prove that the operator norm on weighted Lebesgue space L2(w) of the
commutators of the Hilbert, Riesz and Beurling transforms with a BMO function b
depends quadratically on the A2-characteristic of the weight, as opposed to the
linear dependence known to hold for the operators themselves. It is known that
the operator norms of these commutators can be controlled by the norm of the
commutator with appropriate Haar shift operators, and we prove the estimate for
these commutators. For the shift operator corresponding to the Hilbert
transform we use Bellman function methods, however there is now a general
theorem for a class of Haar shift operators that can be used instead to deduce
similar results. We invoke this general theorem to obtain the corresponding
result for the Riesz transforms and the Beurling-Ahlfors operator. We can then
extrapolate to Lp(w), and the results are sharp for 1 < p < 1.
