Authentication and authorization are two tightly coupled and interrelated
concepts which are used to keep transactions secure and help in protecting
confidential information. This paper proposes to evaluate the current
techniques used for authentication and authorization also compares them with
the best practices and universally accepted authentication and authorization
methods. Authentication verifies user identity and provides reusable
credentials while authorization services stores information about user access
levels. These mechanisms by which a system checks what level of access a
particular authenticated user should have to view secure resources is
controlled by the system
