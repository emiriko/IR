Many binary minor planets (BMPs; both binary asteroids and binary
Trans-Neptunians objects; TNOs) are known to exist in the Solar system. The
currently observed orbital and physical properties of BMPs hold essential
information and clues about their origin, their evolution and the conditions
underwhich they evolved. Here we study the orbital properties of BMPs with
currently known orbital solutions (the BMPs mutual orbits and not the BMP
orbits around the sun). We find that BMPs are typically highly inclined
relative to their orbit around the sun, with a distribution consistent with an
isotropic distribution. BMPs not affected by tidal forces are found to have
high eccentricities with non-thermal eccentricity distribution peaking at
intermediate eccentricities (typically 0.4-0.6). The high inclinations and
eccentricities of the BMPs suggest that BMPs evolved in a dense collisional
environment, in which gravitational encounters in addition to tidal and secular
Kozai affects played an important role in their orbital evolution.
