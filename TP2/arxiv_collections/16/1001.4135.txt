In this paper we have proposed an adaptive dynamic cache replacement
algorithm for a multimedia servers cache system. The goal is to achieve an
effective utilization of the cache memory which stores the prefix of popular
videos. A replacement policy is usually evaluated using hit ratio, the
frequency with which any video is requested. Usually discarding the least
recently used page is the policy of choice in cache management. The adaptive
dynamic replacement approach for prefix cache is a self tuning, low overhead
algorithm that responds online to changing access patterns. It constantly
balances between lru and lfu to improve combined result. It automatically
adapts to evolving workloads. Since in our algorithm we have considered a
prefix caching with multicast transmission of popular objects it utilizes the
hard disk and network bandwidth efficiently and increases the number of
requests being served.
