We prove the existence of a family of initial data for Einstein equations
which represent small deformations of the extreme Kerr black hole initial data.
The data in this family have the same asymptotic geometry as extreme Kerr. In
particular, the deformations preserve the angular momentum and the area of the
cylindrical end.
