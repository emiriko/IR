Schreiber and Yukich [Ann. Probab. 36 (2008) 363-396] establish an asymptotic
representation for random convex polytope geometry in the unit ball
$\mathbb{B}^d, d\geq2$, in terms of the general theory of stabilizing
functionals of Poisson point processes as well as in terms of generalized
paraboloid growth processes. This paper further exploits this connection,
introducing also a dual object termed the paraboloid hull process. Via these
growth processes we establish local functional limit theorems for the properly
scaled radius-vector and support functions of convex polytopes generated by
high-density Poisson samples. We show that direct methods lead to explicit
asymptotic expressions for the fidis of the properly scaled radius-vector and
support functions. Generalized paraboloid growth processes, coupled with
general techniques of stabilization theory, yield Brownian sheet limits for the
defect volume and mean width functionals. Finally we provide explicit variance
asymptotics and central limit theorems for the k-face and intrinsic volume
functionals.
