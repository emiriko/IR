We present an alternative subtraction scheme for the treatment of infrared
divergences in NLO QCD calculations. In this scheme, the number of
transformations is greatly reduced with respect to the standard subtraction
scheme by Catani and Seymour. We discuss the general setup of the scheme as
well as first applications to NLO processes at hadron and lepton colliders.
