We report on the first Suzaku observation of IGR J16318-4848, the most
extreme example of a new group of highly absorbed X-ray binaries that have
recently been discovered by the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory
INTEGRAL. The Suzaku observation was carried out between 2006 August 14 and 17,
with a net exposure time of 97 ks.
  The average X-ray spectrum of the source can be well described with a
continuum model typical for neutron stars i.e., a strongly absorbed power law
continuum with a photon index of 0.676(42) and an exponential cutoff at 20.5(6)
keV. The absorbing column is 1.95(3)x10e24 cm-2. Consistent with earlier work,
strong fluorescent emission lines of Fe Kalpha, Fe Kbeta, and Ni Kalpha are
observed. Despite the large absorbing column, no Compton shoulder is seen in
the lines, arguing for a non-spherical and inhomogeneous absorber.
  Seen at an average 5-60 keV absorbed flux of 3.4x10e-10 erg cm-2 s-1, the
source exhibits significant variability on timescales of hours.
