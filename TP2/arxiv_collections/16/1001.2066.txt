Silica is an abundant component of the Earth whose crystalline polymorphs
play key roles in its structure and dynamics. As the simplest silicates,
understanding pure silica is a prerequisite to understanding the rocky part of
the Earth, its majority. First principle density functional theory (DFT)
methods have often been used to accurately predict properties of silicates.
Here, we study silica with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), which until now was not
computationally possible for such complex materials, and find that QMC
overcomes the failures of DFT. QMC is a benchmark method that does not rely on
density functionals, but rather explicitly treats the electrons and their
interactions via a stochastic solution of Schrodinger's equation. Using ground
state QMC plus phonons within the quasiharmonic approximation from density
functional perturbation theory, we obtain the thermal pressure and equations of
state of silica phases up to Earth's core-mantle boundary. Our results provide
the most well-constrained equations of state and phase boundaries available for
silica. QMC indicates a transition to the most dense alpha-PbO2 structure above
the core-insulating D" layer, suggesting the absence of significant free silica
in the bulk lower mantle, which has been assumed but never proven. We also find
an accurate shear elastic constant and its geophysically important softening
with pressure.
