In this paper we prove that weak solution constructed by artificial
compressibility method are suitable in the sense of Scheffer. Using Hilbertian
setting and Fourier transform with respect to the time we obtain nontrivial
estimates of the pressure and the time derivate which allow us to pass into the
limit.
