Starting from the cycle permutation sigma_(2^k) associated with the
(2^k)-periodic orbit of the period doubling cascade we obtain the inverse
permutation (sigma_(2^k))^-1. Then we build a matrix permutation related to
(sigma_(2^k))^-1, which includes the visiting order of the (2^k)-periodic orbit
points. After some manipulations a recurrence relation of matricial
representation of period doubling cascade is obtained. Finally the explicit
matricial representation is reached.
