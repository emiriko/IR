A new interpretation of astronomical aberration is given in this paper and it
is based on the new theory of reference frames. The new interpretation confirms
the result of classical physics based on the concept of ether and does not
confirm the result of Special Relativity based on the constancy of the speed of
light. But in the new theory there is no need to suppose the existence of
ether.
