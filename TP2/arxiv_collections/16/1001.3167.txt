We study two types of models for the superconducting layered nitride
$\beta$-MNCl(M=Hf,Zr); a single band model on a triangular lattice, and a two
band model on a honeycomb lattice. We find that the former model does not
suffice as an effecitive model, while the latter one can be a good candidate.
We propose from the study on the two band model a possibility of spin
fluctuation mediated $d+id'$-wave superconductivity in the doped $\beta$-MNCl.
We show that the relatively high $T_c$ obtained in the doped band insulator is
a characteristic feature of the spin fluctuation mediated superconductivity on
a honeycomb lattice. We also find that the gap anisotropy on the Fermi surface
strongly increases upon increasing the doping concentration, and the inter
layer hopping suppresses superconductivity. These results are in qualitative
agreement with the experimental findings.
