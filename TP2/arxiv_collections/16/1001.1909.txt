Continuous time stochastic processes are useful models especially for
financial and insurance purposes. The numerical simulation of such models is
dependant of the time discrete discretization, of the parametric estimation and
of the choice of a random number generator. The aim of this paper is to provide
the tools for the practical implementation of diffusion processes simulation,
particularly for insurance contexts.
