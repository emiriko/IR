In this thesis we study algebraic structures in M-theory, in particular the
exceptional Lie algebras arising in dimensional reduction of its low energy
limit, eleven-dimensional supergravity. We focus on e8 and its
infinite-dimensional extensions e9 and e10. We review the dynamical
equivalence, up to truncations on both sides, between eleven-dimensional
supergravity and a geodesic sigma model based on the coset E10/K(E10), where
K(E10) is the maximal compact subgroup. The description of e10 as a graded Lie
algebra is crucial for this equivalence. We study generalized Jordan triple
systems, which are closely related to graded Lie algebras, and which may also
play a role in the description of M2-branes using three-dimensional
superconformal theories.
