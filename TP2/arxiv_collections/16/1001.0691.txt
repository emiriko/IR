We present an extended analysis of the wave-vector dependent shear viscosity
of monatomic and diatomic (liquid chlorine) fluids over a wide range of
wave-vectors and for a variety of state points. The analysis is based on
equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, which involves the evaluation of
transverse momentum density and shear stress autocorrelation functions. For
liquid chlorine we present the results in both atomic and molecular formalisms.
We find that the viscosity kernel of chlorine is statistically
indistinguishable with respect to atomic and molecular formalisms. The results
further suggest that the real space viscosity kernels of monatomic and diatomic
fluids depends sensitively on the density, the potential energy function and
the choice of fitting function in reciprocal space. It is also shown that the
reciprocal space shear viscosity data can be fitted to two different simple
functional forms over the entire density, temperature and wave-vector range: a
function composed of n-Gaussian terms and a Lorentzian type function. Overall,
the real space viscosity kernel has a width of 3 to 6 atomic diameters which
means that the generalized hydrodynamic constitutive relation is required for
fluids with strain rates that vary nonlinearly over distances of the order of
atomic dimensions.
