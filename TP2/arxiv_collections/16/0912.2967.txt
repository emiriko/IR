We discuss realistic nonlocal NN interactions of a new type - J-matrix
Inverse Scattering Potential (JISP). In an ab exitu approach, these
interactions are fitted to not only two-nucleon data (NN scattering data and
deuteron properties) but also to the properties of light nuclei without
referring to three-nucleon forces. We discuss recent progress with the ab
initio No-core Shell Model (NCSM) approach and respective progress in
developing ab exitu JISP-type NN-interactions together with plans of their
forthcoming improvements.
