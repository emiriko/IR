We study families of algebraic varieties parametrized by topological spaces
and generalize some classical results such as Hilbert Nullstellensatz and
primary decomposition of commutative rings. We show that there is an
equivalence between the category of bivariant coherent sheaves and the category
of sheaves of finitely generated modules.
