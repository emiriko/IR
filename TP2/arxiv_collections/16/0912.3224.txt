Abriged version for astroph: The young late-type star V1118 Orionis was in
outburst from 2005 to 2006. We followed the outburst with optical and
near-infrared photometry; the X-ray emission was further probed with
observations taken with XMM-Newton and Chandra during and after the outburst.
In addition, we obtained mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy with Spitzer
at the peak of the outburst and in the post-outburst phase. The spectral energy
distribution of V1118 Ori varied significantly over the course of the outburst.
The optical flux showed the largest variations, most likely due to enhanced
emission by a hot spot. The latter dominated the optical and near-infrared
emission at the peak of the outburst, while the disk emission dominated in the
mid-infrared. The X-ray flux correlated with the optical and infrared fluxes,
indicating that accretion affected the magnetically active corona and the
stellar magnetosphere. The thermal structure of the corona was variable with
some indication of a cooling of the coronal temperature in the early phase of
the outburst with a gradual return to normal values. Color-color diagrams in
the optical and infrared showed variations during the outburst, with no obvious
signature of reddening due to circumstellar matter. Using MC realizations of
star+disk+hotspot models to fit the SED in ``quiescence'' and at the peak of
the outburst, we determined that the mass accretion rate varied from about
2.5E-7 Msun/yr to 1E-6 Msun/yr; in addition the fractional area of the hotspot
increased significantly as well. The multi-wavelength study of the V1118 Ori
outburst helped us to understand the variations in spectral energy
distributions and demonstrated the interplay between the disk and the stellar
magnetosphere in a young, strongly accreting star.
