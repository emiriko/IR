Asteroseismology involves probing the interiors of stars and quantifying
their global properties, such as radius and age, through observationsof normal
modes of oscillation. The technical requirements for conducting
asteroseismology include ultra-high precision measured in photometry in parts
per million, as well as nearly continuous time series over weeks to years, and
cadences rapid enough to sample oscillations with periods as shortas a few
minutes. We report on results from the first 43 days of observations in which
the unique capabilities of Kepler in providing a revolutionary advance in
asteroseismology are already well in evidence. The Kepler asteroseismology
program holds intrinsic importance in supporting the core planetary search
program through greatly enhanced knowledge of host star properties, and extends
well beyond this to rich applications in stellar astrophysics.
