We report results of muon spin rotation measurements performed on the
ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO, which is one of the best approximations to a
localized ferromagnet. We argue that implanted muons are sensitive to the
internal field primarily through a combination of hyperfine and Lorentz fields.
The temperature dependences of the internal field and the relaxation rate have
been measured and are compared with previous theoretical predictions.
