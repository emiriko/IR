Compact, flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models have recently
regained interest as a good fit to the observed cosmic microwave background
temperature fluctuations. However, it is generally thought that a globally,
exactly-flat FLRW model is theoretically improbable. Here, in order to obtain a
probability space on the set F of compact, comoving, 3-spatial sections of FLRW
models, a physically motivated hypothesis is proposed, using the density
parameter Omega as a derived rather than fundamental parameter. We assume that
the processes that select the 3-manifold also select a global mass-energy and a
Hubble parameter. The inferred range in Omega consists of a single real value
for any 3-manifold. Thus, the obvious measure over F is the discrete measure.
Hence, if the global mass-energy and Hubble parameter are a function of
3-manifold choice among compact FLRW models, then probability spaces
parametrised by Omega do not, in general, give a zero probability of a flat
model. Alternatively, parametrisation by the injectivity radius r_inj ("size")
suggests the Lebesgue measure. In this case, the probability space over the
injectivity radius implies that flat models occur almost surely (a.s.), in the
sense of probability theory, and non-flat models a.s. do not occur.
