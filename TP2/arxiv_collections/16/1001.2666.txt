The Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of a massive scalar field on a 3-brane embedded
in six dimensional multiply warped spacetime are determined. Due to the
presence of warping along both the extra dimensions the KK mass spectrum splits
into two closely spaced branches which is a distinct feature of this model
compared to the five dimensional Randall-Sundrum model. This new cluster of the
KK mode spectrum is expected to have interesting phenomenological implications
for the upcoming collider experiments. Such a scenario may also be extended for
even larger number of orbifolded extra dimensions.
