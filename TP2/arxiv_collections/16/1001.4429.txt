We study superdevelopments in the weak lambda calculus of Cagman and Hindley,
a confluent variant of the standard weak lambda calculus in which reduction
below lambdas is forbidden. In contrast to developments, a superdevelopment
from a term M allows not only residuals of redexes in M to be reduced but also
some newly created ones. In the lambda calculus there are three ways new
redexes may be created; in the weak lambda calculus a new form of redex
creation is possible. We present labeled and simultaneous reduction
formulations of superdevelopments for the weak lambda calculus and prove them
equivalent.
