We examine the theoretical limits of the generation of entanglement in a
damped coupled ion-cavity system using jump-based feedback. Using Raman
transitions to produce entanglement between ground states reduces the necessary
feedback bandwidth, but does not improve the overall effect of the spontaneous
emission on the final entanglement. We find that the fidelity of the resulting
entanglement will be limited by the asymmetries produced by vibrations in the
trap, but that the concurrence remains above 0.88 for realistic ion trap sizes.
