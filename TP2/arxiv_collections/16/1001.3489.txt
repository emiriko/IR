Additional requirements are set for mobile applications in relation to
applications for desktop computers. These requirements primarily concern the
support to different platforms on which such applications are performed, as
well as the requirement for providing more modalities of input/output
interaction. These requirements have influence on the user interface and
therefore it is needed to consider the usability of MVC (Model-View-Controller)
and PAC (Presentation-Abstraction-Control) design patterns for the separation
of the user interface tasks from the business logic, specifically in mobile
applications. One of the questions is making certain choices of design patterns
for certain classes of mobile applications. When using these patterns the
possibilities of user interface automatic transformation should be kept in
mind. Although the MVC design pattern is widely used in mobile applications, it
is not universal, especially in cases where there are requirements for
heterogeneous multi-modal input-output interactions.
