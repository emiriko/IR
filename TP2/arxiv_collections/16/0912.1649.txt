Examples show that integral forms can be efficiently proved positive
semidefinite by the WDS method, but it was unknown that how many steps of
substitutions are needed, or furthermore, which integral forms is this method
applicable for. In this paper, we give upper bounds of step numbers of WDS
required in proving that an integral form is positive definite, positive
semidefinite, or not positive semidefinite, thus deducing that the WDS method
is complete.
