Films of oxides doped with transition metals are frequently believed to have
magnetic inclusions. Magnetic methods to determine the amount of nanophases and
their magnetic characteristics are described. The amount of the sample that is
paramagnetic may also be measured. Optical methods are described and shown to
be very powerful to determine which defects are also magnetic.
