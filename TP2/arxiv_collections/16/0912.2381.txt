We present the LAGOVirtual Project: an ongoing project to develop platform to
collaborate in the Large Aperture GRB Observatory (LAGO). This continental-wide
observatory is devised to detect high energy (around 100 GeV) component of
Gamma Ray Bursts, by using the single particle technique in arrays of Water
Cherenkov Detectors (WCD) at high mountain sites (Chacaltaya, Bolivia, 5300 m
a.s.l., Pico Espejo, Venezuela, 4750 m a.s.l., Sierra Negra, Mexico, 4650 m
a.s.l). This platform will allow LAGO collaboration to share data, and computer
resources through its different sites. This environment has the possibility to
generate synthetic data by simulating the showers through AIRES application and
to store/preserve distributed data files collected by the WCD at the LAGO
sites. The present article concerns the implementation of a prototype of
LAGO-DR adapting DSpace, with a hierarchical structure (i.e. country,
institution, followed by collections that contain the metadata and data files),
for the captured/simulated data. This structure was generated by using the
community, sub-community, collection, item model; available at the DSpace
software. Each member institution-country of the project has the appropriate
permissions on the system to publish information (descriptive metadata and
associated data files). The platform can also associate multiple files to each
item of data (data from the instruments, graphics, postprocessed-data, etc.).
