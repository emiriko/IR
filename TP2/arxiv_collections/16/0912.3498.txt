The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) hard X-ray transient monitor tracks
more than 700 galactic and extragalactic sources on time scales ranging from a
single Swift pointing (approximately 20 minutes) to one day. The monitored
sources include all objects from the Fermi LAT bright source list which are
either identified or which have a 95% error confidence radius of less than
eight arc minutes. We report on the detection statistics of these sources in
the BAT monitor both before and after the launch of Fermi.
