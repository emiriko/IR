The real theory of the Dunkl operators has been developed very extensively,
while there still lacks the corresponding complex theory. In this paper we
introduce the complex Dunkl operators for certain Coxeter groups. These complex
Dunkl operators have the commutative property, which makes it possible to
establish a corresponding complex analysis of Dunkl operators.
