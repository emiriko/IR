Stars in globular clusters are generally believed to have all formed at the
same time, early in the Galaxy's history. 'Blue stragglers' are stars massive
enough that they should have evolved into white dwarfs long ago. Two possible
mechanisms have been proposed for their formation: mass transfer between binary
companions and stellar mergers resulting from direct collisions between two
stars. Recently, the binary explanation was claimed to be dominant. Here we
report that there are two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers in
M30. This globular cluster is thought to have undergone 'core collapse', during
which both the collision rate and the mass transfer activity in binary systems
would have been enhanced. We suggest that the two observed sequences arise from
the cluster core collapse, with the bluer population arising from direct
stellar collisions and the redder one arising from the evolution of close
binaries that are probably still experiencing an active phase of mass transfer.
