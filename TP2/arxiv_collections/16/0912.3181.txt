The chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields, created by a static
gluon-quark-antiquark system, are computed in quenched SU(3) lattice QCD, in a
$24^3\times 48$ lattice at $\beta=6.2$ and $a=0.07261(85) fm$. We compute the
hybrid Wilson Loop with two spatial geometries, one with a U shape and another
with an L shape. The particular cases of the two gluon glueball and
quark-antiquark are also studied, and the Casimir scaling is investigated in a
microscopic perspective. This microscopic study of the colour fields is
relevant to understand the structure of hadrons, in particular of the hybrid
excitation of mesons. This also contributes to understand confinement with flux
tubes and to discriminate between the models of fundamental versus adjoint
confining strings, analogous to type-II and type-I superconductivity.
