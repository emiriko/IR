The primary focus of Monte Carlo simulation is to identify and quantify risk
related to uncertainty and variability in spreadsheet model inputs. The stress
of Monte Carlo simulation often reveals logical errors in the underlying
spreadsheet model that might be overlooked during day-to-day use or traditional
"what-if" testing. This secondary benefit of simulation requires a trained eye
to recognize warning signs of poor model construction.
