In the context of metric perturbation theory for non-spinning black holes,
extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) systems are described by distributionally
forced master wave equations. Numerical solution of a master wave equation as
an initial boundary value problem requires initial data. However, because the
correct initial data for generic-orbit systems is unknown, specification of
trivial initial data is a common choice, despite being inconsistent and
resulting in a solution which is initially discontinuous in time. As is well
known, this choice leads to a "burst" of junk radiation which eventually
propagates off the computational domain. We observe another unintended
consequence of trivial initial data: development of a persistent spurious
solution, here referred to as the Jost junk solution, which contaminates the
physical solution for long times. This work studies the influence of both types
of junk on metric perturbations, waveforms, and self-force measurements, and it
demonstrates that smooth modified source terms mollify the Jost solution and
reduce junk radiation. Our concluding section discusses the applicability of
these observations to other numerical schemes and techniques used to solve
distributionally forced master wave equations.
