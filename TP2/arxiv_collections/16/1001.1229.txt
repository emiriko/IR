We present experimental sensitivity for the production of a fourth-generation
Majorana neutrino ($N$) via an s-channel $Z$ boson $Z\to NN \to W\ell W\ell$ at
hadron colliders. This channel has not been studied for the Tevatron dataset
with $\int \mathcal{L}=5 $ fb$^{-1}$, where we find that a single experiment
could significantly extend current 95% C.L. mass lower limits, to $m_N>175$
GeV$/c^2$, or report $3\sigma$ evidence for the $N$ if $m_N<150$ GeV$/c^2$.
With 5 fb$^{-1}$, a single LHC experiment at $\sqrt{s}=10$ TeV could expect t o
set a 95% C.L. mass lower limits of $m_N>300$ GeV$/c^2$, or report 3$\sigma$
evidence for the $N$ if $m_N<225$ GeV$/c^2$.
