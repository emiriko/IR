We report the observation of a new dwarf nova, OT J055717+683226, during its
first-ever recorded superoutburst in December 2006. Our observation shows that
this object is an SU UMa-type dwarf nova having a very short superhump period
of 76.67+/- 0.03 min (0.05324+/-0.00002 d). The next superoutburst was observed
in March 2008. The recurrence time of superoutbursts (supercycle) is, hence,
estimated to be ~480 d. The supercycle is much shorter than those of WZ
Sge-type dwarf novae having supercycles of >~ 10 yr, which are a major
population of dwarf novae in the shortest orbital period regime (<~85 min).
Using a hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified seven groups of dwarf
novae in the shortest orbital period regime. We identified a small group of
objects that have short supercycles, small outburst amplitudes, and large
superhump period excesses, compared with those of WZ Sge stars. OT
J055717+683226 probably belongs to this group.
