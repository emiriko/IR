We report on the synthesis of CdSe quantum dots on a graphene surface by an
electrochemical deposition method. By using a mesoporous silica film formed on
the graphene surface as a template and a potential equalizer between the
edge/defect sites and the basal plane of the graphene, CdSe quantum dots can be
grown on the basal plane into a regular hexagonal array.
