We use computational screening to systematically investigate the use of
transition metal doped carbon nanotubes for chemical gas sensing. For a set of
relevant target molecules (CO, NH3, H2S) and the main components of air (N2,
O2, H2O), we calculate the binding energy and change in conductance upon
adsorption on a metal atom occupying a vacancy of a (6,6) carbon nanotube.
Based on these descriptors, we identify the most promising dopant candidates
for detection of a given target molecule. From the fractional coverage of the
metal sites in thermal equilibrium with air, we estimate the change in the
nanotube resistance per doping site as a function of the target molecule
concentration assuming charge transport in the diffusive regime. Our analysis
points to Ni-doped nanotubes as candidates for CO sensors working under typical
atmospheric conditions.
