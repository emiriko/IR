I report recent results and the status of the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search
(CDMS II) experiment at the Soudan Underground Laboratory in Minnesota, USA. A
blind analysis of data taken by 30 detectors between October 2006 and July 2007
found zero events consistent with WIMPs elastically scattering in our Ge
detectors. This resulted in an upper limit on the spin-independent,
WIMP-nucleon cross section of 6.6 x 10^-44 cm^2 (4.6 x 10^-44 cm^2 when
combined with our previous results) at the 90% C.L. for a WIMP of mass 60
GeV/c^2. In March 2009 data taking with CDMS II stopped in order to install the
first of 5 SuperTowers of detectors for the SuperCDMS Soudan project. Analysis
of data taken between August 2007 and March 2009 is ongoing.
