Methods developed for mapping the journal structures contained in aggregated
journal-journal citations in the Science Citation Index are applied to the
Chinese Science Citation Database of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This
database covers 991 journals, of which only 37 had originally English titles.
Using factor-analytical and graph-analytical techniques we show that this data
is dually structured. The main structure is the intellectual organization of
the journals in journal groups (as in the international SCI), but the
university-based journals provide an institutional layer that orients this
structure towards practical ends (e.g., agriculture). The Chinese Science
Citation Database exhibits the characteristics of Mode 2 in the production of
scientific knowledge more than its western counterparts. The contexts of
application lead to correlation (interfactorial complexity) among the
components.
