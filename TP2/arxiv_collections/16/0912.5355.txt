VERITAS is a state-of-the-art ground-based gamma-ray observatory that
operates in the very high-energy (VHE) region of 100 GeV to 50 TeV. The
observatory consists of an array of four 12m-diameter imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes located in southern Arizona, USA. The four-telescope array
has been fully operational since September 2007, and over the last two years,
VERITAS has been operating with high efficiency and with excellent performance.
This talk summarizes the recent results from VERITAS, including the discovery
of eight new VHE gamma-ray sources.
