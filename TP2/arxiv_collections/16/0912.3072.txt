Within the conjectured duality between N=4 super Yang-Mills and Anti-deSitter
string theory, the BFKL Pomeron of the gauge theory corresponds to the graviton
mode of the dual string. As a first step towards analyzing multigraviton
exchange, we investigate R-current six-point functions within the supergravity
approximation. We compute the analogue of diffractive scattering, and we
analyze the triple Regge limit. In the supergravity approximation the triple
graviton vertex is found to vanish.
