We present a coherent population trapping based scheme to attain
sub-nanoscale resolution for atom localization, microscopy and lithography. Our
method uses three-level atoms coupled to amplitude modulated probe field and
spatially dependent drive field. The modulation of the probe field allows us to
tap into the steep dispersion normally associated with electromagnetically
induced transparency and offers an avenue to attain sub-nanometer resolution
using just optical fields. We illustrate application of the techniques to the
area of microscopy and lithography and show how multilevel schemes offer the
possibility of improving resolution further.
