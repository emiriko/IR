The role of dipolar interactions among Ni nanoparticles (NP) embedded in an
amorphous SiO2/C matrix with different concentrations has been studied
performing ac magnetic susceptibility Chi_ac measurements. For very diluted
samples, with Ni concentrations < 4 wt % Ni or very weak dipolar interactions,
the data are well described by the Neel-Arrhenius law. Increasing Ni
concentration to values up to 12.8 wt % Ni results in changes in the
Neel-Arrhenius behavior, the dipolar interactions become important, and need to
be considered to describe the magnetic response of the NPs system. We have
found no evidence of a spin-glasslike behavior in our Ni NP systems even when
dipolar interactions are clearly present.
