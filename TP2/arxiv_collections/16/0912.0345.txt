The solar transition region (TR), in which above the photosphere the tempera-
ture increases rapidly and the density drops dramatically, is believed to play
an important role in coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. Long-lasting
up-flows are present in the upper TR and interpreted as signatures of mass
supply to large coronal loops in the quiet Sun. Coronal bright points (BPs) are
local heating phenomena and we found a different Doppler-shift pattern at TR
and coronal temperatures in one BP, which might be related to the twisted loop
system. The dominant energy loss in the lower TR is the Ly-alpha emission. It
has been found that most Ly-alpha radiance profiles are stronger in the blue
peak, an asymmetry opposite to higher order Lyman lines. This asymmetry is
stronger when the downflow in the middle TR is stronger, indicating that the TR
flows play an important role in the line formation process. The peak separation
of Ly-alpha is found to be larger in coronal holes than in the quiet Sun,
reflecting the different magnetic structures and radiation fields between the
two regions. The Lyman line profiles are found to be not reversed in sunspot
plume and umbra regions, while they are obviously reversed in the surrounding
plage region. At TR temperatures, the densities of the sunspot plume and umbra
are a factor of 10 lower than of the plage, indicating that the sunspot plasma
emitting at TR temperatures is higher and possibly more extended above sunspots
than above the plage region.
