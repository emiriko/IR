The Low Frequency Instrument on board the PLANCK satellite is designed to
give the most accurate map ever of the CMB anisotropy of the whole sky over a
broad frequency band spanning 27 to 77 GHz. It is made of an array of 22
pseudo-correlation radiometers, composed of 11 actively cooled (20 K) Front End
Modules (FEMs), and 11 Back End Modules (BEMs) at 300K. The connection between
the two parts is made with rectangular Wave Guides. Considerations of different
nature (thermal, electromagnetic and mechanical), imposed stringent
requirements on the WGs characteristics and drove their design. From the
thermal point of view, the WG should guarantee good insulation between the FEM
and the BEM sections to avoid overloading the cryocooler. On the other hand it
is essential that the signals do not undergo excessive attenuation through the
WG. Finally, given the different positions of the FEM modules behind the focal
surface and the mechanical constraints given by the surrounding structures,
different mechanical designs were necessary. A composite configuration of
Stainless Steel and Copper was selected to satisfy all the requirements. Given
the complex shape and the considerable length (about 1.5-2 m), manufacturing
and testing the WGs was a challenge. This work deals with the development of
the LFI WGs, including the choice of the final configuration and of the
fabrication process. It also describes the testing procedure adopted to fully
characterize these components from the electromagnetic point of view and the
space qualification process they underwent. Results obtained during the test
campaign are reported and compared with the stringent requirements. The
performance of the LFI WGs is in line with requirements, and the WGs were
successfully space qualified.
