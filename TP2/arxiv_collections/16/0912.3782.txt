We present a multi-frequency and multi-instrument study of the 20 January
2005 event. We focus mainly on the complex radio signatures and their
association with the active phenomena taking place: flares, CMEs, particle
acceleration and magnetic restructuring. As a variety of energetic particle
accelerators and sources of radio bursts are present, in the flare-ejecta
combination, we investigate their relative importance in the progress of this
event. The dynamic spectra of {Artemis-IV-Wind/Waves-Hiras with 2000 MHz-20 kHz
frequency coverage, were used to track the evolution of the event from the low
corona to the interplanetary space; these were supplemented with SXR, HXR and
gamma-ray recordings. The observations were compared with the expected radio
signatures and energetic-particle populations envisaged by the {Standard
Flare--CME model and the reconnection outflow termination shock model. A proper
combination of these mechanisms seems to provide an adequate model for the
interpretation of the observational data.
