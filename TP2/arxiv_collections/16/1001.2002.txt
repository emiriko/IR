We discuss a new lattice implementation of the linear covariant gauge,
recently introduced in [1]. In particular, we present details of the numerical
procedure for fixing the gauge. We also report on preliminary results for the
transverse and longitudinal gluon propagators for the SU(2) gauge group in four
space-time dimensions.
