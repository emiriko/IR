We investigate theoretically the dissociative ionization of a H2+ molecule
using two ultrashort laser (pump-probe) pulses. The pump pulse prepares a
dissociating nuclear wave packet on an ungerade surface of H2+. Next, an UV (or
XUV) probe pulse ionizes this dissociating state at large (R = 20 - 100 bohr)
internuclear distance. We calculate the momenta distributions of protons and
photoelectrons which show a (two-slit-like) interference structure. A general,
simple interference formula is obtained which depends on the electron and
protons momenta, as well as on the pump-probe delay on the pulses durations and
polarizations. This interference can be interpreted as visualization of an
electron state delocalized over the two-centres. This state is an entangled
state of a hydrogen atom with a momentum p and a proton with an opposite
momentum. -p dissociating on the ungerade surface of H2+. This pump-probe
scheme can be used to reveal the nonlocality of the electron which intuitively
should be localized on just one of the protons separated by the distance R much
larger than the atomic Bohr orbit.
