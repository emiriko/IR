We construct topological geon quotients of two families of
Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes. For Kuenzle's static, spherically symmetric
SU(n) black holes with n>2, a geon quotient exists but generically requires
promoting charge conjugation into a gauge symmetry. For Kleihaus and Kunz's
static, axially symmetric SU(2) black holes a geon quotient exists without
gauging charge conjugation, and the parity of the gauge field winding number
determines whether the geon gauge bundle is trivial. The geon's gauge bundle
structure is expected to have an imprint in the Hawking-Unruh effect for
quantum fields that couple to the background gauge field.
