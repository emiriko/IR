We have analyzed the first 3.75 years of data from TAOS, the Taiwanese
American Occultation Survey. TAOS monitors bright stars to search for
occultations by Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). This dataset comprises 5e5
star-hours of multi-telescope photometric data taken at 4 or 5 Hz. No events
consistent with KBO occultations were found in this dataset. We compute the
number of events expected for the Kuiper Belt formation and evolution models of
Pan & Sari (2005), Kenyon & Bromley (2004), Benavidez & Campo Bagatin (2009),
and Fraser (2009). A comparison with the upper limits we derive from our data
constrains the parameter space of these models. This is the first detailed
comparison of models of the KBO size distribution with data from an occultation
survey. Our results suggest that the KBO population is comprised of objects
with low internal strength and that planetary migration played a role in the
shaping of the size distribution.
