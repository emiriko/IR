We present a minimal but crucial microscopic theory for epitaxial graphene
and graphene nanoribbons on the 4H-SiC(0001) surface -- protopypical materials
to explore physical properties of graphene in large scale. Coarse-grained model
Hamiltonians are constructed based on the atomic and electronic structures of
the systems from first-principles calculations. From the theory, we
unambiguously uncover origins of several intriguing experimental observations
such as broken-symmetry states around the Dirac points and new energy bands
arising throughout the Brillouin zone, thereby establishing the role of
substates in modifying electronic properties of graphene. We also predict that
armchair graphene nanoribbons on the surface have a single energy gap of 0.2 eV
when their widths are over 15 nm, in sharp contrast to their usual family
behavior.
