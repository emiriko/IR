In comparative genomic, the first step of sequence analysis is usually to
decompose two or more genomes into syntenic blocks that are segments of
homologous chromosomes. For the reliable recovery of syntenic blocks, noise and
ambiguities in the genomic maps need to be removed first. Maximal Strip
Recovery (MSR) is an optimization problem proposed by Zheng, Zhu, and Sankoff
for reliably recovering syntenic blocks from genomic maps in the midst of noise
and ambiguities. Given $d$ genomic maps as sequences of gene markers, the
objective of \msr{d} is to find $d$ subsequences, one subsequence of each
genomic map, such that the total length of syntenic blocks in these
subsequences is maximized. For any constant $d \ge 2$, a polynomial-time
2d-approximation for \msr{d} was previously known. In this paper, we show that
for any $d \ge 2$, \msr{d} is APX-hard, even for the most basic version of the
problem in which all gene markers are distinct and appear in positive
orientation in each genomic map. Moreover, we provide the first explicit lower
bounds on approximating \msr{d} for all $d \ge 2$. In particular, we show that
\msr{d} is NP-hard to approximate within $\Omega(d/\log d)$. From the other
direction, we show that the previous 2d-approximation for \msr{d} can be
optimized into a polynomial-time algorithm even if $d$ is not a constant but is
part of the input. We then extend our inapproximability results to several
related problems including \cmsr{d}, \gapmsr{\delta}{d}, and
\gapcmsr{\delta}{d}.
