The role of edge illumination in the performance of compact-size dielectric
lens antennas (DLAs) is studied in accurate manner using a highly efficient
algorithm based on the combination of the Muller boundary integral equations
and the method of analytical regularization. The analysis accounts for the
finite size of the lens and directive nature of the primary feed placed close
to the center of the lens base. The problem is solved in a two-dimensional
formulation for both E- and H-polarizations. It is found that away from
internal resonances that spoil the radiation characteristics of DLAs made of
dense materials, the edge illumination has primary importance. The proper
choice of this parameter helps maximize DLA directivity, and its optimal value
depends on the lens material and feed polarization. Index Terms: Beam
