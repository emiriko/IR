Indexing learning documents using the Learning Object Metadata (LOM) is often
carried out manually by archivists. Filling out the LOM fields is a long and
difficult task, requiring a complete reading and a full knowledge on the topic
dealt within the document. In this paper, we present an innovative model and
method to assist the archivists in finding the important concepts and keywords
of a learning document. The application is performed using wikipedia's category
links.
