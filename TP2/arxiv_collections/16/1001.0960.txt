We extend stochastic network optimization theory to treat networks with
arbitrary sample paths for arrivals, channels, and mobility. The network can
experience unexpected link or node failures, traffic bursts, and topology
changes, and there are no probabilistic assumptions describing these time
varying events. Performance of our scheduling algorithm is compared against an
ideal T-slot lookahead policy that can make optimal decisions based on
knowledge up to T-slots into the future. We develop a simple non-anticipating
algorithm that provides network throughput-utility that is arbitrarily close to
(or better than) that of the T-slot lookahead policy, with a tradeoff in the
worst case queue backlog kept at any queue. The same policy offers even
stronger performance, closely matching that of an ideal infinite lookahead
policy, when ergodic assumptions are imposed.
  Our analysis uses a sample path version of Lyapunov drift and provides a
methodology for optimizing time averages in general time-varying optimization
problems.
