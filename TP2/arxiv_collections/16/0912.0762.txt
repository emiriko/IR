We examine the effects of thermohaline mixing on the composition of the
envelopes of low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We have
evolved models of 1, 1.5 and 2 solar masses from the pre-main sequence to the
end of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch with thermohaline mixing
applied throughout the simulations. In agreement with other authors, we find
that thermohaline mixing substantially reduces the abundance of helium-3 on the
upper part of the red giant branch in our lowest mass model. However, the small
amount of helium-3 that remains is enough to drive thermohaline mixing on the
AGB. We find that thermohaline mixing is most efficient in the early thermal
pulses and its efficiency drops from pulse to pulse. Nitrogen is not
substantially affected by the process, but we do see substantial changes in
carbon-13. The carbon-12 to carbon-13 ratio is substantially lowered during the
early thermal pulses but the efficacy of the process is seen to diminish
rapidly. As the process stops after a few pulses, the carbon-12 to carbon-13
ratio is still able to reach values of 10^3-10^4, which is inconsistent with
the values measured in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. We also note a
surprising increase in the lithium-7 abundance, with log epsilon(Li-7) reaching
values of over 2.5 in the 1.5 solar mass model. It is thus possible to get
stars which are both C- and Li-rich at the same time. We compare our models to
measurements of carbon and lithium in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars which
have not yet reached the giant branch. These models can simultaneously
reproduced the observed C and Li abundances of carbon-enhanced metal-poor
turn-off stars that are Li-rich, but the observed nitrogen abundances still
cannot be matched.
