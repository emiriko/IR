We argue that if color-superconducting quark matter exists in the core of a
neutron star, it may contain a high density of flux tubes, carrying flux that
is mostly color-magnetic, with a small admixture of ordinary magnetic flux. We
focus on the two-flavor color-superconducting ("2SC") phase, and assume that
the flux tubes are energetically stable, although this has not yet been
demonstrated. The density of flux tubes depends on the nature of the transition
to the color-superconducting phase, and could be within an order of magnitude
of the density of magnetic flux tubes that would be found if the core were
superconducting nuclear matter. We calculate the cross-section for
Aharonov-Bohm scattering of gapless fermions off the flux tubes, and the
associated collision time and frictional force on a moving flux tube. We
discuss the other forces on the flux tube, and find that if we take in to
account only the forces that arise within the 2SC core region then the
timescale for expulsion of the color flux tubes from the 2SC core is of order
10^10 years.
