We discuss the implications of recent experimental evidence of nuclear Short
Range Correlations (SRCs) on the modeling of the wave function of complex
nuclei. We perform a calculation of potential energy contributions of pp and pn
pairs in nuclei, showing that the presence of strong tensor correlations
produce a ratio between the twos of about 1/9, which strongly deviates from the
combinatorial counting of the number of pairs. We also discuss implications for
the production of Monte Carlo configuration for the simulation of nuclear
reactions involving complex nuclei.
