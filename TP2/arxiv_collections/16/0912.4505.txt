This paper reports on some new inequalities of
Margolus-Levitin-Mandelstam-Tamm-type involving the speed of quantum evolution
between two orthogonal pure states. The clear determinant of the qualitative
behavior of this time scale is the statistics of the energy spectrum. An
often-overlooked correspondence between the real-time behavior of a quantum
system and the statistical mechanics of a transformed (imaginary-time)
thermodynamic system appears promising as a source of qualitative insights into
the quantum dynamics.
