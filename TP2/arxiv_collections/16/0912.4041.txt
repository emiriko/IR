We investigate the formation of fullerene-like structures from hot Carbon gas
using classical molecular dynamics, employing Brenner's potential. In
particular we examine the influence of different annealing strategies on
fullerene yield, which is characterized by the distribution of coordination
numbers and polygon numbers. It will be shown that the fullerene yield strongly
depends on the annealing strategy. Furthermore, we observe a close relation
between polygon formation and the number of atoms surrounded by three atoms.
