What should a court do with a preliminary-injunction request to halt a
multi-billion-dollar particle-physics experiment that plaintiffs claim could
create a black hole that will devour the planet? The real-life case of CERN's
LHC seems like a legal classic in the making. Unfortunately, however, no court
has braved the extreme factual terrain to reach the merits. This article steps
into the void. First, the relevant facts of the scientific debate and its human
context are memorialized and made ripe for legal analysis. Next, the article
explores the daunting challenges the case presents to equity, evidence, and
law-and-economics analysis. Finally, a set of analytical tools are offered that
provide a way out of the thicket - a method for providing meaningful judicial
review even in cases, such as this one, where the scientific issues are almost
unfathomably complex.
