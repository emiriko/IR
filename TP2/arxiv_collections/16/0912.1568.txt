We develop a two dimensional, self-consistent, compressible fluid model to
study evolution of Alfvenic modes in partially ionized astrophysical and space
plasmas. The partially ionized plasma consists mainly of electrons, ions and
significant neutral atoms. The nonlinear interactions amongst these species
take place predominantly through direct collision or charge exchange processes.
Our model uniquely describe the interaction processes between two distinctly
evolving fluids. In our model, the electrons and ions are described by a single
fluid compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model and are coupled
self-consistently to the neutral fluid via compressible hydrodynamic equations.
Both plasma and neutral fluids are treated with different energy equations that
adequately enable us to monitor non adiabatic and thermal energy exchange
processes between these two distinct fluids. Based on our self-consistent
model, we find that the propagation speed of Alfvenic modes in space and
astrophysical plasma is slowed down because these waves are damped
predominantly due to direct collisions with the neutral atoms. Consequently,
energy transfer takes place between plasma and neutral fluids. We describe the
mode coupling processes that lead to the energy transfer between the plasma and
neutral and corresponding spectral features.
