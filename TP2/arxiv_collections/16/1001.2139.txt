Aims: We measure transition probabilities for Cr II transitions from the z
^4H_J, z ^2D_J, y ^4F_J, and y ^4G_J levels in the energy range 63000 to 68000
cm^{-1}. Methods: Radiative lifetimes were measured using time-resolved
laser-induced fluorescence from a laser-produced plasma. In addition, branching
fractions were determined from intensity-calibrated spectra recorded with a UV
Fourier transform spectrometer. The branching fractions and radiative lifetimes
were combined to yield accurate transition probabilities and oscillator
strengths. Results: We present laboratory measured transition probabilities for
145 Cr II lines and radiative lifetimes for 14 Cr II levels. The
laboratory-measured transition probabilities are compared to the values from
semi-empirical calculations and laboratory measurements in the literature.
