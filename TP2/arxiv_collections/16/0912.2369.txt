We investigate the strong electric current sheet that develops at the tip of
the pulsar closed line region through time dependent three-dimensional
numerical simulations of a rotating magnetic dipole. We show that curvature
radiation from relativistic electrons and positrons in the current sheet may
naturally account for several features of the high-energy pulsar emission. We
obtain light curves and polarization profiles for the complete range of
magnetic field inclination angles and observer orientations, and compare our
results to recent observations from the Fermi gamma-ray telescope.
