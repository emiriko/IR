We report results from a 50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the dust-reddened
broad-line quasar FTM 0830+3759 (z=0.413) selected from the FIRST/2MASS Red
Quasar survey. For this AGN, a very short 9 ks Chandra exposure had suggested a
feature-rich X-ray spectrum and HST images revealed a very disturbed host
galaxy morphology. Contrary to classical, optically-selected quasars, the X-ray
properties of red (i.e. with J-Ks> 1.7 and R-Ks> 4) broad line quasars are
still quite unexplored, although there is a growing consensus that, due to
moderate obscuration, these objects can offer a unique view of spectral
components typically swamped by the AGN light in normal, blue quasars. The
XMM-Newton observation discussed here has definitely confirmed the complexity
of the X-ray spectrum revealing the presence of a cold (or mildly-ionized)
absorber with Nh ~10^{22} cm^-2 along the line of sight to the nucleus and a
Compton reflection component accompanied by an intense Fe K emission line in
this quasar with a Lum(2-10) ~5 x 10^{44} erg/s. A soft-excess component is
also required by the data. The match between the column density derived by our
spectral analysis and that expected on the basis of reddening due to the dust
suggests the possibility that both absorptions occur in the same medium. FTM
0830+3759 is characterized by an extinction/absorption-corrected
X-ray-to-optical flux ratio alphaox = -2.3, that is steeper than expected on
the basis of its UV luminosity. These findings indicate that the X-ray
properties of FTM 0830+3759 differs from those typically observed for
optically-selected broad line quasars with comparable hard X-ray luminosity.
