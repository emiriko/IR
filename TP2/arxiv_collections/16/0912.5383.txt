The time evolution of collective modes in an expanding ultarelativistic and
(effectively) Abelian plasma is studied in the hard-loop approximation
semi-analytically by means of integro-differential equations. A previous
treatment is generalized to arbitrary orientation of wave vectors with respect
to the direction of anisotropy and thus to a fully 3+1 dimensional situation.
Moreover, initial fluctuations are allowed in both gauge fields and currents,
which is necessary in the case of (stable) longitudinal modes. For unstable
(Weibel) modes, this generalization of initial conditions reduces drastically
the lower bound on the delay in the onset of growth that was found previously
by considering only collective gauge fields as seeds. This makes it appear much
more likely that non-Abelian plasma instabilities seeded by small initial
rapidity fluctuations could play an important role in the early stage of
heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies.
