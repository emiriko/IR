The addition of non-renormalizable terms involving the Higgs fields to the
MSSM (BMSSM) ameliorates the little hierarchy problem of the MSSM. For
neutralino dark matter, new regions for which the relic abundance of the LSP is
consistent with WMAP (as the bulk region and the stop coannihilation region)
are now permitted. In this framework, we analyze in detail the direct dark
matter detection prospects in a Xenon-like experiment. On the other hand, we
study the capability of detecting gamma-rays, antiprotons and positrons
produced in the annihilation of neutralino LSPs in the Fermi and oncoming
AMS-02 experiments.
