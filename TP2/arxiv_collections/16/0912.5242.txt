The diffusion of information and behaviors over social networks is of
considerable interest in research fields ranging from sociology to computer
science and application domains such as marketing, finance, human health, and
national security. Of particular interest is the possibility to develop
predictive capabilities for social diffusion, for instance enabling early
identification of diffusion processes which are likely to become "viral" and
propagate to a significant fraction of the population. Recently we have shown,
using theoretical analysis, that the dynamics of social diffusion may depend
crucially upon the interactions of social network communities, that is, densely
connected groupings of individuals which have only relatively few links between
groups. This paper presents an empirical investigation of two related
hypotheses which follow from this finding: 1.) inter-community interaction is
predictive of the reach of social diffusion and 2.) dispersion of the diffusion
phenomenon across network communities is a useful early indicator that the
propagation will be "successful". We explore these hypotheses with case studies
involving the emergence of the Swedish Social Democratic Party at the turn of
the 20th century, the spread of the SARS virus in 2002-2003, and blogging
dynamics associated with real world protest activity. These empirical studies
demonstrate that network community-based diffusion metrics do indeed possess
predictive power, and in fact can be more useful than standard measures.
