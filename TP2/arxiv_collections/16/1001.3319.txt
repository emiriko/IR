Biomimetic nanotechnology is a prominent research area at the meeting place
of life sciences with engineering and physics: it is a continuously growing
field that deals with knowledge transfer from biology to nanotechnology.
Biomimetic nanotechnology is a field that has the potential to substantially
support successful mastering of major global challenges. The Millennium Project
was commissioned by the United Nations Secretary-General in 2002 to develop a
concrete action plan for the world to reverse the grinding poverty, hunger and
disease affecting billions of people. It states 15 Global Challenges:
sustainable development, water, population and resources, democratization,
long-term perspectives, information technology, the rich-poor gap, health,
capacity to decide, peace and conflict, status of women, transnational crime,
energy, science and technology and global ethics. The possible contributions to
master these challenges with the help of biomimetic nanotechnology will be
discussed in detail.
