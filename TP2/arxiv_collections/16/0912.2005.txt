The performance of prototypes for the ALICE electromagnetic sampling
calorimeter has been studied in test beam measurements at FNAL and CERN. A
$4\times4$ array of final design modules showed an energy resolution of about
11% /$\sqrt{E(\mathrm{GeV})}$ $\oplus$ 1.7 % with a uniformity of the response
to electrons of 1% and a good linearity in the energy range from 10 to 100 GeV.
The electromagnetic shower position resolution was found to be described by 1.5
mm $\oplus$ 5.3 mm /$\sqrt{E \mathrm{(GeV)}}$. For an electron identification
efficiency of 90% a hadron rejection factor of $>600$ was obtained.
