Many applications require optimizing an unknown, noisy function that is
expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem,
where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has
low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds
for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We
analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its
cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel
connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by
bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear
regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important
cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In
our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other
heuristical GP optimization approaches.
