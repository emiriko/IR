The superfluid density, \rho_s, of the iron chalcogenide superconductor,
FeSe_1-x, was studied as a function of pressure by means of muon-spin rotation.
The zero-temperature value of \rho_s increases with increasing transition
temperature T_c (increasing pressure) following the tendency observed for
various Fe-based and cuprate superconductors. The analysis of \rho_s(T) within
the two-gap scheme reveals that the effect on both, T_c and \rho_s(0), is
entirely determined by the band(s) where the large superconducting gap
develops, while the band(s) with the small gap become practically unaffected.
