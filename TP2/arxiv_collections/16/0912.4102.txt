The long-time dynamics of somatic adaptability in immune system is simulated
by a simple physical model. The immune system described by the model exhibits a
scale free behavior as is observed in living systems. The balance between the
positive and negative feedbacks of the model leads to a robust immune system
where the positive one corresponds to the formation of memory cells and the
negative one to immunosuppression. Also the immunosenescence of the system is
discussed based on the time-dependence of the epigenetic landscape of the
adaptive immune cells in the shape space.
