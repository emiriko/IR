In this paper we show that if $A$ is a subset of the primes with positive
relative density $\delta$, then $A+A$ must have positive upper density
$C_1\delta e^{-C_2(\log(1/\delta))^{2/3}(\log\log(1/\delta))^{1/3}}$ in
$\mathbb{N}$. Our argument applies the techniques developed by Green and
Green-Tao used to find arithmetic progressions in the primes, in combination
with a result on sums of subsets of the multiplicative subgroup of the integers
modulo $M$.
