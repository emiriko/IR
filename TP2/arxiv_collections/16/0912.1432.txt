We investigate the localized nonlinear matter waves of the quasi-two
dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates with spatially modulated nonlinearity in
harmonic potential. It is shown that the whole Bose-Einstein condensates,
similar to the linear harmonic oscillator, can have an arbitrary number of
localized nonlinear matter waves with discrete energies, which are
mathematically exact orthogonal solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
Their novel properties are determined by the principle quantum number n and
secondary quantum number l: the parity of the matter wave functions and the
corresponding energy levels depend only on n, and the numbers of density
packets for each quantum state depend on both n and l which describe the
topological properties of the atom packets. We also give an experimental
protocol to observe these novel phenomena in future experiments.
