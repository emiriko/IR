BiOCu_{1-y}S was recently reported to superconduct at T=5.8 K at y~0.15. Band
structure calculations indicate that stoichiometric BiOCuS is a band insulator.
In this paper, I show that hole-doped (whether in the virtual crystal
approximation or with actual Cu vacancies) BiOCuS is on the verge of a
ferromagnetic instability (cf. Pd metal), and therefore conventional
superconductivity with Tc~6 K is quite unlikely. Presumably, hole-doped BiOCuS
is another example of superconductivity mediated by spin-fluctuations
