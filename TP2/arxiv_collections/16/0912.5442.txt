Geminga is the second brightest persistent source in the GeV gamma-ray sky.
Discovered in 1975 by SAS-2 mission, it was identified as a pulsar only in the
90s, when ROSAT detected the 237 ms X-ray periodicity, that was later also
found by EGRET in gamma rays. Even though Geminga has been one of the most
intensively studied isolated neutron star during the last 30 years, its
interest remains intact especially at gamma-ray energies, where instruments
like the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi mission will provide an
unprecedented view of this pulsars. We will report on the preliminary results
obtained on the analysis of the first year of observations. We have been able
to do precise timing of Geminga using solely gamma rays, producing a timing
solution and allowing a deep study of the evolution of the light curve with
energy. We have also measured and studied the high-energy cutoff in the
phase-averaged spectrum and produced a detailed study of the spectral evolution
with phase.
