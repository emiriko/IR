Recent experiments aim at cooling nanomechanical resonators to the ground
state by coupling them to non-equilibrium environments in order to observe
quantum effects such as entanglement. This raises the general question of how
such environments affect entanglement. Here we show that there is an optimal
dissipation strength for which the entanglement between two coupled oscillators
is maximized. Our results are established with the help of a general framework
of exact quantum Langevin equations valid for arbitrary bath spectra, in and
out of equilibrium. We point out why the commonly employed Lindblad approach
fails to give even a qualitatively correct picture.
