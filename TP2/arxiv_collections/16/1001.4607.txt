The compound Ce2PdIn8 is a recently discovered novel member of the series
Ce(n)TIn(3n+2), where T = d-electron transition metal, and n = 1 or 2. So far,
only the phases with T = Co, Rh and Ir have been intensively studied for their
unconventional superconducting behaviors at low temperatures. By means of
magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements
we provide evidence that also Ce2PdIn8 has a superconducting ground state with
strong heavy-fermion character. The clean-limit superconductivity sets in at Tc
= 0.7 K at ambient pressure, likely at a verge of a quantum phase transition
that manifests itself in a form of distinct non-Fermi liquid features in the
bulk normal state characteristics.
