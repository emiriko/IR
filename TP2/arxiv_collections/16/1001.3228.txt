The carrier spin dynamics in a n-doped (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum well has been
studied by time-resolved Faraday rotation and ellipticity techniques in the
temperature range down to 430 milliKelvin. These techniques give data with very
different spectral dependencies, from which nonetheless consistent information
on the spin dynamics can be obtained, in agreement with theoretical
predictions. The mechanisms of long-lived spin coherence generation are
discussed for the cases of trion and exciton resonant excitation. We
demonstrate that carrier localization leads to a saturation of spin relaxation
times at 45 ns for electrons below 4.5 K and at 2 ns for holes below 2.3 K. The
underlying spin relaxation mechanisms are discussed.
