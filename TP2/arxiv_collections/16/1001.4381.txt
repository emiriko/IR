Streams are infinite sequences over a given data type. A stream specification
is a set of equations intended to define a stream. A core property is
productivity: unfolding the equations produces the intended stream in the
limit. In this paper we show that productivity is equivalent to termination
with respect to the balanced outermost strategy of a TRS obtained by adding an
additional rule. For specifications not involving branching symbols
balancedness is obtained for free, by which tools for proving outermost
termination can be used to prove productivity fully automatically.
