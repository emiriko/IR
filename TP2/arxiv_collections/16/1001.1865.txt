Recently, several new correlations between gamma ray burst (GRB) observables
have been discovered. Like previously well established correlations, they
challenge GRB models. Here we show that in the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs,
these newly discovered correlations have the same simple kinematic origin as
those discovered earlier. They all result from the strong dependence of the
observed radiations on the Lorentz and Doppler factors of the jet of highly
relativistic plasmoids (CBs) that produces the observed radiations by
interaction with the medium through which it propagates.
