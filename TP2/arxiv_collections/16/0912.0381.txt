In the present work a closed system of kinetic equations is obtained for the
description of the vacuum creation of an electron - positron plasma and
secondary photons due to a strong laser field. An estimate for the photon
energy distribution is obtained. In the Markovian approximation the photon
distribution has a 1/k spectrum (flicker noise).
