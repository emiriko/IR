We report on an implementation of a new method to calculate RPA strength
functions with iterative non-hermitian Arnoldi diagonalization method, which
does not explicitly calculate and store the RPA matrix. We discuss the
treatment of spurious modes, numerical stability, and how the method scales as
the used model space is enlarged. We perform the particle-hole RPA benchmark
calculations for double magic nucleus 132Sn and compare the resulting
electromagnetic strength functions against those obtained within the standard
RPA.
