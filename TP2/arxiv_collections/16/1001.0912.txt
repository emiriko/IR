This article continues the study of the category of harmonious field models
that was recently introduced as a kinetically non-linear generalisation of the
well known harmonic category of multiscalar fields over a supporting brane
wordsheet in a target space with a curved Riemannian metric. Like the perfectly
harmonious case of which a familiar example is provided by ordinary barotropic
perfect fluids, another important subcategory is the simply harmonious case,
for which it is shown that as well as ``wiggle'' modes of the underlying brane
world sheet, and sound type longitudinal modes, there will also be transverse
shake modes that propagate at the speed of light. Models of this type are shown
to arise from a non-Abelian generalisation of the Witten mechanism for
conducting string formation by ordinary scalar fields with a suitable quartic
self coupling term in the action.
