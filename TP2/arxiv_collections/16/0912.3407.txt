Recent progress in solid state quantum information processing has stimulated
the search for ultra-low-noise amplifiers and frequency converters in the
microwave frequency range, which could attain the ultimate limit imposed by
quantum mechanics. In this article, we report the first realization of an
intrinsically phase-preserving, non-degenerate superconducting parametric
amplifier, a so far missing component. It is based on the Josephson ring
modulator, which consists of four junctions in a Wheatstone bridge
configuration. The device symmetry greatly enhances the purity of the
amplification process and simplifies both its operation and analysis. The
measured characteristics of the amplifier in terms of gain and bandwidth are in
good agreement with analytical predictions. Using a newly developed noise
source, we also show that our device operates within a factor of three of the
quantum limit. This development opens new applications in the area of quantum
analog signal processing.
