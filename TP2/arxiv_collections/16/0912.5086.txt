The data collected during the 2006 total solar eclipse are analyzed in the
search for signals produced by a hypothetical radiative decay of massive
neutrinos. In the absence of the expected light pattern, we set lower limits
for the massive neutrino components proper lifetime. The reached sensitivity
indicates thet these are the best limits obtainable with this method.
