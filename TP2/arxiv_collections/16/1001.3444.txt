The quark-gluon properties of the nucleon are probed by a host of recent and
planned experiments. These involve elastic, deep-inelastic, semi-inclusive
deep-inelastic (SIDIS), and deeply-virtual Compton scattering. A light-front
description is naturally applied to interpret all of these processes. The
advantages of this approach will be discussed The talk will then focus on the
transverse charge and magnetization densities of the nucleons and the use of
SIDIS to reveal the non-spherical shape of the nucleon. We find that the
central charge density of the neutron is negative, that the magnetization
density of the proton extends further in space than the charge distribution,
and that the shape of the nucleon, as measured by the spin-dependent density,
is not spherical.
