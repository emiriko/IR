Tunneling spectroscopy at surfaces of unconventional superconductors has
proven an invaluable tool for obtaining information about the pairing symmetry.
It is known that mid gap Andreev bound states manifest itself as a zero bias
conductance peak in tunneling spectroscopy. The zero bias conductance peak is a
signature for a non-trivial pair potential that exhibits different signs on
different regions of the Fermi surface. Here, we review recent theoretical
results on the spectrum of Andreev bound states near interfaces and surfaces in
non-centrosymmetric superconductors. We introduce a theoretical scheme to
calculate the energy spectrum of a non-centrosymmetric superconductor. Then, we
discuss the interplay between the spin orbit vector field on the Fermi surface
and the order parameter symmetry. The Andreev states carry a spin supercurrent
and represent a helical edge mode along the interface. We study the topological
nature of the resulting edge currents. If the triplet component of the order
parameter dominates, then the helical edge mode exists. If, on the other hand,
the singlet component dominates, the helical edge mode is absent. A quantum
phase transition occurs for equal spin singlet and triplet order parameter
components. We discuss the tunneling conductance and the Andreev point contact
conductance between a normal metal and a non-centrosymmetric superconductor.
