We report the first three-particle coincidence measurement in pseudorapidity
($\Delta\eta$) between a high transverse momentum ($p_{\perp}$) trigger
particle and two lower $p_{\perp}$ associated particles within azimuth
$\mid$$\Delta\phi$$\mid$$<$0.7 in $\sqrt{{\it s}_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV $d$+Au and
Au+Au collisions. Charge ordering properties are exploited to separate the
jet-like component and the ridge (long-range $\Delta\eta$ correlation). The
results indicate that the particles from the ridge are uncorrelated in
$\Delta\eta$ not only with the trigger particle but also between themselves
event-by-event. In addition, the production of the ridge appears to be
uncorrelated to the presence of the narrow jet-like component.
