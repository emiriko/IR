We solve the coupled system of Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations
for the quark propagator and the pion Bethe-Salpeter amplitude on a finite
volume. To this end we use a truncation scheme that includes pion cloud effects
in the quark propagator and light mesons. We study volume effects in the quark
condensate, the pion mass and the pion decay constant and compare to
corresponding results in other approaches. In general we find large effects for
volumes below V=(1.8 fm)^4.
