In above mentioned article [1] assumptions of possible systematic errors of
our experiment on measuring of the neutron lifetime [2] have been made. In the
given comment we are obliged to explain, that assumptions made in [1] are
erroneous. They are caused by an inattentive reading of our work [2] and by the
improper understanding the methods used in our work [2]. Simulation of
experiment [2] carried out in [1] seems to be imperfect and doesn't describe
the experimental results. Therefore it is impossible to do any conclusions from
such simulation.
