We study dynamic heterogeneities in a model glass-former whose overlap with a
reference configuration is constrained to a fixed value. The system
phase-separates into regions of small and large overlap, so that dynamical
correlations remain strong even for asymptotic times. We calculate an
appropriate thermodynamic potential and find evidence of a Maxwell's
construction consistent with a spinodal decomposition of two phases. Our
results suggest that dynamic heterogeneities are the expression of an ephemeral
phase-separating regime ruled by a finite surface tension.
