In this note, we calculate the electronic properties of a realistic atomistic
model of amorphous graphene. The model contains odd membered rings,
particularly five and seven membered rings and no coordination defects. We show
that odd-membered rings increase the electronic density of states at the Fermi
level relative to crystalline graphene; a honeycomb lattice with semi-metallic
character. Some graphene samples contain amorphous regions, which even at small
concentrations, may strongly affect many of the exotic properties of
crystalline graphene, which arise because of the linear dispersion and
semi-metallic character of perfectly crystalline graphene. Estimates are given
for the density of states at the Fermi level using a tight-binding model for
the $\pi$ states.
