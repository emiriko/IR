The radial part of the Klein-Gordon equation for the Woods-Saxon potential is
solved. In our calculations, we have applied the Nikiforov-Uvarov method by
using the Pekeris approximation to the centrifugal potential for any $l$
states. The exact bound state energy eigenvalues and the corresponding
eigenfunctions are obtained on the various values of the quantum numbers $n$
and $l$. The non-relativistic limit of the bound state energy spectrum was also
found.
