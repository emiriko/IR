We investigate the performance of rateless codes for single-server streaming
to diverse users, assuming that diversity in users is present not only because
they have different channel conditions, but also because they demand different
amounts of information and have different decoding capabilities. The LT
encoding scheme is employed. While some users accept output symbols of all
degrees and decode using belief propagation, others only collect degree- 1
output symbols and run no decoding algorithm. We propose several performance
measures, and optimize the performance of the rateless code used at the server
through the design of the code degree distribution. Optimization problems are
formulated for the asymptotic regime and solved as linear programming problems.
Optimized performance shows great improvement in total bandwidth consumption
over using the conventional ideal soliton distribution, or simply sending
separately encoded streams to different types of user nodes. Simulation
experiments confirm the usability of the optimization results obtained for the
asymptotic regime as a guideline for finite-length code design.
