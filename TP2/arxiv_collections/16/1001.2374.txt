The liquid-gas phase transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter is
investigated within relativistic mean-field model using the density dependence
of nuclear symmetry energy constrained from the measured neutron skin thickness
of finite nuclei. We find symmetry energy has a significant influence on
several features of liquid-gas phase transition. The boundary and area of the
liquid-gas coexistence region, the maximal isospin asymmetry and the critical
values of pressure and isospin asymmetry all of which systematically increase
with increasing softness in the density dependence of symmetry energy. The
critical temperature below which the liquid-gas mixed phase exists is found
higher for a softer symmetry energy.
