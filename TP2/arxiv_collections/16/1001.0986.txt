Classical and quantum interference of light propagating in arrays of coupled
waveguides and undergoing multiband optical Bloch oscillations (BOs) with
negligible Zener tunneling is theoretically investigated. In particular, it is
shown that Mach-Zehnder-like interference effects spontaneously arise in
multiband BOs owing to beam splitting and subsequent beam recombination
occurring in one BO cycle. As a noteworthy example of quantum interference, we
discuss the doubling of interference fringes in photon counting rates for a
correlated photon pair undergoing two-band BOs, a phenomenon analogous to the
manifestation of the de Broglie wavelength of an entangled biphoton state
observed in quantum Mach-Zehnder interferometry.
