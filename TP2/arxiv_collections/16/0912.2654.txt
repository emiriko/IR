Most applications of superconductors, such as power transmission lines,
motors, generators, and transformers, require long cables through which large
currents circulate. Impressive progress has recently been achieved in the
current-carrying capability in conductors based on high-temperature
superconductors. Coated conductors are likely the best examples, consisting of
very good quality thin layers of YBCO superconductor grown on top of a metallic
tape with some intermediate layers. However, there is an important problem for
achieving large currents: a large decrease in transport critical-current
density Jc when increasing film thickness has been observed in coated
conductors made by all available techniques. Here, we theoretically explain the
nature and the ubiquitous presence of this so-called thickness effect by
analyzing the self-field created by the transport currents in the
superconductor, assuming a realistic field-dependent Jc. This knowledge can
help finding new ways to improve transport current in thick superconducting
films.
