We study Archimedean atomic lattice effect algebras whose set of sharp
elements is a complete lattice. We show properties of centers, compatibility
centers and central atoms of such lattice effect algebras. Moreover, we prove
that if such effect algebra $E$ is separable and modular then there exists a
faithful state on $E$. Further, if an atomic lattice effect algebra is densely
embeddable into a complete lattice effect algebra $\widehat{E}$ and the
compatiblity center of $E$ is not a Boolean algebra then there exists an
$(o)$-continuous subadditive state on $E$.
