The black hole X-ray transient, XTE J1118+480, has now twice been observed in
outburst - 2000 and 2005 - and on both occasions remained in the low/hard X-ray
spectral state. Here we present radio, infrared, optical, soft X-ray and hard
X-ray observations of the more recent outburst. We find that the lightcurves
have very different morphologies compared with the 2000 event and the optical
decay is delayed relative to the X-ray/radio. We attribute this lesser degree
of correlation to contributions of emission from multiple components, in
particular the jet and accretion disc. Whereas the jet seemed to dominate the
broadband spectrum in 2000, in 2005 the accretion disc seems to be more
prominent and we use an analysis of the lightcurves and spectra to distinguish
between the jet and disc emission. There also appears to be an optically thin
component to the radio emission in the 2005 data, possibly associated with
multiple ejection events and decaying as the outburst proceeds. These results
add to the discussion that the term "low/hard state'" covers a wider range of
properties than previously thought, if it is to account for XTE J1118+480
during these two outbursts.
