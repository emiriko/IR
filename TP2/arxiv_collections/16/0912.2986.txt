The boundary of the convex hull of a compact algebraic curve in real 3-space
defines a real algebraic surface. For general curves, that boundary surface is
reducible, consisting of tritangent planes and a scroll of stationary
bisecants. We express the degree of this surface in terms of the degree, genus
and singularities of the curve. We present algorithms for computing their
defining polynomials, and we exhibit a wide range of examples.
