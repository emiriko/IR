We solve the dilaton field equation in the background of a spherically
symmetric black hole in bosonic or heterotic string theory with
curvature-squared corrections in arbitrary d spacetime dimensions. We then
apply this result to obtain a spherically symmetric black hole solution with
dilatonic charge and curvature-squared corrections in bosonic or heterotic
string theory compactified on a torus. For this black hole we obtain its free
energy, entropy, temperature, specific heat and mass.
