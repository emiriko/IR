The paper offers the full action for an electromagnetic field with electrical
and magnetic charges; Feynman laws are formulated for the calculation of the
interaction cross-sections for electrically and magnetically charged particles
on the base of offered action within relativistic quantum field theory. Derived
with formulated Feynman rules cross-section of the interaction between an
elementary particle with magnetic charge and an elementary particle with
electrical charge proves to be equal zero.
