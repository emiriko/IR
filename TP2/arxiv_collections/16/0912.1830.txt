This paper proposes a method of gesture recognition with a focus on important
actions for distinguishing similar gestures. The method generates a partial
action sequence by using optical flow images, expresses the sequence in the
eigenspace, and checks the feature vector sequence by applying an optimum
path-searching method of weighted graph to focus the important actions. Also
presented are the results of an experiment on the recognition of similar sign
language words.
