Extending previous papers of Coleman-Fabrizio-Owen [1], [2] and Oncu-Moodie
[3], we give a derivation of the thermodynamic restrictions on the constitutive
relations of an electrically polarizable and finitely deformable heat
conducting elastic continuum, interacting with the electric field. The
constitutive equations include an evolution equation for the heat flux; the
latter and the temperature obey a frame-invariant form of Cattaneo's equation.
