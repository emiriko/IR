We propose a new class of materials, which can be viewed as graphene
derivatives involving Group IA or Group VIIA elements, forming what we refer to
as graphXene. We show that in several cases large band gaps can be found to
open up, whereas in other cases a semimetallic behavior is found. Formation
energies indicate that under ambient conditions, sp$^3$ and mixed sp$^2$/sp$^3$
systems will form. The results presented allow us to propose that by careful
tuning of the relative concentration of the adsorbed atoms, it should be
possible to tune the band gap of graphXene to take any value between 0 and 6.4
eV.
