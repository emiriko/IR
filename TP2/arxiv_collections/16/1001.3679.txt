We present tracial analogs of the classical results of Curto and Fialkow on
moment matrices. A sequence of real numbers indexed by words in non-commuting
variables with values invariant under cyclic permutations of the indexes, is
called a tracial sequence. We prove that such a sequence can be represented
with tracial moments of matrices if its corresponding moment matrix is positive
semidefinite and of finite rank. A truncated tracial sequence allows for such a
representation if and only if one of its extensions admits a flat extension.
Finally, we apply the theory via duality to investigate trace-positive
polynomials in non-commuting variables.
