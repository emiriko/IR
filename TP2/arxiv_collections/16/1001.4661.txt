70 GHz radiometer front-end and back-end modules for the Low Frequency
Instrument of the European Space Agencys Planck Mission were built and tested.
The operating principles and the design details of the mechanical structures
are described along with the key InP MMIC low noise amplifiers and phase
switches of the units. The units were tested in specially designed cryogenic
vacuum chambers capable of producing the operating conditions required for
Planck radiometers, specifically, a physical temperature of 20 K for the
front-end modules, 300 K for the back-end modules and 4 K for the reference
signal sources. Test results of the low noise amplifiers and phase switches,
the front and back-end modules, and the combined results of both modules are
discussed.
  At 70 GHz frequency, the system noise temperature of the front and back end
is 28 K; the effective bandwidth 16 GHz, and the 1/f spectrum knee frequency is
38 mHz. The test results indicate state-of-the-art performance at 70 GHz
frequency and fulfil the Planck performance requirements.
