The discovery of the interstellar medium and the early work of Lyman Spitzer,
Jr. are reviewed here in the context of the remarkable observation in the early
1950's that star formation continues in the present age. Prior to this
observation, stars were thought to have formed only at the beginning of the
universe. The main debate in the 1930's was whether stars had the young age of
~3 Gyr suggested by the expansion of the universe and the meteorites, or the
old age of 10^{13} yr suggested by thermalized stellar motions. The adoption of
Ambartsumian's claim of modern-day star formation was slow and mixed in the
early 1950's. While some astronomers like Adriaan Blaauw immediately followed,
adding more from their own data, others were slow to change. By the end of the
1950's, Lyman had deduced the basic theory for star formation that we would
recognize today.
