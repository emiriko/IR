We demonstrate magnetomotive drive and detection of doubly clamped string
resonators in water. A compact 1.9 T permanent magnet is used to detect the
fundamental and higher flexural modes of $\mathrm{200 \mu m}$ long resonators.
Good agreement is found between the magnetomotive measurements and optical
measurements performed on the same resonator. The magnetomotive detection
scheme can be used to simultaneously drive and detect multiple sensors or
scanning probes in viscous fluids without alignment of detector beams.
