Taking into account the experimental results of the HiRes and AUGER
collaborations, the present status of bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation
(LSV) patterns is discussed. Although significant constraints will emerge, a
wide range of models and values of parameters will still be left open.
Cosmological implications of allowed LSV patterns are discussed focusing on the
origin of our Universe, the cosmological constant, dark matter and dark energy.
Superbradyons (superluminal preons) may be the actual constituents of vacuum
and of standard particles, and form equally a cosmological sea leading to new
forms of dark matter and dark energy.
