We report superconductivity in single crystals of the new iron-pnictide
system BaFe1.9Pt0.1As2 grown by a self-flux solution method and characterized
via x-ray, transport, magnetic and thermodynamic measurements. The magnetic
ordering associated with a structural transition at 140 K present in BaFe2As2
is completely suppressed by substitution of 5% Fe with Pt and superconductivity
is induced at a critical temperature Tc=23 K. Full diamagnetic screening in the
magnetic susceptibility and a jump in the specific heat at Tc confirm the bulk
nature of the superconducting phase. All properties of the superconducting
state including transition temperature Tc, the lower critical field Hc1=200 mT,
upper critical field Hc2~65 T, and the slope dHc2/dT are comparable in value to
the those found in other transition-metal-substituted BaFe2As2 series,
indicating the robust nature of superconductivity induced by substitution of
Group VIII elements.
