Bit Plane Complexity Segmentation (BPCS) digital picture steganography is a
technique to hide data inside an image file. BPCS achieves high embedding rates
with low distortion based on the theory that noise-like regions in an image's
bit-planes can be replaced with noise-like secret data without significant loss
in image quality. . In this framework we will propose a collaborate approach
for select frame for Hiding Data within MPEG Video Using Bit Plane Complexity
Segmentation. This approach will invent high secure data hidden using select
frame form MPEG Video and furthermore we will assign the well-built of the
approach; during this review the author will answer the question why they used
select frame steganography. In additional to the security issues we will use
the digital video as a cover to the data hidden. The reason behind opt the
video cover in this approach is the huge amount of single frames image per sec
which in turn overcome the problem of the data hiding quantity, as the
experiment result shows the success of the hidden data within select frame,
extract data from the frames sequence. These function without affecting the
quality of the video.
