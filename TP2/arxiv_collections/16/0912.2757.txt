HH objects are characterized by a complex knotty morphology detected mainly
along the axis of protostellar jets in a wide range of bands. Evidence of
interactions between knots formed in different epochs have been found,
suggesting that jets may result from the ejection of plasma blobs from the
source. We aim at investigating the physical mechanism leading to the irregular
knotty structure observed in jets in different bands and the complex
interactions occurring among blobs of plasma ejected from the stellar source.
We perform 2D axisymmetric HD simulations of a randomly ejected pulsed jet. The
jet consists of a train of blobs which ram with supersonic speed into the
ambient medium. The initial random velocity of each blob follows an exponential
distribution. We explore the ejection rate parameter to derive constraints on
the physical properties of protostellar jets by comparison of model results
with observations. Our model takes into account radiative losses and thermal
conduction. We find that the mutual interactions of blobs ejected at different
epochs and with different speed lead to a variety of plasma components not
described by current models. The main features characterizing the random pulsed
jet scenario are: single high speed knots, showing a measurable proper motion
in nice agreement with observations; irregular chains of knots aligned along
the jet axis and possibly interacting with each other; reverse shocks
interacting with outgoing knots; oblique shocks produced by the reflection of
shocks at the jet cocoon. All these structures concur to determine the
morphology of the jet in different bands. We also find that the thermal
conduction plays a crucial role in damping out HD instabilities that would
develop within the cocoon and that contribute to the jet breaking.
