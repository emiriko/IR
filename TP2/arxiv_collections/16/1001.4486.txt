The scalar meson f_0(1370) - indicated in particular in the low energy p\bar
p \to 3 body reactions - is a crucial element in certain schemes of the scalar
meson spectroscopy including glueballs. The most definitive results can be
obtained from elastic and inelastic pi pi phase shift analyses using the
constraints from unitarity where the discrete ambiguities can be identified and
resolved. We reconsider the phase shift analyses for pi^+ pi^- \to pi+ \pi-,
pi^0 pi^0, K \bar K, eta eta. While a clear resonance signal for f_0(1500) in
the resp. Argand diagrams is seen in all channels above a large ``background''
from f_0(600) there is no clear signal of a second resonance ``f_0(1370)'' in
this mass range in any reaction, at the level of \sim 10% branching ratio into
pi-pi.
