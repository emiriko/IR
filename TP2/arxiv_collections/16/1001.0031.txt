Exact analytic expressions for planetary orbits and light trajectories in the
Schwarzschild geometry are presented. A new parameter space is used to
characterize all possible planetary orbits. Different regions in this parameter
space can be associated with different characteristics of the orbits. The
boundaries for these regions are clearly defined. Observational data can be
directly associated with points in the regions. A possible extension of these
considerations with an additional parameter for the case of Kerr geometry is
briefly discussed.
