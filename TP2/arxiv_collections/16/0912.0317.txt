We perform a non-radial adiabatic perturbation analysis on homologous
conventional polytropic stellar core collapses. The core collapse features a
polytropic exponent $\Gamma=4/3$ relativistic gas under self-gravity of
spherical symmetry while three-dimensional perturbations involve an adiabatic
exponent $\gamma$ with $\gamma\neq\Gamma$ such that the Brunt-V$\ddot{\rm
a}$is$\ddot{\rm a}$l$\ddot{\rm a}$ buoyancy frequency ${\cal N}$ does not
vanish. With proper boundary conditions, we derive eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions for different modes of oscillations. In reference to stellar
oscillations and earlier results, we examine behaviours of different modes and
the criterion for instabilities. The acoustic p$-$modes and surface f$-$modes
remain stable. For $\gamma<\Gamma$, convective instabilities appear as unstable
internal gravity g$^{-}-$modes. For $\gamma>\Gamma$, sufficiently low-order
internal gravity g$^{+}-$modes are stable, whereas sufficiently high-order
g$^{+}-$modes, which would have been stable in a static star, become unstable
during self-similar core collapses. For supernova explosions, physical
consequences of such inevitable g$-$mode instabilities are speculated.
