We present a non-parametric measure of the ellipticity and the alignment of
the dark matter halos in Abell 901/902 supercluster. This super-cluster is a
system of four separate peaks in a $0.5^{\circ}\times0.5^{\circ}$ field of
view. We map the mass distribution of each individual peak using an improved
version of Particle Based Lensing (PBL) and measure the ellipticity of the dark
matter halos associated with two of the peaks directly from the mass map and by
fitting them to a singular isothermal ellipse. The parametric and
non-parametric measurements are consistent for A901b while the position angle
for the Southwest Group is different for the two techniques. We account for
this discrepancy to substructure present in the Southwest Peak. We estimate an
axis ratio of $0.37\pm 0.1$ for A901b and $0.54^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ for the
Southwest Group.
