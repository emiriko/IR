he observed well-known resonances $\Sigma^0$ $\Sigma^{*+}$(1385) and
$K^{*\pm}$(892) from PDG are good tests of this method. Exotic strange
multibaryon states have been observed in the effective mass spectra of:
$\Lambda \pi^{\pm}$,$\Lambda \gamma$, $\Lambda p$, $\Lambda p p$ subsystems.
The mean value of mass for $\Sigma^{*-}(1385)$ resonance is shifted till mass
of 1370 MeV/$c^2$ and width is two times larger than the same value from PDG.
Such kind of behavior for width and invariant mass of $\Sigma^{*-}(1385)$
resonance is interpreted as extensive contribution from stopped
$\Xi^-\to\Lambda\pi^-$ and medium effect with invariant mass. The mean value of
mass for $\Sigma^{*+}(1385)$ from secondary interactions is also shifted till
mass of 1370 MeV/$c^2$. The width of $\Sigma^0$ is $\approx$ 2 times larger
than the experimental error. There are enhancement production for all observed
hyperons.
