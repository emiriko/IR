The calibration and performance of the Silicon Drift Detector of the ALICE
experiment during the 2008 cosmic ray run will be presented. In particular the
procedures to monitor the running parameters (baselines, noise, drift speed)
are detailed. Other relevant parameters (SOP delay, time-zero, charge
calibration) were also determined.
