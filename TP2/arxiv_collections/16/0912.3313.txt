We calculate the two-qubit disentanglement due to classical random telegraph
noise using the quasi-Hamiltonian method. This allows us to obtain analytical
results even for strong coupling and mixed noise, important when the qubits
have tunable working point. We determine when entanglement sudden death and
revival occur as functions of qubit working point, noise coupling strength and
initial state entanglement. For extended Werner states, we show that the
concurrence is related to the difference of two functions: one is related to
dephasing and the other longitudinal relaxation. A physical intepretation based
on the generalized Bloch vector is given: revival only occurs for
strongly-coupled noise and comes from the angular motion of the vector.
