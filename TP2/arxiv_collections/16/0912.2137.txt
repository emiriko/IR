We obtain the topological expansion of the hermitian matrix model using its
representation as a CFT on a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. To each branch
point of the Riemann surface we associate an operator which represents a twist
field dressed by the modes of the twisted boson. The partition function of the
matrix model is computed as a correlation function of such dressed twist
fields. The perturbative construction of the dressing operators yields a set of
Feynman rules for evaluating the free energy and the loop observables at any
genus.
