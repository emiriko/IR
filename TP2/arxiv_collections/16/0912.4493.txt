We study the collisional processes that can lead to thermalization in
one-dimensional systems. For two body collisions excitations of transverse
modes are the prerequisite for energy exchange and thermalzation. At very low
temperatures excitations of transverse modes are exponentially suppressed,
thermalization by two body collisions stops and the system should become
integrable. In quantum mechanics virtual excitations of higher radial modes are
possible. These virtually excited radial modes give rise to effective
three-body velocity-changing collisions which lead to thermalization. We show
that these three-body elastic interactions are suppressed by pairwise quantum
correlations when approaching the strongly correlated regime. If the relative
momentum $k$ is small compared to the two-body coupling constant $c$ the
three-particle scattering state is suppressed by a factor of $(k/c)^{12}$,
which is proportional to $\gamma ^{12}$, that is to the square of the
three-body correlation function at zero distance in the limit of the
Lieb-Liniger parameter $\gamma \gg 1$. This demonstrates that in one
dimensional quantum systems it is not the freeze-out of two body collisions but
the strong quantum correlations which ensures absence of thermalization on
experimentally relevant time scales.
