First, we survey some results on classical and quantum dynamical systems
associated with transverse Dirac operators on Riemannian foliations. Then we
illustrate these results by two examples of Riemannian foliations: a foliation
given by the fibers of a fibration and a linear foliation on the
two-dimensional torus.
