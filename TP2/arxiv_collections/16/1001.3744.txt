Admission control is a key component in multimedia servers, which will allow
the resources to be used by the client only when they are available. A problem
faced by numerous content serving machines is overload, when there are too many
clients who need to be served, the server tends to slow down. An admission
control algorithm for a multimedia server is responsible for determining if a
new request can be accepted without violating the QoS requirements of the
existing requests in the system. By caching and streaming only the data in the
interval between two successive requests on the same object, the following
request can be serviced directly from the buffer cache without disk operations
and within the deadline of the request. An admission control strategy based on
Popularity-aware interval caching for Prefix [3] scheme extends the interval
caching by considering different popularity of multimedia objects. The method
of Prefix caching with multicast transmission of popular objects utilizes the
hard disk and network bandwidth efficiently and increases the number of
requests being served.
