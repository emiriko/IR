The competitive advantages in a knowledge-based economy can no longer be
attributed to single nodes in the network. Political economies are increasingly
reshaped by knowledge-based developments that upset market equilibria and
institutional arrangements. The network coordinates the subdynamics of (i)
wealth production, (ii) organized novelty production, and (iii) private
appropriation versus public control. The interaction terms generate a complex
dynamics which cannot be expected to contain central coordination. However, the
knowledge infrastructure of systems of innovations can be measured, for
example, in terms of university-industry-government relations. The mutual
information in these three dimensions indicates the globalization of the
knowledge base. Patent statistics and data from the Internet are compared in
terms of this indicator.
