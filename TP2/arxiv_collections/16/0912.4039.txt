A model of induced gravity with a Higgs potential is investigated in detail
in view of the pressure components related to the scalar-field excitations. The
physical consequences emerging as an artifact due to the presence of these
pressure terms are analysed in terms of the constraints parting from energy
density, solar-relativistic effects and galactic dynamics along with the dark
matter halos.
