We update the constraints on the minimal model of dark matter, where a stable
real scalar field is added to the standard model Lagrangian with a
renormalizable coupling to the Higgs field. Once we fix the dark matter
abundance, there are only two relevant model parameters, the mass of the scalar
field and that of the Higgs boson. The recent data from the CDMS II experiment
have excluded a parameter region where the scalar field is light such as less
than about 50 GeV. In a large parameter region, the consistency of the model
can be tested by the combination of future direct detection experiments and the
LHC experiments.
