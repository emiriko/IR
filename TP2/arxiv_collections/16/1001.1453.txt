We present a novel readout scheme for phase qubits which eliminates the
read-out SQUID so that the entire qubit and measurement circuitry only requires
a single Josephson junction. Our scheme capacitively couples the phase qubit
directly to a transmission line and detects its state after the measurement
pulse by determining a frequency shift observable in the forward scattering
parameter of the readout microwaves. This readout is extendable to multiple
phase qubits coupled to a common readout line and can in principle be used for
other flux biased qubits having two quasi-stable readout configurations.
