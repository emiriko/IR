The Nuchal Translucency thickness measurement is made to identify the Down
Syndrome in screening first trimester fetus and presented in this paper. The
mean shift analysis and canny operators are utilized for segmenting the nuchal
translucency region and the exact thickness has been estimated using Blob
analysis. It is observed from the results that the fetus in the 14th week of
Gestation is expected to have a nuchal translucency thickness of 1.87 plus or
minus 0.25mm.
