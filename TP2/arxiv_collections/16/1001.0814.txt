We have conducted a detailed microscopic investigation of [LaNiO3(1
u.c.)/LaAlO3(1 u.c.)]N superlattices grown on (001) SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 to
explore the influence of polar mismatch on the resulting electronic and
structural properties. Our data demonstrate that the initial growth on the
non-polar SrTiO3 surface leads to a rough morphology and unusual 2+ valence of
Ni in the first LaNiO3 layer, which is not observed after growth on the polar
surface of LaAlO3. A newly devised model suggests that the polar mismatch can
be resolved if the perovskite layers grow with an excess of LaO, which also
accounts for the observed electronic, chemical, and structural effects.
