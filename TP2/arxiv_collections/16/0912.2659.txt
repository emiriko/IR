We investigate the AdS/QCD duality for the two-point correlation functions of
the lowest dimension scalar meson and scalar glueball operators, in the case of
the Soft Wall holographic model of QCD. Masses and decay constants as well as
gluon condensates are compared to their QCD estimates. In particular, the role
of the boundary conditions for the bulk-to-boundary propagators is emphasized.
