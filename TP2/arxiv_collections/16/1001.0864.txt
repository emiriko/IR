In this paper we shall discuss the backreaction of a massive quantum scalar
field on the curvature, the latter treated as a classical field. Furthermore,
we shall deal with this problem in the realm of cosmological spacetimes by
analyzing the Einstein equations in a semiclassical fashion. More precisely, we
shall show that, at least on small intervals of time, solutions for this
interacting system exist. This result will be achieved providing an iteration
scheme and showing that the series, obtained starting from the massless
solution, converges in the appropriate Banach space. The quantum states with
good ultraviolet behavior (Hadamard property), used in order to obtain the
backreaction, will be completely determined by their form on the initial
surface if chosen to be lightlike. Furthermore, on small intervals of time,
they do not influence the behavior of the exact solution. On large intervals of
time the situation is more complicated but, if the spacetime is expanding, we
shall show that the end-point of the evolution does not depend strongly on the
quantum state, because, in this limit, the expectation values of the matter
fields responsible for the backreaction do not depend on the particular
homogeneous Hadamard state at all. Finally, we shall comment on the
interpretation of the semiclassical Einstein equations for this kind of
problems. Although the fluctuations of the expectation values of pointlike
fields diverge, if the spacetime and the quantum state have a large spatial
symmetry and if we consider the smeared fields on regions of large spatial
volume, they tend to vanish. Assuming this point of view the semiclassical
Einstein equations become more reliable.
