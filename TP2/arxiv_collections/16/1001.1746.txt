In this letter we show how to perform a systematic perturbative approach for
the mode-coupling theory. The results coincide with those obtained via the
replica approach. The upper critical dimension turns out to be always 8 and the
correlations have a double pole in momentum space in perturbations theory.
Non-perturbative effects are found to be very important. We suggest a possible
framework to compute these effects.
