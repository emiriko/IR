In the present work an attempt has been made to study the dynamics of a
diatomic molecule N2 in water. The proposed model consists of Langevin
stochastic differential equation whose solution is obtained through Euler's
method. The proposed work has been concluded by studying the behavior of
statistical parameters like variance in position, variance in velocity and
covariance between position and velocity. This model incorporates the important
parameters like acceleration, intermolecular force, frictional force and random
force.
