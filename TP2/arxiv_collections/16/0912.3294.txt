Topological superconductors have been theoretically predicted as a new class
of time-reversal-invariant superconductors which are fully gapped in the bulk
but have protected gapless surface Andreev bound states. In this work, we
provide a simple criterion that directly identifies this topological phase in
\textit{odd-parity} superconductors. We next propose a two-orbital $U-V$
pairing model for the newly discovered superconductor Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$%. Due
to its peculiar three-dimensional Dirac band structure, we find that an
inter-orbital triplet pairing with odd-parity is favored in a significant part
of the phase diagram, and therefore gives rise to a topological superconductor
phase. Finally we propose sharp experimental tests of such a pairing symmetry.
