Laboratory based courses play a critical role in scientific education.
Automation is changing the nature of the laboratories, and there is a long
running debate about the value of hands on versus simulated and remote
laboratories. The remote lab technology has brought a significant improvement
in communication within the Academic community and has improved students
learning experiences. There are different educational objectives as criteria
for judging the laboratories: Hands on advocates emphasize design skills, while
remote lab advocates focus on conceptual understanding. Remote laboratories
offer all the advantages of the new technology, but are often a poor
replacement for real laboratory work. Remote laboratories are similar to
simulation techniques in that they require minimal space and time, because the
experiments can be rapidly configured and run over the Internet [Web]. But
unlike simulations, they provide real data. This paper presents a comparative
analysis for the educational objectives of the three laboratory techniques,
hands on, simulated, and remote laboratories. In addition, it proposes
enhancements for the remote lab activities leading to improving its
performance.
