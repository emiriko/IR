If Supersymmetry would manifest itself at a low mass scale it might be found
already in the early phase of the LHC operation. Generic signatures for
Supersymmetry in pp-collisions consist of high jet multiplicity, large missing
transverse energy as well as leptons in the final state. The CMS search
strategy and prospects for a SUSY discovery in the first year of data-taking is
reviewed.
