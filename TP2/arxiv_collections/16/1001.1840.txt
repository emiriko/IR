Strategies that utilise the interference effects within B -> DK decays hold
great potential for improving our sensitivity to the CKM angle gamma. However,
in order to exploit fully this potential, knowledge of parameters associated
with the D decay, such as strong-phase differences, are required. This
essential information can be obtained from the unique quantum-correlated
psi(3770) datasets at CLEO-c. Results of such analyses involving the decay
modes D -> Kpi, Kpipi^0, Kpipipi and K^0_Spipi will be presented.
