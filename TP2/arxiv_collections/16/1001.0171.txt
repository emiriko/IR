The structural and electronic properties of oxidized graphene are
investigated on the basis of the genetic algorithm and density functional
theory calculations. We find two new low energy semiconducting phases of the
fully oxidized graphene (C1O). In one phase, there is parallel epoxy pair
chains running along the zigzag direction. In contrast, the ground state phase
with a slightly lower energy and a much larger band gap contains epoxy groups
in three different ways: normal epoxy, unzipped epoxy, and epoxy pair. For
partially oxidized graphene, a phase separation between bare graphene and fully
oxidized graphene is predicted.
