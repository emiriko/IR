In this work a class of massive scalar field theories with self-interactions
described by a general potential is studied. Under the sole condition that the
potential admits the Fourier representation, it is shown that such theories may
be mapped into a standard field theory, in which the interaction of the new
fields is a polynomial of fourth degree. With some restrictions, this mapping
allows the perturbative treatment of models that are otherwise intractable with
standard field theoretical methods.
  A nonperturbative approach to these theories is attempted. The original
scalar field is integrated out exactly at the price of introducing auxiliary
vector fields. The latter are treated in a mean field theory approximation. The
singularities that arise after the elimination of the auxiliary fields are
cured using the dimensional regularization. The expression of the counterterms
to be subtracted is computed.
