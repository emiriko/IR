We report the detection of the radio and infrared counterparts of the ring
nebula around the WN3(h) star HD211564 (WR152), located to the southwest of the
HII region Sh2132. Using radio continuum data from the Canadian Galactic Plane
Survey, we identified the radio counterparts of the two concentric rings, of
about 9' and 16' in radius, related to the star. After applying a filling
factor f = 0.05-0.12, electron densities and ionized masses are in the range
10-16 cm^-3 and 450-700 Mo, respectively. The analysis of the HI gas emission
distribution allowed the identification of 5900 Mo of neutral atomic gas with
velocities between -52 and -43 km/s probably linked to the nebula. The region
of the nebula is almost free of molecular gas. Only four small clumps were
detected, with a total molecular mass of 790 Mo. About 310 Mo are related to a
small infrared shell-like source linked to the inner ring, which is also
detected in the MSX band A. An IRAS YSO candidate is detected in coincidence
with the shell-like IR source.
  We suggest that the optical nebula and its neutral counterparts originated
from the stellar winds from the WR star and its massive progenitor, and are
evolving in the envelope of a slowly expanding shell centered at (l,b) = (102
30, -0 50), of about 31 pc in radius. The bubble's energy conversion efficiency
is in agreement with recent numerical analysis and with observational results.
