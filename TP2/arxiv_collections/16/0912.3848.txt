We propose a novel method for constructing wavelet transforms of functions
defined on the vertices of an arbitrary finite weighted graph. Our approach is
based on defining scaling using the the graph analogue of the Fourier domain,
namely the spectral decomposition of the discrete graph Laplacian $\L$. Given a
wavelet generating kernel $g$ and a scale parameter $t$, we define the scaled
wavelet operator $T_g^t = g(t\L)$. The spectral graph wavelets are then formed
by localizing this operator by applying it to an indicator function. Subject to
an admissibility condition on $g$, this procedure defines an invertible
transform. We explore the localization properties of the wavelets in the limit
of fine scales. Additionally, we present a fast Chebyshev polynomial
approximation algorithm for computing the transform that avoids the need for
diagonalizing $\L$. We highlight potential applications of the transform
through examples of wavelets on graphs corresponding to a variety of different
problem domains.
