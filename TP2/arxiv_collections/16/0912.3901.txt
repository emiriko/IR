In this paper, I show that a Yang-Mills force with a
U(1)$\timesSU(2)\times$SU(2) group symmetry predicts solar system observations
of gravitational behavior as well as binary pulsar precession provided that
mass is redefined as intrinsic static pressure and all stress-energy-momentum
tensors are, thus, traceless. Using a homogeneous, isotropic universe model, I
show that this theory explains the accelerating expansion of the universe
directly from group symmetry with no ad hoc constants and predicts that
antimatter and matter gravitationally repel one another (antimatter "falls"
up). In addition, because it is a generic massless Yang-Mills theory, it is a
renormalizable quantum theory.
