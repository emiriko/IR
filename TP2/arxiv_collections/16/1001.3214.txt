In the MSSM scalar h,H production is mediated by heavy quark and squark
loops. The higher order QCD corrections have been obtained some time ago and
turned out to be large. The full SUSY QCD corrections have been obained
recently including the full mass dependence of the loop particles. We describe
our calculation and present first numerical results. We also address the
question of the proper treatment of the large gluino mass limit, i.e. the
consistent decoupling of heavy gluino effects, and present the effective
Lagrangian for decoupled gluinos.
