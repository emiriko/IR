We report the consequences of implementing momentum dependent interactions
(MDI) on multifragmentation in heavy-ion reactions over entire collision
geometry. The evolution of a single cold nucleus using static soft equation of
state and soft momentum dependent equation of state demonstrates that inclusion
of momentum dependence increases the emission of free nucleons. However, no
heavier fragments are emitted artificially. The calculations performed within
the framework of quantum molecular dynamics approach suggest that MDI strongly
influence the system size dependence of fragment production. A comparison with
ALADiN experimental data justifies the use of momentum dependent interactions
in heavy-ion collisions.
