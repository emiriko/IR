The attractive feature of the Everett approach is its admirable spirit of
approaching the quantum puzzle with a Zen-like "beginner's mind" in order to
try to envision what the pure formalism might be saying about quantum reality,
even if that journey leads to a strange place. It is argued that the
transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics (TI), appropriately
interpreted, shares the same motivation and achieves much more, with far fewer
conceptual perplexities, by taking into account heretofore overlooked features
of the quantum formalism itself (i.e. advanced states). In particular, TI does
not need to talk about brain states, consciousness, or observers (rational or
otherwise). In its possibilist variant ("PTI"), it shares the realist virtues
of treating state vector branches as genuine dynamical entities, without having
to explain how or why all of their associated outcomes actually happen (they
don't), how to account for a plenitude of counterpart observers in some
coherent notion of trans-temporal identity of the bifurcating observers
(observers don't bifurcate in TI), nor how the certainty of all outcomes could
be consistent with any coherent theory of probability, let alone the Born
probability (the Born probability emerges naturally in TI). In short, TI is
precisely the one-world interpretation Kent is looking for in his (2010).
