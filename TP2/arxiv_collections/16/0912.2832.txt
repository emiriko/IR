We consider the fully overheated single-electron transistor, where the heat
balance is determined entirely by electron transfers. We find three distinct
transport regimes corresponding to cotunneling, single-electron tunneling, and
a competition between the two. We find an anomalous sensitivity to temperature
fluctuations at the crossover between the two latter regimes that manifests in
an exceptionally large Fano factor of current noise.
