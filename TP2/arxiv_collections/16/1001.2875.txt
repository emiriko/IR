Theoretical analysis of random walk on percolation lattices has predicted
that, at the occupied site concentrations of above the threshold value, a
characteristic crossover between an initial sub-diffusion to a final classical
diffusion behavior should occur. In this study, we have employed the lattice
gas automata model to simulate random walk over a square 2D site-percolation
lattice. Quite good result was obtained for the critical exponent of diffusion
coefficient. The random walker was found to obey the anomalous sub-diffusion
regime, with the exponent decreasing when the occupied site concentration
decreases. The expected crossover between diffusion regimes was observed in a
configuration-dependent manner, but the averaging over the ensemble of lattice
configurations removed any manifestation of such crossovers. This may have been
originated from the removal of short-scale inhomogeneities in percolation
lattices occurring after ensemble averaging.
