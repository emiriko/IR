A substantial fraction of the baryons of disk galaxies like the Milky Way is
expected to reside in coronae of gas at the virial temperature. This is the
only realistic reservoir of gas available to feed star formation in the disks.
The way this feeding occurs depends crucially on whether galactic coronae can
fragment into cool clouds via thermal instability. Here I summarize arguments
suggesting that galactic coronae are not prone to thermal instability, and I
briefly discuss the implications for galaxy-formation models and for the origin
of the high-velocity clouds of the Milky Way.
