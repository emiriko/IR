We define a mapping of the QCD Balitsky-Kovchegov equation in the diffusive
approximation with noise and a generalized coupling allowing a common treatment
of the fixed and running QCD couplings. It corresponds to the extension of the
stochastic Fisher and Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov equation to the radial
wave propagation in a medium with negative-gradient absorption responsible for
anomalous diffusion,non-integer dimension and damped noise fluctuations. We
obtain its analytic traveling wave solutions with a new scaling curve and in
particular for running coupling a new scaling variable allowing to extend the
range and validity of the geometric-scaling QCD prediction beyond the
previously known domain.
