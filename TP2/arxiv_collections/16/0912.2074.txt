We present new analysis of HST images of (47171) 1999 TC36 that confirm it as
a triple system. Fits to the point-spread function consistently show that the
apparent primary is itself composed of two similar-sized components. The two
central components, A1 and A2, can be consistently identified in each of nine
epochs spread over seven years of time. In each instance the component
separation, ranging from 0.023+/-0.002 to 0.031+/-0.003 arcsec, is roughly one
half of the Hubble Space Telescope's diffraction limit at 606 nm. The orbit of
the central pair has a semi-major axis of a~867 km with a period of P~1.9 days.
These orbital parameters yield a system mass that is consistent with Msys =
12.75+/-0.06 10^18 kg derived from the orbit of the more distant secondary,
component B. The diameters of the three components are dA1= 286(+45,-38) km,
dA2= 265(+41,-35 km and dB= 139(+22,-18) km. The relative sizes of these
components are more similar than in any other known multiple in the solar
system. Taken together, the diameters and system mass yield a bulk density of
p=542(+317,-211) kg m^-3. HST Photometry shows that component B is variable
with an amplitude of >=0.17+/-0.05 magnitudes. Components A1 and A2 do not show
variability larger than 0.08+/-0.03 magnitudes approximately consistent with
the orientation of the mutual orbit plane and tidally-distorted equilibrium
shapes. The system has high specific angular momentum of J/J'=0.93, comparable
to most of the known Transneptunian binaries.
