Purpose: A novel approach using nano technology enhanced radiation modalities
is investigated. The proposed methodology uses antibodies labeled with
organically inert metals with a high atomic number. Irradiation using photons
with energies in the kilo--electron volt (keV) range show an increase in dose
due to a combination of an increase in photo-electric interactions and a
pronounced generation of Auger and/or Coster-Kronig (A-CK) electrons.
  Methods: The dependency of the dose deposition on various factors is
investigated using Monte Carlo simulation models. The factors investigated
include: agent concentration, spectral dependency looking at mono--energetic
sources as well as classical bremsstrahlung sources. The optimization of the
energy spectrum is performed in terms of physical dose enhancement as well as
the dose deposited by Auger and/or Coster-Kronig electrons and their biological
effectiveness.
  Results: A quasi-linear dependency on concentration and an exponential
decrease within the target medium is observed. The maximal dose enhancement is
dependent on the position of the target in the beam. Apart from irradiation
with low photon energies (10 - 20 keV) there is no added benefit from the
increase in generation of Auger electrons. Interestingly, a regular 110kVp
bremsstrahlung spectrum shows a comparable enhancement in comparison with the
optimized mono--energetic sources.
  Conclusions: In conclusion we find that the use of nano-particle enhanced
shows promise to be implemented quite easily in regular clinic on a physical
level due to the advantageous properties in classical beams.
