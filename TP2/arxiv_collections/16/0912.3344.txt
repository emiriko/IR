Following Flory's ideality hypothesis the chemical potential of a test chain
of length $n$ immersed into a dense solution of chemically identical polymers
of length distribution P(N) is extensive in $n$. We argue that an additional
contribution $\delta \mu_c(n) \sim +1/\rho\sqrt{n}$ arises ($\rho$ being the
monomer density) for all $\P(N)$ if $n \ll <N>$ which can be traced back to the
overall incompressibility of the solution leading to a long-range repulsion
between monomers. Focusing on Flory distributed melts we obtain $\delta
\mu_c(n) \approx (1- 2 n/<N>) / \rho \sqrt{n}$ for $n \ll <N>^2$, hence,
$\delta \mu_c(n) \approx - 1/\rho \sqrt{n}$ if $n$ is similar to the typical
length of the bath $<N>$. Similar results are obtained for monodisperse
solutions. Our perturbation calculations are checked numerically by analyzing
the annealed length distribution P(N) of linear equilibrium polymers generated
by Monte Carlo simulation of the bond-fluctuation model. As predicted we find,
e.g., the non-exponentiality parameter $K_p \equiv 1 - <N^>/p!<N>^p$ to decay
as $K_p \approx 1 / \sqrt{<N>}$ for all moments $p$ of the distribution.
