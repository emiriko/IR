The influence of the environment on the polarized and total power radio
continuum emission of cluster spiral galaxies is investigated. We present deep
scaled array VLA 20 and 6 cm observations including polarization of 8 Virgo
spiral galaxies. These data are combined with existing optical, HI, and Halpha
data. Ram pressure compression leads to sharp edges of the total power
distribution at one side of the galactic disk. These edges coincide with HI
edges. In edge-on galaxies the extraplanar radio emission can extend further
than the HI emission. In the same galaxies asymmetric gradients in the degree
of polarization give additional information on the ram pressure wind direction.
The local total power emission is not sensitive to the effects of ram pressure.
The radio continuum spectrum might flatten in the compressed region only for
very strong ram pressure. This implies that neither the local star formation
rate nor the turbulent small-scale magnetic field are significantly affected by
ram pressure. Ram pressure compression occurs mainly on large scales (>=1 kpc)
and is primarily detectable in polarized radio continuum emission.
