We report an actuation/detection scheme with a top-down
nano-electromechanical system for frequency shift-based sensing applications
with outstanding performance. It relies on electrostatic actuation and
piezoresistive nanowire gauges for in-plane motion transduction. The process
fabrication is fully CMOS compatible. The results show a very large dynamic
range (DR) of more than 100dB and an unprecedented signal to background ratio
(SBR) of 69dB providing an improvement of two orders of magnitude in the
detection efficiency presented in the state of the art in NEMS field. Such a
dynamic range results from both negligible 1/f-noise and very low Johnson noise
compared to the thermomechanical noise. This simple low-power detection scheme
paves the way for new class of robust mass resonant sensor.
