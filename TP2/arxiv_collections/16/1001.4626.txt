The fundamentals of precessing ball solitons (PBS), arising as a result of
the energy fluctuations during spin-flop phase transition induced by a magnetic
field in antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy, are presented. The PBS
conditions exist within a wide range of amplitudes and energies, including
negative energies relative to an initial condition. For each value of the
magnetic field, there exists a precession frequency for which a curve of PBS
energy passes through a zero value (bifurcation point), and hence, in the
vicinity of this point the PBS originate with the highest probability. The
characteristics of PBS, including the time dependences of configuration,
energy, and precession frequency, are considered. As a result of dissipation,
the PBS transform into the macroscopic domains of a new phase.
