Faced with the persisting problem of the unification of gravity with other
fundamental interactions we investigate the possibility of a new paradigm,
according to which the basic space of physics is a multidimensional space
${\cal C}$ associated with matter configurations. We consider general
relativity in ${\cal C}$. In spacetime, which is a 4-dimensional subspace of
${\cal C}$, we have not only the 4-dimensional gravity, but also other
interactions, just as in Kaluza-Klein theories. We then consider a finite
dimensional description of extended objects in terms of the center of mass,
area, and volume degrees of freedom, which altogether form a 16-dimensional
manifold whose tangent space at any point is Clifford algebra Cl(1,3). The
latter algebra is very promising for the unification, and it provides
description of fermions.
