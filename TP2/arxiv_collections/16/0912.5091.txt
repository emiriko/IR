We show that 138 odd values of n less than 10000 for which one knows how to
construct a Hadamard matrix of order 4n have been overlooked in the recent
handbook of combinatorial designs. There are four additional odd n, namely 191,
5767, 7081 and 8249, in that range for which we can construct a Hadamard matrix
of order 4n. Our exhaustive computer searches show that the near-normal
sequences NN(n) exist for n=36,38,40. Thus the Yang conjecture on the existence
of NN(n) for all even n has been verified for n <= 40 but it still remains
open.
