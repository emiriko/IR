We investigate the accuracy of mass determinations M_BH of supermassive black
holes in galaxies using dynamical models of the stellar kinematics. We compare
10 of our M_BH measurements, using integral-field OASIS kinematics, to
published values. For a sample of 25 galaxies we confront our new M_BH derived
using two modeling methods on the same OASIS data.
