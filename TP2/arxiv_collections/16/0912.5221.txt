We present the leptonic decay constants fDs and fD+ computed on the MILC
collaboration's 2+1 flavor asqtad gauge ensembles. We use clover heavy quarks
with the Fermilab interpretation and improved staggered light quarks. The
simultaneous chiral and continuum extrapolation, which determines both decay
constants, includes partially-quenched lattice results at lattice spacings a ~
0:09, 0:12 and 0:15 fm. We have made several recent improvements in our
analysis: a) we include terms in the fit describing leading order heavy-quark
discretization effects, b) we have adopted a more precise input r1 value
consistent with our other D and B meson studies, c) we have retuned the input
bare charm masses based upon the new r1. Our preliminary results are fDs = 260
+/-10 MeV and fD+ = 217 +/-10 MeV.
