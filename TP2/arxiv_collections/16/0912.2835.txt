Trapped low magnetic flux dynamics including local ones are investigated in
YBCO single crystals in the strong thermal fluctuations domain near the
superconducting phase transition temperatures. The essential difference from
quasi-logarithmic isothermal relaxation of a magnetization behavior (observed
earlier in high magnetic fields) was established. Within the framework of
classic model of a thermal activated vortices creep the estimation of an
effective pinning potential was made at these temperatures.
