An analysis of the position angles distribution of 10461 extended radio
sources shows that the spatial orientation of the axes of these objects is
anisotropic: they avoid the direction towards the Celestial Pole and are mostly
oriented in the equatorial direction. The ratio of the probability densities of
the orientation in these two directions is 0.68. The probability that the sky
distribution of axes is isotropic is less then 0.00004. This conclusion is
consistent with the results of the analyses of the spatial distribution of
galactic normals orientation in the galaxies from UGC, ESO and FGC catalogs
