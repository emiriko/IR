{The Galactic microquasar SS 433 is very luminous and ejects opposite jets at
approximately one quarter the speed of light. It is regarded as a
super-Eddington accretor but until recently there were no observations of
accretion.} % aims heading (mandatory) {To present an analysis of spectroscopic
optical data obtained before and during a major flare, which yield in H$\alpha$
unambiguous evidence for the accretion disk.} % methods heading (mandatory)
{Published high resolution spectra, taken with a 3.6-m telescope almost nightly
over 0.4 of a precession cycle, are analysed.} % results heading (mandatory)
{Optical spectra taken almost nightly in August and September 2004 revealed a
period of quiescence followed by activity which culminated in the accretion
disk of SS433 becoming visible. The visible material in the accretion disk
orbited the compact object at greater than 500 km s$^{-1}$, implying that the
mass of the compact object is less than 37 $M_\odot$. Evidence that an
accretion stream joins the disk at over 700 km s$^{-1}$ suggests that the mass
is considerably below this upper limit. The accretion disk clearly orbits the
centre of mass of the binary system with the compact object, sharing its speed
of approximately 175 km s$^{-1}$. The mass of the companion lies between 20 and
30 $M_\odot$ and it probably does not fill its Roche lobe.}
