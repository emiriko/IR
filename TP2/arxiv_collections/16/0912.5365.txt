Kim and Fedele discovered experimental evidence for the breakdown of the
Millikan's Law for the fall rate of oil droplets in Nitrogen gas and the
discrepancy is most pronounced for the smallest, sub-micron size particles.
Here we explain these results by showing that the particle's motion is
determined in part by the bare shear viscosity which is defined by the
averaging length lambda. This is in contrast to the usual theory which involves
the renormalized shear viscosity. An increase in gas pressure produces a
decrease in the bare shear viscosity and as a result the fall rate increases.
This behavior is opposite the Millikan Law prediction that an increase in
pressure produces a decrease in fall rate. As a result, the bare shear
viscosity is experimentally measurable by the fallrate. The theory here uses a
convective diffusion equation and a Langevin approach will be presented
elsewhere.
