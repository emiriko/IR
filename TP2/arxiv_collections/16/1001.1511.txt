We compute electromagnetic properties of the Be-11 nucleus using an effective
field theory that exploits the separation of scales in this halo system. We fix
the parameters of the EFT from measured data on levels and scattering lengths
in the Be-10 plus neutron system. We then obtain predictions for the B(E1)
strength of the 1/2^+ to 1/2^- transition in the Be-11 nucleus. We also compute
the charge radius of the ground state of Be-11. Agreement with experiment
within the expected accuracy of a leading-order computation in this EFT is
obtained. We also indicate how higher-order corrections that affect both s-wave
and p-wave Be-10-neutron interactions will affect our results.
