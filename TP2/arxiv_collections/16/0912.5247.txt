When particle speeds are large the motion of a collisionless plasma is
modeled by the relativistic Vlasov Maxwell system. Large time behavior of
solutions which depend on one position variable and two momentum variables is
considered. In the case of a single species of charge it is shown that there
are solutions for which the charge density does not decay in time. This is in
marked contrast to results for the non-relativistic Vlasov Poisson system in
one space dimension. The case when two oppositely charged species are present
and the net total charge is zero is also considered. In this case, it is shown
that the support in the first component of momentum can grow at most like t to
the three-fourths power.
