We propose that a magnetic quantum wire composed of magnetic and non-magnetic
atomic sites can be used as a spin filter for a wide range of applied bias
voltage. We adopt a simple tight-binding Hamiltonian to describe the model
where the quantum wire is attached to two semi-infinite one-dimensional
non-magnetic electrodes. Based on single particle Green's function formalism
all the calculations are performed numerically which describe two-terminal
conductance and current through the wire. Our exact results may be helpful in
fabricating mesoscopic or nano-scale spin filter.
