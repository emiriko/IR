We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that high-numerical-aperture
(NA) optical microscopy is accompanied by strong spin-orbit interaction of
light, which translates fine infomation about the specimen to the polarization
degrees of freedom of light. An 80nm gold nano-particle scattering the light in
the focus of a high-NA objective generates angular momentum conversion which is
seen as a non-uniform polarization distribution at the exit pupil. We
demonstrate remarkable sensitivity of the effect to the position of the
nano-particle: Its subwavelength displacement produces the giant spin-Hall
effect, i.e., macro-separation of spins in the outgoing light. This brings
forth a far-field optical nanoprobing technique based on the spin-orbit
interaction of light.
