The modified theories of gravity, especially the f(R) theory, have attracted
much attention in recent years. In this context, we explore static plane
symmetric vacuum solutions using the metric approach of this theory. The field
equations are solved using the assumption of constant scalar curvature which
may be zero or non-zero. We have found a total of three plane symmetric
solutions. The correspondence of these solutions with the well-known solutions
in General Relativity is given.
