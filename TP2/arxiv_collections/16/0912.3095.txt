The correspondence of a new form of quantum mechanics based on a quantum
version of the action principle, which was proposed earlier [arXiv:0807.3508],
with the ordinary quantum mechanics is established. New potentialities of the
quantum action principle in the interpretation of quantum mechanics are
considered.
