We consider the prospects of supersymmetric dark matter in light of the
recent results announced by the CDMS experiments. In this paper, we investigate
the status of: (i) neutralino dark matter in models of minimal supergravity,
(ii) neutralino dark matter in models with nonuniversal Higgs masses, and (iii)
sneutrino dark matter in the U(1)_{B-L} extension of the minimal supersymmetric
standard model; and discuss the predictions of these models for the LHC,
Tevatron, IceCube and PAMELA.
