Angular distributions of the 7Li(6Li,6Li)7Li elastic scattering and the
7Li(6Li,7Li_{g.s.})6Li, 7Li(6Li,7Li*_{0.48})6Li transfer reactions at Ec.m. =
23.7 MeV were measured with the Q3D magnetic spectrograph. The optical
potential of 6Li+7Li was obtained by fitting the elastic scattering
differential cross sections. Based on the distorted wave Born approximation
(DWBA) analysis, spectroscopic factors of 7Li=6Li+n were determined to be 0.73
+- 0.05 and 0.90 +- 0.09 for the ground and first exited states in 7Li,
respectively. Using the spectroscopic factors, the cross sections of the
6Li(n,g)7Li direct neutron capture reactions and the astrophysical 6Li(n,g)7Li
reaction rates were derived.
