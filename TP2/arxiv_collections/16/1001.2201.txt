I investigate the dynamics and power spectrum of two coupled qubits
(two-level systems) under incoherent continuous pump and dissipation. New
regimes of strong coupling are identified, that are due to additional paths of
coherence flow in the system. Dressed states are reconstructed even in the
regime of strong decoherence. The results are analytical and offer an exact
description of strong-coupling in presence of pumping and decay in a nontrivial
(nonlinear) system.
