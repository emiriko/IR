In this paper geometry is studied with a novel approach. Every geometrical
object is defined as a symbol which satisfies some properties. These symbols
are then coded into a class of numbers which are named here as many dots
numbers (MDN). The algebraic structure of MDN is established. Assuming the
universe as a symbol, the existence of dark matter is explained qualitatively.
Moreover, it is shown that dark matter increases as the universe expands.
