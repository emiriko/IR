Web blog is used as a collaborative platform to publish and share
information. The information accumulated in the blog intrinsically contains the
knowledge. The knowledge shared by the community of people has intangible value
proposition. The blog is viewed as a multimedia information resource available
on the Internet. In a blog, information in the form of text, image, audio and
video builds up exponentially. The multimedia information contained in an Atom
blog does not have the capability, which is required by the software processes
so that Atom blog content can be accessed, processed and reused over the
Internet. This shortcoming is addressed by exploring OWL knowledge modeling,
semantic annotation and semantic categorization techniques in an Atom blog
sphere. By adopting these techniques, futuristic Atom blogs can be created and
deployed over the Internet.
