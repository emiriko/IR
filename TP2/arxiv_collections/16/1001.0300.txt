We study the stability of multipole-mode solitons in one-dimensional thermal
nonlinear media. We show how the sample geometry impacts the stability of
mutlipole-mode solitons and reveal that the tripole and quadrupole can be made
stable in their whole domain of existence, provided that the sample width
exceeds a critical value. In spite of such geometry-dependent soliton
stability, we find that the maximal number of peaks in stable multipole-mode
solitons in thermal media is the same as that in nonlinear materials with
finite-range nonlocality.
