Earth-alkaline-like atoms with ultra-narrow transitions open the door to a
new regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. That regime is characterized by a
critical photon number that is many orders of magnitude smaller than what can
be achieved in conventional systems. We show that it is possible to achieve
superradiance in steady state with such systems. We discuss the basic
underlying mechanisms as well as the key experimental requirements
