The majority of astronomers and physicists accept the reality of dark energy
but also believe it can only be studied indirectly through observation of the
motions of galaxies. This paper opens the experimental question of whether it
is possible to directly detect dark energy on earth using atom interferometry
through a force hypothetically caused by a gradient in the dark energy density.
Our proposed experimental design is outlined. The possibility of detecting
other weak fields is briefly discussed.
