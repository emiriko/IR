A model of Lorentz invariant random fluctuations in photon polarization is
presented. The effects are frequency dependent and affect the polarization of
photons as they propagate through space. We test for this effect by confronting
the model with the latest measurements of polarization of Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) photons.
