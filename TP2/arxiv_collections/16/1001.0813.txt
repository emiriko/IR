We review the importance of Centaurus A in high energy astrophysics as a
nearby object with many of the properties expected of a major source of very
high energy cosmic rays and gamma-rays. We examine observational techniques and
the results so far obtained in the energy range from 200 GeV to above 100 EeV
and attempt to fit those data with expectations of Centaurus A as an
astrophysical source from VHE to UHE energies.
