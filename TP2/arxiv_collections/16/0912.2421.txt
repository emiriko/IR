The dielectric response of hard (Fe-doped) and soft (Nb-doped) rhombohedral
Pb(Zr0.58Ti0.42)1-xMexO3 (PZT; Me= Fe or Nb) ceramics was studied at
subswitching conditions over a wide range of temperatures (50 C to 450 C) and
frequencies (10 mHz to 10 kHz). The results show qualitative differences in
behavior of the acceptor and donor doped samples. Hard materials exhibit a
steep increase of the complex permittivity with decreasing frequency. The onset
of the dispersion is thermally activated with activation energy of about
0.6-0.8 eV and is attributed here to oxygen vacancy hopping. Activation energy
for ac conductivity observed in soft materials is estimated to about 1.7 eV,
corresponding to the half of the energy gap of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and is thus
consistent with electronic conduction. The relevance of ionic hopping
conductivity in hard materials to ferroelectric aging / deaging and hardening
is analyzed. Strong ionic conductivity in hard and its absence in soft samples
agree well with the dipolar mechanism of ageing in hard materials and the
absence of significant ageing in soft materials.
