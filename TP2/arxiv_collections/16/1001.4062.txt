A method is presented that allows to solve the Faddeev integral equations of
the semirelativistic constituent quark model. In such a model the quark-quark
interaction is modeled by a infinitely rising confining potential and the
kinetic energy is taken in a relativistic form. We solve the integral equations
in Coulomb-Sturmian basis. This basis facilitate an exact treatment of the
confining potentials.
