For several decades there has been no breakthrough in fundamental physics as
revolutionary as relativity and quantum physics despite the amazing advancement
of applied physics and technology. By discussing several examples of what
physics could have achieved by now, but failed, I will argue that the present
state of fundamental physics is not caused by the lack of talented physicists,
but rather by problematic general views on how one should do physics. Although
it appears to be widely believed that such general views cannot affect the
advancement of physics I would like to draw the attention of the younger
generation of physicists to three reasons that might have been responsible for
failures in the past and might cause problems in the future: (i) misconceptions
on the nature of physical theories, (ii) underestimation of the role of
conceptual analyses so successfully employed by Galileo and Einstein, and (iii)
overestimation of the predictive power of mathematics in physics.
