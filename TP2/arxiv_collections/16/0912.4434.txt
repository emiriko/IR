Gaussian Graphical Models provide a convenient framework for representing
dependencies between variables. Recently, this tool has received a high
interest for the discovery of biological networks. The literature focuses on
the case where a single network is inferred from a set of measurements, but, as
wetlab data is typically scarce, several assays, where the experimental
conditions affect interactions, are usually merged to infer a single network.
In this paper, we propose two approaches for estimating multiple related
graphs, by rendering the closeness assumption into an empirical prior or group
penalties. We provide quantitative results demonstrating the benefits of the
proposed approaches. The methods presented in this paper are embeded in the R
package 'simone' from version 1.0-0 and later.
