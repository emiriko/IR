We have studied, both experimentally and theoretically, the change of the
so-called 2D band of the Raman scattering spectrum of graphene (the two-phonon
peak near 2700 cm-1) in an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the
graphene crystal plane at liquid helium temperature. A shift to lower frequency
and broadening of this band is observed as the magnetic field is increased from
0 to 33 T. At fields up to 5--10 T the changes are quadratic in the field while
they become linear at higher magnetic fields. This effect is explained by the
curving of the quasiclassical trajectories of the photo-excited electrons and
holes in the magnetic field, which enables us (i) to extract the electron
inelastic scattering rate, and (ii) to conclude that electronic scattering
accounts for about half of the measured width of the 2D peak.
