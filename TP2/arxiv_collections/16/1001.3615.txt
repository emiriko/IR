Josephson junctions were fabricated in epitaxial films of cobalt-doped
BaFe2As2 on [001]-tilt (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 bicrystal substrates. 10m-wide
microbridges spanning a 30-degrees-tilted bicrystal grain boundary (BGB bridge)
exhibited resistively-shunted-junction (RSJ)-like current-voltage
characteristics up to 17 K, and the critical current was suppressed remarkably
by a magnetic field. Microbridges without a BGB did not show the RSJ-like
behavior, and their critical current densities were 20 times larger than those
of BGB bridges, confirming BGB bridges display a Josephson effect originating
from weakly-linked BGB.
