In this work, a combination of experiments and theory is used to investigate
three-body, normal collisions between solid particles with a liquid coating
(i.e., "wetted" particles). Experiments are carried out using a Stokes' cradle,
an apparatus inspired by the Newton's cradle desktop toy except with wetted
particles. Unlike previous work on two-body systems, which may either
agglomerate or rebound upon collision, four outcomes are possible in three-body
systems: fully agglomerated, Newton's cradle (striker and target particle it
strikes agglomerate), reverse Newton's cradle (targets agglomerate while
striker separates), and fully separated. Post-collisional velocities are
measured over a range of parameters. For all experiments, as the impact
velocity increases, the progression of outcomes observed is fully agglomerated,
reverse Newton's cradle, and fully separated. Notably, as the viscosity of the
oil increases, experiments reveal a decrease in the critical Stokes number (the
Stokes number that demarcates a transition from agglomeration to separation)
for both sets of adjacent particles. A scaling theory is developed based on
lubrication forces and particle deformation and elasticity. Unlike previous
work for two-particle systems, two pieces of physics are found to be critical
in the prediction of a regime map that is consistent with experiments: (i) an
additional resistance upon rebound of the target particles due to the
pre-existing liquid bridge between them (which has no counterpart in
two-particle collisions), and (ii) the addition of a rebound criterion due to
glass transition of the liquid layer at high pressure between colliding
particles.
