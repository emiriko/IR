We present results for matched distributions of a range of dijet event shapes
at hadron colliders, combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy in
the resummation exponent, next-to-next-to leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy
in its expansion and next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in a pure alpha_s
expansion. This is the first time that such a matching has been carried out for
hadronic final-state observables at hadron colliders. We compare our results to
Monte Carlo predictions, with and without matching to multi-parton tree-level
fixed-order calculations. These studies suggest that hadron-collider event
shapes have significant scope for constraining both perturbative and
non-perturbative aspects of hadron-collider QCD. The differences between
various calculational methods also highlight the limits of relying on
simultaneous variations of renormalisation and factorisation scale in making
reliable estimates of uncertainties in QCD predictions. We also discuss the
sensitivity of event shapes to the topology of multi-jet events, which are
expected to appear in many New Physics scenarios.
