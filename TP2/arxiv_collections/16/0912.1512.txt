We construct a large class of examples of the cyclic sieving phenomenon by
expoiting the representation theory of semi-simple Lie algebras. Let $M$ be a
finite dimensional representation of a semi-simple Lie algebra and let $B$ be
the associated Kashiwara crystal. For $r\ge 0$, the triple $(X,c,P)$ which
exhibits the cyclic sieving phenomenon is constructed as follows: the set $X$
is the set of isolated vertices in the crystal $\otimes^rB$; the map $c\colon
X\rightarrow X$ is a generalisation of promotion acting on standard tableaux of
rectangular shape and the polynomial $P$ is the fake degree of the Frobenius
character of a representation of $\mathfrak{S}_r$ related to the natural action
of $\mathfrak{S}_r$ on the subspace of invariant tensors in $\otimes^rM$.
Taking $M$ to be the defining representation of $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ gives the
cyclic sieving phenomenon for rectangular tableaux.
