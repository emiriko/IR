We consider the possibility that the recently reported events at the CDMS-II
direct dark matter detection experiment are the result of coherent scattering
of supersymmetric neutralinos. In such a scenario we argue that non-universal
soft supersymmetry breaking gaugino masses are favored with a resulting
lightest neutralino with significant Higgsino and wino components. We discuss
the accompanying signals which must be seen at liquid-xenon direct detection
experiments and indirect detection experiments if such a supersymmetric
interpretation is to be maintained. We illustrate the possible consequences for
early discovery channels at the LHC via a set of benchmark points designed to
give rise to an observed event rate comparable to the reported CDMS-II data.
