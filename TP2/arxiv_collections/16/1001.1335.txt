In this paper we consider a sequential "meson emission" mechanism for
charmonium decays of the type Psi -> N Nbar m, where Psi is a generic
charmonium state, N is a nucleon and m is a light meson. This decay mechanism,
which may not be dominant in general, assumes that an NNbar pair is created
during charmonium annihilation, and the light meson m is emitted from the
outgoing nucleon or antinucleon line. A straightforward generalization of this
model can incorporate intermediate N* resonances. We derive Dalitz plot event
densities for the cases Psi = eta_c, J/psi, chi_c0, chi_c1} and psi' and m =
pi0, f0 and omega (and implicitly, any 0^{-+}, 0^{++} or 1^{--} final light
meson). It may be possible to separate the contribution of this decay mechanism
to the full decay amplitude through characteristic event densities. For the
decay subset Psi -> p pbar pi0 the two model parameters are known, so we are
able to predict absolute numerical partial widths for Gamma(Psi -> p pbar pi0).
In the specific case J/psi -> p pbar pi0 the predicted partial width and M_{p
pi0} event distribution are intriguingly close to experiment. We also consider
the possibility of scalar meson and glueball searches in Psi -> p pbar f0. If
the meson emission contributions to Psi -> N Nbar m decays can be isolated and
quantified, they can be used to estimate meson-nucleon strong couplings
{g_NNm}, which are typically poorly known, and are a crucial input in meson
exchange models of the NN interaction. The determination of g_NNpi from J\psi
-> p pbar pi0 and the (poorly known) g_NNomega and the anomalous "strong
magnetic" coupling kappa_{NNomega} from J/psi -> p pbar omega are considered as
examples.
