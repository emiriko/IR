Transiting exoplanets provide unparalleled access to the fundamental
parameters of both extrasolar planets and their host stars. We present
limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) for the exoplanet hunting CoRot and Kepler
missions. The LDCs are calculated with ATLAS stellar atmospheric model grids
and span a wide range of Teff, log g, and metallically [M/H]. Both CoRot and
Kepler contain wide, nonstandard response functions, and are producing a large
inventory of high-quality transiting lightcurves, sensitive to stellar limb
darkening. Comparing the stellar model limb darkening to results from the first
seven CoRot planets, we find better fits are found when two model intensities
at the limb are excluded in the coefficient calculations. This calculation
method can help to avoid a major deficiency present at the limbs of the 1D
stellar models.
