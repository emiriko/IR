We provide a general method for evaluation of the joint range of
f-divergences for two different functions f. Via topological arguments we prove
that the joint range for general distributions equals the convex hull of the
joint range achieved by the distributions on a two-element set. The joint range
technique provides important inequalities between different f-divergences with
various applications in information theory and statistics.
