Under an appropriate regular variation condition, the affinely normalized
partial sums of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random
variables converges weakly to a non-Gaussian stable random variable. A
functional version of this is known to be true as well, the limit process being
a stable L\'{e}vy process. The main result in the paper is that for a
stationary, regularly varying sequence for which clusters of high-threshold
excesses can be broken down into asymptotically independent blocks, the
properly centered partial sum process still converges to a stable L\'{e}vy
process. Due to clustering, the L\'{e}vy triple of the limit process can be
different from the one in the independent case. The convergence takes place in
the space of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g functions endowed with Skorohod's $M_1$ topology,
the more usual $J_1$ topology being inappropriate as the partial sum processes
may exhibit rapid successions of jumps within temporal clusters of large
values, collapsing in the limit to a single jump. The result rests on a new
limit theorem for point processes which is of independent interest. The theory
is applied to moving average processes, squared GARCH(1,1) processes and
stochastic volatility models.
