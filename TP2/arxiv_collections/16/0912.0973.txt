The diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission is produced by cosmic rays (CRs)
interacting with the interstellar gas and radiation field. Measurements by the
Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) instrument on the Compton
Gamma-Ray Observatory indicated excess gamma-ray emission > 1 GeV relative to
diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission models consistent with directly measured CR
spectra (the so-called ``EGRET GeV excess''). The excess emission was observed
in all directions on the sky, and a variety of explanations have been proposed,
including beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios like annihilating or decaying
dark matter. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope has measured the diffuse gamma-ray emission with improved
sensitivity and resolution compared to EGRET. We report on LAT measurements of
the diffuse gamma-ray emission for energies 100 MeV to 10 GeV and Galactic
latitudes 10 deg. <= |b| <= 20 deg. The LAT spectrum for this region of the sky
is well reproduced by a diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission model that is
consistent with local CR spectra and inconsistent with the EGRET GeV excess.
