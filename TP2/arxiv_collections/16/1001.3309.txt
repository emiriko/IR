We give an extensive treatment of the pairing symmetry in the ferromagnetic
superconductor $UGe_{2}$. We show that one can draw important conclusions
concerning the superconducting state, considering only the transformation
properties of the pairing function, without assumptions about the form of the
pairing amplitudes.
