We present an unquenched quark model for baryons in which the effects of the
quark-antiquark pairs (up, down and strange) are taken into account in an
explicit form via a microscopic, QCD-inspired, quark-antiquark creation
mechanism. In the present approach, the contribution of the quark-antiquark
pairs can be studied for any inital baryon and for any flavor of the pairs. It
is shown that, while the inclusion of quark-antiquark pairs does not affect the
baryon magnetic moments, it leads to a sizeable contribution of the orbital
angular momentum to the spin of the proton and the Lambda hyperon.
