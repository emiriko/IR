The multiple scattering of photons in a hot, resonant, atomic vapor is
investigated and shown to exhibit a L\'evy Flight-like behavior. Monte Carlo
simulations give insights into the frequency redistribution process that
originates the long steps characteristic of this class of random walk
phenomena.
