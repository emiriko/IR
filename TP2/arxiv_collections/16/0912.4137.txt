We present the exact solution of a system of Fermi particles living on the
sites of a Bethe lattice with coordination number z and interacting through
on-site U and nearest-neighbor V interactions. This is a physical realization
of the extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit. Within the Green's function
and equations of motion formalism, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the
model and we study the phase diagram at finite temperature in the whole model's
parameter space, allowing for the on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions to
be either repulsive or attractive. We find the existence of critical regions
where charge ordering (V>0) and phase separation (V<0) are observed. This
scenario is endorsed by the study of several thermodynamic quantities.
