The distribution of the Hall voltage induced by low-frequency AC current is
studied theoretically in the incoherent linear transport of quantum Hall
systems. It is shown that the Hall-voltage distribution makes a crossover from
the uniform distribution to a concentrated-near-edges distribution as the
frequency is increased or the diagonal conductivity is decreased. This
crossover is also reflected in the frequency dependence of AC
magnetoresistance.
