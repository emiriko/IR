At nonzero temperature in QCD, about the deconfining phase transition there
is a "semi" quark gluon plasma (semi-QGP), where the expectation value of the
(renormalized) Polyakov loop is less than one. This can be modeled by a
semiclassical expansion about a constant field for the vector potential, A_0,
which is diagonal in color. We compute the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP by
using the Boltzmann equation in the presence of this background field. To
leading, logarithmic order in weak coupling, the dominant diagrams are given by
the usual scattering processes of 2 -> 2 particles. For simplicity we also
assume that both the number of colors and flavors are large. Near the critical
temperature T_c, where the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is small, the
overall density of colored fields decreases according to their color
representation, with the density of quarks vanishes linearly with the loop, and
that of gluons, quadratically. This decrease in the overall density dominates
changes in the transport cross section. As a result, relative to that in the
perturbative QGP, near T_c the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP is suppressed by
two powers of the Polyakov loop. In a semiclassical expansion, the suppression
of colored fields depends only upon which color representation they lie in, and
not upon their mass. That light and heavy quarks are suppressed in a common
manner may help to explain the behavior of charm quarks at RHIC.
