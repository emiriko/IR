The dynamics of cold Bose atoms in driven tilted optical lattices is analyzed
focusing on destruction of Wannier-Stark localization and the phenomenon of
band collapse. It is argued that an understanding of the experimental results
requires thorough account for interaction effects. These are suppression of the
ballistic spreading of atoms for resonant driving (a multiple of the driving
frequency coincides with the Bloch frequency) and unbounded sub-diffusive
spreading of atoms for off-resonant driving.
