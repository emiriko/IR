Modern magnetic thin film devices owe their success in large part to effects
emerging from interlayer coupling and exchange interaction at interfaces. A
prominent example is exchange bias (EB), a magnetic coupling phenomenon found
in ferromagnet (F)/antiferromagnet (AF) systems. Uncompensated pinned moments
in the AF couple to the F via the interface causing an additional
unidirectional anisotropy. As a result, the hysteresis of the F is shifted. The
existence of such pinned moments is nowadays accepted although their physical
nature and origin is still unknown. Here we present a thorough spectroscopic
investigation based on X-ray magnetic circular dichroism which does for the
first time provide direct information about the physics of pinned magnetic
moments. Our data clearly shows that the orbital magnetic moment, which is
usually widely quenched in transition metal systems, is the driving force
behind exchange bias in Co/FeMn.
