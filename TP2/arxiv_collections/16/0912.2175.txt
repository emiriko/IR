The search for CP violating forces between nucleons in the so-called axion
window of force ranges lam between 2x10^-5 m and 0.02 m is interesting because
only little experimental information is available there. Axion-like particles
would induce a pseudo-magnetic field for neutrons close to bulk matter. A
laboratory search investigates neutron spin precession close to a heavy mirror
using ultracold neutrons in a magnetic resonance spectrometer. From the absence
of a shift of the magnetic resonance we established new constraints on the
coupling strength of axion-like particles in terms of the product gs x gp of
scalar and pseudo-scalar dimensionless constants, as a function of the force
range lam, gs x gp x lam^2 <= 2x10-21 [cm^2] (C.L.95%) for 10^-4 cm < lam < 1
cm. For 0.1 cm < lam < 1 cm previous limits are improved by 4 to 5 orders of
magnitude.
