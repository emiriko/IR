We offer a new theoretical interpretation for the effect of enhanced electron
density at $^7$Be nucleus encapsulated in fullerene C$_{60}$. Our {\it{ab
initio}} Hartree-Fock calculations show that electron density at the $^7$Be
nucleus in $^7$Be@C$_{60}$ increase due to {\it{}attractive} effective
potential well generated by the fullerene. The 2$s$ state in the isolated Be
atom turns into 3$s$ state in the joint potential. This new state has higher
energy, and slightly larger amplitude at the Be nucleus than the previous 2$s$
state. Moreover the 3$s$ wave function has additional {\it{}node} appeared at
the distance $r \simeq 5a_B$ from the center. The node imitates repulsion
between the Be electron and the fullerene wall, because the electron has zero
probability to occupy this region. Such imitation of the repulsion by means of
the node in attractive potential has direct physical analogy in the theory of
$\alpha$-$\alpha$ and $N$-$N$ nuclear interactions.
