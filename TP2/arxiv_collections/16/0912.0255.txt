Data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments are collected with
significant financial and human effort and are mostly unique. At the same time,
HEP has no coherent strategy for data preservation and re-use. An
inter-experimental Study Group on HEP data preservation and long-term analysis
was convened at the end of 2008 and held two workshops, at DESY (January 2009)
and SLAC (May 2009). This document is an intermediate report to the
International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) of the reflections of
this Study Group.
