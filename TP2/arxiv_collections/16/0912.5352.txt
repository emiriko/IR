CIB matrices are N x N hypermatrices, the elements of which are m x n
matrices. They are used in Cross-Impact Balance Analysis, a concept applied in
social sciences, management sciences, scenario analysis and technology
foresight to identify plausible configurations of qualitatively defined impact
networks. Cross-Impact Balance Analysis (CIB) offers an opportunity for
qualitative systems analysis without complex mathematics. Although CIB doesn't
confront its user with too much mathematics, the background of the method and
its algorithm can be scrutinized by mathematical means, thus revealing an
extensive set of useful properties which are described and proved in this
article. Among them are four laws of invariance, a treatise on several special
cases of CIB matrices, and the proof that CIB analysis is equivalent to a
universal computer (a Turing machine).
