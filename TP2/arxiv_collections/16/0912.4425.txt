A computationally-fast inverse design method for nanophotonic structures is
presented. The method is based on two complementary convex optimization
problems which modify the dielectric structure and resonant field respectively.
The design of one- and two-dimensional nanophotonic resonators is demonstrated
and is shown to require minimal computational resources.
