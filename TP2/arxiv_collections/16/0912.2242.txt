Forty years have gone by since the optical identification of the Crab pulsar
(PSR B0531+21), and 25 isolated neutron stars of different types have been now
identified. Observations with ESO telescopes historically played a pivotal role
in the optical studies of INSs, first with the 3.6m telescope and the New
Technology Telescope (NTT), at the La Silla Observatory, and after 1998 with
the Very Large Telescope (VLT), at the Paranal Observatory. In this review I
summarise some of the most important results obtained in ten years of VLT
observations of isolated neutron stars.
