We apply a recent argument of Verlinde to loop quantum gravity, to conclude
that Newton's law of gravity emerges in an appropriate limit and setting. This
is possible because the relationship between area and entropy is realized in
loop quantum gravity when boundaries are imposed on a quantum spacetime.
