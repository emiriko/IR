Within the tight binding approximation, we study the dependence of the
electronic band structure and of the optical conductivity of a graphene single
layer on the modulus and direction of applied uniaxial strain. While the Dirac
cone approximation, albeit with a deformed cone, is robust for sufficiently
small strain, band dispersion linearity breaks down along a given direction,
corresponding to the development of anisotropic massive low-energy excitations.
We recover a linear behavior of the low-energy density of states, as long as
the cone approximation holds, while a band gap opens for sufficiently intense
strain, for almost all, generic strain directions. This may be interpreted in
terms of an electronic topological transition, corresponding to a change of
topology of the Fermi line, and to the merging of two inequivalent Dirac points
as a function of strain. We propose that these features may be observed in the
frequency dependence of the longitudinal optical conductivity in the visible
range, as a function of strain modulus and direction, as well as of field
orientation.
