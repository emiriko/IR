Recently [Physics Letters A, 374, (2010) 1801] the concept of vacuum
capacitor spontaneously charged harnessing the heat from a single thermal
reservoir at room temperature has been introduced, along with a mathematical
description of its functioning and a discussion on the main paradoxical feature
that seems to violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In the present paper we
investigate the theoretical and practical possibility of exploiting a such
thermo-charged capacitor as voltage/current generator: we show that if very
weak provisos on the physical characteristics of the capacitor are fulfilled,
then a non-zero current should flow across the device, allowing the generation
of potentially usable voltage, current and electric power out of a single
thermal source at room temperature. Preliminary results show that the power
output is tiny but non-zero.
