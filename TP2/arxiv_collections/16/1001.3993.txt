The fragment production cross sections for 140 MeV/nucleon
$^{48,40}$Ca$+^{9}$Be reactions have been calculated by the Heavy Ion Phase
Space Exploration (HIPSE) model. Isoscaling behavior is observed. The
isoscaling parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for both heavy and light fragments
from HIPSE model calculations are in good agreement with the experiment data.
Studies show that the potential parameters in the HIPSE model have very small
effect on the isoscaling parameters. The effect of the excitation energy and
evaporation on the isoscaling behavior has also been discussed.
