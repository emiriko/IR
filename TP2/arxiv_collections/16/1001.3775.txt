We report on observations of the dust trail of comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG) in visible light with the Wide Field Imager at
the ESO/MPG 2.2m telescope at 4.7 AU before aphelion, and at 24 micron with the
MIPS instrument on board the Spitzer Space Telescope at 5.7 AU both before and
after aphelion. The comet did not appear to be active during our observations.
Our images probe large dust grains emitted from the comet that have a radiation
pressure parameter beta<0.01. We compare our observations with simulated images
generated with a dynamical model of the cometary dust and constrain the
emission speeds, size distribution, production rate and geometric albedo of the
dust. We achieve the best fit to our data with a differential size distribution
exponent of -4.1, and emission speeds for a beta=0.01 particle of 25 m/s at
perihelion and 2 m/s at 3 AU. The dust production rate in our model is on the
order of 1000 kg/s at perihelion and 1 kg/s at 3 AU, and we require a dust
geometric albedo between 0.022 and 0.044. The production rates of large (>10
micron) particles required to reproduce the brightness of the trail are
sufficient to also account for the coma brightness observed while the comet was
inside 3 AU, and we infer that the cross-section in the coma of CG may be
dominated by grains of the order of 60-600 micron.
