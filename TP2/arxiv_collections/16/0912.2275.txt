The compound, Tb5Si3, crystallizing in Mn5Si3-type hexagonal structure, was
recently reported by us to exhibit a sudden and huge enhancement in electrical
resistivity (rho) at a critical magnetic field (H_cr) in the magnetically
ordered state (<70 K) tracking isothermal magnetization (M) behavior. We have
investigated the influence of external pressure (<15 kbar) and negative
chemical pressure induced by Ge substitution for Si on M and rho as a function
of temperature (5-300 K) and magnetic field (<120 kOe), with the primary aim of
understanding the field-induced anomalies. Focussing on isothermal M and
magnetoresistance (MR) at two temperatures, 5 and 20K, we find that this rho
anomaly persists under external as well as negative chemical pressures, however
with a large change in the H_cr. The pressure-derivative of H_cr is negative
and this trend and the MR behavior at the H_cr are comparable to that observed
in some Laves phase itinerant magnetic systems. On the basis of this
observation, we speculate that the magnetic fluctuations induced at this
critical field could be responsible for the MR anomal.ies
