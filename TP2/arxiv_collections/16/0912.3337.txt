We perform a systematic numerical study of the effects of the particle-size
ratio $R \ge 1$ on the properties of jammed binary mixtures. We find that
changing $R$ does not qualitatively affect the critical scaling of the pressure
and coordination number with the compression near the jamming transition, but
the critical volume fraction at the jamming transition varies with $R$.
Moreover, the static structure factor (density correlation) $S(k)$ strongly
depends on $R$ and shows distinct long wave-length behaviors between large and
small particles. Thus the previously reported behavior of $S(k)\sim k$ in the
long wave-length limit is only a special case in the $R\to 1$ limit, and cannot
be simply generalized to jammed systems with $R>1$.
