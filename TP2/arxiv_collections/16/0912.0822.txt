We describe a notion of (abstract) projective line over a field as a set
equipped with a certain first order structure, and a projectivity between
projective lines as a bijection preserving this structure. The structure in
question is that of a groupoid, with certain properties. This leads to a
natural notion of bundle of projective lines, forming a stack.
