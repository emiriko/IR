We demonstrate the cancellation of the differential ac Stark shift of the
microwave hyperfine clock transition in trapped $^{87}$Rb atoms. Recent
progress in metrology exploits so-called "magic wavelengths," whereby an atomic
ensemble can be trapped with laser light whose wavelength is chosen so that
both levels of an optical atomic transition experience identical ac Stark
shifts. Similar magic-wavelength techniques are not possible for the microwave
hyperfine transitions in the alkalis, due to their simple electronic structure.
We show, however, that ac Stark shift cancellation is indeed achievable for
certain values of wavelength, polarization, and magnetic field. The
cancellation comes at the expense of a small magnetic-field sensitivity. The
technique demonstrated here has implications for experiments involving the
precise control of optically-trapped neutral atoms.
