We consider extensions of the standard model based on open strings ending on
D-branes, in which gauge bosons and their associated gauginos exist as strings
attached to stacks of D-branes, and chiral matter exists as strings stretching
between intersecting D-branes. Under the assumptions that the fundamental
string scale is in the TeV range and the theory is weakly coupled, we study
models of supersymmetry for which signals of annihilating neutralino dark
matter are observable. In particular, we construct a model with a
supersymmetric R-symmetry violating (but R-parity conserving) effective
Lagrangian that allows for the s-wave annihilation of neutralinos, once
gauginos acquire mass through an unspecified mechanism. The model yields
bino-like neutralinos (with the measured relic abundance) that annihilate to a
gamma-gamma final state with a substantial branching fraction (~ 10%) that is
orders of magnitude larger than in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. A
very bright gamma-ray spectral line could be observed by gamma-ray telescopes.
