The duality between QCD perturbative series and power corrections recently
conjectured by Narison and Zakharov is analyzed. We propose to study
correlations between both contributions as diagnostics tool. A very strong
correlation between perturbative and non perturbative contributions is observed
for several observables at zero and at finite temperature supporting the
validity of the dual description.
