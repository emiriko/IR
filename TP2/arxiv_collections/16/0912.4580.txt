What do we mean by neutrino astronomy? Which information is it able to
provide us and which is its potential? To address these questions, we discuss
three among the most relevant sources of neutrinos: the Sun; the core collapse
supernovae; the supernova remnants. For each of these astronomical objects, we
describe the state of the art, we present the expectations and we outline the
most actual problems from the point of view of neutrino astronomy.
