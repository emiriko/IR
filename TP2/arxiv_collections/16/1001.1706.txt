The auxiliary field method is a powerful technique to obtain approximate
closed-form energy formulas for eigenequations in quantum mechanics. Very good
results can be obtained for Schr\"odinger and semirelativistic Hamiltonians
with various potentials, even in the case of many-body problems. This method
can also provide approximate eigenstates in terms of well known wavefunctions,
for instance harmonic oscillator or hydrogen-like states, but with a
characteristic size which depends on quantum numbers. In this paper, we
consider two-body Schr\"odinger equations with linear, logarithmic and
exponential potentials and show that analytical approximations of the
corresponding eigenstates can be obtained with the auxiliary field method, with
a very good accuracy in some cases.
