We here study fragmentation using \emph{simulated annealing clusterization
algorithm} (SACA) with binding energy at a microscopic level. In an earlier
version, a constant binding energy (4 MeV/nucleon) was used. We improve this
binding energy criterion by calculating the binding energy of different
clusters using modified Bethe-Weizs\"{a}cker mass (BWM) formula. We also
compare our calculations with experimental data of ALADiN group. Nearly no
effect is visible of this modification.
