We obtained spectro-interferometric observations in the visible of $\beta$
Lyrae and $\upsilon$ Sgr using the instrument VEGA of the CHARA interferometric
array. For $\beta$ Lyrae, the dispersed fringe visibilities and differential
phases were obtained in spectral regions containing the H$\alpha$ and HeI 6678
lines and the H$\beta$ and HeI 4921 lines. Whereas the source is unresolved in
the continuum, the source of the emission lines is resolved and the photocenter
of the bulk of the H$\alpha$ emission exhibits offsets correlated with the
orbital phase. For $\upsilon$ Sgr, both the continuum and H$\alpha$ sources are
resolved, but no clear binary signal is detected. The differential phase shift
across the line reveals that the bulk of the H$\alpha$ emission is clearly
offset from the primary.
