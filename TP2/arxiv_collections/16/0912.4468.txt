I present a model in which dark energy interacts with matter. The former is
represented by a variable equation of state. It is shown that the phantom
crossing takes place at zero redshift, moreover, stable scaling solution of the
Friedmann equations is obtained. I show that dark energy is most probably be
either generalized phantom energy or the generalized Chaplygin gas.
