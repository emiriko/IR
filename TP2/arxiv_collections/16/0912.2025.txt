The effect of pressure on superconductivity of 111 type NaxFeAs is
investigated through temperature dependent electrical resistance measurement in
a diamond anvil cell. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases
from 26 K to a maximum 31 K as the pressure increases from ambient to 3 GPa.
Further increasing pressure suppresses Tc drastically. The behavior of pressure
tuned Tc in NaxFeAs is much different from that in LixFeAs, although they have
the same Cu2Sb type structure
