Spontaneous excitation of the dominant mode in a spin-wave active ring -- a
self-exciting positive-feedback system incorporating a spin-wave transmission
structure -- occurs at a certain threshold value of external gain. In general,
the wavenumber of the dominant mode is extremely sensitive to the properties
and environment of the spin-wave transmission medium, and is almost impossible
to predict. In this letter, we report on a backward volume magnetostatic
spin-wave active ring system incorporating a magnonic crystal. When mode
enhancement conditions -- readily predicted by a theoretical model -- are
satisfied, the ring geometry permits highly robust and consistent forced
dominant wavenumber selection.
