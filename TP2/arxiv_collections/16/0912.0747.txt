Using measured spin-transfer rates from alkali atoms to He-3, combined with
spin-relaxation rates of the alkali atoms due to He-3 and He-4, it should be
possible to differentiate between isotropic and anisotropic spin-exchange. This
would give a fundamental limit on the He-3 polarization attainable in
spin-exchange optical pumping. For K-He, we find the limit to be 0.90+-0.11.
