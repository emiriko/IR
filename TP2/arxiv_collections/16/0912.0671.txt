We study the Ising antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice which are
interacting along three different directions via two $J$-bonds and one
anisotropic $J'$-bond with $J' \ge J$. Although its finite temperature state
has long been considered as simply disordered, we find a systematic generation
of a ferromagnetic $J'$-bonds named "good defects" each carrying the energy
$2\delta_J\equiv 2(J'-J)$. They exhibit an eminent correlation which is
regarded as a network or a soft lattice. The specific heat shows a universal
peak at $T^* \sim \delta_J$ and the corresponding energy follows the activation
type of temperature-dependence with an excitation gap $2\delta_J$. Energetics
and the crossover between this particular two-dimensional state and the other
disordered or one-dimensional states are discussed.
