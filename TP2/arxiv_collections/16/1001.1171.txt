We present a time-dependent radiative model for the atmosphere of extrasolar
planets that takes into account the eccentricity of their orbit. In addition to
the modulation of stellar irradiation by the varying planet-star distance, the
pseudo-synchronous rotation of the planets may play a significant role. We
include both of these time-dependent effects when modeling the planetary
thermal structure. We investigate the thermal structure, and spectral
characteristics for time-dependent stellar heating for two highly eccentric
planets. Finally, we discuss observational aspects for those planets suitable
for Spitzer measurements, and investigate the role of the rotation rate.
