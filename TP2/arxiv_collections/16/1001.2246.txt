On the basis of measurements of the V-band sky brightness obtained at Cerro
Tololo Inter-American Observatory in December 2006 and December 2008 we confirm
the functional form of the basic model of Garstang (1989, 1991). At high zenith
angles we measure an enhancement of a factor of two over Garstang's later model
when there is no marine cloud layer over La Serena/Coquimbo. No corresponding
enhancement is found in the B-band.
