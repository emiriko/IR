We have studied the phenomenology of pion condensation in 2-flavor neutral
quark matter at finite density with Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model of QCD. We
have discussed the role of the bare quark mass $m$ and the electric chemical
potential $\mu_{e}$ in controlling the condensation. The central result of this
work is that the onset for $\pi$-condensed phase occurs when $|\mu_{e}|$
reaches the value of the in-medium pion mass $M_{\pi}$ provided the transition
is of the second order, even for a composite pion system in the medium.
Finally, we have shown that the condensation is extremely fragile with respect
to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking via a finite current quark mass.
