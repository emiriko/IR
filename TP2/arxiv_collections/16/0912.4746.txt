In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 097403 (2009)], we outlined a
computational method to calculate the optical properties of structures with a
spatially nonlocal dielectric function. In this Article, we detail the full
method, and verify it against analytical results for cylindrical nanowires.
Then, as examples of our method, we calculate the optical properties of Au
nanostructures in one, two, and three dimensions. We first calculate the
transmission, reflection, and absorption spectra of thin films. Because of
their simplicity, these systems demonstrate clearly the longitudinal (or
volume) plasmons characteristic of nonlocal effects, which result in anomalous
absorption and plasmon blueshifting. We then study the optical properties of
spherical nanoparticles, which also exhibit such nonlocal effects. Finally, we
compare the maximum and average electric field enhancements around nanowires of
various shapes to local theory predictions. We demonstrate that when nonlocal
effects are included, significant decreases in such properties can occur.
