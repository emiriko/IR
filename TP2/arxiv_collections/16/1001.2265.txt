We consider a model for quark and lepton masses and mixings based on S4
flavor symmetry. The model contains six Higgs doublets where three of them give
mass to the leptons and the other three gives mass to the quarks. Charged
fermion and quark masses arise from renormalizable interactions while neutrino
Majorana masses are generated through effective dimension five Weinberg
operator. From the study of the minimization of the scalar potential we found a
residual mu-tau symmetry in the neutrino sector predicting zero reactor angle
and maximal atmospheric angle and for the quark sector we found a four-zero
texture. We give a fit of the mass hierarchies and mixing angles in the quark
sector.
