Let X be a smooth projective variety defined over an algebraically closed
field k. Nori constructed a category of vector bundles on X, called essentially
finite vector bundles, which is reminiscent of the category of representations
of the fundamental group (in characteristic zero). In fact, this category is
equivalent to the category of representations of a pro--finite group scheme
which controls all finite torsors. We show that essentially finite vector
bundles coincide with those which become trivial after being pulled back by
some proper and surjective morphism to X.
