Everett's relative states interpretation of quantum mechanics has met with
problems related to probability, the preferred basis, and multiplicity. The
third theme, I argue, is the most important one. It has led to developments of
the original approach into many-worlds, many-minds, and decoherence-based
approaches. The latter especially have been advocated in recent years, in an
effort to understand multiplicity without resorting to what is often perceived
as extravagant constructions. Drawing from and adding to arguments of others, I
show that proponents of decoherence-based approaches have not yet succeeded in
making their ontology clear.
