The most direct probe of non-Gaussian initial conditions has come from
bispectrum measurements of temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave
Background and of the matter and galaxy distribution at large scales. Such
bispectrum estimators are expected to continue to provide the best constraints
on the non-Gaussian parameters in future observations. We review and compare
the theoretical and observational problems, current results and future
prospects for the detection of a non-vanishing primordial component in the
bispectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background and large-scale structure, and
the relation to specific predictions from different inflationary models.
