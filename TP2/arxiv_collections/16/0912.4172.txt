We propose an asymmetric double quantum well structure with a common
continuum and investigate the effect of resonant tunneling on the control of
coherent electron population transfer between the two quantum wells. By
numerically solving the motion equations of element moments, the almost
complete electron population transfer from initial subband to the target
subband could be realized due to the constructive interference via flexibly
adjusting the structure parameters.
