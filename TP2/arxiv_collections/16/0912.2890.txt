A semi-empirical three-dimensional model of turbulence in the approximation
of the far turbulent wake behind a body of revolution in a passive stratified
medium is considered. The sought quantities are the kinetic turbulent energy,
kinetic energy dissipation rate, averaged density defect and density
fluctuation variance. The full group of transformations admitted by this model
is found. The model is reduced to the system of the ordinary differential
equations due to similarity presentations obtained and B-determining equations
method. System of ordinary differential equations satisfying natural boundary
conditions was solved numerically. The solutions obtained agree with
experimental data.
