We present here an analogue of the Brian\c{c}on-Skoda theorem for a germ of
an analytic space $Z$ at 0, such that $O_{Z,0}$ is Cohen-Macaulay, but not
necessarily reduced. More precisely, we find a sufficient condition for
membership of a function in a power of an arbitrary ideal $a^l \subset O_{Z,0}$
in terms of size conditions of Noetherian differential operators applied to
that function. This result generalizes a theorem by Huneke in the reduced case.
