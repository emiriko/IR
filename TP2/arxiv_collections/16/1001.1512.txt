High-precision measurements of the scattering observables such as cross
sections and analyzing powers for the proton-deuteron elastic and break-up
reactions have been performed at KVI in the last two decades and elsewhere to
investigate various aspects of the three-nucleon force (3NF) effects
simultaneously. In 2006 an experiment was performed to study these effects in
$\vec{p}+d$ break-up reaction at 135 MeV with the detection system, Big
Instrument for Nuclear polarization Analysis, BINA. BINA covers almost the
entire kinematical phase space of the break-up reaction. The results are
interpreted with the help of state-of-the-art Faddeev calculations and are
partly presented in this contribution.
