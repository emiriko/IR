It is widely recognized that the AdS/CFT correspondence is a useful tool to
study strongly coupled field theories. On the other hand, Randall-Sundrum (RS)
braneworld models have been actively discussed as a novel cosmological
framework. Interestingly, the geometrical set up of braneworlds is quite
similar to that in the AdS/CFT correspondence. Hence, it is legitimate to seek
a precise relation between these two different frameworks. In this lecture, I
will explain how the AdS/CFT correspondence is related to the RS braneworld
models. There are two different versions of RS braneworlds, namely, the
single-brane model and the two-brane model. In the case of the single-brane
model, we reveal the relation between the geometrical and the AdS/CFT
correspondence approach using the gradient expansion method. It turns out that
the high energy and the Weyl term corrections found in the geometrical approach
correspond to the CFT matter correction found in the AdS/CFT correspondence
approach. In the case of two-brane system, we also show that the AdS/CFT
correspondence plays an important role in the sense that the low energy
effective field theory can be described by the conformally coupled
scalar-tensor theory where the radion plays the role of the scalar field. We
also discuss dilatonic braneworld models from the point of view of the AdS/CFT
correspondence.
