We investigate numerically the free-fall expansion of a $^{87}$Rb atoms
condensate at nonzero temperatures. The classical field approximation is used
to separate the condensate and the thermal cloud during the expansion. We
calculate the radial and axial widths of the expanding condensate and find
clear evidence that the thermal component changes the dynamics of the
condensate. Our results are confronted against the experimental data.
