We study the dynamics of one and two qubits plunged in a q-deformed
oscillators environment. Specifically we evaluate the decay of quantum
coherence and entanglement in time when passing from bosonic to fermionic
environments. Slowing down of decoherence in the fermionic case is found. The
effect only manifests at finite temperature.
