The physical origin of holographic dark energy (HDE) is investigated. The
main existing explanations, namely the UV/IR connection argument of Cohen et
al, Thomas' bulk holography argument, and Ng's spacetime foam argument, are
shown to be not satisfactory. A new explanation of the HDE model is then
proposed based on the ideas of Thomas and Ng. It is suggested that the dark
energy might originate from the quantum fluctuations of spacetime limited by
the event horizon of the universe. Several potential problems of the
explanation are also discussed.
