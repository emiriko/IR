We briefly review analytic approximations of thermodynamic functions of fully
ionized nonideal electron-ion plasmas, applicable in a wide range of plasma
parameters, including the domains of nondegenerate and degenerate,
nonrelativistic and relativistic electrons, weakly and strongly coupled Coulomb
liquids, classical and quantum Coulomb crystals. We present improvements to
previously published approximations. Our code for calculation of thermodynamic
functions based on the reviewed approximations is made publicly available.
