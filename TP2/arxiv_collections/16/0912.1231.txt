In this chapter, we elaborate on the topic of European integration in
science. We will not deal with questions related to the effects of European
integration, but only with the scientometric question how one can
quantitatively indicate integration of the European science system. Our study
is intended to facilitate and supplement debates rather than to provide a final
answer to the questions whether European integration 'exists'. In this chapter,
we first discuss the use of scientometric indicators in research evaluation
from a historical perspective in (section 2). A discussion of European science
policy follows (section 3). Then, we introduce a number of indicators of
integration and discuss our empirical results concerning the evolution of the
European science system in the 1980s and 1990s (section 4). We close the
chapter with a discussion of possible avenues of future research for enhancing
research evaluation (section 5).
