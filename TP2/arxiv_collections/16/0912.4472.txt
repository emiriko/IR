Gene trees are evolutionary trees representing the ancestry of genes sampled
from multiple populations. Species trees represent populations of individuals
-- each with many genes -- splitting into new populations or species. The
coalescent process, which models ancestry of gene copies within populations, is
often used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed
species tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for
phylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum
likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching
process over time, all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this
setting. Often, however, gene trees inferred by traditional phylogenetic
methods are unrooted.
  We investigate probabilities of unrooted gene trees under the multispecies
coalescent model. We show that when there are 4 species with one gene sampled
per species, the distribution of unrooted gene tree topologies identifies the
unrooted species tree topology and some, but not all, information in the
species tree edges (branch lengths). The location of the root on the species
tree is not identifiable in this situation. However, for 5 or more species with
one gene sampled per species, we show that the distribution of unrooted gene
tree topologies identifies the rooted species tree topology and all its
internal branch lengths. The length of any pendent branch leading to a leaf of
the species tree is also identifiable for any species from which more than one
gene is sampled.
