General conditions of stability of a very dense deuterium-tritium plasma ball
are discussed. It is shown that the decrease in the size of a plasma ball
(increase in the plasma density) can be expected only when the temperature and
the pressure in the plasma ball are kept high enough for all the particles, the
nuclei and the delocalized electrons, to be described by classical statistics.
