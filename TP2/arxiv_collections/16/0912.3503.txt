We survey the most important results and some recent developments about the
secure key exchange protocol where the security is based on the Second Law of
Thermodynamics and the robustness of classical physical information. We
conclude that a classical physical system offers a higher level of control and
security during the communication. We also mention some recent attempts
inspired by this communicator to create other systems where Alice and Bob do
not form an organic single system and/or the Second Law is irrelevant. It seems
philosophically that they cannot be unconditionally secure, however it is yet
an open question how to crack them; how can they be best used for conditionally
secure communications, and what are the practical implications.
