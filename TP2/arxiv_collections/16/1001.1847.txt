In this note, we would like to find the laws of electrodynamics in simple
economic systems. In this direction, we identify the chief economic variables
and parameters, scalar and vector, which are amenable to be put directly into
the crouch of the laws of electrodynamics, namely Maxwell's equations.
Moreover, we obtain Phillp's curve, recession and Black-Scholes formula, as
sample applications.
