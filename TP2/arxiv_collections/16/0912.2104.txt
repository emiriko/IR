The inclusive Higgs production cross section from gluon fusion is calculated
through NNLO QCD, including its top quark mass dependence. This is achieved
through a matching of the 1/mtop expansion of the partonic cross sections to
the exact large s-hat limits which are derived from k_T-factorization. The
accuracy of this procedure is estimated to be better than 1% for the hadronic
cross section. The final result is shown to be within 1% of the commonly used
effective theory approach, thus confirming earlier findings.
