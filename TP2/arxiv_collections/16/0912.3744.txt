Quantum teleportation enables deterministic and faithful transmission of
quantum states, provided a maximally entangled state is pre-shared between
sender and receiver, and a one-way classical channel is available. Here, we
prove that these resources are not only sufficient, but also necessary, for
deterministically and faithfully sending quantum states through any fixed noisy
channel of maximal rank, when a single use of the cannel is admitted. In other
words, for this family of channels, there are no other protocols, based on
different (and possibly cheaper) sets of resources, capable of replacing
quantum teleportation.
