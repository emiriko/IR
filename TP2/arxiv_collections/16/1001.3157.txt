We show that the 1/8 BPS condition for composite stationary black holes can
be rewritten as a first order system of differential equations associated to
the nilpotent orbit in which lie the Noether charges of the black holes.
Solving these equations, we prove that the most general 1/8 BPS black hole
composites are solutions of the N=2 truncation of the theory associated to the
quaternions. This system of first order differential equations generalises to
the non-BPS solutions with a vanishing central charge at the horizon in N=2, 4
supergravity theories with a symmetric moduli space. We solve these equations
for the exceptional N=2 supergravity associated to the octonions.
