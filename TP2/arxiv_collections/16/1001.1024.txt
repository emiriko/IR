We investigate an exactly solvable model for directional transport in 1D. The
structured system, which has strong elastic interactions in its parts,
explicitly demonstrates the role of volume exclusion in producing directional
transport. We capture the complementary role of the elasticity and volume
exclusion as the basic ingredient for showing up of broken microscopic symmetry
at the scale of macroscopic motions. We compare the analytic results with the
numerical simulation.
