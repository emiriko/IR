We study the power of nonadaptive quantum query algorithms, which are
algorithms whose queries to the input do not depend on the result of previous
queries. First, we show that any bounded-error nonadaptive quantum query
algorithm that computes some total boolean function depending on n variables
must make Omega(n) queries to the input in total. Second, we show that, if
there exists a quantum algorithm that uses k nonadaptive oracle queries to
learn which one of a set of m boolean functions it has been given, there exists
a nonadaptive classical algorithm using O(k log m) queries to solve the same
problem. Thus, in the nonadaptive setting, quantum algorithms can achieve at
most a very limited speed-up over classical query algorithms.
