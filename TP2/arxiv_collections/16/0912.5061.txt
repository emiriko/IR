Inspired by the newly observed $X$(4160) and $X$(3915) states, we analyze the
mass spectrum of these states in different quark models and calculate their
strong decay widths by the $^3P_0$ model. According to the mass spectrum of
charmonium states predicted by the potential model, the states $\chi_0(3^3P_0),
\chi_1(3^3P_1), \eta_{c2}(2^1D_2), \eta_c(4^1S_0)$ all can be candidates for
the $X$(4160). However, only the decay width of the state $\eta_{c2}(2^1D_2)$
in our calculation is in good agreement with the data reported by Belle and the
decay of $\eta_{c2}(2^1D_2)\to D\bar{D}$, which is not seen in experiment, is
also forbidden. Therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the charmonium state
$\eta_{c2}(2^1D_2)$ as the state X(4160). For the state X(3915), although the
mass of $\chi_0(2^3P_0)$ is compatible with the experimental value, the
calculated strong decay width is much larger than experimental data. Hence, the
assignment of X(3915) to charmonium state $\chi_0(2^3P_0)$ is disfavored in our
calculation.
