One of the key challenges of the society development is related to public
health and one of its specific targets includes better treatments of diseases.
It is true that there are affections which by their nature do not endanger the
life of a person, but they may have negative implications during his/her
lifetime. Various language or speech disorders are part of this category.
Discovered and treated in time, they can be corrected, most often in childhood.
Because the Romanian language is a phonetic one that has its own special
linguistic particularities, there is a real need to develop advanced
information systems, which can be used to assist and help specialists in
different speech disorders therapy. The aim of this paper is to present a few
CBTS developed for the treatment of various language and speech disorders
specific to the Romanian language.
