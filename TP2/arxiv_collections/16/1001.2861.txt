Temkin's 1963 article on one-way fluxes and flux ratios in steady-state
reaction systems bears directly on current research in physical and biological
chemistry, such as in the interpretation of metabolic exchange fluxes
determined from isotopomer labeling experiments. Yet, originally published in
Russian [Dolk. Akad. Nauk SSSR 152, 156-159 (1963)], this article has remained
inaccessible to much of the scientific community. Here we provide an English
translation of the original article with several additional clarifications and
corrections.
