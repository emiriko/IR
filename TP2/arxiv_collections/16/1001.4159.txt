We propose a simple three-body model of an atom in which one electron on a
circular Rydberg orbit is treated as an independent particle and the remaining
core electrons are collectively described as a single object. Within this model
we predict the existence of stable deformed states of atoms. The deformation is
generated by a bootstrap mechanism. The atomic core is polarized by the excited
electron and the induced dipole moment keeps this electron localized. The
deformed stable states of the atom are similar to the Trojan states observed in
recent experiments. However, in the present case the breaking of the rotational
symmetry does not require the presence of external fields.
