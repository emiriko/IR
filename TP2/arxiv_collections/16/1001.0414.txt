The Kepler mission provides an exciting opportunity to study the lightcurves
of stars with unprecedented precision and continuity of coverage. This is the
first look at a large sample of stars with photometric data of a quality that
has heretofore been only available for our Sun. It provides the first
opportunity to compare the irradiance variations of our Sun to a large cohort
of stars ranging from vary similar to rather different stellar properties, at a
wide variety of ages. Although Kepler data is in an early phase of maturity,
and we only analyze the first month of coverage, it is sufficient to garner the
first meaningful measurements of our Sun's variability in the context of a
large cohort of main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood. We find that
nearly half of the full sample is more active than the active Sun, although
most of them are not more than twice as active. The active fraction is closer
to a third for the stars most similar to the Sun, and rises to well more than
half for stars cooler than mid K spectral types.
