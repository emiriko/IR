We examine the speed and fidelity of several protocols for state or single
excitation transfer in finite spin chains subject to diagonal and off-diagonal
disorder. We find that, for a given chain length and maximal achievable
inter-spin exchange (XY) coupling strength, the optimal static spin-coupling
protocol, implementing the fastest state transfer between the two ends of the
chain, is more susceptible to off-diagonal (XY coupling) disorder, as compared
to a much slower but robust adiabatic transfer protocol with time-dependent
coupling strengths.
