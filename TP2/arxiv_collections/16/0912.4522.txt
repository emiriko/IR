In this paper we deal with the generalized Gamma processes and their
compositions. For the compositions of two or more than two generalized Gamma
processes we give, when possible, the explicit law whereas, in the other cases
the representations in terms of Fox's H-functions are given. We also study the
connections between iteration and product of random processes by exploiting the
properties of the generalized Gamma processes, such a study allows us to obtain
some striking result about the compositions of the Cauchy processes or
fractional Brownian motions. Furthermore, we find out the partial differential
equations governing the generalized Gamma processes and their compositions
