Within the scheme of quantum rate equations, we investigate the spin-resolved
transport through a double quantum dot system with four ferromagnetic
terminals. It is found that the injection efficiency of spin-polarized
electrons can be significantly improved compared with single dot case. When the
magnetization in one of four ferromagnetic terminals is antiparallel with the
other three, the polarization rate of the current through one dot can be
greatly enhanced, accompanied by the drastic decrease of the current
polarization rate through the other one. The mechanism is the exchange
interaction between electrons in the two quantum dots, which can be a promising
candidate for the improvement of the spin injection efficiency.
