We consider a class of multicomponent nonlinear Schrodinger equations (MNLS)
related to the symmetric BD.I-type symmetric spaces. As important particular
case of these MNLS we obtain the Kulish-Sklyanin model. Some new reductions and
their effects on the soliton solutions are obtained by proper modifying the
Zakahrov-Shabat dressing method.
