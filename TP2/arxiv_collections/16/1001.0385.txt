This article extends the previous paper in "M.W. Yuen, \textit{Stabilities
for Euler-Poisson Equations in Some Special Dimensions}, J. Math. Anal. Appl.
\textbf{344} (2008), no. 1, 145--156.", from the Euler-Poisson equations for
attractive forces to the repulsive ones in $R^{N}$ $(N\geq2)$. The similar
stabilities of the system are studied. Additionally, we explain that it is
impossible to have the density collapsing solutions with compact support to the
system with repulsive forces for $\gamma>1$.
