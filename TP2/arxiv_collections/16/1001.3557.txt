In this paper we study the unique solvability of backward stochastic Volterra
integral equations (BSVIEs in short), in terms of both the M-solutions
introduced in [17] and the adapted solutions in [6], [12] or [14]. A general
existence and uniqueness of M-solutions is proved under non-Lipschitz
conditions by virtue of a briefer argument than the one in [17], which also
extends the results in [17]. For the adapted solutions, the unique solvability
of BSVIEs, under more general stochastic non-Lipschitz conditions, is obtained
which generalizes the results in [6], [12] and [14].
