We study the outer-shock structure of the oxygen-rich supernova remnant
G292.0+1.8, using a deep observation with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We
measure radial variations of the electron temperature and emission measure that
we identify as the outer shock propagating into a medium with a radially
decreasing density profile. The inferred ambient density structure is
consistent with models for the circumstellar wind of a massive progenitor star
rather than for a uniform interstellar medium. The estimated wind density n_H =
0.1 ~ 0.3 cm^-3) at the current outer radius (~7.7 pc) of the remnant is
consistent with a slow wind from a red supergiant (RSG) star. The total mass of
the wind is estimated to be ~ 15 - 40 solar mass (depending on the estimated
density range), assuming that the wind extended down to near the surface of the
progenitor. The overall kinematics of G292.0+1.8 are consistent with the
remnant expanding through the RSG wind.
