We propose and theoretically investigate spin superconducting qubits. Spin
superconducting qubit consists of a single spin confined in a Josephson
junction. We show that owing to spin-orbit interaction, superconducting
difference across the junction can polarize this spin. We demonstrate that this
enables single qubit operations and more complicated quantum gates, where spins
of different qubits interact via a mutual inductance of superconducting loop
where the junctions are embedded. Recent experimental realizations of Josephson
junctions made of semiconductor quantum dots in contact with superconducting
leads have shown that the number of electrons in the quantum dot can be tuned
by a gate voltage. Spin superconducting qubit is realized when the number of
electrons is odd. We discuss the qubit properties at phenomenological level. We
present a microscopic theory that enables us to make accurate estimations of
the qubit parameters by evaluating the spin-dependent Josephson energy in the
framework of fourth-order perturbation theory.
