We get the general expression for the stability criterion with respect to the
internal kink under helicoidal discharges, if one assumes that the helicity is
finite and the aspect ratio is large (hx<<1). We show that the helicity
relative to the cylindric topology has a stabilizing effect. This effect can be
greater than the toric effect when the helicoidal pitch is smaller than the
toric radius.
