We study the holographic dual string configuration of 1/2 BPS circular Wilson
loops in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory by using the global coordinate of AdS. The
dual string worldsheet is given by the Poincare disk AdS_2 sitting at a
constant global time slice of AdS_5. We also analyze the correlator of two
concentric circular Wilson loops from the global AdS perspective and study the
phase transition associated with the instability of annulus worldsheet
connecting the two Wilson loops.
