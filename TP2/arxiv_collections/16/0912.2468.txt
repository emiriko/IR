A central endeavor of thermodynamics is the measurement of free energy
changes. Regrettably, although we can measure the free energy of a system in
thermodynamic equilibrium, typically all we can say about the free energy of a
non-equilibrium ensemble is that it is larger than that of the same system at
equilibrium. Herein, we derive a formally exact expression for the probability
distribution of a driven system, which involves path ensemble averages of the
work over trajectories of the time-reversed system. From this we find a simple
near-equilibrium approximation for the free energy in terms of an excess mean
time-reversed work, which can be experimentally measured on real systems. With
analysis and computer simulation, we demonstrate the accuracy of our
approximations for several simple models.
