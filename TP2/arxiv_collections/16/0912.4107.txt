A new [48,16,16] optimal linear binary block code is given. To get this code
a general construction is used which is also described in this paper. The
construction of this new code settles an conjecture mentioned in a 2008 paper
by Janosov et al. where the authors found an new optimal [47,15,16]-code, which
is relevant to the applied construction.
