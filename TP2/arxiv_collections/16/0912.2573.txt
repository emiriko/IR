A field of random space-time events exhibiting complete spatial-temporal
randomness appears statistically identical to all observers. Boost invariant
lengths naturally emerge when we examine fluctuation scales of this field such
as the nearest neighbor distance. If we interpret Planck's length as the
characteristic fluctuation scale of quantum gravity, its boost invariance can
then be understood without modifying Special Relativity.
