The Eynard-Orantin invariants of a plane curve are multilinear differentials
on the curve. For a particular class of genus zero plane curves these
invariants can be equivalently expressed in terms of simpler expressions given
by polynomials obtained from an expansion of the Eynard-Orantin invariants
around a point on the curve. This class of curves contains many interesting
examples.
