The criticality of vacancy-induced metal-insulator transition (MIT) in
graphene is investigated by Kubo-Greenwood formula with tight-binding recursion
method. The critical vacancy concentration for the MIT is determined to be
0.053%. The scaling laws for transport properties near the critical point are
examined showing several unconventional 2D localization behaviors. Our
theoretical results have shed some new lights to the understanding of recent
experiments in H-dosed graphene and of 2D disordered systems in general.
