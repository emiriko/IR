We propose a novel approach to quasiparticle GW calculations which does not
require the computation of unoccupied electronic states. In our approach the
screened Coulomb interaction is evaluated by solving self-consistent
linear-response Sternheimer equations, and the noninteracting Green's function
is evaluated by solving inhomogeneous linear systems. The frequency-dependence
of the screened Coulomb interaction is explicitly taken into account. In order
to avoid the singularities of the screened Coulomb interaction the calculations
are performed along the imaginary axis, and the results are analytically
continued to the real axis through Pade' approximants. As a proof of concept we
implemented the proposed methodology within the empirical pseudopotential
formalism and we validated our implementation using silicon as a test case. We
examine the advantages and limitations of our method and describe promising
future directions.
