We provide a physical interpretation of the Kirchhoff index of any molecules
as well as of the Wiener index of acyclic ones. For the purpose, we use a local
vertex invariant that is obtained from first principles and describes the
atomic displacements due to small vibrations/oscillations of atoms from their
equilibrium positions. In addition, we show that the topological atomic
displacements correlate with the temperature factors (B-factors) of atoms
obtained by X-ray crystallography for both organic molecules and biological
macromolecules.
