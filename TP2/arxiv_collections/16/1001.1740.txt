We examine whether the super star-forming clumps (R~1-3 kpc; M~10^8-10^9.5
Msun) now known to be a key component of star-forming galaxies at z~2 could be
the formation sites of the locally observed old globular cluster population. We
find that the stellar populations of these super star-forming clumps are
excellent matches to those of local metal-rich globular clusters. Moreover,
this globular cluster population is known to be associated with the bulges /
thick disks of galaxies, and we show that its spatial distribution and
kinematics are consistent with the current understanding of the assembly of
bulges and thick disks from super star-forming clumps at high redshift.
Finally, with the assumption that star formation in these clumps proceeds as a
scaled-up version of local star formation in molecular clouds, this formation
scenario reproduces the observed numbers and mass spectra of metal-rich
globular clusters. The resulting link between the turbulent and clumpy disks
observed in high-redshift galaxies and a local globular cluster population
provides a plausible co-evolutionary scenario for several of the major
components of a galaxy: the bulge, the thick disk, and one of the globular
cluster populations.
