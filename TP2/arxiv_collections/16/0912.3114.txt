Equation of motion and the vector of perturbing acceleration (force) for the
galactic tide in a noninertial frame of reference is derived. The noninertial
reference frame is rotating with a fixed angular velocity $\vec{\omega}$ $=$
$-$ $\omega_{0}$ $\hat{\vec{z}}$ with respect to the inertial frame of
reference of the Galaxy. $\vec{\omega}$ is the angular velocity of the solar
rotation (rotation of the Local Standard of Rest) around the galactic center,
the unit vector $\hat{\vec{z}}$ is oriented toward the north pole of the
Galaxy: the Sun is always situated in the plane $y'$ $=$ 0 ($x' - z'$-plane).
The equation of motion can be applied to the dynamics of the Oort cloud of
comets. Relations for calculation of the osculating orbital elements are
presented and a new integral of motion is derived for the conventional approach
in modelling of the effect of the galactic tidal field.
