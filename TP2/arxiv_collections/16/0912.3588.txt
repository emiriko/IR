We present a design for simulating quantum pumping of electrons in a
mesoscopic circuit with ultra-cold atoms in a micro-magnetic chip trap. We
calculate theoretical results for quantum pumping of both bosons and fermions,
identifying differences and common features, including geometric behavior and
resonance transmission. We analyze the feasibility of experiments with bosonic
$^{87}$Rb and fermionic $^{40}$K atoms with an emphasis on reliable atomic
current measurements.
