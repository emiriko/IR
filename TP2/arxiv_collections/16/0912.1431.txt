Motivated by the motion of biopolymers and membranes in solution, this
article presents a formulation of the equations of motion for curves and
surfaces in a viscous fluid. We focus on geometrical aspects and simple
variational methods for calculating internal stresses and forces, and we derive
the full nonlinear equations of motion. In the case of membranes, we pay
particular attention to the formulation of the equations of hydrodynamics on a
curved, deforming surface. The formalism is illustrated by two simple case
studies: (1) the twirling instability of straight elastic rod rotating in a
viscous fluid, and (2) the pearling and buckling instabilities of a tubular
liposome or polymersome.
