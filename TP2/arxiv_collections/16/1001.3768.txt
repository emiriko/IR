Evolutionary game dynamics describes not only frequency dependent genetical
evolution, but also cultural evolution in humans. In this context, successful
strategies spread by imitation. It has been shown that the details of strategy
update rules can have a crucial impact on evolutionary dynamics in theoretical
models and e.g. significantly alter the level of cooperation in social
dilemmas. But what kind of strategy update rules can describe imitation
dynamics in humans? Here, we present a way to measure such strategy update
rules in a behavioral experiment. We use a setting in which individuals are
virtually arranged on a spatial lattice. This produces a large number of
different strategic situations from which we can assess strategy updating. Most
importantly, spontaneous strategy changes corresponding to mutations or
exploration behavior are more frequent than assumed in many models. Our
experimental approach to measure properties of the update mechanisms used in
theoretical models will be useful for mathematical models of cultural
evolution.
