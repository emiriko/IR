We present in this letter a theoretical analysis of the current-voltage (I-V)
characteristics of a hybrid normal-superconducting device consisting of a
quantum dot and two electrodes that can be either normal or superconducting. We
show that voltage drops at two different contacts that have been regarded
unimportant in literature play essential roles in the Andreev tunneling process
when at least one of electrodes is superconducting. A
differential-conductance-anomaly caused by the aforementioned voltage drops is
predicted. We also propose a new spectroscopy method to measure the energy
levels of a quantum dot as well as voltage drops at contacts between the
quantum dot and the two leads. Our findings have potential applications for the
next generation of electronic devices at nanoscale.
