Mechanically compatible and electrically neutral domain walls in tetragonal,
orthorhombic and rhombohedral ferroelectric phases of BaTiO3 are systematically
investigated in the framework of the phenomenological
Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire (GLD) model with parameters of Ref. [Hlinka and
Marton, Phys. Rev. 74, 104104 (2006)]. Polarization and strain profiles within
domain walls are calculated numerically and within an approximation leading to
the quasi-one-dimensional analytic solutions applied previously to the
ferroelectric walls of the tetragonal phase [W. Cao and L.E. Cross, Phys. Rev.
44, 5 (1991)]. Domain wall thicknesses and energy densities are estimated for
all mechanically compatible and electrically neutral domain wall species in the
entire temperature range of ferroelectric phases. The model suggests that the
lowest energy walls in the orthorhombic phase of BaTiO3 are the 90-degree and
60-degree walls. In the rhombohedral phase, the lowest energy walls are the
71-degree and 109-degree walls. All these ferroelastic walls have thickness
below 1 nm except for the 90-degree wall in the tetragonal phase and the
60-degree S-wall in the orthorhombic phase, for which the larger thickness of
the order of 5 nm was found. The antiparallel walls of the rhombohedral phase
have largest energy and thus they are unlikely to occur. The calculation
indicates that the lowest energy structure of the 109-degree wall and few other
domain walls in the orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases resemble Bloch-like
walls known from magnetism.
