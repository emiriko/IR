We present new optical and near infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy of
the type IIP supernova, SN 2004et. In combination with already published data,
this provides one of the most complete studies of optical and NIR data for any
type IIP SN from just after explosion to +500 days. The contribution of the NIR
flux to the bolometric light curve is estimated to increase from 15% at
explosion to around 50% at the end of the plateau and then declines to 40% at
300 days. SN 2004et is one of the most luminous IIP SNe which has been well
studied, and with a luminosity of log L = 42.3 erg/s, it is 2 times brighter
than SN 1999em. We provide parametrised bolometric corrections as a function of
time for SN 2004et and three other IIP SNe that have extensive optical and NIR
data, which can be used as templates for future events. We compare the physical
parameters of SN 2004et with those of other IIP SNe and find kinetic energies
spanning the range of 10^50-10^51 ergs. We compare the ejected masses
calculated from hydrodynamic models with the progenitor masses and limits
derived from prediscovery images. Some of the ejected mass estimates are
significantly higher than the progenitor mass estimates, with SN 2004et showing
perhaps the most serious mass discrepancy. With current models, it appears
difficult to reconcile 100 day plateau lengths and high expansion velocities
with the low ejected masses of 5-6 Msun implied from 7-8 Msun progenitors. The
nebular phase is studied using very late time HST photometry, along with
optical and NIR spectroscopy. The light curve shows a clear flattening at 600
days in the optical and the NIR, which is likely due to the ejecta impacting on
the CSM. We further show that the [Oi] 6300,6364 Angstrom line strengths of
four type IIP SNe imply ejected oxygen masses of 0.5-1.5 Msun.
