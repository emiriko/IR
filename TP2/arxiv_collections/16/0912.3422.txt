We show that the eigenvalue density of a product X=X_1 X_2 ... X_M of M
independent NxN Gaussian random matrices in the large-N limit is rotationally
symmetric in the complex plane and is given by a simple expression
rho(z,\bar{z}) = 1/(M\pi\sigma^2} |z|^{-2+2/M} for |z|<\sigma, and is zero for
|z|> \sigma. The parameter \sigma corresponds to the radius of the circular
support and is related to the amplitude of the Gaussian fluctuations. This form
of the eigenvalue density is highly universal. It is identical for products of
Gaussian Hermitian, non-Hermitian, real or complex random matrices. It does not
change even if the matrices in the product are taken from different Gaussian
ensembles. We present a self-contained derivation of this result using a planar
diagrammatic technique for Gaussian matrices. We also give a numerical evidence
suggesting that this result applies also to matrices whose elements are
independent, centered random variables with a finite variance.
