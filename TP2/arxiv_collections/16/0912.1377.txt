For heavy-ion collisions at RHIC a scaling behavior is found in the
dependencies on azimuthal angle $\phi$ and impact parameter $b$ for pion
production at high $p_T$ essentially independent of the hadronization process.
The scaling variable is in terms of a dynamical path length $\xi$ that takes
into account detailed properties of geometry, medium density and probability of
hard scattering. It is shown in the recombination model how the nuclear
modification factor depends on the average $\bar\xi(\phi,b)$. The data for
$\pi^0$ production at $p_T=$ 4-5 and 7-8 GeV/c at RHIC are shown to exhibit the
same scaling behavior as found in the model calculation. Extension to
back-to-back dijet production has been carried out, showing the existence of
$\bar\xi$ scaling also in the away-side yield per trigger. At LHC the
hard-parton density can be high enough to realize the likelihood of
recombination of shower partons arising from neighboring jets. It is shown that
such 2-jet recombination can cause strong violation of $\bar\xi$ scaling.
Furthermore, the large value of $R_{AA}$ that exceeds 1 can become a striking
signature of such a hadronization process at high energy.
