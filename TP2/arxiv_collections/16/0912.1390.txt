Background: The pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) is a serious on-going global
public crisis. Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental
importance for both public health and scientific researches. Recent studies
have focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which
strongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social
contacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of
confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's
law and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also found a
hierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to
countries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control
effects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the
need of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the
impact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the
model and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical
spreading properties observed in empirical data.
  Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although
strict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in
the regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention
after the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the
largest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the
spreading. This work provided not only a deeper understanding of the generic
mechanisms underlying the spread of infectious diseases, but also some
practical guidelines for decision makers to adopt suitable control strategies.
