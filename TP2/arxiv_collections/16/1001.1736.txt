We investigate the (large-scale) bar fraction in a mass-complete sample of M
> 10^10.5 Msun disk galaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.6 in the COSMOS field. The fraction
of barred disks strongly depends on mass, disk morphology, and specific star
formation rate (SSFR). At intermediate stellar mass (10^10.5 < M < 10^11 Msun)
the bar fraction in early-type disks is much higher, at all redshifts, by a
factor ~2, than that in late-type disks. This trend is reversed at higher
stellar mass (M > 10^11 Msun), where the fraction of bars in early-type disks
becomes significantly lower, at all redshifts, than that in late-type disks.
The bar fractions for galaxies with low and high SSFRs closely follow those of
the morphologically-selected early-type and late-type populations,
respectively. This indicates a close correspondence between morphology and SSFR
in disk galaxies at these earlier epochs. Interestingly, the total bar fraction
in 10^10.5 < M < 10^11 Msun disks is built up by a factor of ~2 over the
redshift interval explored, while for M > 10^11 Msun disks it remains roughly
constant. This indicates that, already by z ~ 0.6, spectral and morphological
transformations in the most massive disk galaxies have largely converged to the
familiar Hubble sequence that we observe in the local Universe, while for
intermediate mass disks this convergence is ongoing until at least z ~ 0.2.
Moreover, these results highlight the importance of employing mass-limited
samples for quantifying the evolution of barred galaxies. Finally, the
evolution of the barred galaxy populations investigated does not depend on the
large-scale environmental density (at least, on the scales which can be probed
with the available photometric redshifts).
