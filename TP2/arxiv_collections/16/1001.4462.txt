C.Calude, A.Nies, L.Staiger, and F.Stephan posed the following question about
the relation between plain and prefix Kolmogorov complexities (see their paper
in DLT 2008 conference proceedings): does the domain of every optimal
decompressor contain the domain of some optimal prefix-free decompressor? In
this paper we provide a negative answer to this question.
