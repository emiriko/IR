We present the discovery of three new giant planets around three
metal-deficient stars: HD5388b (1.96M_Jup), HD181720b (0.37M_Jup), and
HD190984b (3.1M_Jup). All the planets have moderately eccentric orbits (ranging
from 0.26 to 0.57) and long orbital periods (from 777 to 4885 days). Two of the
stars (HD181720 and HD190984) were part of a program searching for giant
planets around a sample of ~100 moderately metal-poor stars, while HD5388 was
part of the volume-limited sample of the HARPS GTO program. Our discoveries
suggest that giant planets in long period orbits are not uncommon around
moderately metal-poor stars.
