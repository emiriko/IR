A R&D project has been launched in 2009 to address fundamental methods in
radiation transport simulation and revisit Geant4 kernel design to cope with
new experimental requirements. The project focuses on simulation at different
scales in the same experimental environment: this set of problems requires new
methods across the current boundaries of condensed-random-walk and discrete
transport schemes. An exploration is also foreseen about exploiting and
extending already existing Geant4 features to apply Monte Carlo and
deterministic transport methods in the same simulation environment. An overview
of this new R&D associated with Geant4 is presented, together with the first
developments in progress.
