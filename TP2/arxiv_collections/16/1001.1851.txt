Two-body hadronic weak decays of Bc meson involving tensor meson in the final
state are studied by using Isgur- Scora-Grinstein-Wise (ISGW II) model. Decay
amplitudes are obtained using the factorization scheme in the Spectator Quark
Model. Branching ratios for the charm changing and bottom changing decay modes
are predicted.
