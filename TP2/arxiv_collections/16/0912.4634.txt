The knowledge of electron g factor is essential for spin manipulation in the
field of spintronics and quantum computing. While there exist technical
difficulties in determining the sign of g factor in semiconductors by the
established magneto-optical spectroscopic methods. We develop a time resolved
Kerr rotation technique to precisely measure the sign and the amplitude of
electron g factor in semiconductors.
