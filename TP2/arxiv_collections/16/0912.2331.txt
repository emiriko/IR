For reproducing the anomalous -- i.e., sub- or super-diffusive -- behavior in
some stochastic dynamical systems, the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) has
gained considerable popularity in recent years. Motivated by the question
whether or not a system with anomalous dynamics can have the GLE formulation,
here I consider polymer physics, where sub-diffusive behavior is commonplace. I
provide an exact derivation of the GLE for phantom Rouse polymers, andby
identifying polymeric response to local strains, I argue the case for the GLE
formulation for self-avoiding polymers and polymer translocation through a
narrow pore in a membrane. The number of instances in polymer physics, where
the anomalous dynamics corresponds to the GLE, thus seems to be fairly common.
