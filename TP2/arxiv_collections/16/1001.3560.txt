The relevance of the Regular Charge-Monopole Theory to the proton structure
is described. The discussion relies on classical electrodynamics and its
associated quantum mechanics. Few experimental data are used as a clue to the
specific structure of baryons. This basis provides an explanation for the shape
of the graph of the pre-LHC proton-proton cross section data. These data also
enable a description of the significance of the expected LHC cross section
measurements which will be known soon. Problematic QCD issues are pointed out.
