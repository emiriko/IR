We study an effective gauge theory whose gauge group is a semidirect product
$G = G_c \rtimes \mathit{\Gamma}$ with $G_c$ and $\mathit{\Gamma}$ being a
connected Lie group and a finite group, respectively. The semidirect product is
defined through a projective homomorphism $\gamma$ (i.e., homomorphism up to
the center of $G_c$) from $\mathit{\Gamma}$ into $G_c$. The (linear)
representation of $G$ is made from $\gamma$ and a projective representation of
$\mathit{\Gamma}$ over $\mathbb{C}$. To be specific, we take $SU(3)_L$ as $G_c$
and $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ as $\mathit{\Gamma}$. It is noticed that
the irreducible projective representations of $\mathit{\Gamma}$ are
three-dimensional in spite of its Abelian nature. We give a toy model on the
lepton mixing which illustrates the peculiar feature of such gauge symmetry. It
is shown that under a particular vacuum alignment the tri-bimaximal mixing
matrix is reproduced.
