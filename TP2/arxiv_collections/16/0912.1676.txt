Interplay between magnetization dynamics and electric current in a conducting
ferromagnet is theoretically studied based on a microscopic model calculation.
First, the effects of the current on magnetization dynamics (spin torques) are
studied with special attention to the "dissipative" torques arising from
spin-relaxation processes of conduction electrons. Next, an analysis is given
of the "spin motive force", namely, a spin-dependent 'voltage' generation due
to magnetization dynamics, which is the reaction to spin torques. Finally, an
attempt is presented of a unified description of these effects.
