We study in detail various aspects of the renormalization of the spin-1
resonance propagator in the effective field theory framework. First, we briefly
review the formalisms for the description of spin-1 resonances in the path
integral formulation with the stress on the issue of propagating degrees of
freedom. Then we calculate the one-loop 1-- meson self-energy within the
Resonance chiral theory in the chiral limit using different methods for the
description of spin-one particles, namely the Proca field, antisymmetric tensor
field and the first order formalisms. We discuss in detail technical aspects of
the renormalization procedure which are inherent to the power-counting
non-renormalizable theory and give a formal prescription for the organization
of both the counterterms and one-particle irreducible graphs. We also construct
the corresponding propagators and investigate their properties. We show that
the additional poles corresponding to the additional one-particle states are
generated by loop corrections, some of which are negative norm ghosts or
tachyons. We count the number of such additional poles and briefly discuss
their physical meaning.
