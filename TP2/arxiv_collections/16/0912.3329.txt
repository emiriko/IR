The HAWC gamma ray observatory, to be constructed at Sierra Negra, Puebla in
Mexico, is a large array of water Cherenkov detectors sited at an elevation of
4100 m, which has been optimized for gamma/hadron discrimination of the primary
cosmic rays in the TeV energy range. It is based on the Milagro experience, but
the design has been changed from a water pond to individual water tanks. In
order to validate the design with large water tanks a prototype array has been
constructed near the HAWC site with 3 of the largest commercial rotomolded
plastic tanks available in Mexico. They have been instrumented with 20 cm
hemispherical photomultiplier tubes and read out with 2 Gsample/s flash ADCs.
The performance of a single tank has been measured as well as the response of
the array to cosmic ray showers. In this paper we present the first
measurements of the performance of the HAWC prototype array.
