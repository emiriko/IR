Anomalous soft photons in excess of what is expected from electromagnetic
bremsstrahlung have been observed in association with the production of
hadrons, mostly mesons, in high-energy (K+)p, (pi+)p, (pi-)p, pp, and (e+)(e-)
collisions. We propose a model for the simultaneous production of anomalous
soft photons and mesons in quantum field theory, in which the meson production
arises from the oscillation of color charge densities of the quarks of the
underlying vacuum in the flux tube. As a quark carries both a color charge and
an electric charge, the oscillation of the color charge densities will be
accompanied by the oscillation of electric charge densities, which will in turn
lead to the simultaneous production of soft photons during the meson production
process. How the production of these soft photons may explain the anomalous
soft photon data will be discussed. Further experimental measurements to test
the model will be proposed.
