Using data collected with the ISTRA+ spectrometer at U70 proton synchrotron
of IHEP, we report the first measurement of the destructive interference in the
radiative kaon cecay K- -->mu-nugamma. We find the difference of the vector and
axial form factors Fv-Fa=0.126+/-0.027+/-0.043. The measured value is two
standard deviations above the O(p**4) ChPT prediction equal to 0.055. Inclusion
of exotic tensor interaction gives Fv-Fa=0.144+/-0.044+/-0.035 and
Ft=-0.0079+/-0.0113+/-0.0073, i.e. -0.03<Ft<0.01 at 90% CL,consistent both with
zero and with recent theoretical prediction equal to |Ft|=0.022.
