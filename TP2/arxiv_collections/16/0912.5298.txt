On the basis of the exact relations the general formula for the static
dielectric permittivity e(q,0) for Coulomb system is found in the region of
small wave vectors q. The obtained formuladescribes the dielectric function
e(q,0) of the Coulomb system in both states in the "metallic" state and in the
"dielectric" one. The parameter which determines possible states of the Coulomb
system - from the "true" dielectric till the "ideal" conductor is found. The
exact relation for the pair correlation function for two-component system of
electrons and nuclei g_ei(r) is found for the arbitrary thermodynamic
parameters.
