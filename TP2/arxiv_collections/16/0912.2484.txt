We propose a method to systematically control carrier densities at the
interface of transition-metal oxide heterostructures without introducing
disorders. By inserting non-polar layers sandwiched by polar layers, continuous
carrier doping into the interface can be realized. This method enables us to
control the total carrier densities per unit cell systematically up to high
values of the order unity.
