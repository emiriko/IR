These notes are an introduction to and an overview of the theory of algebraic
surfaces over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic. After
some background in characteristic-p-geometry, we sketch the Kodaira-Enriques
classification. Next, we turn to more special characteristic-p topics, and end
by lifting results and applications to characteristic zero. We assume that the
reader has a background in complex geometry and has seen the Kodaira-Enriques
classification of complex surfaces before.
