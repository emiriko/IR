We consider optimal vaccination protocol where the vaccine is in short
supply. In this case, disease extinction results from a large and rare
fluctuation. We show that the probability of such fluctuation can be
exponentially increased by vaccination. For periodic vaccination with fixed
average rate, the optimal vaccination protocol is model independent and
presents a sequence of short pulses. The effect of vaccination can be
resonantly enhanced if the pulse period coincides with the characteristic
period of the disease dynamics or its multiples. This resonant effect is
illustrated using a simple epidemic model. If the system is periodically
modulated, the pulses must be synchronized with the modulation, whereas in the
case of a wrong phase the vaccination can lead to a negative result. The
analysis is based on the theory of fluctuation-induced population extinction in
periodically modulated systems that we develop.
