We propose that the \textit{post-glitch} epoch in a Vela-type pulsar
corresponds to a transition time in which the broken \textit{crust} is
readjusting its temperature and core-\textit{crust} transition pressure after
the changes produced by the \textit{glitch}. To describe the evolution of the
pulsar in this epoch we use a sequence of stationary and axisymmetric
relativistic models of slowly rotating neutron stars with a surface layer
\textit{crust}. Previously, we have formulated the matching conditions on the
surface of the star in terms of physical properties (total mass of the star,
core-\textit{crust} transition pressure,...).
