We formulate a minimal ansatz for local stress distribution in a solid that
includes the possibility of strongly anharmonic short-length motions. We
discover a broken-symmetry metastable phase that exhibits an aperiodic,
frozen-in stress distribution. This aperiodic metastable phase is characterized
by many distinct, nearly degenerate configurations. The activated transitions
between the configurations are mapped onto the dynamics of a long range
classical Heisenberg model with 6-component spins and anisotropic couplings. We
argue the metastable phase corresponds to a deeply supercooled non-polymeric,
non-metallic liquid, and further establish an order parameter for the
glass-to-crystal transition. The spin model itself exhibits a continuous range
of behaviors between two limits corresponding to frozen-in shear and uniform
compression/dilation respectively. The two regimes are separated by a
continuous transition controlled by the anisotropy in the spin-spin
interaction, which is directly related to the Poisson ratio $\sigma$ of the
material. The latter ratio and the ultra-violet cutoff of the theory determine
the liquid configurational entropy. Our results suggest that liquid's fragility
depends on the Poisson ratio in a non-monotonic way. The present ansatz
provides a microscopic framework for computing the configurational entropy and
relaxational spectrum of specific substances.
