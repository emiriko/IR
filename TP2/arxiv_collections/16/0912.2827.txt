Based on a quasiparticle model for \beta stable and electrically neutral
deconfined matter we address the mass-radius relation of pure quark stars. The
model is adjusted to recent hot lattice QCD results for 2 + 1 flavors with
almost physical quark masses. We find rather small radii and masses of
equilibrium configurations composed of cold deconfined matter, well
distinguished from neutron or hybrid stars.
