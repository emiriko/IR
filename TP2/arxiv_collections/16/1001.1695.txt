In present work it is suggested the concept of continual multi-electrode
system being realized on the elongated electrically conducting element immersed
into electrolyte. Conjugation of such kind of system with the point-contact
structure creates the unique electrode architecture and permits realizing of
the auto-oscillation process of electrochemical commutation at atomic scale.
During this process the nanostructure is being realized in a form of point
contact at the place of the mutual touching of the dendrite top and
counter-electrode. The ability of point contacts to concentrate the electric
field in assemblage with the peculiar properties of elongated element causes
unambiguously the localization of all the electrochemical transformations at
the dendrite top, where contact is forming.
