We investigate a two-level atom coupled to a cavity with a strong classical
driving field in a dissipative environment and find an analytical expression of
the time evolution density matrix for the system. The analytical density
operator is then used to study the entanglement between the atom and cavity by
considering the competing process between the atom-field interactions and the
field-environment interactions. It is shown that there is an optimal
interaction time for generating atom-cavity entanglement.
