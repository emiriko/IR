We focus down an ion beam consisting of single 40Ca+ ions to a spot size of a
few mum using an einzel-lens. Starting from a segmented linear Paul trap, we
have implemented a procedure which allows us to deterministically load a
predetermined number of ions by using the potential shaping capabilities of our
segmented ion trap. For single-ion loading, an efficiency of 96.7(7)% has been
achieved. These ions are then deterministically extracted out of the trap and
focused down to a 1sigma-spot radius of (4.6 \pm 1.3)mum at a distance of 257mm
from the trap center. Compared to former measurements without ion optics, the
einzel-lens is focusing down the single-ion beam by a factor of 12. Due to the
small beam divergence and narrow velocity distribution of our ion source,
chromatic and spherical aberration at the einzel-lens is vastly reduced,
presenting a promising starting point for focusing single ions on their way to
a substrate.
