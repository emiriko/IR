In this work, we make use of the OpenCL framework to accelerate an EMRI
modeling application using the hardware accelerators -- Cell BE and Tesla CUDA
GPU. We describe these compute technologies and our parallelization approach in
detail, present our performance results, and then compare them with those from
our previous implementations based on the native CUDA and Cell SDKs. The OpenCL
framework allows us to execute identical source-code on both architectures and
yet obtain strong performance gains that are comparable to what can be derived
from the native SDKs.
