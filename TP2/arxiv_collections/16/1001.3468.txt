Attention is paid to the production mechanisms of light scalars that reveal
their nature. We reveal the chiral shielding of the \sigma(600) meson. We show
that the kaon loop mechanism of the \phi radiative decays, ratified by
experiment, points to the four-quark nature of light scalars. We show also that
the light scalars are produced in the two photon collisions via four-quark
transitions in contrast to the classic P wave tensor q\bar q mesons that are
produced via two-quark transitions $\gamma\gamma\to q\bar q$. The history of
spontaneous breaking of symmetry in quantum physics is discussed in Appendix.
