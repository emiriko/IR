Since our early childhood we know in our bones that in order to interact with
an object we have either to go to it or to throw something at it. Yet, contrary
to all our daily experience, Nature is nonlocal: there are spatially separated
systems that exhibit nonlocal correlations. In recent years this led to new
experiments, deeper understanding of the tension between quantum physics and
relativity and to proposals for disruptive technologies.
