We consider a class of two-dimensional functions f(x,y) with the property
that the smallness of its rectangular norm implies the smallness of rectangular
norm for f(x,x+y). Also we study a family of functions f(x,y) having a similar
property for higher Gowers norms. The method based on a transference principle
for a class of sums over special systems of linear equations.
