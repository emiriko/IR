Modularization and granulation are key concepts in educational content
management, whereas teaching, learning and understanding require a discourse
within thematic contexts. Even though hyperlinks and semantically typed
references provide the context building blocks of hypermedia systems, elaborate
concepts to derive, manage and propagate such relations between content objects
are not around at present. Based on Semantic Web standards, this paper makes
several contributions to content enrichment. Work starts from harvesting
multimedia annotations in class-room recordings, and proceeds to deriving a
dense educational semantic net between eLearning Objects decorated with
extended LOM relations. Special focus is drawn on the processing of recorded
speech and on an Ontological Evaluation Layer that autonomously derives
meaningful inter-object relations. Further on, a semantic representation of
hyperlinks is developed and elaborated to the concept of semantic link
contexts, an approach to manage a coherent rhetoric of linking. These solutions
have been implemented in the Hypermedia Learning Objects System (hylOs), our
eLearning content management system. hylOs is built upon the more general Media
Information Repository (MIR) and the MIR adaptive context linking environment
(MIRaCLE), its linking extension. MIR is an open system supporting the
standards XML and JNDI. hylOs benefits from configurable information
structures, sophisticated access logic and high-level authoring tools like the
WYSIWYG XML editor and its Instructional Designer.
