Systematic investigations of the structural and magnetic properties of single
crystal (Ga,Mn)N films grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy are
presented. High resolution transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron x-ray
diffraction, and extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies do not reveal
any crystallographic phase separation and indicate that Mn occupies
Ga-substitutional sites in the Mn concentration range up to 1%. The magnetic
properties as a function of temperature, magnetic field and its orientation
with respect to the c-axis of the wurtzite structure can be quantitatively
described by the paramagnetic theory of an ensemble of non-interacting
Mn$^{3+}$ ions in the relevant crystal field, a conclusion consistent with the
x-ray absorption near edge structure analysis. A negligible contribution of Mn
in the 2+ charge state points to a low concentration of residual donors in the
studied films. Studies on modulation doped p-type (Ga,Mn)N/(Ga,Al)N:Mg
heterostructures do not reproduce the high temperature robust ferromagnetism
reported recently for this system.
