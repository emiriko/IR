Reduze is a computer program for reducing Feynman Integrals to master
integrals employing a Laporta algorithm. The program is written in C++ and uses
classes provided by the GiNaC library to perform the simplifications of the
algebraic prefactors in the system of equations. Reduze offers the possibility
to run reductions in parallel.
