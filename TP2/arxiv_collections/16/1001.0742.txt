In the past years, a clear picture of the evolution of outbursts of
black-hole X-ray binaries has emerged. While the X-ray properties can be
classified into our distinct states, based on spectral and timing properties,
the observations in the radio band have shown strong links between accretion
and ejection properties. Here I briefly outline the association between X-ray
timing and jet properties.
