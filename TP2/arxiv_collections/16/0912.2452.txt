Enhanced optical transmission (EOT) through subwavelength apertures is
usually obtained for p-polarized light. The present study experimentally
investigates EOT for s-polarized light. A subwavelength slit surrounded on each
side by periodic grooves has been fabricated in a gold film and covered by a
thin dielectric layer. The excitation of s-polarized dielectric waveguide modes
inside the dielectric film strongly increases the s-polarized transmission.
Transmission measurements are compared with a coupled mode model and show good
qualitative agreement. Adding a waveguide can improve light transmission
through subwavelength apertures, as both s and p-polarization can be
efficiently transmitted.
