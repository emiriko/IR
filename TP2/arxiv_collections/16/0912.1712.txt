Active Galactic Nuclei emit over the entire electromagnetic spectrum with the
peak of the accretion disk emission in the far-UV, a wavelength range
historically difficult to investigate. We use here the GALEX (Galaxy Evolution
Explorer) Near-UV and Far-UV measurements (complemented with optical data from
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and XMM-Newton X-ray spectra) of a sample of 83
X-ray selected type 1 AGN extracted from the XMM-Newton Bright Serendipitous
Survey to study their spectral energy distribution (SED) in the optical, Near
and Far-UV and X-ray energy bands. We have constrained the luminosity of the
accretion disk emission component and calculated the hard X-ray bolometric
corrections for a significant sample of AGN spanning a large range in
properties (z, L(x)).
