We evaluate interhadron interactions in two-color lattice QCD from
Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes on the Euclidean lattice. The simulations are
performed in quenched SU(2) QCD with the plaquette gauge action at $\beta =
2.45$ and the Wilson quark action. We concentrate on S-wave scattering states
of two scalar diquarks. Evaluating different flavor combinations with various
quark masses, we try to find out the ingredients in hadronic interactions.
Between two scalar diquarks ($u C\gamma_5 d$, the lightest baryon in SU(2)
system), we observe repulsion in short-range region, even though present quark
masses are not very light. We define and evaluate the "quark-exchange part" in
the interaction, which is induced by adding quark-exchange diagrams, or
equivalently, by introducing Pauli blocking among some of quarks. The repulsive
force in short-distance region arises only from the "quark-exchange part", and
disappears when quark-exchange diagrams are omitted. We find that the strength
of repulsion grows in light quark-mass regime and its quark-mass dependence is
similar to or slightly stronger than that of the color-magnetic interaction by
one-gluon-exchange (OGE) processes. It is qualitatively consistent with the
constituent-quark model picture that a color-magnetic interaction among quarks
is the origin of repulsion. We also find a universal long-range attractive
force, which enters in any flavor channels of two scalar diquarks and whose
interaction range and strength are quark-mass independent. The weak quark-mass
dependence of interaction ranges in each component implies that meson-exchange
contributions are small and subdominant, and the other contributions, {\it ex.}
flavor exchange processes, color-Coulomb or color-magnetic interactions, are
considered to be predominant, in the quark-mass range we evaluated.
