We combine searches by the CDF and D0 collaborations for a Higgs boson
decaying to W+W-. The data correspond to an integrated total luminosity of 4.8
(CDF) and 5.4 (D0) fb-1 of p-pbar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV at the
Fermilab Tevatron collider. No excess is observed above background expectation,
and resulting limits on Higgs boson production exclude a standard-model Higgs
boson in the mass range 162-166 GeV at the 95% C.L.
