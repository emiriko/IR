Boolean functions with symmetry properties are interesting from a complexity
theory perspective; extensive research has shown that these functions, if
nonconstant, must have high `complexity' according to various measures.
  In recent work of this type, Sun gave bounds on the block sensitivity of
nonconstant Boolean functions invariant under a transitive permutation group.
Sun showed that all such functions satisfy bs(f) = Omega(N^{1/3}), and that
there exists such a function for which bs(f) = O(N^{3/7}ln N). His example
function belongs to a subclass of transitively invariant functions called the
minterm-transitive functions (defined in earlier work by Chakraborty).
  We extend these results in two ways. First, we show that nonconstant
minterm-transitive functions satisfy bs(f) = Omega(N^{3/7}). Thus Sun's example
function has nearly minimal block sensitivity for this subclass. Second, we
give an improved example: a minterm-transitive function for which bs(f) =
O(N^{3/7}ln^{1/7}N).
