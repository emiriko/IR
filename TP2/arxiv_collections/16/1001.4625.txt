We argue that the A_4 symmetry as required by three flavors of fermions may
well-embed in the SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X gauge model. The new neutral
fermion singlets as introduced in a canonical seesaw mechanism can be combined
with the standard model lepton doublets to perform SU(3)_L triplets. Various
leptoscalar multiplets such as singlets, doublets, and triplets as played in
the models of A_4 are unified in single SU(3)_L antisextets. As a result,
naturally light neutrinos with various kinds of mass hierarchies are obtained
as a combination of type I and type II seesaw contributions. The observed
neutrino mixing pattern in terms of the Harrison-Perkins-Scott proposal is
obtained by enforcing of the A_4 group. The quark masses and
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix are also discussed. By virtue of very
heavy antisextets the nature of the vacuum alignments of scalar fields can be
given.
