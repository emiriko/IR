We present a search for lepton-flavor-violating tau decays into three leptons
(electrons or muons) using 782 fb^-1 of data collected with the Belle detector
at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. No evidence for these decays is
observed and we set 90% confidence level upper limits on the branching
fractions between 1.5 x 10^-8 and 2.7 x 10^-8.
