We analyse data on forward eta-meson photoproduction off a proton target and
extract the eta to gamma gamma decay width utilizing the Primakoff effect. The
hadronic amplitude that enters into our analysis is strongly constrained
because it is fixed from a global fit to available gamma p to p eta data for
differential cross sections and polarizations. We compare our results with
present information on the two-photon eta-decay from the literature. We provide
predictions for future PrimEx experiments at Jefferson Laboratory in order to
motivate further studies.
