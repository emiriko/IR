Constructing the Theory of Everything (TOE) is an elusive goal of today's
physics. Goedel's incompleteness theorem seems to forbid physics
axiomatization, a necessary part of the TOE. The purpose of this contribution
is to show how physics axiomatization can be achieved guided by a new heuristic
rule. This will open up new roads into constructing the ultimate theory of
everything. Three physical principles will be identified from the heuristic
rule and they in turn will generate uniqueness results of various technical
strengths regarding space, time, non-relativistic and relativistic quantum
mechanics, electroweak symmetry and the dimensionality of space-time. The hope
is that the strong force and the Standard Model axiomatizations are not too far
out. Quantum gravity and cosmology are harder problems and maybe new approaches
are needed. However, complete physics axiomatization seems to be an achievable
goal, no longer part of philosophical discussions, but subject to rigorous
mathematical proofs.
