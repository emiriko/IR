We study the representations of tensor random fields on the sphere basing on
the theory of representations of the rotation group. Introducing specific
components of a tensor field and imposing the conditions of weak isotropy and
mean square continuity, we derive their spectral decompositions in terms of
generalized spherical functions. The properties of random coefficients of the
decompositions are characterized, including such an important question as
conditions of Gaussianity.
