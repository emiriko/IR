We discuss cooling of a nanomechanical resonator to its mechanical ground
state by coupling it to a collective system of two interacting flux qubits. We
find that the collectivity crucially improves cooling by two mechanisms. First,
cooling transitions proceed via sub-radiant Dicke states, and the reduced line
width of these sub-radiant states suppresses both the scattering and the
environmental contribution to the final phonon number. Second, detrimental
carrier excitations without change in the motion of the resonator are
suppressed by collective energy shifts.
