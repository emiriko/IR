Magnetic reconnection (MR) in Earth's magnetotail is usually followed by a
systemwide redistribution of explosively released kinetic and thermal energy.
Recently, multispacecraft observations from the THEMIS mission were used to
study localized explosions associated with MR in the magnetotail so as to
understand subsequent Earthward propagation of MR outbursts during substorms.
Here we investigate plasma and magnetic field fluctuations/structures
associated with MR exhaust and ion-ion kink mode instability during a well
documented MR event. Generation, evolution and fading of kinklike oscillations
are followed over a distance of 70 000 km from the reconnection site in the
midmagnetotail to the more dipolar region near the Earth. We have found that
the kink oscillations driven by different ion populations within the outflow
region can be at least 25 000 km from the reconnection site.
