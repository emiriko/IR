We describe the self-assembly of biomimetic isotropic films which display
structural color amenable to potential applications in coatings. Isotropic
structures can produce color if there is a pronounced characteristic
length-scale comparable to the wavelength of visible light and
wavelength-independent scattering is suppressed.
