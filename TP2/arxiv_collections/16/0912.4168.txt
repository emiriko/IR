We derive universal scaling laws for physical observables such as the
critical temperature, the chiral condensate, and the pion decay constant as a
function of the flavor number near the conformal window of many-flavor QCD in
the chiral limit. We argue on general grounds that the associated critical
exponents are all interrelated and can be determined from the critical exponent
of the running gauge coupling at the Caswell-Banks-Zaks infrared fixed point.
We illustrate our findings with the aid of nonperturbative functional
Renormalization Group (RG) calculations and low-energy QCD models.
