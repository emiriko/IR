We discuss the calculation of soft supersymmetry breaking terms in type IIB
string theoretic models in the Large Volume Scenario (LVS). The suppression of
FCNC gives a lower bound on the size of the compactification volume. This leads
to soft terms which are strongly suppressed relative to the gravitino mass so
that the dominant contribution to the gaugino masses comes from the Weyl
anomaly. The other soft terms are essentially generated by the renormalization
group running from the string scale to the TeV scale.
