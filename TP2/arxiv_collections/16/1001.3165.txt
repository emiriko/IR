We study an optimal relaxed control problem for a class of semilinear
stochastic PDEs on Banach spaces perturbed by multiplicative noise and driven
by a cylindrical Wiener process. The state equation is controlled through the
nonlinear part of the drift coefficient which satisfies a dissipative-type
condition with respect to the state variable. The main tools of our study are
the factorization method for stochastic convolutions in UMD type-2 Banach
spaces and certain compactness properties of the factorization operator and of
the class of Young measures on Suslin metrisable control sets.
