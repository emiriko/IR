We report the field and temperature dependence of the low-temperature
specific heat down to 400 mK and in magnetic fields up to 9 T of the
electron-doped Ba(Fe0.92Co0.08)2As2 superconductor. Using the phonon specific
heat obtained from pure BaFe2As2 we find the normal state Sommerfeld
coefficient to be 18 mJ/mol.K^2 and a condensation energy of 1.27 J/mol. The
temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat clearly indicate the
presence of the low-energy excitations in the system. The magnetic field
variation of field-induced specific heat cannot be described by single clean s-
or d-wave models. Rather, the data require an anisotropic gap scenario which
may or may not have nodes. We discuss the implications of these results.
