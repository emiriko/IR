In this note, we prove that smooth self-shrinkers in $\Real^{n+1}$, that are
entire graphs, are hyperplanes. Previously Ecker and Huisken showed that smooth
self-shrinkers, that are entire graphs and have at most polynomial growth, are
hyperplanes. The point of this note is that no growth assumption at infinity is
needed.
