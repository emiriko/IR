New CCD photometric observations of the eclipsing binary V566 Oph have been
obtained. The light curves are analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney code and new
geometric and photometric elements are derived. A new O-C analysis of the
system is presented and apparent period changes are discussed with respect to
possible Light-Time Effect in the system.
