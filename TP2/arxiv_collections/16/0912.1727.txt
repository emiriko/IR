We investigate the transient times for the onset of control of steady states
by time-delayed feedback. The optimization of control by minimising the
transient time before control becomes effective is discussed analytically and
numerically, and the competing influences of local and global features are
elaborated. We derive an algebraic scaling of the transient time and confirm
our findings by numerical simulations in dependence on feedback gain and time
delay.
