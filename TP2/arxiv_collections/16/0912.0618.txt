We use hybrid functionals and restricted self-consistent GW, state-of-the-art
theoretical approaches for quasiparticle band structures, to study the
electronic states of delafossite Cu(Al,In)O$_2$, the first p-type and bipolar
transparent conductive oxides. We show that self-consistent GW gives remarkably
wider band gaps than all the other approaches used so far. Accounting for
polaronic effects in the GW scheme we recover a very nice agreement with
experiments. Furthermore, the modifications with respect to the Kohn-Sham bands
are strongly k-dependent, which makes questionable the common practice of using
a scissor operator. Finally, our results support the view that the low energy
structures found in optical experiments, and initially attributed to an
indirect transition, are due to intrinsic defects in the samples.
