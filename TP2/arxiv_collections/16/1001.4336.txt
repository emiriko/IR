[ABRIDGED] The new generation of wide field optical imaging like the Canada
France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) enables discoveries of all types
of gravitational lenses present in the sky. The Strong Lensing Legacy Survey
(SL2S) project has started an inventory, respectively for clusters or groups of
galaxies lenses, and for Einstein rings around distant massive ellipticals.
Here we attempt to extend this inventory by finding lensing events produced by
massive edge-on disk galaxies which remains a poorly documented class of
lenses. We implement and test an automated search procedure of edge-on galaxy
lenses in the CFHTLS Wide fields with magnitude 18
