We discuss T-odd correlations between jet and lepton momenta in tt_bar events
at the Tevatron that can be used to search for CP violation. We identify
correlations suitable for the lepton plus jets and purely hadronic top-quark
pair decay channels. As an example of CP violation we consider the top-quark
anomalous couplings, including its chromo-electric dipole moment, and we
estimate the limits that can be placed at the Tevatron.
