Dark matter halos contain a wealth of substructure in the form of subhalos
and tidal streams. Enhancements in the dark matter density of these regions
leads to enhanced rates in direct detection experiments, as well as enhanced
dark matter capture rates in the Sun and the Earth. Direct detection
experiments probe the present-day dark matter density, while energetic
neutrinos probe the past history of the dark matter density along the solar
system's orbit about the Galactic center. We discuss how an elevated energetic
neutrino flux can be used to probe the level of substructure present at the
Galactic radius of the solar system.
