Photoinduced melting of horizontal-stripe charge orders in
quasi-two-dimensional organic conductors
\theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4[BEDT-TTF=bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene]
and
  \alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 is investigated theoretically. By numerically solving
the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, we study the photoinduced dynamics
in extended Peierls-Hubbard models on anisotropic triangular lattices within
the
  Hartree-Fock approximation. The melting of the charge order needs more energy
for \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4 than for \alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3, which is a
consequence of the larger stabilization energy in \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4.
After local photoexcitation in the charge ordered states, the growth of a
photoinduced domain shows anisotropy. In \theta-(BEDT-TTF)2RbZn(SCN)4, the
domain hardly expands to the direction perpendicular to the horizontal-stripes.
This is because all the molecules on the hole-rich stripe are rotated in one
direction and those on the hole-poor stripe in the other direction. They
modulate horizontally connected transfer integrals homogeneously, stabilizing
the charge order stripe by stripe. In \alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3, lattice distortions
locally stabilize the charge order so that it is easily weakened by local
photoexcitation. The photoinduced domain indeed expands in the plane. These
results are consistent with recent observation by femtosecond reflection
spectroscopy.
