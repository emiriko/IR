We investigate a hybrid structure consisting of $20\pm4$ implanted $^{31}$P
atoms close to a gate-induced silicon single electron transistor (SiSET). In
this configuration, the SiSET is extremely sensitive to the charge state of the
nearby centers, turning from the off state to the conducting state when the
charge configuration is changed. We present a method to measure fast electron
tunnel rates between donors and the SiSET island, using a pulsed voltage scheme
and low-bandwidth current detection. The experimental findings are
quantitatively discussed using a rate equation model, enabling the extraction
of the capture and emission rates.
