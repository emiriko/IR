A family of non-equilibrium statistical operators is introduced which differ
by the system age distribution over which the quasi-equilibrium (relevant)
distribution is averaged. To describe the nonequilibrium states of a system we
introduce a new thermodynamic parameter - the lifetime of a system.
Superstatistics, introduced in works of Beck and Cohen [Physica A \textbf{322},
(2003), 267] as fluctuating quantities of intensive thermodynamical parameters,
are obtained from the statistical distribution of lifetime (random time to the
system degeneracy) considered as a thermodynamical parameter. It is suggested
to set the mixing distribution of the fluctuating parameter in the
superstatistics theory in the form of the piecewise continuous functions. The
distribution of lifetime in such systems has different form on the different
stages of evolution of the system. The account of the past stages of the
evolution of a system can have a substantial impact on the non-equilibrium
behaviour of the system in a present time moment.
