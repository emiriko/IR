We make a systematic investigation of the generic properties of static,
spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat solutions to the field equations
describing gravity minimally coupled to a nonlinear self-gravitating real
scalar field. Seven corollaries and a theorem on selection criteria for two-
and one-parametric solutions are proven and conditions for obtaining
particle-like solution, black holes or naked singularities are derived. A
series of exact solutions in closed forms describing different black holes,
naked singularities and particle-like solutions are provided.
