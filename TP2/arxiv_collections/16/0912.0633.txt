Using superconducting quantum circuit elements, we propose an approach to
experimentally construct a Kitaev lattice, which is an anisotropic spin model
on a honeycomb lattice with three types of nearest-neighbor interactions and
having topologically protected ground states. We study two particular parameter
regimes to demonstrate both vortex and bond-state excitations. Our proposal
outlines an experimentally realizable artificial many-body system that exhibits
exotic topological properties.
