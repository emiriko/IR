Scenarios with hidden, spontaneously broken, non-abelian gauge groups contain
a natural dark matter candidate, the hidden vector, whose longevity is due to
an accidental custodial symmetry in the renormalizable Lagrangian.
Nevertheless, non-renormalizable dimension six operators break the custodial
symmetry and induce the decay of the dark matter particle at cosmological
times. We discuss in this paper the cosmic ray signatures of this scenario and
we show that the decay of hidden vector dark matter particles generically
produce an intense gamma ray line which could be observed by the Fermi-LAT
experiment, if the scale of custodial symmetry breaking is close to the Grand
Unification scale. This gamma line proceeds directly from a tree level dark
matter 2-body decay in association with a Higgs boson. Within this model we
also perform a determination of the relic density constraints taking into
account the dark matter annihilation processes with one dark matter particle in
the final state. The corresponding direct detection rates can be easily of
order the current experimental sensitivities.
