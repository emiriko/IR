A new type of resonant light absorption by a small particle (nanocluster) is
reported. The problem cannot be described within the commonly used dipole
scattering approximation and should be studied with methods based upon the
exact Mie solution. It is shown that the absorption cross-section has giant
maxima realized at small values of the imaginary part of the complex dielectric
permittivity of the particle. The maxima are situated in the vicinity of the
plasmon (polariton) resonances and correspond to the regions where the
dissipative damping equals the radiative one. The case is similar to the
recently introduced anomalous scattering [PRL vol. 97, 263902 (2006)] and
exhibits similar peculiarities.
