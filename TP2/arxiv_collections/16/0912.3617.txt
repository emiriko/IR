Electromagnetic cloaks are devices that can be used to reduce the total
scattering cross section of various objects. An ideal cloak removes all
scattering from an object and thus makes this object "invisible" to the
electromagnetic fields that impinge on the object. However, ideal cloaking
appears to be possible only at a single frequency. To study cloaking from an
electromagnetic pulse we consider propagation of a pulse inside a waveguide
with a cloaked metal object inside. There are several ways to achieve cloaking
and in this paper we study three such methods, namely, the
coordinate-transformation cloak, the transmission-line cloak, and the
metal-plate cloak. In the case of the two last cloaks, pulse propagation is
studied using experimental data whereas the coordinate-transformation cloak is
studied with numerical simulations. The results show that, at least in the
studied cases where the cloaked object's diameter is smaller than the
wavelength, the cloaks based on transmission-line meshes and metal plates have
wider bandwidth than the coordinate-transformation cloak.
