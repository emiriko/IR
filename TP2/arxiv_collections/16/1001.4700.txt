We study a graphene double quantum dot in different coupling regimes. Despite
the strong capacitive coupling between the dots, the tunnel coupling is below
the experimental resolution. We observe additional structures inside the
finite-bias triangles, part of which can be attributed to electronic excited
dot states, while others are probably due to modulations of the transmission of
the tunnel barriers connecting the system to source and drain leads.
