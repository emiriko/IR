Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) is a synchronized, six
camera high cadence solar imaging instrument developed by Queen's University
Belfast. The system is available on the Dunn Solar Telescope at the National
Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico, USA as a common-user instrument.
Consisting of six 1k x 1k Peltier-cooled frame-transfer CCD cameras with very
low noise (0.02-15 e/s/pixel), each ROSA camera is capable of full-chip readout
speeds in excess of 30 Hz, or 200 Hz when the CCD is windowed. Combining
multiple cameras and fast readout rates, ROSA will accumulate approximately 12
TB of data per 8 hours observing. Following successful commissioning during
August 2008, ROSA will allow multi-wavelength studies of the solar atmosphere
at high temporal resolution.
