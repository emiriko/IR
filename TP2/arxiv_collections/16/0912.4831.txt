We present the first experimental study of mesoscopic fluctuations of Coulomb
drag in a system with two layers of composite fermions, which are seen when
either the magnetic field or carrier concentration are varied. These
fluctuations cause an alternating sign of the average drag. We study these
fluctuations at different temperatures to establish the dominant dephasing
mechanism of composite fermions.
