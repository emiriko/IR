A basic problem in the classification theory of compact complex manifolds is
to give simple characterizations of complex tori. It is well known that a
compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ homotopically equivalent to a a complex torus is
biholomorphic to a complex torus.
  The question whether a compact complex manifold $X$ diffeomorphic to a
complex torus is biholomorphic to a complex torus has a negative answer due to
a construction by Blanchard and Sommese.
  Their examples have however negative Kodaira dimension, thus it makes sense
to ask the question whether a compact complex manifold $X$ with trivial
canonical bundle which is homotopically equivalent to a complex torus is
biholomorphic to a complex torus.
  In this paper we show that the answer is positive for complex threefolds
satisfying some additional condition, such as the existence of a non constant
meromorphic function.
