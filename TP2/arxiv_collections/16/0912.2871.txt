We compute the spectrum of gluonic screening-masses in the $0^{++}$ channel
of quenched 3d Yang-Mills theory near the phase-transition. Our
finite-temperature lattice simulations are performed at scaling region, using
state-of-art techniques for thermalization and spectroscopy, which allows for
thorough data extrapolations to thermodynamic limit. Ratios among
mass-excitations with the same quantum numbers on the gauge theory, 2d Ising
and $\lambda\phi^{4}$ models are compared, resulting in a nice agreement with
predictions from universality. In addition, a gauge-to-scalar mapping,
previously employed to fit QCD Green's functions at deep IR, is verified to
dynamically describe these universal spectroscopic patterns
