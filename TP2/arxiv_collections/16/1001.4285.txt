The structure of high-lying states in $^{22}$Ne has been studied using the
$^{14}$C($^{12}$C,$\alpha$)$^{22}$Ne reaction at E($^{12}$C)= 44 MeV. The spins
were determined by measuring double ($\alpha$,$\alpha$) angular correlations.
Selective population of the 9$^-$ and 11$^-$ states at E$_x$=20.1 and 20.7 MeV,
respectively, identifies those states as the 9$^-$ and 11$^-$ members of the
first $K^{\pi}$ = 0$^-$ band, whose lower members were investigated by a method
using inverse kinematics and a thick gas target. The spin and parity of four
other new levels were determined to be 9$^-$ (21.5 MeV),12$^+$ (22.1 MeV),9$^-$
(25.0 MeV) and 8$^+$ (22.9 MeV). The two levels 9$^-$ and 12$^+$ may belong to
the rotational doublets.
