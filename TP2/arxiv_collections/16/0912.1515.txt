In this paper, we study the notion of local time and Tanaka formula for the
G-Brownian motion. Moreover, the joint continuity of the local time of the
G-Brownian motion is obtained and its quadratic variation is proven. As an
application, we generalize It^o's formula with respect to the G-Brownian motion
to convex functions.
