We analyze the decoherence induced on a single qubit by the interaction with
a two-level boson system with critical internal dynamics. We explore how the
decoherence process is affected by the presence of quantum phase transitions in
the environment. We conclude that the dynamics of the qubit changes
dramatically when the environment passes through a continuous excited state
quantum phase transition. If the system-environment coupling energy equals the
energy at which the environment has a critical behavior, the decoherence
induced on the qubit is maximal and the fidelity tends to zero with finite size
scaling obeying a power-law.
