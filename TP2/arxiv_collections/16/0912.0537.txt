We define a simple orthogonal polyhedron to be a three-dimensional polyhedron
with the topology of a sphere in which three mutually-perpendicular edges meet
at each vertex. By analogy to Steinitz's theorem characterizing the graphs of
convex polyhedra, we find graph-theoretic characterizations of three classes of
simple orthogonal polyhedra: corner polyhedra, which can be drawn by isometric
projection in the plane with only one hidden vertex, xyz polyhedra, in which
each axis-parallel line through a vertex contains exactly one other vertex, and
arbitrary simple orthogonal polyhedra. In particular, the graphs of xyz
polyhedra are exactly the bipartite cubic polyhedral graphs, and every
bipartite cubic polyhedral graph with a 4-connected dual graph is the graph of
a corner polyhedron. Based on our characterizations we find efficient
algorithms for constructing orthogonal polyhedra from their graphs.
