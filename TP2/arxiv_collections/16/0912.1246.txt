Outflows of plasma at the edges of active regions surrounded by quiet Sun are
now a common observation with the Hinode satellite. While there is
observational evidence to suggest that the outflows are originating in the
magnetic field surrounding the active regions, there is no conclusive evidence
that reveals how they are driven. Motivated by observations of outflows at the
periphery of a mature active region embedded in a coronal hole, we have used a
three-dimensional simulation to emulate the active region's development in
order to investigate the origin and driver of these outflows. We find outflows
are accelerated from a site in the coronal hole magnetic field immediately
surrounding the active region and are channelled along the coronal hole field
as they rise through the atmosphere. The plasma is accelerated simply as a
result of the active region expanding horizontally as it develops. Many of the
characteristics of the outflows generated in the simulation are consistent with
those of observed outflows: velocities up to 45 km per sec, properties akin to
the coronal hole, proximity to the active region's draining loops, expansion
with height, and projection over monopolar photospheric magnetic
concentrations. Although the horizontal expansion occurs as a consequence of
the active region's development in the simulation, expansion is also a general
feature of established active regions. Hence, it is entirely possible and
plausible that the expansion acceleration mechanism displayed in the simulation
is occurring in active regions on the Sun and, in addition to reconnection, is
driving the outflows observed at their edges.
