ASTEP South is the first phase of the ASTEP project (Antarctic Search for
Transiting ExoPlanets). The instrument is a fixed 10 cm refractor with a 4kx4k
CCD camera in a thermalized box, pointing continuously a 3.88 degree x 3.88
degree field of view centered on the celestial South pole. ASTEP South became
fully functional in June 2008 and obtained 1592 hours of data during the 2008
Antarctic winter. The data are of good quality but the analysis has to account
for changes in the point spread function due to rapid ground seeing variations
and instrumental effects. The pointing direction is stable within 10 arcseconds
on a daily timescale and drifts by only 34 arcseconds in 50 days. A truly
continuous photometry of bright stars is possible in June (the noon sky
background peaks at a magnitude R=15 arcsec-2 on June 22), but becomes
challenging in July (the noon sky background magnitude is R=12.5 arcsec?2 on
July 20). The weather conditions are estimated from the number of stars
detected in the field. For the 2008 winter, the statistics are between 56.3 %
and 68.4 % of excellent weather, 17.9 % to 30 % of veiled weather and 13.7 % of
bad weather. Using these results in a probabilistic analysis of transit
detection, we show that the detection efficiency of transiting exoplanets in
one given field is improved at Dome C compared to a temperate site such as La
Silla. For example we estimate that a year-long campaign of 10 cm refractor
could reach an efficiency of 69 % at Dome C versus 45 % at La Silla for
detecting 2-day period giant planets around target stars from magnitude 10 to
15. This shows the high potential of Dome C for photometry and future planet
discoveries. [Short abstract]
