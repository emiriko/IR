The charm quark offers interesting opportunities to cross-check the mechanism
of CP violation precisely tested in the strange and beauty sectors. In this
paper, we exploit the angular and quantum correlations in the D\bar{D} pairs
produced through the decay of the psi(3770) resonance in a charm factory to
investigate CP-violation in two different ways. We build CP-violating
observables in psi(3770) -> D\bar{D} -> (V_1V_2)(V_3 V_4) to isolate specific
New Physics effects in the charm sector. We also consider the case of psi(3770)
-> D\bar{D} -> (V_1V_2)(K\pi) decays, which provide a new way to measure the
strong phase difference delta between Cabibbo-favored and doubly-Cabibbo
suppressed D decays required in the determination of the CKM angle gamma.
Neglecting the systematics, we give a first rough estimate of the sensitivities
of these measurements at BES-III with an integrated luminosity of 20 fb^-1 at
psi(3770) peak and at a future Super tau-charm factory with a luminosity of
10^35 cm^-2.s^-1.
