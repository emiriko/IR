A strong coupling expansion of the SU(2) Yang-Mills quantum Hamiltonian is
carried out in the form of an expansion in the number of spatial derivatives,
using the symmetric gauge \epsilon_{ijk} A_{jk}=0. Introducing an infinite
lattice with box length a, I obtain a systematic strong coupling expansion of
the Hamiltonian in \lambda\equiv g^{-2/3}, with the free part being the sum of
Hamiltonians of Yang-Mills quantum mechanics of constant fields for each box,
and interaction terms of higher and higher number of spatial derivatives
connecting different boxes. The corresponding deviation from the free glueball
spectrum, obtained earlier for the case of the Yang-Mills quantum mechanics of
spatially constant fields, is calculated using perturbation theory in \lambda.
As a first step, the interacting glueball vacuum and the energy spectrum of the
interacting spin-0 glueball are obtained to order \lambda^2. Its relation to
the renormalisation of the coupling constant in the IR is discussed, indicating
the absence of infrared fixed points.
