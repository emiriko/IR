Schumpeter's (1939) distinction between changes in the form of the production
function corresponding to innovation, and shifts along the production function
corresponding to factor substitution, does not preclude that the underlying
dynamics interact. In an evolutionarily complex system, such interactions are
expected: they lead to non-linear terms in the model, and therefore to
stabilization and self-organization in addition to selection and variation.
Relatively simple simulations enable us to specify various concepts used in
'evolutionary economics' in terms of non-linear dynamics. While a technological
trajectory can be considered as a stabilization in a (distributed) environment,
a technological regime can be defined as a next-higher-order globalization in a
hyper-space. A regime is able to restore its order despite local disturbances,
for example by the political system. Technology policies may be effective at
the level of the (sub-)systems if they provide the relevant agents with room
for 'creative destruction' of the globalized hyper-systems. Implications for
firm behaviour and innovation policies are elaborated.
