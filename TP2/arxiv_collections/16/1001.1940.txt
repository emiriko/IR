We revisit General Gauge Mediation (GGM) in light of the supersymmetric
(linear) sigma model by utilizing the current superfield. The current
superfield in the GGM is identified with supersymmetric extension of the vector
symmetry current of the sigma model while spontaneous breakdown of
supersymmetry in the GGM corresponds to soft breakdown of the axial vector
symmetry of the sigma model. We first derive the current superfield from the
supersymmetric linear sigma model and then compute 2-point functions of the
current superfield using the (anti-)commutation relations of the messenger
component fields. After the global symmetry are weakly gauged, the 2-point
functions of the current superfield are identified with a part of the 2-point
functions of the associated vector superfield. We renormalize them by
dimensional regularization and show that physical gaugino and sfermion masses
of the MSSM are expressed in terms of the wavefunction renormalization
constants of the component fields of the vector superfield.
