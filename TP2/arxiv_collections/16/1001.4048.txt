We propose a method to achieve coherent coupling between Nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) centers in diamond and superconducting (SC) flux qubits. The resulting
coupling can be used to create a coherent interaction between the spin states
of distant NV centers mediated by the flux qubit. Furthermore, the magnetic
coupling can be used to achieve a coherent transfer of quantum information
between the flux qubit and an ensemble of NV centers. This enables a long-term
memory for a SC quantum processor and possibly an interface between SC qubits
and light.
