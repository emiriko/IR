Our goal is to study the feasibility of porting termination analysis
techniques developed for one programming paradigm to another paradigm. In this
paper, we show how to adapt termination analysis techniques based on polynomial
interpretations - very well known in the context of term rewrite systems (TRSs)
- to obtain new (non-transformational) ter- mination analysis techniques for
definite logic programs (LPs). This leads to an approach that can be seen as a
direct generalization of the traditional techniques in termination analysis of
LPs, where linear norms and level mappings are used. Our extension general-
izes these to arbitrary polynomials. We extend a number of standard concepts
and results on termination analysis to the context of polynomial
interpretations. We also propose a constraint-based approach for automatically
generating polynomial interpretations that satisfy the termination conditions.
Based on this approach, we implemented a new tool, called Polytool, for
automatic termination analysis of LPs.
