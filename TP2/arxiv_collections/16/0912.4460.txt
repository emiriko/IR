Photonic chips that integrate guides, switches, gratings and other
components, process vast amounts of information rapidly on a single device. A
new branch of this technology becomes possible if the light is coupled to cold
atoms in a junction of small enough cross section, so that small numbers of
photons interact appreciably with the atoms. Cold atoms are among the most
sensitive of metrological tools and their quantum nature also provides a basis
for new information processing methods. Here we demonstrate a photonic chip
which provides multiple microscopic junctions between atoms and photons. We use
the absorption of light at a junction to reveal the presence of one atom on
average. Conversely, we use the atoms to probe the intensity and polarisation
of the light. Our device paves the way for a new type of chip with
interconnected circuits of atoms and photons.
