The intrinsic metastable crystal structure of the cuprates results in local
dynamical lattice instabilities, strongly coupled to the density fluctuations
of the charge carriers. They acquire in this way simultaneously both,
delocalized and localized features. It is responsible for a partial fractioning
of the Fermi surface, i.e., the Fermi surface gets hidden in a region around
the anti-nodal points, because of the opening of a pseudogap in the normal
state, arising from a partial charge localization. The high energy localized
single-particle features are a result of a segregation of the homogeneous
crystal structure into checker-board local nano-size structures, which breaks
the local translational and rotational symmetry. The pairing in such a system
is dynamical rather than static, whereby charge carriers get momentarily
trapped into pairs in a deformable dynamically fluctuating ligand environment.
We conclude that the intrinsically heterogeneous structure of the cuprates must
play an important role in this type of superconductivity.
