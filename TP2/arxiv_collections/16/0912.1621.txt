We determine Li abundances and vsini values from new spectra of 53 stars with
Doppler-detected planets not included in our previous papers in this series. We
also examine two sets of stars without detected planets, which together serve
as our comparison sample. Using the method of comparison of Li abundances and
vsini values between two sets of stars we introduced in Gonzalez (2008), we
confirm that these two quantities are smaller among stars with planets compared
to stars without detected planets near the solar temperature. The transition
from low to high Li abundance among SWPs occurs near 5850 K, a revision of
about 50 K from our previous determination. The transition from low to high
vsini occurs near 6000 K, but this temperature is not as well constrained.
