A transition-free lattice is a basic requirement of a high-intensity
medium-energy (several GeV) proton synchrotron in order to eliminate beam
losses during transition crossing. An 8 GeV synchrotron is proposed as a
principal component in an alternative hybrid design of Project-X [1]. This
machine would be housed in the Fermilab antiproton source enclosure replacing
the present Debuncher. A simple doublet lattice with high transition gamma has
been designed. It uses just one type of dipoles and one type of quadrupoles (QF
and QD are of the same length). It has no transition crossing. It has a
triangular shape with three zero dispersion straight sections, which can be
used for injection, extraction, RF and collimators. The beta-functions and
dispersion are low. This lattice has plenty of free space for correctors and
diagnostic devices, as well as good optical properties including large dynamic
aperture, weak dependence of lattice functions on amplitude and momentum
deviation.
