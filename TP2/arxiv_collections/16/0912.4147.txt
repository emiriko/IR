We explore electron transport properties for the model of benzene-1,
4-dithiolate (BDT) molecule and for some other geometric models of benzene
molecule attached to two semi-infinite one-dimensional metallic electrodes
using the Green's function formalism. An analytic approach, based on a simple
tight-binding framework, is presented to describe electron transport through
the molecular wires. Electronic transport in such molecular systems is strongly
affected by the geometry of the molecules as well as their coupling to the
side-attached electrodes. Conductance reveals resonant peaks associated with
the molecular energy eigenstates providing several complex spectra. Current
passing through the molecules shows staircase-like behavior with sharp steps in
the weak molecule-to-electrode coupling limit, while it varies quite
continuously with the applied bias voltage in the limit of strong molecular
coupling. In the presence of transverse magnetic field, conductance exhibits
oscillatory behavior with flux $\phi$, threaded by the molecular ring, showing
$\phi_0$ ($=ch/e$) flux-quantum periodicity. Though, conductance changes in the
presence of transverse magnetic field, but the current-voltage characteristics
are not significantly affected by this field.
