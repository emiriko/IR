This paper presents a recursive computational multi-secret sharing technique
that hides k-2 secrets of size b each into n shares of a single secret S of
size b, such that any k of the n shares suffice to recreate the secret S as
well as all the hidden secrets. This may act as a steganographic channel to
transmit hidden information or used for authentication and verification of
shares and the secret itself. Further, such a recursive technique may be used
as a computational secret sharing technique that has potential applications in
secure and reliable storage of information on the Web, in sensor networks and
information dispersal schemes. The presented technique, unlike previous
computational techniques, does not require the use of any encryption key or
storage of public information.
