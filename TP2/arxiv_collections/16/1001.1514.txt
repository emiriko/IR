The topological superfluid 3He-B provides many examples of the interplay of
symmetry and topology. Here we consider the effect of magnetic field on
topological properties of 3He-B. Magnetic field violates the time reversal
symmetry. As a result, the topological invariant supported by this symmetry
ceases to exist; and thus the gapless fermions on the surface of 3He-B are not
protected any more by topology: they become fully gapped. Nevertheless, if
perturbation of symmetry is small, the surface fermions remain relativistic
with mass proportional to symmetry violating perturbation -- magnetic field.
The 3He-B symmetry gives rise to the Ising variable I=+/- 1, which emerges in
magnetic field and which characterizes the states of the surface of 3He-B. This
variable also determines the sign of the mass term of surface fermions and the
topological invariant describing their effective Hamiltonian. The line on the
surface, which separates the surface domains with different I, contains 1+1
gapless fermions, which are protected by combined action of symmetry and
topology.
