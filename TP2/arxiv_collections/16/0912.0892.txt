A mechanism of negative compressibility occurring in compressed layered
compounds in the presence of a pressure transmitting fluid medium is discussed
within a simple model. It takes into account the excluded volume effects and
soft fluid-matrix repulsion. It is demonstrated that a non-monotonic behavior
of the interlayer spacing with the applied pressure results from a competition
between the applied pressure and the internal one induced by the adsorbed
fluid. Recent experimental data on the graphite oxide "structure breathing"
under compression in the presence of water are analyzed in the light of these
theoretical results.
