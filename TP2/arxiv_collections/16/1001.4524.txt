We present an up-to-date global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor and
accelerator neutrino data in the framework of three-neutrino oscillations. We
discuss in detail the statistical significance of the observed "hint" of
non-zero theta13 in the solar sector at the light of the latest experimental
advances, such as the Borexino spectral data, the lower value of Gallium rate
recently measured in SAGE, and the low energy threshold analysis of the
combined SNO phase I and phase II. We also study the robustness of the results
under changes of the inputs such as the choice of solar model fluxes and a
possible modification of the Gallium capture cross-section as proposed by SAGE.
In the atmospheric sector we focus on the latest results for nu_e appearance
from MINOS and on the recent Super-Kamiokande results from the combined phases
I, II and III, and we discuss their impact on the determination of theta13.
Finally, we combine all the data into a global analysis and determine the
presently allowed ranges of masses and mixing.
