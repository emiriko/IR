We prove that the generalised non-crossing partitions associated to
well-generated complex reflection groups of exceptional type obey two different
cyclic sieving phenomena, as conjectured by Armstrong, respectively by Bessis
and Reiner. This manuscript accompanies the paper "Cyclic sieving for
generalised non-crossing partitions associated to complex reflection groups of
exceptional type" [arXiv:1001.0028], for which it provides the computational
details.
