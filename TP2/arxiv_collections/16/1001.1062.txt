Clifford quantum cellular automata (CQCAs) are a special kind of quantum
cellular automata (QCAs) that incorporate Clifford group operations for the
time evolution. Despite being classically simulable, they can be used as basic
building blocks for universal quantum computation. This is due to the
connection to translation-invariant stabilizer states and their entanglement
properties. We will give a self-contained introduction to CQCAs and investigate
the generation of entanglement under CQCA action. Furthermore, we will discuss
finite configurations and applications of CQCAs.
