The geometry of $k^{K}$ Gepner model, where $k+2=2K$ is investigated by
free-field representation known as "$bc\bet\gm$"-system. Using this
representation it is shown directly that internal sector of the model is given
by Landau-Ginzburg $\mathbb{C}^{K}/\mathbb{Z}_{2K}$-orbifold. Then we consider
the deformation of the orbifold by marginal anti-chiral-chiral operator.
Analyzing the holomorphic sector of the deformed space of states we show that
it has chiral de Rham complex structure of some toric manifold, where toric
dates are given by certain fermionic screening currents. It allows to relate
the Gepner model deformed by the marginal operator to the $\sigma$-model on CY
manifold realized as double cover of $\mathbb{P}^{K-1}$ with ramification along
certain submanifold.
