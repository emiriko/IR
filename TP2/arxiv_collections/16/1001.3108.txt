The study of hadron spectra at high $p_{T}$ in p+p collisions provides a good
test of perturbative quantum chromo-dynamic calculations (pQCD) and baseline
for measurements of nuclear modification factors in Au+Au collisions. Using
events triggered by the Barrel Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter, identified charged
hadron transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra are measured up to 15 GeV/$c$ at
mid-rapidity ($\mid y\mid$ $<$ 0.5) and neutral kaon $p_T$ spectra up to 12
GeV/$c$ in p + p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The particle ratios
of $p/\pi^{+}$, $\bar{p}/\pi^{-}$ and $K^{\pm,0}$ / $\pi^{\pm}$ in p + p
collisions are shown and compared with next-to-leading order pQCD calculations.
In central Au+Au collisions, we report nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$)
for pion, kaon, proton and $\rho$ and discuss several model calculations:
color-charge dependence of jet quenching and jet conversion. Finally,
centrality dependence of $R_{AA}$ at high $p_T$ ($>$ 5.5 GeV/c) for kaon are
compared with that of pion in Au + Au collisions at 200 GeV.
