In this work we have shown that it is possible to construct non-Abelian field
theories employing, in a systematic way, the Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic
formalism. This approach follows two steps. In the first step, the original
Abelian fields are modified in order to introduce the non-Abelian algebra.
After that, the Faddeev-Jackiw method is implemented and the gauge symmetry
relative to some non-Abelian symmetry group, is introduced through the
zero-mode of the symplectic matrix. We construct the SU(2) and SU(2)xU(1)
Yang-Mills theories having as starting point the U(1) Maxwell electromagnetic
theory.
