We present a semiclassical theory of spin-diffusion in a ferromagnetic metal
subject to a temperature gradient. Spin-flip scattering can generate pure
thermal spin currents by short-circuiting spin channels while suppressing spin
accumulations. A thermally induced spin density is locally generated when the
energy dependence of the density of states is spin polarized.
