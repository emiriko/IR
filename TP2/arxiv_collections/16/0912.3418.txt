Chiral symmetry in QCD can be simultaneously in Wigner and Goldstone modes,
depending on the part of the spectrum examined. The transition regime between
both, exploiting for example the onset of parity doubling in the high baryon
spectrum, can be used to probe the running quark mass in the mid-IR power-law
regime. In passing we also argue that three-quark states naturally group into
same-flavor quartets, split into two parity doublets, all splittings decreasing
high in the spectrum. We propose that a measurement of masses of high-partial
wave Delta* resonances should be sufficient to unambiguously establish the
approximate degeneracy and see the quark mass running. We test these concepts
with the first computation of the spectrum of high-J excited baryons in a
chiral-invariant quark model.
