In the case of previously proposed idea of photonic portal to hidden sector,
the parity in this sector may be violated. We discuss here two new options
within our model, where the parity is preserved. The first of them is not
satisfactory, as not diplaying a full relativistic covariance. The second seems
to be satisfactory.
