We demonstrate controlled polarization rotation of an optical field
conditional on the presence of a second field. Induced rotations of greater
than pi/2 rad are seen with a transmission of 95%, corresponding to a ratio of
phase shift to absorption of 40 pi. This combination of large, controlled
rotation and low loss is well-suited for the manipulation of both classical and
quantum light pulses.
