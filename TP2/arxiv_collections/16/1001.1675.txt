It was pointed out by de Arcangelis et al. [Europhys. Lett. 14 (1991), 515]
that the correct understanding of the percolation phenomenon of the
Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster in the Edwards-Anderson model is important since a
dynamical transition, which is characterized by a parameter called the Hamming
distance or damage, and the percolation transition are related to a transition
for a signal propagating between spins. We show analytically the percolation
thresholds of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster for a Potts gauge glass model,
which is an extended model of the Edwards-Anderson model, on random graphs with
arbitary degree distributions. The results are shown on the Nishimori line. We
also show the results for the infinite-range model.
