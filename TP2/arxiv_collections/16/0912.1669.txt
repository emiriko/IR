The productions of thorium and uranium are key ingredients in $r$-process
nucleo-cosmochronology. With the combination of improved nuclear and stellar
data, we have made detailed investigations on the $r$-process abundance pattern
in the very metal-poor halo stars based on the classical $r$-process approach.
It is found that the results are almost independent of specified simulations to
observed abundances. The influence from nuclear mass uncertainties on Th/U
chronometer can approach 2 Gyr. Moreover, the ages of the metal-poor stars HE
1523-0901, CS 31082-001, and BD +17$^\circ$3248 are determined as $11.8\pm
3.7$, $13.5\pm 2.9$, and $10.9 \pm 2.9$ Gyr, respectively. The results can
serve as an independent check for age estimate of the universe.
