Advantages of hypercube network and torus topology are used to derive an
embedded architecture for product network known as torus embedded hypercube
scalable interconnection network. This paper analyzes torus embedded hypercube
network pertinent to parallel architecture. The network metrics are used to
show how good embedded network can be designed for parallel computation.
Network parameter analysis and comparison of embedded network with basic
networks is presented.
