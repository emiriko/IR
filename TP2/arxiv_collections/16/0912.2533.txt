The nuclear pairing condensate is expected to change character from
spin-singlet to spin-triplet when the nucleus is very large and the neutron and
proton numbers $Z,N$ are equal. We investigate the transition between these two
phases within the framework of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations, using a
zero-range interaction to generate the pairing. We confirm that extremely large
nucleus would indeed favor triplet pairing condensates, with the Hamiltonian
parameters taken from known systematics. The favored phase is found to depend
on the specific orbitals at the Fermi energy. The smallest nuclei with a
well-developed spin-triplet condensate are in the mass region A ~ 130-140.
