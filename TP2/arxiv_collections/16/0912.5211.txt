We survey and show our earlier results about three different ways of
fluctuation-enhanced sensing of bio agent, the phage-based method for bacterium
detection published earlier; sensing and evaluating the odors of microbes; and
spectral and amplitude distribution analysis of noise in light scattering to
identify spores based on their diffusion coefficient.
