Bayesian Positive Source Separation (BPSS) is a useful unsupervised approach
for hyperspectral data unmixing, where numerical non-negativity of spectra and
abundances has to be ensured, such in remote sensing. Moreover, it is sensible
to impose a sum-to-one (full additivity) constraint to the estimated source
abundances in each pixel. Even though non-negativity and full additivity are
two necessary properties to get physically interpretable results, the use of
BPSS algorithms has been so far limited by high computation time and large
memory requirements due to the Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations. An
implementation strategy which allows one to apply these algorithms on a full
hyperspectral image, as typical in Earth and Planetary Science, is introduced.
Effects of pixel selection, the impact of such sampling on the relevance of the
estimated component spectra and abundance maps, as well as on the computation
times, are discussed. For that purpose, two different dataset have been used: a
synthetic one and a real hyperspectral image from Mars.
