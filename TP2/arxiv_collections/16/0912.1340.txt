The role of turbulence in various astrophysical settings is reviewed. Among
the differences to laboratory and atmospheric turbulence we highlight the
ubiquitous presence of magnetic fields that are generally produced and
maintained by dynamo action. The extreme temperature and density contrasts and
stratifications are emphasized in connection with turbulence in the
interstellar medium and in stars with outer convection zones, respectively. In
many cases turbulence plays an essential role in facilitating enhanced
transport of mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic fields in terms of the
corresponding coarse-grained mean fields. Those transport properties are
usually strongly modified by anisotropies and often completely new effects
emerge in such a description that have no correspondence in terms of the
original (non coarse-grained) fields.
