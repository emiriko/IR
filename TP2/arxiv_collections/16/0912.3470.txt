The unified geometrical interpretation of the linear character of the
Zeno-line (unit compressibility line Z=1) and the rectilinear diameter is
proposed. We show that recent findings about the properties of the Zeno-line
and striking correlation with the rectilinear diameter line as well as other
empirical relations can be naturally considered as the consequences of the
projective isomorphism between the real molecular fluids and the lattice gas
(Ising) model.
