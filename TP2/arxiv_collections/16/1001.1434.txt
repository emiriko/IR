By implementing the new IR-improved
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-Callan-Symanzik (DGLAP-CS) kernels
recently developed by one of us in the HERWIG6.5 environment we generate a new
MC, HERWIRI1.0(31), for hadron-hadron scattering at high energies. We use MC
data to illustrate the comparison between the parton shower generated by the
standard DGLAP-CS kernels and that generated by the new IR-improved DGLAP-CS
kernels. The interface to MC@NLO, MC@NLO/HERWIRI, is illustrated. Comparisons
with FNAL data and some discussion of possible implications for LHC
phenomenology are also presented.
