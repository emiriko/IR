Scalar Dark Matter (DM) can have dimensionful coupling to the Higgs boson -
the "soft" portal into DM - which is predicted to be unsuppressed by underlying
SO(10) GUT. The dimensionful coupling can be large, \mu/v >> 1, without
spoiling perturbativity of low energy theory up to the GUT scale. We show that
the soft portal into DM naturally triggers radiative EWSB via large 1-loop DM
corrections to the effective potential. In this scenario EWSB, DM thermal
freeze-out cross section and DM scattering on nuclei are all dominated by the
same coupling, predicting DM mass range to be 700 GeV< M_{DM} < 2 TeV. The
spin-independent direct detection cross section is predicted to be just at the
present experimental sensitivity and can explain the observed CDMS II recoil
events.
