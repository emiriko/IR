We report the first comprehensive high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission measurements on CeFeAsO, a parent compound of FeAs-based high
temperature superconductors with a mangetic/structural transition at $\sim$150
K. In the magnetic ordering state, four hole-like Fermi surface sheets are
observed near $\Gamma$(0,0) and the Fermi surface near M(+/-$\pi$,+/-$\pi$)
shows a tiny electron-like pocket at M surrounded by four Dirac cone-like
strong spots. The unusual Fermi surface topology deviates strongly from the
band structure calculations. The electronic signature of the
magnetic/structural transition shows up in the dramatic change of the
quasiparticle scattering rate. A dispersion kink at $\sim$ 25meV is for the
first time observed in the parent compound of Fe-based superconductors.
