Three-quark nucleon interpolating fields in QCD have well-defined SU_L(2) x
SU_R(2) and U_A(1) chiral transformation properties. Mixing of the [(1,1/2) +
(1/2,1)] chiral multiplet with one of [(1/2,0) + (0,1/2)] or [(0,1/2) +
(1/2,0)] representation can be used to fit the isovector axial coupling g_A(1)
and thus predict the isoscalar axial coupling g_A(0) of the nucleon, in
reasonable agreement with experiment. We also use a chiral meson-baryon
interaction to calculate the masses and one-pion-interaction terms of J=1/2
baryons belonging to the [(0,1/2) + (1/2,0)] and [(1,1/2) + (1/2,1)] chiral
multiplets and fit two of the diagonalized masses to the lowest-lying nucleon
resonances thus predicting the third J=1/2 resonance at 2030 MeV, not far from
the (one-star PDG) state Delta(2150).
