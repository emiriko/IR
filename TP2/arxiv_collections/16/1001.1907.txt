The aim of this paper is to propose an operational two-dimensional parametric
adjustment for laws of maintenance in disability. The method suggested rests on
splines in dimension 2; it is applied to a real data set, and the scale of
reserving which results from it is compared with the scale of reference of the
BCAC.
