The EPR correlation has become an integral part of quantum communications as
has general relativity in classical communication theory, however when combined
an apparent deterioration is observed for spin states. We consider appropriate
changes in directions of measurement to exploit full EPR entanglement for a
pair of particles and show that it can be deduced only up to the outer even
horizon of a Kerr-Newman black hole, even in the case of freely falling
observer.
