We consider two spherical, roughened crystals with approximately isotropic
surface free energy which are brought into contact and begin to sinter. We
argue that the geometry immediately post-contact is two dimensional and
Cartesian and can be approximated by the evolution of a slot-shaped cavity. On
this basis, we construct travelling wave solutions for the crystal shape in the
limits of bulk diffusion limited and surface diffusion limited kinetics. These
solutions are then used to calculate novel scalings for the neck size as a
function of time $t$ after contact: We predict that neck size is proportional
to $t^{1/4}$ for the bulk diffusion limited case and (following a single
pinch-off event) approximately proportional to $t^{1/3}$ for the surface
diffusion limited case.
