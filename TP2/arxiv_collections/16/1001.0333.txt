We announce the discovery of Kepler-6b, a transiting hot Jupiter orbiting a
star with unusually high metallicity, [Fe/H] = +0.34 +/- 0.04. The planet's
mass is about 2/3 that of Jupiter, Mp = 0.67 Mj, and the radius is thirty
percent larger than that of Jupiter, Rp = 1.32 Rj, resulting in a density of
0.35 g/cc, a fairly typical value for such a planet. The orbital period is P =
3.235 days. The host star is both more massive than the Sun, Mstar = 1.21 Msun,
and larger than the Sun, Rstar = 1.39 Rsun.
