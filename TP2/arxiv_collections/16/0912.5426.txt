The existing solutions to privacy preserving publication can be classified
into the theoretical and heuristic categories. The former guarantees provably
low information loss, whereas the latter incurs gigantic loss in the worst
case, but is shown empirically to perform well on many real inputs. While
numerous heuristic algorithms have been developed to satisfy advanced privacy
principles such as l-diversity, t-closeness, etc., the theoretical category is
currently limited to k-anonymity which is the earliest principle known to have
severe vulnerability to privacy attacks. Motivated by this, we present the
first theoretical study on l-diversity, a popular principle that is widely
adopted in the literature. First, we show that optimal l-diverse generalization
is NP-hard even when there are only 3 distinct sensitive values in the
microdata. Then, an (l*d)-approximation algorithm is developed, where d is the
dimensionality of the underlying dataset. This is the first known algorithm
with a non-trivial bound on information loss. Extensive experiments with real
datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed solution.
