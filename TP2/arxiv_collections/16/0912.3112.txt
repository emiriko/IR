Equation of motion for the galactic tide is derived under the assumption of
cylindrically symmetric gravitational potential of the Galaxy. The paper
considers galactic tide both for the galactic plane $x-$ and $y-$ components
and also for the normal $z-$ component. The $x-$ and $y-$ components of the
acceleration come not only from the $x-$ and $y-$ components of the position of
a body, but also from its $z-$component of the position vector.
  Values of the Oort constants are $A$ $=$ (14.2 $\pm$ 0.5) $km s^{-1}
kpc^{-1}$ and $B$ $=$ ($-$ 12.4 $\pm$ 0.5) $km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}$. %(the values
hold for the galactocentric distance of the Sun). Mass density in the solar
neighborhood, 30 $pc$ above the galactic equatorial plane, equals to (0.117
$\pm$ 0.005) $M_{\odot} pc^{-3}$. The result for the acceleration is written in
the form easily applicable to Solar System studies, to the evolution of comets
in the Oort cloud.
