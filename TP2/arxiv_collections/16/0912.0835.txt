We fabricated and characterized a new spin-functional MOSFET referred to as a
pseudo-spin-MOSFET (PS-MOSFET). The PS-MOSFET is a circuit using an ordinary
MOSFET and magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) for reproducing functions of
spin-transistors. Device integration techniques for a bottom gate MOSFET using
a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate and for an MTJ with a full-Heusler alloy
electrode and MgO tunnel barrier were developed. The fabricated PS-MOSFET
exhibited high and low transconductance controlled by the magnetization
configurations of the MTJ at room temperature. This is the first observation of
spin-transistor operations for spin-functional MOSFETs.
