The asymptotics of the SU(2) 15j symbol are obtained using coherent states
for the boundary data. The geometry of all non-suppressed boundary data is
given. For some boundary data, the resulting formula is interpreted in terms of
the Regge action of the geometry of a 4-simplex in 4-dimensional Euclidean
space. This asymptotic formula can be used to derive and extend the asymptotics
of the spin foam amplitudes for quantum gravity models. The relation of the
SU(2) Ooguri model to these quantum gravity models and their continuum
Lagrangians is discussed.
