QCD equation of state is calculated in (2+1) flavor QCD at temperatures
corresponding fermion action on lattices with temporal extent $N_{\tau}=8$. The
results are compared with previous calculations performed at twice larger
values of the light quark masses as well as with results obtained from the
resonance gas model calculation. The deconfining and chiral aspects of the QCD
transition are also discussed
