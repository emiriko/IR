We present a summary of the observation strategy of TANAMI (Tracking Active
Galactic Nuclei with Austral Milliarcsecond Interferometry), a monitoring
program to study the parsec-scale structure and dynamics of relativistic jets
in active galactic nuclei (AGN) of the Southern Hemisphere with the Australian
Long Baseline Array (LBA) and the trans-oceanic antennas Hartebeesthoek, TIGO,
and O'Higgins. TANAMI is focusing on extragalactic sources south of -30 degrees
declination with observations at 8.4 GHz and 22 GHz every ~2 months at
milliarcsecond resolution. The initial TANAMI sample of 43 sources has been
defined before the launch of the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope to include the
most promising candidates for bright gamma-ray emission to be detected with its
Large Area Telescope (LAT). Since November 2008, we have been adding new
sources to the sample, which now includes all known radio- and gamma-ray bright
AGN of the Southern Hemisphere. The combination of VLBI and gamma-ray
observations is crucial to understand the broadband emission characteristics of
AGN and the nature of relativistic jets.
