After a brief review of the muon g-2 status, we discuss hypothetical errors
in the Standard Model prediction that might explain the present discrepancy
with the experimental value. None of them seems likely. In particular, a
hypothetical increase of the hadroproduction cross section in low-energy e+e-
collisions could bridge the muon g-2 discrepancy, but it is shown to be
unlikely in view of current experimental error estimates. If, nonetheless, this
turns out to be the explanation of the discrepancy, then the 95% CL upper bound
on the Higgs boson mass is reduced to about 135GeV which, in conjunction with
the experimental 114.4GeV 95% CL lower bound, leaves a narrow window for the
mass of this fundamental particle.
