We construct a holographic dark energy model in a braneworld setup that
gravity is induced on the brane embedded in a bulk with Gauss-Bonnet curvature
term. We include possible modification of the induced gravity and its coupling
with a canonical scalar field on the brane. Through a perturbational approach
to calculate the effective gravitation constant on the brane, we examine the
outcome of this model as a candidate for holographic dark energy.
