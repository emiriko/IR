Oscillating stars in binary systems are among the most interesting stellar
laboratories, as these can provide information on the stellar parameters and
stellar internal structures. Here we present a red giant with solar-like
oscillations in an eclipsing binary observed with the NASA Kepler satellite. We
compute stellar parameters of the red giant from spectra and the asteroseismic
mass and radius from the oscillations. Although only one eclipse has been
observed so far, we can already determine that the secondary is a main-sequence
F star in an eccentric orbit with a semi-major axis larger than 0.5 AU and
orbital period longer than 75 days.
