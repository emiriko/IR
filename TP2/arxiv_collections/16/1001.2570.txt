We consider the response of a protostellar disc to a tidally induced warp and
the resultant changes in the spectral energy distribution (SED). We argue that
for typical protostellar disc parameters the warp is communicated through the
disc in a wave-like fashion. We find that the main effects of the warp tend to
be at large radii (greater than 30 AU) and, for sufficiently small viscosity,
can be quite long-lived. This can result in non-uniform illumination of the
disc at these radii and can induce significant changes to the SED at
wavelengths greater than 100 microns.
