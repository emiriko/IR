We consider a Boussinesq system describing one-dimensional internal waves
which develop at the boundary between two immiscible fluids, and we restrict to
its traveling waves. The method which yields explicitly all the elliptic or
degenerate elliptic solutions of a given nonlinear, any order algebraic
ordinary differential equation is briefly recalled. We then apply it to the
fluid system and, restricting in this preliminary report to the generic
situation, we obtain all the solutions in that class, including several new
solutions.
