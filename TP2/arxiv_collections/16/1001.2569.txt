Structured P2P overlays provide a framework for building distributed
applications that are self-configuring, scalable, and resilient to node
failures. Such systems have been successfully adopted in large-scale Internet
services such as content delivery networks and file sharing; however,
widespread adoption in small/medium scales has been limited due in part to
security concerns and difficulty bootstrapping in NAT-constrained environments.
Nonetheless, P2P systems can be designed to provide guaranteed lookup times,
NAT traversal, point-to-point overlay security, and distributed data stores. In
this paper we propose a novel way of creating overlays that are both secure and
private and a method to bootstrap them using a public overlay. Private overlay
nodes use the public overlay's distributed data store to discover each other,
and the public overlay's connections to assist with NAT hole punching and as
relays providing STUN and TURN NAT traversal techniques. The security framework
utilizes groups, which are created and managed by users through a web based
user interface. Each group acts as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) relying on
the use of a centrally-managed web site providing an automated Certificate
Authority (CA). We present a reference implementation which has been used in a
P2P VPN (Virtual Private Network). To evaluate our contributions, we apply our
techniques to an overlay network modeler, event-driven simulations using
simulated time delays, and deployment in the PlanetLab wide-area testbed.
