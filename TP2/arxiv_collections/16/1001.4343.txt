Superradiance scattering from a Bose-Einstein condensate is studied with a
two-frequency pumping beam. We demonstrate the possibility of fully tuning the
backward mode population as a function of the locked initial relative phase
between the two frequency components of the pumping beam. This result comes
from an imprinting of this initial relative phase on two matter wave gratings,
formed by the forward mode or backward mode condensate plus the condensate at
rest, so that cooperative scattering is affected. A numerical simulation using
a semiclassical model agrees with our observations.
