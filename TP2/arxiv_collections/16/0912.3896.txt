This talk reviews progress in the (semi-) analytic calculations of the
thermodynamics of the quark-gluon plasma. I shall explain how weak coupling
techniques can allow us, through appropriate resummations, to deal with
particular non perturbative aspects of the quark-gluon plasma. Then I shall
show how the exact renormalization group may provide insight into the physics
of this multi-scale system
