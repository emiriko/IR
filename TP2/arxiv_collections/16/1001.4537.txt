We report the high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
studies of electronic structure of EuFe2As2. The paramagnetic state data are
found to be consistent with density-functional calculations. In the
antiferromagnetic ordering state of Fe, our results show that the band
splitting, folding, and hybridization evolve with temperature, which cannot be
explained by a simple folding picture. Detailed measurements reveal that a tiny
electron Fermi pocket and a tiny hole pocket are formed near (pi,pi) in the
(0,0)-(pi,pi) direction, which qualitatively agree with the results of quantum
oscillations, considering kz variation of Fermi surface. Furthermore, no
noticeable change within the energy resolution is observed across the
antiferromagnetic transition of Eu2+ ordering, suggesting weak coupling between
Eu sublattice and FeAs sublattice.
