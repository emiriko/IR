Single spin asymmetry in inclusive $\pi^0$-production was measured in the
polarized target fragmentation region using 50 GeV proton beam. The asymmetry
is in agreement with asymmetry measurements in the polarized beam fragmentation
region carried out at higher energies. The measurement completed 30-years
history of polarized measurements at the PROZA setup.
