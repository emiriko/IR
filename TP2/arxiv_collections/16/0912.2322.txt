We study numerically shear banded flow in planar and curved Couette
geometries. Our aim is to explain two recent observations in shear banding
systems of roll cells stacked in the vorticity direction, associated with an
undulation of the interface between the bands. Depending on the degree of cell
curvature and on the material's constitutive properties, we find either (i) an
instability of the interface between the bands driven by a jump in second
normal stress across it; or (ii) a bulk viscoelastic Taylor Couette instability
in the high shear band driven by a large first normal stress within it. Both
lead to roll cells and interfacial undulations, but with a different signature
in each case. Our work thereby suggests a different origin for the roll cells
in each of the recent experiments.
