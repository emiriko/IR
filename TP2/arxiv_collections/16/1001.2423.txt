A consistent strategy for the subtraction of the divergences in the
nonlinearly realized Electroweak Model in the loop expansion is presented. No
Higgs field enters into the perturbative spectrum. The local functional
equation (LFE), encoding the invariance of the SU(2) Haar measure under local
left SU(2) transformations, the Slavnov-Taylor identity, required in order to
fulfill physical unitarity, and the Landau gauge equation hold in the
nonlinearly realized theory. The quantization is performed in the Landau gauge
for the sake of simplicity and elegance. The constraints on the admissible
interactions arising from the Weak Power-Counting (WPC) are discussed. The same
symmetric pattern of the couplings as in the Standard Model is shown to arise,
as a consequence of the defining functional identities and the WPC. However,
two independent mass invariants in the vector meson sector are possible, i.e.
no tree-level Weinberg relation holds between the Z and W mass. Majorana
neutrino masses can be implemented in the nonlinearly realized Electroweak
Model in a way compatible with the WPC and all the symmetries of the theory.
