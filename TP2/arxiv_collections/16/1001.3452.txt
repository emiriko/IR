Optimally doped single crystals of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$T$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ (T=Co, Ni)
were irradiated with 1.4 GeV $^{208}$Pb$^{56+}$ ions at fluences corresponding
to matching fields of $B_{\phi}=0.1, 0.5, 1$ and 2 T. Magneto-optical imaging
has been used to map the distribution of the magnetic induction in the
irradiated samples. The imaging is complemented by the magnetization
measurements. The results show a substantial enhancement of the apparent
critical current densities as revealed by the much larger Bean penetration
fields and an increase of the hysteretic magnetization. However, the effect
depends on the compound, temperature and applied magnetic field. In \FeCo
crystals, at 15 K and low fields, the enhancement appears to scale with the
irradiation dose at a rate of about 0.27 MA$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$T$^{-1}$, whereas in
\FeNi crystals, higher irradiation doses are less effective. Our results
suggest that moderate irradiation with heavy ions is a an effective way to
\emph{homogeneously} enhance the current-currying capabilities of pnictide
superconductors.
