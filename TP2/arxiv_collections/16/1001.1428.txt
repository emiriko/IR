We use the method of statistical parallax to constrain the distance-scale
zero points and analyze the kinematics of extensive samples of Galactic
classical Cepheids, RR Lyrae type variables, and blue horizontal branch stars,
which serve as standard candles/kinematic tracers of various Galactic
populations. We obtain three consistent estimates for the local circular
velocity based on the mean velocities of halo RR Lyrae variables, BHB stars,
and Galactic rotation curve inferred from Cepheid data with an average value of
210+/-6 km/s, which is close to the average circular velocity in the 5-40 kpc
interval of Galactocentric distances inferred from BHB star data (195+/-5
km/s), thereby providing further supporting evidence for the practically flat
shape of the Galactic rotation curve beyond ~5 kpc from the center. The
inferred distance-scale corrections imply a solar Galactocentric distance of
7.7+/-0.4 kpc, an LMC distance modulus of 18.42+/-0.06, and a Hubble constant
of 73-85 km/s/Mpc.
