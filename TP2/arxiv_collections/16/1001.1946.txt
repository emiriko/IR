The neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay of nuclei is reviewed. We discuss
neutrino mixing and 3x3 PMNS neutrino mixing matrix. Basic theory of
neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay is presented in some details. Results of
different calculations of nuclear matrix element are discussed. Experimental
situation is considered. The Appendix is dedicated to E. Majorana (brief
biography and his paper in which the theory of Majorana particles is given)
