We analyze non-Markovian evolution of open quantum systems. It is shown that
any dynamical map representing evolution of such a system may be described
either by non-local master equation with memory kernel or equivalently by
equation which is local in time. These two descriptions are complementary: if
one is simple the other is quite involved, or even singular, and vice versa.
The price one pays for the local approach is that the corresponding generator
keeps the memory about the starting point `t_0'. This is the very essence of
non-Markovianity. Interestingly, this generator might be highly singular,
nevertheless, the corresponding dynamics is perfectly regular. Remarkably,
singularities of generator may lead to interesting physical phenomena like
revival of coherence or sudden death and revival of entanglement.
