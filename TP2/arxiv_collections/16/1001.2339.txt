The static equilibrium deformation of a heavy spring due to its own weight is
calculated for two cases. First for a spring hanging in a constant
gravitational field, then for a spring which is at rest in a rotating system
where it is stretched by the centrifugal force. Two different models are
considered. First a discrete model assuming a finite number of point masses
connected by springs of negligible weight. Then the continuum limit of this
model. In the second case the differential equation for the deformation is
obtained by demanding that the potential energy is minimized. In this way a
simple application of the variational calculus is obtained.
