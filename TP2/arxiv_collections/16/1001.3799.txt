This paper contains a discussion on the quantum cosmic models, starting with
the interpretation that all of the accelerating effects in the current universe
are originated from the existence of a nonzero entropy of entanglement. In such
a realm, we obtain new cosmic solutions for any arbitrary number of spatial
dimensions, studying the stability of these solutions, so as the emergence of
gravitational waves in the realm of the most general models.
