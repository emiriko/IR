We present results obtained from extensive near-infrared spectroscopic and
photometric observations of nova V574 Pup during its 2004 outburst. The
observations were obtained over four months, starting from 2004 November 25
(four days after the nova outburst) to 2005 March 20. The near-IR JHK light
curve is presented - no evidence is seen from it for dust formation to have
occurred during our observations. In the early decline phase, the JHK spectra
of the nova are dominated by emission lines of hydrogen Brackett and Paschen
series, OI, CI and HeI. We also detect the fairly uncommon Fe II line at 1.6872
micron in the early part of our observations. The strengths of the HeI lines at
1.0830 micron and 2.0585 micron are found to become very strong towards the end
of the observations indicating a progression towards higher excitation
conditions in the nova ejecta. The width of the emission lines do not show any
significant change during the course of our observations. The slope of the
continuum spectrum was found to have a lambda^{-2.75} dependence in the early
stages which gradually becomes flatter with time and changes to a free-free
spectral dependence towards the later stages. Recombination analysis of the HI
lines shows deviations from Case B conditions during the initial stages.
However, towards the end of our observations, the line strengths are well
simulated with case B model values with electron density n_e = 10^{9-10}
cm^{-3} and a temperature equal to 10^4 K. Based on our distance estimate to
the nova of 5.5 kpc and the observed free-free continuum emission in the later
part of the observations, we estimate the ionized mass of the ejecta to be
between 10^{-5} and 10^{-6} solar-mass.
