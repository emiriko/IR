We provide an intuitive platform for engineering exciton transfer dynamics.
We show that careful consideration of the spectral density, which describes the
system-bath interaction, leads to opportunities to engineer the transfer of an
exciton. Since excitons in nanostructures are proposed for use in quantum
information processing and artificial photosynthetic designs, our approach
paves the way for engineering a wide range of desired exciton dynamics. We
carefully describe the validity of the model and use experimentally relevant
material parameters to show counter-intuitive examples of a directed exciton
transfer in a linear chain of quantum dots.
