We analyze the formation and dynamics of bright unstaggered solitons in the
disk-shaped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, which features the interplay of
contact (collisional) and long-range dipole-dipole (DD) interactions between
atoms. The condensate is assumed to be trapped in a strong optical-lattice
potential in the disk's plane, hence it may be approximated by a
two-dimensional (2D) discrete model, which includes the on-site nonlinearity
and cubic long-range (DD) interactions between sites of the lattice. We
consider two such models, that differ by the form of the on-site nonlinearity,
represented by the usual cubic term, or more accurate nonpolynomial one,
derived from the underlying 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Similar results are
obtained for both models. The analysis is focused on effects of the DD
interaction on fundamental localized modes in the lattice (2D discrete
solitons). The repulsive isotropic DD nonlinearity extends the existence and
stability regions of the fundamental solitons. New families of on-site,
inter-site and hybrid solitons, built on top of a finite background, are found
as a result of the interplay of the isotropic repulsive DD interaction and
attractive contact nonlinearity. By themselves, these solutions are unstable,
but they evolve into robust breathers which exist on an oscillating background.
In the presence of the repulsive contact interactions, fundamental localized
modes exist if the DD interaction (attractive isotropic or anisotropic) is
strong enough. They are stable in narrow regions close to the anticontinuum
limit, while unstable solitons evolve into breathers. In the latter case, the
presence of the background is immaterial.
