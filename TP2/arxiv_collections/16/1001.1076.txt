We discuss the neutrino constraints from solar and terrestrial dark matter
(DM) annihilations in the inelastic dark matter (iDM) scenario after the recent
CDMS II results. To reconcile the DAMA/LIBRA data with constraints from all
other direct experiments, the iDM needs to be light ($m_\chi < 100$ GeV) and
have a large DM-nucleon cross section ($\sigma_n \sim$ 10$^{-4}$ pb in the
spin-independent (SI) scattering and $\sigma_n \sim$ 10 pb in the
spin-dependent (SD) scattering). The dominant contribution to the iDM capture
in the Sun is from scattering off Fe/Al in the SI/SD case. Current bounds from
Super-Kamiokande exclude the hard DM annihilation channels, such as $W^+W^-$,
$ZZ$, $t\bar{t}$ and $\tau^+ \tau^-$. For soft channels such as $b\bar{b}$ and
$c \bar{c}$, the limits are loose, but could be tested or further constrained
by future IceCube plus DeepCore. For neutrino constraints from the DM
annihilation in the Earth, due to the weaker gravitational effect of the Earth
and inelastic capture condition, the constraint exists only for small mass
splitting $\delta <$ 40 keV and $m_\chi \sim (10, 50)$ GeV even in the $\tau^+
\tau^-$ channel.
