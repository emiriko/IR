We describe some recent results on isospin breaking corrections which are of
relevance for predictions of the leading order hadronic contribution to the
muon anomalous magnetic moment (amuhadLO) when using tau lepton data. When
these corrections are applied to the new combined data on the pi^+pi^0 spectral
function, the prediction for amuhadLO based on tau lepton data gets closer to
the one obtained using e^+e^- data.
