Proteins with nontrivial topology, containing knots and slipknots, have the
ability to fold to their native states without any additional external forces
invoked. A mechanism is suggested for folding of these proteins, such as YibK
and YbeA, which involves an intermediate configuration with a slipknot. It
elucidates the role of topological barriers and backtracking during the folding
event. It also illustrates that native contacts are sufficient to guarantee
folding in around 1-2% of the simulations, and how slipknot intermediates are
needed to reduce the topological bottlenecks. As expected, simulations of
proteins with similar structure but with knot removed fold much more
efficiently, clearly demonstrating the origin of these topological barriers.
Although these studies are based on a simple coarse-grained model, they are
already able to extract some of the underlying principles governing folding in
such complex topologies.
