We investigate a new laser scheme by using Ramsey separated-field technique
with bad cavity. By studying the linewidth of the stimulated-emission spectrum
of this kind of laser inside the cavity, we find its linewidth is more than two
orders of magnitude narrower than atomic natural linewidth, and it is far
superior to that of conventional optical Ramsey method and any other available
subnatural linewidth spectroscopy at present. Since any cavity related noise is
reduced to cavity-pulling effect in bad cavity laser, this Ramsey laser
provides the possibility of precision subnatural linewidth spectroscopy, which
is critical for the next generation of optical clock and atom interferometers.
