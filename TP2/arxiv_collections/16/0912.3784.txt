The bispectral quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (BqKZ) equation corresponding
to the affine Hecke algebra $H$ of type $A_{N-1}$ is a consistent system of
$q$-difference equations which in some sense contains two families of
Cherednik's quantum affine Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for meromorphic
functions with values in principal series representations of $H$. In this paper
we extend this construction of BqKZ to the case where $H$ is the affine Hecke
algebra associated to an arbitrary irreducible reduced root system. We
construct explicit solutions of BqKZ and describe its correspondence to a
bispectral problem involving Macdonald's $q$-difference operators.
