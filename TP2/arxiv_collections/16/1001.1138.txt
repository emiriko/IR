A quasi-classical model (QCM) of molecular dynamics in intense femtosecond
laser fields has been developed, and applied to a study of the effect of an
ultrashort `control' pulse on the vibrational motion of a deuterium molecular
ion in its ground electronic state. A nonadiabatic treatment accounts for the
initial ionization-induced vibrational population caused by an ultrashort
`pump' pulse. In the QCM, the nuclei move classically on the molecular
potential as it is distorted by the laser-induced Stark shift and transition
dipole. The nuclei then adjust to the modified potential, non-destructively
shifting the vibrational population and relative phase. This shift has been
studied as a function of control pulse parameters. Excellent agreement is
observed with predictions of time-dependent quantum simulations, lending
confidence to the validity of the model and permitting new observations to be
made. The applicability of the QCM to more complex multi-potential energy
surface molecules (where a quantum treatment is at best difficult) is
discussed.
