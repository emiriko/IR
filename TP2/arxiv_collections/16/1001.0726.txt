Multiverse scenarios in cosmology assume that other universes exist "beyond"
our own universe. They are an exciting challenge both for empirical and
theoretical research as well as for philosophy of science. They could be
necessary to understand why the big bang occurred, why (some of) the laws of
nature and the values of certain physical constants are the way they are, and
why there is an arrow of time. This essay clarifies competing notions of
"universe" and "multiverse"; it proposes a classification of different
multiverse types according to various aspects how the universes are or are not
separated from each other; it reviews the main reasons for assuming the
existence of other universes: empirical evidence, theoretical explanation, and
philosophical arguments; and, finally, it argues that some attempts to
criticize multiverse scenarios as "unscientific", insisting on a narrow
understanding of falsification, is neither appropriate nor convincing from a
philosophy of science point of view. --
