Here we examine the Milky Way's GC system to estimate the fraction of
accreted versus in situ formed GCs. We first assemble a high quality database
of ages and metallicities for 93 Milky Way GCs from literature deep
colour-magnitude data. The age-metallicity relation for the Milky Way's GCs
reveals two distinct tracks -- one with near constant old age of ~12.8 Gyr and
the other branches to younger ages. We find that the latter young track is
dominated by globular clusters associated with the Sagittarius and Canis Major
dwarf galaxies. Despite being overly simplistic, its age-metallicity relation
can be well represented by a simple closed box model with continuous star
formation. The inferred chemical enrichment history is similar to that of the
Large Magellanic Cloud, but is more enriched, at a given age, compared to the
Small Magellanic Cloud. After excluding Sagittarius and Canis Major GCs,
several young track GCs remain. Their horizontal branch morphologies are often
red and hence classified as Young Halo objects, however they do not tend to
reveal extended horizontal branches (a possible signature of an accreted
remnant nucleus). Retrograde orbit GCs (a key signature of accretion) are
commonly found in the young track. We also examine GCs that lie close to the
Fornax-Leo-Sculptor great circle defined by several satellite galaxies. We find
that several GCs are consistent with the young track and we speculate that they
may have been accreted along with their host dwarf galaxy, whose nucleus may
survive as a GC. Finally, we suggest that 27-47 GCs (about 1/4 of the entire
system), from 6-8 dwarf galaxies, were accreted to build the Milky Way GC
system we seen today.
