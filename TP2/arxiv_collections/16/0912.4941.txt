We investigate the parameterized computational complexity of the
satisfiability problem for modal logic and attempt to pinpoint relevant
structural parameters which cause the problem's combinatorial explosion, beyond
the number of propositional variables v. To this end we study the modality
depth, a natural measure which has appeared in the literature, and show that,
even though modal satisfiability parameterized by v and the modality depth is
FPT, the running time's dependence on the parameters is a tower of exponentials
(unless P=NP). To overcome this limitation we propose several possible
alternative parameters, namely diamond dimension, box dimension and modal
width. We show fixed-parameter tractability results using these measures where
the exponential dependence on the parameters is much milder than in the case of
modality depth thus leading to FPT algorithms for modal satisfiability with
much more reasonable running times.
