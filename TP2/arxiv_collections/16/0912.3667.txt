C. E. Creffield and F. Sols (Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 200601 (2009)) recently
reported finite, directed time-averaged ratchet current, for a noninteracting
quantum particle in a periodic potential even when time-reversal symmetry
holds. As we explain in this Comment, this result is incorrect, that is,
time-reversal symmetry implies a vanishing current.
