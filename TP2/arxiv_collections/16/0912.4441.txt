The discovery of cosmic radio emission by Karl Jansky in the course of
searching for the source of interference to telephone communications and the
instrumental advances which followed, have led to a series of new paradigm
changing astronomical discoveries. These discoveries, which to a large extent
define much of modern astrophysical research were the result of the right
people being in the right place at the right time using powerful new
instruments, which in many cases they had designed and built. They were not the
result of trying to test any particular theoretical model or trying to answer
previously posed questions, but they opened up whole new areas of exploration
and discovery. Rather many important discoveries came from military or
communications research; others while looking for something else; and yet
others from just looking. Traditionally, the designers of big telescopes
invariably did not predict what the telescopes would ultimately be known for.
The place in history of the next generation of telescopes will not likely be
found in the science case created to justify their construction, but in the
unexpected new phenomena, new theories, and new ideas which will emerge from
these discoveries. It is important that those who are in a position to filter
research proposals and plans not dismiss as butterfly collecting,
investigations which explore new areas without having predefined the result
they are looking for. Progress must also allow for new discoveries, as well as
for the explanation of old discoveries. New telescopes need to be designed with
the flexibility to make new discoveries which will invariably raise new
questions and new problems.
