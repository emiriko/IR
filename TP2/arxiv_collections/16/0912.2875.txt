For the statistics of global observables in disordered systems, we discuss
the matching between typical fluctuations and large deviations. We focus on the
statistics of the ground state energy $E_0$ in two types of disordered models :
(i) for the directed polymer of length $N$ in a two-dimensional medium, where
many exact results exist (ii) for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model
of $N$ spins, where various possibilities have been proposed. Here we stress
that, besides the behavior of the disorder-average $E_0^{av}(N)$ and of the
standard deviation $ \Delta E_0(N) \sim N^{\omega_f}$ that defines the
fluctuation exponent $\omega_f$, it is very instructive to study the full
probability distribution $\Pi(u)$ of the rescaled variable $u=
\frac{E_0(N)-E_0^{av}(N)}{\Delta E_0(N)}$ : (a) numerically, the convergence
towards $\Pi(u)$ is usually very rapid, so that data on rather small sizes but
with high statistics allow to measure the two tails exponents $\eta_{\pm}$
defined as $\ln \Pi(u \to \pm \infty) \sim - | u |^{\eta_{\pm}}$. In the
generic case $1< \eta_{\pm} < +\infty$, this leads to explicit non-trivial
terms in the asymptotic behaviors of the moments $\bar{Z_N^n}$ of the partition
function when the combination $[| n | N^{\omega_f}]$ becomes large (b) simple
rare events arguments can usually be found to obtain explicit relations between
$\eta_{\pm}$ and $\omega_f$. These rare events usually correspond to
'anomalous' large deviation properties of the generalized form $R(w_{\pm} =
\frac{E_0(N)-E_0^{av}(N)}{N^{\kappa_{\pm}}}) \sim e^{- N^{\rho_{\pm}} {\cal
R}_{\pm}(w_{\pm})}$ (the 'usual' large deviations formalism corresponds to
$\kappa_{\pm}=1=\rho_{\pm}$).
