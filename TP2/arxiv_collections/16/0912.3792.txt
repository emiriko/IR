We perform a chiral extrapolation of lattice data on the scalar K pi form
factor and the ratio of the kaon and pion decay constants within Chiral
Perturbation Theory to two loops. We determine the value of the scalar form
factor at zero momentum transfer, at the Callan-Treiman point and at its soft
kaon analog as well as its slope. Results are in good agreement with their
determination from experiment using the standard couplings of quarks to the W
boson. The slope is however rather large. A study of the convergence of the
chiral expansion is also performed.
