A static, asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric solutions is
investigated in f(R) theories of gravity for a charged black hole. We have
studied the weak field limit of f(R) gravity for the some f(R) model such as
f(R) = R + epsilon h(R). In particular, weconsider the case lim_{R =0} {h(R)/
dh(R)/dR}=0 and find the space time metric for f(R) = R + {mu}^{4} /R and f(R)
= R^{1-epsilon} theories of gravity far away a charged mass point.
