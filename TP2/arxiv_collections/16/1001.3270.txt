The notion of causal boundary $\partial M$ for a strongly causal spacetime
$M$ has been a controversial topic along last decades: on one hand, some
attempted definitions were not fully consistent, on the other, there were
simple examples where an open conformal embedding $i:M\hookarrow M_{0}$ could
be defined, but the corresponding conformal boundary $\partial_{i}M$ disagreed
drastically with the causal one. Nevertheless, the recent progress in this
topic suggests a definitive option for $\partial M$, which is developed here in
detail. Our study has two parts: (I) To give general arguments on a boundary in
order to ensure that it is admissible as a causal boundary at the three natural
levels, i.e., as a point set, as a chronological space and as a topological
space. Then, the essential uniqueness of our choice is stressed, and the
relatively few admissible alternatives are discussed. (II) To analyze the role
of the conformal boundary $\partial_{i}M$. We show that, in general,
$\partial_{i}M$ may present a very undesirable structure. Nevertheless, it is
well-behaved under certain general assumptions, and its accessible part
$\partial_{i}^{*}M$ agrees with the causal boundary. This study justifies both
boundaries. On one hand, the conformal boundary $\partial_{i}^{*}M$, which
cannot be defined for a general spacetime but is easily computed in particular
examples, appears now as a special case of the causal boundary. On the other,
the new redefinition of the causal boundary not only is free of inconsistencies
and applicable to any strongly causal spacetime, but also recovers the expected
structure in the cases where a natural conformal boundary is available. The
cases of globally hyperbolic spacetimes and asymptotically conformally flat
ends are especially studied.
