We present results from Suzaku and Swift observations of the nearby radio
galaxy 3C 33, and investigate the nature of absorption, reflection, and jet
production in this source. We model the 0.5-100 keV nuclear continuum with a
power law that is transmitted either through one or more layers of pc-scale
neutral material, or through a modestly ionized pc-scale obscurer. The standard
signatures of reflection from a neutral accretion disk are absent in 3C 33:
there is no evidence of a relativistically blurred Fe K$\alpha$ emission line,
and no Compton reflection hump above 10 keV. We find the upper limit to the
neutral reflection fraction is R<0.41 for an e-folding energy of 1 GeV. We
observe a narrow, neutral Fe K$\alpha$ line, which is likely to originate at
least 2,000 R_s from the black hole. We show that the weakness of reflection
features in 3C 33 is consistent with two interpretations: either the inner
accretion flow is highly ionized, or the black-hole spin configuration is
retrograde with respect to the accreting material.
