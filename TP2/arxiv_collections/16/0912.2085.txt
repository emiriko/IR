Formation of the nonequilibrium subsystem in dynamical processes during
defect generation is simulated by means of molecular dynamics. A particular
process of dissipation of the low-frequency acoustic emission into
high-frequency equilibrium vibrations of lattice is studied numerically. Clear
heuristic reasons are used to introduce different temperatures and entropies
for equilibrium and nonequilibrium subsystems. Simple relaxation equation is
proposed to describe time behavior of the nonequilibrium entropy.
