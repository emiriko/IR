A first measurement of the di-hadron interference fragmentation function of
light quarks in pion pairs with the Belle detector is presented. The chiral odd
nature of this fragmentation function allows the use as a quark polarimeter
sensitive to the transverse polarization of the fragmenting quark. Therefore it
can be used together with data taken at fixed target and collider experiments
to extract the quark transversity distribution. A sample consisting of $711
\times 10^6$ di-hadron pairs was extracted from 661 $fb^{-1}$ of data recorded
near the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance delivered by the KEKB $e^+$$e^{-}$ collider.
