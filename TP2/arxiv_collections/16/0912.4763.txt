A comprehensive theory of the Landau-Zener transition in quadratic nonlinear
two-state systems is developed. A compact analytic formula involving elementary
functions only is derived for the final transition probability. The formula
provides a highly accurate approximation for the whole rage of the variation of
the Landau-Zener parameter.
