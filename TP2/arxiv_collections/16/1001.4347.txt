The position and strength of the boson peak in silica glass vary considerably
with temperature $T$. Such variations cannot be explained solely with changes
in the Debye energy. New Brillouin scattering measurements are presented which
allow determining the $T$-dependence of unrelaxed acoustic velocities. Using a
velocity based on the bulk modulus, scaling exponents are found which agree
with the soft-potential model. The unrelaxed bulk modulus thus appears to be a
good measure for the structural evolution of silica with $T$ and to set the
energy scale for the soft potentials.
