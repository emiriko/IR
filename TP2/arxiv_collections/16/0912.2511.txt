It is now well established that all galaxies with a massive bulge component
harbour a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The mass of the SMBH
correlates with bulge properties such as the bulge mass and the velocity
dispersion, which implies that the bulge and the SMBH of a galaxy have grown
together during the formation process. The spiral galaxy NGC3368 and the S0
galaxy NGC3489 both host a pseudobulge and a much smaller classical bulge
component at the centre. We present high resolution, near-infrared IFU data of
these two galaxies, taken with SINFONI at the VLT, and use axisymmetric orbit
models to determine the masses of the SMBHs. The SMBH mass of NGC3368 is
M_BH=7.5x10^6 M_sun with an error of 1.5x10^6 M_sun, which mostly comes from
the non-axisymmetry in the data. For NGC3489, a solution without black hole
cannot be excluded when modelling the SINFONI data alone, but can be clearly
ruled out when modelling a combination of SINFONI, OASIS and SAURON data, for
which we obtain M_BH=6.00^{+0.56}_{-0.54} (stat) +/- 0.64 (sys) x 10^6 M_sun.
Although both galaxies seem to be consistent with the M_BH-sigma relation, at
face value they do not agree with the relation between bulge magnitude and
black hole mass when the total bulge magnitude (i.e., including both classical
bulge and pseudobulge) is considered; the agreement is better when only the
small classical bulge components are considered. However, taking into account
the ageing of the stellar population could change this conclusion.
