We introduce a new universality class of one-dimensional iteration model
giving rise to self-similar motion, in which the Feigenbaum constants are
generalized as self-similar rates and can be predetermined. The curves of the
mean-square displacement versus time generated here show that the motion is a
kind of anomalous diffusion with the diffusion coefficient depending on the
self-similar rates. In addition, it is found that the distribution of
displacement agrees to a reliable precision with the q-Gaussian type
distribution in some cases and bimodal distribution in some other cases. The
results obtained show that the self-similar motion may be used to describe the
anomalous diffusion and nonextensive statistical distributions.
