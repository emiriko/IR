We show that two families of germs of real-analytic subsets in $C^{n}$ are
formally equivalent if and only if they are equivalent of any finite order. We
further apply the same technique to obtain analogous statements for
equivalences of real-analytic self-maps and vector fields under conjugations.
On the other hand, we provide an example of two sets of germs of smooth curves
that are equivalent of any finite order but not formally equivalent.
