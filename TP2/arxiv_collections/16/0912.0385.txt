Let $U_n(q)$ be the upper triangular group of degree $n$ over the finite
field $\F_q$ with $q$ elements. In this paper, we present constructions of
large degree ordinary irreducible representations of $U_n(q)$ where $n\geq 7$,
and then determine the number of irreducible representations of largest, second
largest and third largest degrees.
