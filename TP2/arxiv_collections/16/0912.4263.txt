Searches for very-high-redshift galaxies over the past decade have yielded a
large sample of more than 6,000 galaxies existing just 900-2,000 million years
(Myr) after the Big Bang (redshifts 6 > z > 3; ref. 1). The Hubble Ultra Deep
Field (HUDF09) data have yielded the first reliable detections of z ~ 8
galaxies that, together with reports of a gamma-ray burst at z ~ 8.2 (refs 10,
11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. Observations of
z ~ 7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z > 9-10. Here we use
the full two-year HUDF09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z ~ 10
galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500 Myr after the Big
Bang. Not only do we find one possible z ~ 10 galaxy candidate, but we show
that, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is much
smaller (~10%) at this time than it is just ~200 Myr later at z ~ 8. This
demonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z ~ 10, as galaxies increased in
both luminosity density and volume density from z ~ 8 to z ~ 10. The 100-200
Myr before z ~ 10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliest
galaxies.
