We consider the Casimir effect for a sphere in front of a plane at finite
temperature for scalar and electromagnetic fields and calculate the limiting
cases. For small separation we compare the exact results with the corresponding
ones obtained in proximity force approximation. For the scalar field with
Dirichlet boundary conditions, the low temperature correction is of order $T^2$
like for parallel planes. For the electromagnetic field it is of order $T^4$.
For high temperature we observe the usual picture that the leading order is
given by the zeroth Matsubara frequency. The non-zero frequencies are
exponentially suppressed except for the case of close separation.
