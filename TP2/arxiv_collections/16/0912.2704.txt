Results of the latest CLEO contribution to bottomonium spectroscopy is
presented, the confirmation of the eta_b(1S0) ground state of bottomonium in
the radiative decay Upsilon(3S) -> gamma eta_b. The bottomonium hyperfine
splitting is determined to be Delta M_hf(1S) = 68.5+-6.6+-2.0 MeV and the
branching fraction B(Upsilon(3S) -> gamma eta_b=(7.1+-1.8+-1.1)x10^-4. These
results are in good agreement with those reported by BaBar.
