X-ray mirrors are usually built in the Wolter I (paraboloid-hyperboloid)
configuration. This design exhibits no spherical aberration on-axis but suffers
from field curvature, coma and astigmatism, therefore the angular resolution
degrades rapidly with increasing off-axis angles. Different mirror designs
exist in which the primary and secondary mirror profiles are expanded as a
power series in order to increase the angular resolution at large off-axis
positions, at the expanses of the on-axis performances. Here we present the
design and global trade off study of an X-ray mirror systems based on
polynomial optics in view of the Wide Field X-ray Telescope (WFXT) mission.
WFXT aims at performing an extended cosmological survey in the soft X-ray band
with unprecedented flux sensitivity. To achieve these goals the angular
resolution required for the mission is very demanding ~5 arcsec mean resolution
across a 1-deg field of view. In addition an effective area of 5-9000 cm^2 at 1
keV is needed.
