We propose a new noise subtraction method, which we call "eigenspectrum
subtraction", which uses low eigenmode information to suppress statistical
noise at low quark mass. This is useful for lattice calculations involving
disconnected loops or all-to-all propagators. It has significant advantages
over perturbative subtraction methods. We compare unsubtracted, eigenspectrum
and perturbative error bar results for the scalar operator on a small Wilson
QCD matrix.
