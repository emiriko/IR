In this paper we obtain some congruences involving central binomial
coefficients and Lucas sequences. For example, we show that if p>5 is a prime
then $\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}F_k*binom(2k,k)/12^k$ is congruent to 0,1,-1 modulo p
according as p=1,4 (mod 5), p=13,17 (mod 30), and p=7,23 (mod 30) respectively,
where {F_n} is the Fibonacci sequence. We also raise several conjectures.
