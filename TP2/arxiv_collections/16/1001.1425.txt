The generators of rotations, boosts and translations are built up based on
the commutation and anticommutation relations of the fundamental two
dimensional representation of SU(2). Rotations in spacetime derive from the
commutation relations of SU(2). Boosts derive from the anticommutation
relations of SU(2).
