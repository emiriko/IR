In the present work, we assume D_{s0}(2317) meson as the c\bar{s} state and
study its parameters at finite temperature using QCD sum rules. It is
calculated the annihilation and scattering parts of spectral function in the
lowest order of perturbation theory. Taking into account perturbative two-loop
order \alpha_{s} corrections and nonperturbative corrections up to the
dimension six condensates it is investigated the temperature dependences of
mass and leptonic decay constant of D_{s0}(2317) meson.
