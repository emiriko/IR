We present preliminary asteroseismic results from Kepler on three G-type
stars. The observations, made at one-minute cadence during the first 33.5d of
science operations, reveal high signal-to-noise solar-like oscillation spectra
in all three stars: About 20 modes of oscillation may be clearly distinguished
in each star. We discuss the appearance of the oscillation spectra, use the
frequencies and frequency separations to provide first results on the radii,
masses and ages of the stars, and comment in the light of these results on
prospects for inference on other solar-type stars that Kepler will observe.
