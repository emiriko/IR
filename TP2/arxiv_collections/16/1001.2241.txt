We present the theoretical approach to study the unconventional Josephson
junction (uJJ) made by putting the non-superconduncting strip on the top of
superconducting strip. We work in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau,
Bogoliubov de Gennes and Usadel formalisms. We solve the non-linear parital
differential equations numerically for few simple cases. We obtaine the
eigenenergies of the uJJ by means of combined GL and BdGe method. cases. We
predict the occurence of the physical effect, which we call the topological
Meissner effect. Basing on the obtained results and current knowledge on
Josephson junctions we point the future perspectives of the research on uJJs.
