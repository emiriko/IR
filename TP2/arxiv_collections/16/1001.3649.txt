We explore the hypothesis that the set of symmetries enjoyed by the theory
that describes gravity is not the full group of diffeomorphisms Diff(M), as in
General Relativity, but a maximal subgroup of it, TransverseDiff(M), with its
elements having a jacobian equal to unity; at the infinitesimal level, the
parameter describing the coordinate change, xi^mu (x), is transverse, i.e.,
partial_mu(xi^mu)=0. Incidentally, this is the smaller symmetry one needs to
propagate consistently a graviton, which is a great theoretical motivation for
considering these theories. Also, the determinant of the metric, g, behaves as
a "transverse scalar", so that these theories can be seen as a generalization
of the better-known unimodular gravity. We present our results on the
observational constraints on transverse gravity, in close relation with the
claim of equivalence with general scalar-tensor theory. We also comment on the
structure of the divergences of the quantum theory to the one-loop order.
