In this work we study the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in the SU (2) version with
repulsive vector coupling and apply it to quark stellar matter. We discuss the
influence of the vector interaction on the equation of state (EoS) and study
quark stars that are composed of pure quark matter with two flavors. We show
that, increasing the vector coupling, we obtain more massive stars with larger
radii for the same central energy density.
