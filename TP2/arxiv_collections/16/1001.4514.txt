This paper focuses on a comparison of the space densities of FRI and FRII
sources at different epochs, with a particular focus on FRI sources. First, we
present the concluding steps in constructing the Combined NVSS-FIRST Galaxy
catalogue (CoNFIG), including new VLA observations, optical identifications and
redshift estimates. The final catalogue consists of 859 sources over 4 samples
(CoNFIG-1, 2, 3 and 4 with flux density limits of S_1.4GHz = 1.3, 0.8, 0.2 and
0.05 Jy respectively). It is 95.7% complete in radio morphology classification
and 74.3% of the sources have redshift data. Combining CoNFIG with
complementary samples, the distribution and evolution of FRI and FRII sources
are investigated. We find that FRI sources undergo mild evolution and that, at
the same radio luminosity, FRI and FRII sources show similar space density
enhancements in various redshift ranges, possibly implying a common evolution.
