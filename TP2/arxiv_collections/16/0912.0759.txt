This volume contains the proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Interaction and
Concurrency Experience (ICE'09). The workshop was held in Bologna, Italy on
31th of August 2009, as a satellite workshop of CONCUR'09. The previous edition
of ICE has been organized in Reykjavik (2008).
  The ICE workshop is intended as a series of international scientific meetings
oriented to researchers in various fields of theoretical computer science and,
each year, the workshop focuses on a specific topic: ICE 2009 focused on
structured interactions meant as the class of synchronisations that go beyond
the "simple" point-to-point synchronisations (e.g., multicast or broadcast
synchronisations, even-notification based interactions, time dependent
interactions, distributed transactions,...).
