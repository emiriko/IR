We consider the absorption spectrum of a Fermi gas mixed with a minority
species when majority fermions are transferred to another internal state by an
external probe. In the limit when the minority species is much more massive
than the majority one, we show that the minority species may be treated as
static impurities and the problem can be solved in closed form. The analytical
results bring out the importance of vertex corrections, which change
qualitatively the nature of the absorption spectrum. It is demonstrated that
large line shifts are not associated with resonant interactions in general. We
also show that the commonly used ladder approximation fails when the majority
component is degenerate for large mass ratios between the minority and majority
species and that bubble diagrams, which correspond to the creation of many
particle--hole pairs, must be taken into account. We carry out detailed
numerical calculations, which confirm the analytical insights and we point out
the connection to shadowing phenomena in nuclear physics.
