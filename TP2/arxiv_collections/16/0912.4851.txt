In this paper, we investigate the geometric phase of the field interacting
with $\Xi $-type moving three-level atom. The results show that the atomic
motion and the field-mode structure play important roles in the evolution of
the system dynamics and geometric phase. We test this observation with
experimentally accessible parameters and some new aspects are obtained.
