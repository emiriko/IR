We have measured the correlation of rates in IceCube with long and short term
variations in the South Pole atmosphere. The yearly temperature variation in
the middle stratosphere (30-60 hPa) is highly correlated with the high energy
muon rate observed deep in the ice, and causes a +/-10% seasonal modulation in
the event rate. The counting rates of the surface detectors, which are due to
secondary particles of relatively low energy (muons, electrons and photons),
have a negative correlation with temperatures in the lower layers of the
stratosphere (40-80 hPa), and are modulated at a level of +/-5%. The region of
the atmosphere between pressure levels 20-120 hPa, where the first cosmic ray
interactions occur and the produced pions/kaons interact or decay to muons, is
the Antarctic ozone layer. The anticorrelation between surface and deep ice
trigger rates reflects the properties of pion/kaon decay and interaction as the
density of the stratospheric ozone layer changes. Therefore, IceCube closely
probes the ozone hole dynamics, and the temporal behavior of the stratospheric
temperatures.
