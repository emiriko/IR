We present a phenomenological analysis of the $\cos 2 \phi$ asymmetry
recently measured by the COMPASS and HERMES collaborations in unpolarized
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. In the kinematical regimes explored
by these experiments the asymmetry arises from transverse-spin and intrinsic
transverse-momentum effects. We consider the leading-twist contribution,
related to the so-called Boer-Mulders transverse-polarization distribution
$h_1^{\perp}(x, k_T^2)$, and the twist-4 Cahn contribution, involving
unpolarized transverse-momentum distribution functions. We show that a
reasonably good fit of the data is achieved with a Boer-Mulders function
consistent with the main theoretical expectations. Our conclusion is that the
COMPASS and HERMES measurements represent the first experimental evidence of
the Boer-Mulders effect in SIDIS.
