Exotic phenomena about the behavior of electrons inside the solid were a long
time ago predicted by the quantum mechanic physics and are only recently
experimentally observed, in particular for systems of extremely reduced
dimensions. Here, I report on recent experimental observation of fundamental
effect concerning the dispersion properties of the surface state influenced by
the presence of surface reconstruction.
