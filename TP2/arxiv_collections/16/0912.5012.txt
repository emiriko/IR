We aim here to show that reductionism and emergence play a complementary role
in understanding natural processes and in the dynamics of science explanation.
In particular, we will show that the renormalization group - one of the most
refined tool of theoretical physics - allows understanding the importance of
emergent processes' role in Nature identifying them universal organization
processes, which is to say they are scale independent. We can use the syntaxes
of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking as a
trans-disciplinary theoretical scenario for many other forms of complexity,
especially the biological and cognitive ones.
