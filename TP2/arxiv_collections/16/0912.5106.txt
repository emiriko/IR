The equations of motion that must be satisfied by fields that constitute
realizations of the Poincare group algebra, for integral spin, and mass m, are
obtained. For the case of massive spin 2 these equations are satisfied by the
selfdual, intermediate and the linear topologically massive models, whose
actions are connected by duality transformations. These duality transformations
incorporate the gauge invariances that distinguish one action from the other.
The relation between their partition functions is briefly discussed.
