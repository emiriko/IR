Boost-rotation symmetric spacetimes are exceptional as they are the only
exact asymptotically flat solutions to the Einstein equations describing
spatially bounded sources ("point-like" particles, black holes) undergoing
non-trivial motion ("uniform acceleration") with radiation. We construct the
Newtonian limit of these spacetimes: it yields fields of uniformly accelerated
sources in classical mechanics. We also study the special-relativistic limit of
the charged rotating C-metric and so find accelerating electromagnetic magic
field.
