We study a deterministic method for particle transport in tissue in selected
medical applications. Generalized Fokker-Planck (GFP) theory has been developed
to improve the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation in cases where scattering is
forward-peaked and where there is a sufficient amount of large-angle
scattering. We compare grid-based numerical solutions to Fokker-Planck and
Generalized Fokker-Planck (GFP) in realistic applications. Electron dose
calculations in heterogeneous parts of the human body are performed. Accurate
electron scattering cross sections are therefore included and their
incorporation in our model is extensively described. Moreover, we solve GFP
approximations of the radiative transport equation to investigate reflectance
and transmittance of light in tissue. All results are compared with either
Monte Carlo or discrete-ordinates transport solutions.
