It has been suggested previously that the observed cosmological constant
Lambda corresponds to the remnant vacuum energy density of dynamical processes
taking place at a cosmic age set by the mass scale M \sim E_{ew} of
ultramassive particles with electroweak interactions. Here, a simple
modification of the nondissipative dynamic equations of q-theory is presented,
which produces a remnant vacuum energy density (effective cosmological
constant) of the correct order of magnitude. Combined with the observed value
of Lambda, a first estimate of the required value of the energy scale E_{ew}
ranges from 3 to 9 TeV, depending on the number of species of ultramassive
particles and assuming a dissipative coupling constant of order unity. If
correct, this estimate implies the existence of new TeV-scale physics beyond
the standard model.
