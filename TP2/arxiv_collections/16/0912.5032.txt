We present observations of the nearby tidal dwarf galaxy Holmberg IX in M81
galaxy group in narrow band [SII] and H$\alpha$ filters, carried out in March
and November 2008 with the 2m RCC telescope at NAO Rozhen, Bulgaria. Our search
for resident supernova remnants (identified as sources with enhanced [SII]
emission relative to their H$\alpha$ emission) in this galaxy yielded no
sources of this kind, besides M&H 10-11 or HoIX X-1. Nevertheless, we found a
number of objects with significant H$\alpha$ emission that probably represent
uncatalogued HII regions.
