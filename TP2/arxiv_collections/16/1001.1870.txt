We discuss a possible interpretation of the open charm mesons
$D_{s0}^*(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$ and the hidden charm mesons X(3872), Y(3940)
and Y(4140) as hadron molecules. Using a phenomenological Lagrangian approach
we review the strong and radiative decays of the $D_{s0}^* (2317)$ and
$D_{s1}(2460)$ states. The X(3872) is assumed to consist dominantly of
molecular hadronic components with an additional small admixture of a
charmonium configuration. Determing the radiative ($\gamma J/\psi$ and $\gamma
\psi(2s)$) and strong ($J/\psi 2\pi $ and $ J/\psi 3\pi$) decay modes we show
that present experimental observation is consistent with the molecular
structure assumption of the X(3872). Finally we give evidence for molecular
interpretations of the Y(3940) and Y(4140) related to the observed strong decay
modes $J/\psi + \omega$ or $J/\psi + \phi$, respectively.
