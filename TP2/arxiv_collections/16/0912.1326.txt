We summarize new X-ray detections of four nitrogen-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars
obtained in a limited survey aimed at establishing the X-ray properties of WN
stars across their full range of spectral subtypes. None of the detected stars
is so far known to be a close binary. We report Chandra detections of WR 2
(WN2), WR 18 (WN4), and WR 134 (WN6), and an XMM-Newton detection of WR79a
(WN9ha). These observations clearly demonstrate that both WNE and WNL stars are
X-ray sources. We also discuss Chandra archive detections of the WN6h stars WR
20b, WR 24, and WR 136 and ROSAT non-detections of WR 16 (WN8h) and WR 78
(WN7h). The X-ray spectra of all WN detections show prominent emission lines
and an admixture of cool (kT < 1 keV) and hot (kT > 2 keV) plasma. The hotter
plasma is not predicted by radiative wind shock models and other as yet
unidentified mechanisms are at work. Most stars show X-ray absorption in excess
of that expected from visual extinction (Av), likely due to their strong winds
or cold circumstellar gas. Existing data suggest a falloff in X-ray luminosity
toward later WN7-9 subtypes, which have higher Lbol but slower, denser winds
than WN2-6 stars. This provides a clue that wind properties may be a more
crucial factor in determining emergent X-ray emission levels than bolometric
luminosity.
