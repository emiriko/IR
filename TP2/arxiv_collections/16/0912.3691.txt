We discuss the boundary of the spacetime region through each point of which a
trapped surface passes, first in some simple soluble examples, and then in the
self-similar Vaidya solution. For the latter the boundary must lie strictly
inside the event horizon. We present a class of closed trapped surfaces
extending strictly outside the apparent horizon.
