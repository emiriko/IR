Despite the conventional wisdom that proactive security is superior to
reactive security, we show that reactive security can be competitive with
proactive security as long as the reactive defender learns from past attacks
instead of myopically overreacting to the last attack. Our game-theoretic model
follows common practice in the security literature by making worst-case
assumptions about the attacker: we grant the attacker complete knowledge of the
defender's strategy and do not require the attacker to act rationally. In this
model, we bound the competitive ratio between a reactive defense algorithm
(which is inspired by online learning theory) and the best fixed proactive
defense. Additionally, we show that, unlike proactive defenses, this reactive
strategy is robust to a lack of information about the attacker's incentives and
knowledge.
