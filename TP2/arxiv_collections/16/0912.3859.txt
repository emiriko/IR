A perturbation spin-wave theory for the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets
on a square lattice is proposed to calculate the uniform static magnetic
susceptibility at finite temperatures, where a divergence in the previous
theories due to an artificial phase transition has been removed. To the zeroth
order, the main features of the uniform static susceptibility are produced: a
linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and a smooth crossover in the
intermediate range and the Curie law at high temperatures. When the leading
corrections from the spin-wave interactions are included, the resulting spin
susceptibility in the full temperature range is in agreement with the numerical
quantum Monte Carlo simulations and high-temperature series expansions.
