The results of a comprehensive study on the YBa_2Cu_3O_{6.53} oxide subjected
to "mild" hydration (exposure at small values of pH2O) by a special technique
have been reported. The material modified in this way acquires an interesting
property; namely, in natural conditions it intensively absorbs large quantities
of components (H2O and CO2) comprising the gas atmosphere. Arguments have been
adduced that at least the water enters the crystal lattice of the
yttrium-barium cuprate. This lattice is in the two-phase (tetragonal and
orthorhombic) state: testing of the magnetic properties of the oxide has
revealed the presence of antiferromagnetic and diamagnetic regions in this
material.
