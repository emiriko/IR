We have observed the fast nova V5583 Sagittarii with five B, V, y, R_C, and
I_C bands, and found that these multi-band light curves are almost identical
with those of V382 Vel 1999 until at least 100 days after outburst. A supersoft
X-ray phase of V382 Vel was detected with BeppoSAX about six months after
outburst. V5583 Sgr outbursted a few days ago the discovery on 2009 August 6.5
UT near its optical peak. From a complete resemblance between these two nova
light curves, we expect a supersoft X-ray phase of V5583 Sgr six months after
outburst. Detection of supersoft X-ray turn-on/turnoff dates strongly constrain
the evolution of a nova and, as a result, mass range of the WD. For a timely
observation of a supersoft X-ray phase of V5583 Sgr, we have calculated nova
outburst evolution based on the optically thick wind theory, which predicts the
supersoft X-ray phase: it will most probably start between days 100 and 140 and
continue until days 200-240 after outburst. We strongly recommend multiple
observations during 2009 December, and 2010 January, February, and March to
detect the turn-on and turnoff times of the supersoft X-ray phase of V5583 Sgr.
