Based on a Riemann theta function and Hirota's bilinear form, a lucid and
straightforward way is presented to explicitly construct double periodic wave
solutions for both nonlinear differential and difference equations. Once such a
equation is written in a bilinear form, its periodic wave solutions can be
directly obtained by using an unified theta function formula. The relations
between the periodic wave solutions and soliton solutions are rigorously
established. The efficiency of our proposed method can be demonstrated on a
class variety of nonlinear equations such as those considered in this paper,
shall water wave equation, (2+1)-dimensional Bogoyavlenskii-Schiff equation and
differential-difference KdV equation.
