We present a preliminary analysis of the HI properties of early-type galaxies
in the ATLAS3D sample. Using WSRT data for ~100 galaxies outside the Virgo
cluster and data from the Alfalfa project for galaxies inside Virgo, we discuss
the dependence of HI properties on environment. We detect HI in about half of
the galaxies outside Virgo. For these systems, the HI morphology and kinematics
change as a function of environment, going from regular, rotating systems
around isolated galaxies to progressively more disturbed structures for
galaxies with neighbours or in groups. In denser environment, inside Virgo,
nearly none of the galaxies contains HI.
  We discuss future work in this field which will be enabled by
next-generation, pre-SKA radio instruments. We present a simulated Apertif HI
observation of an ATLAS3D early-type galaxy, showing how its appearance and
detection level vary as a function of redshift.
