We proposed an altered configuration for dual-frequency (DF) capacitively
coupled plasmas (CCP). In this configuration, two pairs of electrodes are
arranged oppositely, and the discharging is perpendicularly driven by two rf
sources. With Particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo method, we have demonstrated this
configuration can remove the harmful electromagnetic and DF coupling effects in
conventional DF-CCP.
