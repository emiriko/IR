In this work we re-formulate and solve the self-consistent theory for
localization to a Bose-Einstein condensate expanding in a 3D optical speckle.
The long-range nature of the fluctuations in the potential energy, treated in
the self-consistent Born approximation, make the scattering strongly velocity
dependent, and its consequences for mobility edge and fraction of localized
atoms have been investigated numerically.
