We present leading-order (LO) cross sections for the production of three top
quarks ($tt\tb$,$t\tb\tb$) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We find a total
LO cross section for triple-top production in the Standard Model of $\sigma
\approx 2 $ fb at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV and we give examples of two new physics
models which have a significant enhancement to this channel. In the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), there are regions of parameter space
where the decays of gluino pairs into final states including three tops has a
cross section $\sigma \approx 41$ fb. In a leptophobic $Z'$ model featuring
right-handed couplings of the $u$-quark to the top, we find $\sigma \approx 28$
fb. With efficient identification and reconstruction of the top quarks, the
triple-top signal could potentially provide evidence for new physics at the
LHC.
