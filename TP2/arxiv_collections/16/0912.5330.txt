A catalog of the extended extragalactic radio sources consisting of 10461
objects is compiled based on the list of radio sources of the FIRST survey. A
total of 1801 objects are identified with galaxies and quasars of the SDSS
survey and the Veron-Veron catalog. The distribution of the position angles of
the axes of radio sources from the catalog is determined, and the probability
that this distribution is equiprobable is shown to be less then 10^(-7). This
result implies that at Z equal to or smaller then 0.5, spatial orientation of
the axes of radio sources is anisotropic at a statistically significant level.
