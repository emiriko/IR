The power spectra of 457 short BATSE bursts were analyzed, focusing on the 64
ms lightcurves' tails in the low energy bands. Using MC simulations, 22 GRBs
were identified with unusually high harmonic power above 0.03 Hz. The sky
distribution of these bursts shows an extraordinarily strong dipole moment with
a 99.994% significance.
