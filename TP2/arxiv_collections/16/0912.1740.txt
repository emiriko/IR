We present evidence that the spectroscopically identified bipolar jets of the
pre-main sequence binary KH 15D are a common product of the whole binary
system, rather than being launched from either star individually. They may be
launched from the innermost part of the circumbinary disk (CBD) or may result
from the merging of two outflows driven by the individual stars. This evidence
is based on high-resolution H-alpha and [OI] 6300A line profiles obtained
during eclipse phases of this nearly edge-on system. The occultation of star A
(the only currently visible star) by the disk strongly suppresses the stellar
H-alpha and continuum emission and allows one to study the faint redshifted and
blueshifted emission components of the bipolar jets. The strongest evidence for
jet production by the whole binary system comes from the observed radial
velocity symmetry of the two jet components relative to the systemic velocity
of the binary, in combination with current accretion models from the CBD onto a
binary system.
