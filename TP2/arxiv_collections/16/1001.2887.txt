We evaluate, exactly in d, the master integrals contributing to massless
three-loop QCD form factors. The calculation is based on a combination of a
method recently suggested by one of the authors (R.L.) with other techniques:
sector decomposition implemented in FIESTA, the method of Mellin--Barnes
representation, and the PSLQ algorithm. Using our results for the master
integrals we obtain analytical expressions for two missing constants in the
ep-expansion of the two most complicated master integrals and present the form
factors in a completely analytic form.
