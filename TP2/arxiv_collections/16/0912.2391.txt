The Stieltjes constants $\gamma_k(a)$ appear in the coefficients in the
regular part of the Laurent expansion of the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,a)$
about its only pole at $s=1$. We generalize a technique of Addison for the
Euler constant $\gamma=\gamma_0(1)$ to show its application to finding series
representations for these constants. Other generalizations of representations
of $\gamma$ are given.
