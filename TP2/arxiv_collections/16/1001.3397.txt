Monte Carlo studies of the 3D random field $XY$ model on simple cubic
lattices of size $64^3$, using two different isotropic random-field probability
distributions of moderate strength, show a glassy freezing behavior above
$T_c$, and long-range order below $T_c$, consistent with our earlier results
for weaker and stronger random fields. This model should describe random
pinning in vortex lattices in type-II superconducting alloys, charge-density
wave materials, and decagonal quasicrystals.
