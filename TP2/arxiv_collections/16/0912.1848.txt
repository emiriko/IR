The two dimensional structure of hot gas in galaxy clusters contains
information about the hydrodynamical state of the cluster, which can be used to
understand the origin of scatter in the thermodynamical properties of the gas,
and to improve the use of clusters to probe cosmology. Using a set of
hydrodynamical simulations, we provide a comparison between various maps
currently employed in the X-ray analysis of merging clusters and those cluster
maps anticipated from forthcoming observations of the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We show the following: 1) an X-ray pseudo-pressure,
defined as square root of the soft band X-ray image times the temperature map
is a good proxy for the SZ map; 2) we find that clumpiness is the main reason
for deviation between X-ray pseudo-pressure and SZ maps; 3) the level of
clumpiness can be well characterized by X-ray pseudo-entropy maps. 4) We
describe the frequency of deviation in various maps of clusters as a function
of the amplitude of the deviation. This enables both a comparison to
observations and a comparison to effects of introduction of complex physical
processes into simulation.
