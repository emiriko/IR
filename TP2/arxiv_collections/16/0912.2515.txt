Correlations between X-ray and water maser emission in AGN have been recently
reported. However, the lack of systematic studies affects the confidence level
of these results. In the following, we introduce a project aimed at studying
all the water maser sources believed to be associated with AGN activity through
X-ray data obtained with the XRT and BAT instruments on-board the Swift
satellite. Preliminary results of this work indicate a promising rate of XRT
detections allowing us to refine follow-up observing strategies focused on
investigating the nuclei of individual galaxies and deriving, on statistical
basis, the main characteristics of water maser hosts. In addition, a
cross-correlation between our sample and the BAT 22-months all-sky survey
provides an exceptionally high detection rate at hard X-ray energies when
compared to other AGN-related catalogs.
