In this paper we present Darboux transformation for the generalized
Heisenberg magnet (GHM) model based on general linear Lie group GL(n) and
construct multi-soliton solutions in terms of quasideterminants. Further we
relate the quasideterminant multi-soliton solutions obtained by the means of
Darboux transformation with those of obtained by dressing method. We also
discuss the model based on the Lie group SU(n) and obtain explicit soliton
solutions of the model based on SU(2).
