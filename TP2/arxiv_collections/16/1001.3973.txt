Calcium stannate perovskite (CaSnO3) has been studied by Raman spectroscopy
at two excitation wavelengths (514.5 nm and 632.8 nm). A new first-order
order-disorder phase transition induces Raman frequency shifts and line width
doubling at 121C on heating (94C on cooling), seen in experiments using the
514.5 nm line of an Ar+-ion laser. The transition is also seen when using a
623.8 nm He-Ne laser and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), but
without strong order-disorder character, indicating that the phase transition
is dependent on photo-excitation. High-temperature powder X-ray diffraction
measurements provide thermal expansion coefficients of ax = 13.9 x 10-6 K-1, ay
= 2.7 x 10-6 K-1, az = 14.3 x 10-6 K-1. The phase transition is postulated to
be associated with photo-excited charged and conductive nanoscale ferroelectric
order-disorder. As such, CaSnO3 could represent the first in a new class of
optoelectronic materials with additional potential photocatalytic properties.
