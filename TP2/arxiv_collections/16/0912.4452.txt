We consider a mixture of two bosonic species with tunable interspecies
interaction in a periodic potential and discuss the advantages of low filling
factors on the detection of the pair-superfluid phase. We show how the
emergence of such a phase can be put dramatically into evidence by looking at
the interference pictures and density correlations after expansion and by
changing the interspecies interaction from attractive to repulsive.
