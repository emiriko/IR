We show on- and off-diagonal upper estimates for the transition densities of
symmetric Levy and Levy-type processes. To get the an-diagonal estimates we
prove a Nash type inequality for the related Dirichlet form. For the
off-diagonal estimates we assume that the characteristic function of a Levy
(type) process is analytic, which allows to apply the complex analysis
technique.
