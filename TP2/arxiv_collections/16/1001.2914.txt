The Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach consistently
simulates the full evolution of a relativistic heavy-ion collision from the
initial hard scatterings string formation through the dynamical deconfinement
phase transition to the quark gluon plasma (QGP), to the hadronization and to
subsequent interactions in the hadronic phase. The transport theoretical
description of quarks and gluons is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model
for partons matched to reproduce recent lattice QCD results in thermodynamic
equilibrium. The transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is
described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark-antiquark pairs
or three quarks (antiquarks). Studying Pb+Pb reactions from 40 to 158 A GeV, we
find that at most 40% of the collision energy is stored in the dynamics of the
partons. This implies that a large fraction of non-partonic, i.e. hadronic or
string-like matter, which can be viewed as a hadronic corona, is present in
these reactions, thus neither hadronic nor purely partonic models can be
employed to extract physical conclusions in comparing model results with data.
On the other hand, comparing the PHSD results to those of the Hadron-String
Dynamics (HSD) approach without the phase transition to QGP, we observe that
the existence of the partonic phase has a sizeable influence on the transverse
mass distribution of final kaons due to the repulsive partonic mean fields and
initial partonic scattering. Furthermore, we find a significant effect of the
QGP on the production of multi-strange antibaryons due to a slightly enhanced
s+sbar pair production in the partonic phase from massive time-like gluon decay
and to a more abundant formation of strange antibaryons in the hadronization
process.
