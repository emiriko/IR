We present a novel method for checking the Hurwitz stability of a polytope of
matrices. First we prove that the polytope matrix is stable if and only if two
homogenous polynomials are positive on a simplex, then through a newly proposed
method, i.e., the weighted difference substitution method, the latter can be
checked in finite steps. Examples show the efficiency of our method.
