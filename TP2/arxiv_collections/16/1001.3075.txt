Recent BaBaR data on the pion transition form factor, whose Q^2 dependence is
much steeper then predicted by asymptotic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), have
caused a renewed interest in its theoretical description. We present here a
formalism based on a model independent low energy description and a high energy
description based on QCD, which match at a scale Q_0. The high energy
description incorporates a flat pion distribution amplitude, phi(x)=1, at the
matching scale Q_0 and QCD evolution from Q_0 to Q>Q_0. The flat pion
distribution is connected, through soft pion theorems and chiral symmetry, to
the pion valance parton distribution at the same low scale Q_0. The procedure
leads to a good description of the data, and incorporating additional twist
three effects, to an excellent description of the data.
