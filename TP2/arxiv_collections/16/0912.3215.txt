The prospects for using asteroseismology of rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp)
stars are hampered by the large uncertainty in fundamental stellar parameters.
Results in the literature for the effective temperature (Teff) often span a
range of 1000 K. Our goal is to reduce systematic errors and improve the Teff
calibration of Ap stars based on new interferometric measurements. We obtained
long-baseline interferometric observations of beta CrB using the CHARA/FLUOR
instrument. To disentangle the flux contributions of the two components of this
binary star, we obtained VLT/NACO adaptive optics images. We determined limb
darkened angular diameters of 0.699+-0.017 mas for beta CrB A (from
interferometry) and 0.415+-0.017 mas for beta CrB B (from surface brightness-
color relations), corresponding to radii of 2.63+-0.09 Rsun (3.4 percent
uncertainty) and 1.56+-0.07 Rsun (4.5 percent). The combined bolometric flux of
the A and B components was determined from satellite UV data, spectrophotometry
in the visible and broadband data in the infrared. The flux from the B
component constitutes 16+-4 percent of the total flux and was determined by
fitting an ATLAS9 model atmosphere to the broad-band NACO J and K magnitudes.
Combining the flux of the A component with its measured angular diameter, we
determine the effective temperature Teff(A) = 7980+-180 K (2.3 percent). Our
new interferometric and imaging data enable a nearly model-independent
determination of the effective temperature of beta CrB A. Including our recent
study of alpha Cir, we now have direct Teff measurements of two of the
brightest roAp stars, providing a strong benchmark for an improved calibration
of the Teff scale for Ap stars. This will support the use of potentially strong
constraints imposed by asteroseismic studies of roAp stars.
