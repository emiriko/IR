Recent X-ray observations by Fermi/GBM discovered a new torque reversal of 4U
1626-67 after 18 years of steady spinning down. Using Swift/BAT observations we
were able to center this new torque reversal on Feb 4 2008, lasting
approximately 150 days. From 2004 up to the end of 2007, the spin-down rate
averaged at a mean rate of ~dnu/dt=-4.8e-13 Hz s-1 until the torque reversal
reported here. Since then it has been following a steady spin-up at a mean rate
of ~dnu/dt= 4e-13 Hz s-1. The properties of this torque reversal, as well as
the lack of correlation between the X-ray flux and the torque applied to the
neutron star before this transition, challenges our understanding of the
physical mechanisms operating in this system.
