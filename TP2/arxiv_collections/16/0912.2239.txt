We have used oxygen ions irradiation to generate controlled structural
disorder in thin manganite films. Conductive atomic force microscopy CAFM),
transport and magnetic measurements were performed to analyze the influence of
the implantation process in the physical properties of the films. CAFM images
show regions with different conductivity values, probably due to the random
distribution of point defect or inhomogeneous changes of the local Mn3+/4+
ratio to reduce lattice strains of the irradiated areas. The transport and
magnetic properties of these systems are interpreted in this context.
Metal-insulator transition can be described in the frame of a percolative
model. Disorder increases the distance between conducting regions, lowering the
observed TMI. Point defect disorder increases localization of the carriers due
to increased disorder and locally enhanced strain field. Remarkably, even with
the inhomogeneous nature of the samples, no sign of low field magnetoresistance
was found. Point defect disorder decreases the system magnetization but doesn t
seem to change the magnetic transition temperature. As a consequence, an
important decoupling between the magnetic and the metal-insulator transition is
found for ion irradiated films as opposed to the classical double exchange
model scenario.
