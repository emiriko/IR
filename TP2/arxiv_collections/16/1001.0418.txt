The advent of Web 3.0, claiming for personalization in interactive systems
(Lassila & Hendler, 2007), and the need for systems capable of interacting in a
more natural way in the future society flooded with computer systems and
devices (Harper et al., 2008) show that great advances in HCI should be done.
This chapter presents some contributions of LIA for the future of HCI,
defending that using common sense knowledge is a possibility for improving HCI,
especially because people assign meaning to their messages based on their
common sense and, therefore, the use of this knowledge in developing user
interfaces can make them more intuitive to the end-user. Moreover, as common
sense knowledge varies from group to group of people, it can be used for
developing applications capable of giving different feedback for different
target groups, as the applications presented along this chapter illustrate,
allowing, in this way, interface personalization taking into account cultural
issues. For the purpose of using common sense knowledge in the development and
design of computer systems, it is necessary to provide an architecture that
allows it. This chapter presents LIAs approaches for common sense knowledge
acquisition, representation and use, as well as for natural language
processing, contributing with those ones who intent to get into this
challenging world to get started.
