The long standing problem of inexplicably short spin relaxation in carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) is examined. The curvature-mediated spin-orbital interaction
is shown to induce fluctuating electron spin precession causing efficient
relaxation in a manner analogous to the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism. Our
calculation estimates longitudinal (spin-flip) and transversal (decoherence)
relaxation times as short as 150 ps and 110 ps at room temperature,
respectively, along with a pronounced anisotropic dependence. Interference of
electrons originating from different valleys can lead to even faster dephasing.
The results can help clarify the measured data, resolving discrepancies in the
literature.
