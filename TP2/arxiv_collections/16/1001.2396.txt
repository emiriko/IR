We discuss the extension of the antenna subtraction method to include two
hadrons in the initial state (initial-initial antennae) at
next-to-next-to-leading order. We sketch the construction of the subtraction
terms and the required phase space transformations. We discuss the integration
of the subtraction terms in detail.
