Recently, an image scrambling encryption algorithm of pixel bit based on
chaos map was proposed. Considering the algorithm as a typical binary image
scrambling/permutation algorithm exerting on plaintext of size $M\times (8N)$,
this paper proposes a novel optimal method to break it with some
known/chosen-plaintexts. The spatial complexity and computational complexity of
the attack are only $O(32\cdot MN)$ and $O(16\cdot n_0\cdot MN)$ respectively,
where $n_0$ is the number of known/chosen-plaintexts used. The method can be
easily extended to break any permutation-only encryption scheme exerting on
plaintext of size $M\times N$ and with $L$ different levels of values. The
corresponding spatial complexity and computational complexity are only $O(MN)$
and $O(\lceil\log_L(MN)\rceil \cdot MN)$ respectively. In addition, some
specific remarks on the performance of the image scrambling encryption
algorithm are presented.
