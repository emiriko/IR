A dark matter model which is called w-matter or mirror dark matter is
concretely constructed based on (f-SU(5))X(w-SU(5)) symmetry. There is no Higgs
field and all masses originate from interactions in the present model. W-matter
is dark matter relatively to f-matter and vice versa. In high-energy processes
or when temperature is very high, visible matter and dark matter can transform
from one into another. In such process energy seems to be non-conservational,
because dark matter cannot be detected. In low-energy processes or when
temperature is low, there is only gravitation interaction of dark matter for
visible matter.
