A field-theoretic parametrization is proposed for nucleon electromagnetic
form factors at momentum transfer less than 600 MeV. The parametrization is
part of a larger effective field theory lagrangian that is Lorentz covariant
and chirally symmetric, and that has been used to successfully describe bulk
and single-particle properties of medium to heavy mass nuclei. The
parametrization is based on vector meson dominance and a derivative expansion
of nucleon couplings to the electromagnetic fields. At lowest order in the
expansion, it is possible to fit all four parameters to modern data on the rms
radii of the nucleon form factors. At next-to-leading order it is possible to
fit the form factors to within a few percent up to momentum transfers of 600
MeV. The vector meson dominance contributions are crucial in this fit, since a
simple expansion in powers of momentum transfer would require many, many terms
to achieve comparable accuracy. The ability to fit single-nucleon form factors
up to 600 MeV momentum transfer makes possible the study of two-body
electromagnetic exchange currents within this effective field theory framework.
