A two-component Bose-Einstein condensate that is confined in a
one-dimensional ring potential supports solitary-wave solutions, which we
evaluate analytically. The derived solutions are shown to be unique. The
corresponding dispersion relation that generalizes the case of a
single-component system shows interesting features.
