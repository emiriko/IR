We show that the motion of a laser-driven Bose-Einstein condensate in a
high-finesse optical cavity realizes the spin-boson Dicke-model. The quantum
phase transition of the Dicke-model from the normal to the superradiant phase
corresponds to the self-organization of atoms from the homogeneous into a
periodically patterned distribution above a critical driving strength. The
fragility of the ground state due to photon measurement induced back action is
calculated.
