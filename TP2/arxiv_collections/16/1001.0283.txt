In [arXiv:0911.4808] K. Karami commented on my publication
[arXiv:hep-th/0701242] and claimed that my result would be invalid. In fact he
found an error in calculation of the entropy of cold dark matter in section 3
of my article, which is, however, a rather trivial one. It is shown that my
discussion in section 3 of my paper works correctly if we take the value of
free parameter $b^2>0.264$.
