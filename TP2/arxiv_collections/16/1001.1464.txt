Active region 11029 was a small, highly flare-productive solar active region
observed at a time of extremely low solar activity. The region produced only
small flares: the largest of the $>70$ Geostationary Observational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) events for the region has a peak 1--$8{\AA}$
flux of $2.2\times 10^{-6} {\rm W} {\rm m}^{-2}$ (GOES C2.2). The
background-subtracted GOES peak-flux distribution suggests departure from
power-law behavior above $10^{-6} {\rm W} {\rm m}^{-2}$, and a Bayesian model
comparison strongly favors a power-law plus rollover model for the distribution
over a simple power-law model. The departure from the power law is attributed
to this small active region having a finite amount of energy. The rate of
flaring in the region varies with time, becoming very high for two days
coinciding with the onset of an increase in complexity of the photospheric
magnetic field. The observed waiting-time distribution for events is consistent
with a piecewise-constant Poisson model. These results present challenges for
models of flare statistics and of energy balance in solar active regions.
