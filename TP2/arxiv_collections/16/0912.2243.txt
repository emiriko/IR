We present a scheme for obtaining stable Casimir suspension of dielectric
nontouching objects immersed in a fluid, validated here in various geometries
consisting of ethanol-separated dielectric spheres and semi-infinite slabs.
Stability is induced by the dispersion properties of real dielectric
(monolithic) materials. A consequence of this effect is the possibility of
stable configurations (clusters) of compact objects, which we illustrate via a
"molecular" two-sphere dicluster geometry consiting of two bound spheres
levitated above a gold slab. Our calculations also reveal a strong interplay
between material and geometric dispersion, and this is exemplified by the
qualitatively different stability behavior observed in planar versus spherical
geometries.
