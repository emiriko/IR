We study limiting cases of the two known integrable chiral-type models with
tree-dimensional configuration space. One of the initial models is the
non-Abelian Toda $A_2^{(1)}$ model and the other was found by means of the
symmetry approach by A.G. Meshkov and one of the authors. The C-integrability
of the reduced models is established by constructing their complete sets of
integrals and general solutions. A description of the generalized symmetry
algebras of these models is given in terms of operators mapping integrals into
symmetries. The integrals of the Liouville-type systems are known to define
Miura-type transformations for their generalized symmetries. This fact allowed
us to find a few new systems of the Yajima-Oikawa type. We present a recursion
operator for one them.
