We study the evolution of nearest-neighbor entanglement in the one
dimensional Ising model with an external transverse field. The system is
initialized as the so called "thermal ground state" of the pure Ising model. We
analyze properties of generation of entanglement for different regions of
external transverse fields. We find that the derivation of the time at which
the entanglement reaches its first maximum with respect to the reciprocal
transverse field has a minimum at the critical point. This is a new indicator
of quantum phase transition.
