We present a new determination of the solar nitrogen abundance making use of
3D hydrodynamical modelling of the solar photosphere, which is more physically
motivated than traditional static 1D models. We selected suitable atomic
spectral lines, relying on equivalent width measurements already existing in
the literature. For atmospheric modelling we used the co 5 bold 3D radiation
hydrodynamics code. We investigated the influence of both deviations from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE effects) and photospheric inhomogeneities
(granulation effects) on the resulting abundance. We also compared several
atlases of solar flux and centre-disc intensity presently available. As a
result of our analysis, the photospheric solar nitrogen abundance is A(N) =
7.86 +/- 0.12.
