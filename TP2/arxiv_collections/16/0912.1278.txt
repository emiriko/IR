The theorem by Lewandowski et al. stating uniqueness of a diffeomorphism
invariant state on an algebra of quantum observables for background independent
theories of connections is based on some technical assumptions imposed on the
algebra and the diffeomorphisms. In this paper we present a class of
diffeomorphism invariant states on an algebra of this sort, which exist when
the algebra and the diffeomorphisms satisfy alternative assumptions.
