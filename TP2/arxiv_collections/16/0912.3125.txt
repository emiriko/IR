Moving puncture simulations of black hole binaries rely on a specific gauge
choice that leads to approximately stationary coordinates near each black hole.
Part of the shift condition is a damping parameter, which has to be properly
chosen for stable evolutions. However, a constant damping parameter does not
account for the difference in mass in unequal mass binaries. We introduce a
position dependent shift damping that addresses this problem. Although the
coordinates change, the changes in the extracted gravitational waves are small.
