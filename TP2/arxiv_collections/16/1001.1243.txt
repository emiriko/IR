In this paper, we have constructed a (2+1)-dimensional wormhole using
inhomogeneous and anisotropic distribution of phantom energy. We have
determined the exact form of the equation of state of phantom energy that
supports the wormhole structure. Interestingly, this equation of state is
linear but variable one and is dependent only on the radial parameter of the
model.
