These lecture notes have been converted to a book titled Network Information
Theory published recently by Cambridge University Press. This book provides a
significantly expanded exposition of the material in the lecture notes as well
as problems and bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter. The authors are
currently preparing a set of slides based on the book that will be posted in
the second half of 2012. More information about the book can be found at
http://www.cambridge.org/9781107008731/. The previous (and obsolete) version of
the lecture notes can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3404v4/.
