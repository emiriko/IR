We study Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity for points of Schubert varieties in the
complete flag variety, by Groebner degenerations of the Kazhdan-Lusztig ideal.
In the covexillary case, we give a positive combinatorial rule for multiplicity
by establishing (with a Groebner basis) a reduced and equidimensional limit
whose Stanley-Reisner simplicial complex is homeomorphic to a shellable ball or
sphere. We show that multiplicity counts the number of facets of this complex.
We also obtain a formula for the Hilbert series of the local ring. In
particular, our work gives a multiplicity rule for Grassmannian Schubert
varieties, providing alternative statements and proofs to formulae of
[Lakshmibai-Weyman '90], [Rosenthal-Zelevinsky '01], [Krattenthaler '01],
[Kreiman-Lakshmibai '04] and [Woo-Yong '09]. We suggest extensions of our
methodology to the general case.
