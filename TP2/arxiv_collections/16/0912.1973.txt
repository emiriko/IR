Consider a diffusion process corresponding to the operator
$L=\frac12a\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+b\frac d{dx}$ and which is transient to $+\infty$.
For $c>0$, we give an explicit criterion in terms of the coefficients $a$ and
$b$ which determines whether or not the diffusion almost surely eventually
stops making down-crossings of length $c$. As a particular case, we show that
if $a=1$, then the diffusion almost surely stops making down-crossings of
length $c$ if $b(x)\ge\frac1{2c}\log x+\frac\gamma c\log\log x$, for some
$\gamma>1$ and for large $x$, but makes down-crossings of length $c$ at
arbitrarily large times if $b(x)\le\frac1{2c}\log x+\frac1c\log\log x$, for
large $x$.
