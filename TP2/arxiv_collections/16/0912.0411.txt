In magnetism, of which molecular magnetism is a part, the term frustration is
used rather sloppily. Sometimes one gains the impression that if the reason for
some phenomenon is not quite clear then it is attributed to frustration. In
this paper I discuss the effects of frustration that I feel are relevant for
the field of molecular magnetism. As will become clear later they indeed lead
to a variety of unusual magnetic properties.
