Is information causality a new physical principle? To answer this question,
we first analytically derive the criteria of emergence of quantum correlations
from information causality. Then it is shown that, as emergence criteria of
quantum correlations, information causality and uselessness of coupler-based
non-locality swapping can be regarded equivalent. Therefore, incapability of
non-locality swapping using a coupler is as powerful as information causality
in the single-out of quantum physics from generalized non-signalling models.
