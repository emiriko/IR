We derive the higher dimensional generalization of Penrose-Tod equation
describing past horizon in Robinson-Trautman spacetimes with a cosmological
constant and pure radiation. Results for D=4 dimensions are summarized.
Existence of its solutions in D>4 dimensions is proved using tools for
nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations.
