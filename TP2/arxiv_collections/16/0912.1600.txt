We study the spectrum of scalar glueballs in SQCD-like theories whose gravity
description is in terms of Nc D5 color branes wrapped on an S^2 inside a
CY3-fold, and Nf backreacting D5 flavor branes wrapped on a non-compact
two-cycle inside the same CY3-fold. We show that there exists a consistent
truncation of the ten-dimensional Type IIB supergravity system to a
five-dimensional non-linear sigma model consisting of four scalars coupled to
gravity. Studying fluctuations of the scalars as well as the metric around
particular backgrounds allows us to compute their spectra. A few different
backgrounds share the same qualitative features, namely that the mass of the
lightest scalar glueball increases as the number of flavors is increased, until
one reaches the point Nf = 2 Nc after which the opposite behaviour is obtained.
We show that the five-dimensional non-linear sigma model obeys Seiberg duality,
and demonstrate this explicitly for the spectra of a class of backgrounds that
are Seiberg dual to themselves.
