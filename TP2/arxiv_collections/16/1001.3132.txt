We summarize the results for the master integrals of the three-loop quark and
gluon form factor in massless QCD. Working in dimensional regularization we
extract poles up to 1/epsilon^6. The computational techniques involve, among
others, the expansion of higher transcendental functions and the Mellin-Barnes
method. The coefficients of the Laurent expansion in epsilon are given either
analytically or numerically to high precision.
