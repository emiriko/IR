Masses of heavy Standard Model fermions (top-quark, bottom-quark, and
tau-lepton) play an important role in the analysis of theories beyond the SM.
They serve as low-energy input and reduce the parameter space of such theories.
In this paper Minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM is considered and
two-loop relations between known SM values of fermion masses and running
parameters of the MSSM are studied within the effective theory approach. Both
b-quark and tau-lepton have the same quantum numbers with respect to SU(2)
groupand in the MSSM acquire their masses due to interactions with the same
Higgs doublet. As a consequence, for large values of tan beta parameter
corresponding Yukawa couplings also become large and together with tan beta can
significantly enhance radiative corrections. In the case of b-quark two-loop
O(alpha_s^2) contribution to the relation between running bottom-quark mass in
QCD and MSSM is known in literature. This paper is devoted to calculation of
the NNLO corrections proportional to Yukawa couplings. For the tau-lepton
obtained contribution can be considered as a good approximation to the full
two-loop result. For the b-quark numerical analysis given in the paper shows
that only the sum of strong and Yukawa corrections can play such a role.
