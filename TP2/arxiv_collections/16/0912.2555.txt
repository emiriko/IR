In this paper we present a tool that performs CUDA accelerated LTL Model
Checking. The tool exploits parallel algorithm MAP adjusted to the NVIDIA CUDA
architecture in order to efficiently detect the presence of accepting cycles in
a directed graph. Accepting cycle detection is the core algorithmic procedure
in automata-based LTL Model Checking. We demonstrate that the tool outperforms
non-accelerated version of the algorithm and we discuss where the limits of the
tool are and what we intend to do in the future to avoid them.
