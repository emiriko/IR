In this paper, we describe our decade-long experience of building and
operating one of the most active Institutional Repository in the world:
www.saber.ula.ve <http://www.saber.ula.ve> (University of the Andes,
Merida-Venezuela). In order to share our experience with other institutions, we
firstly explain the steps we followed to preserve and disseminate the
scientific production of the University of Los Andes' researchers. We then
present some recent quantitative results about our repository activities and we
outline some methodological guidelines that could be applied in order to
replicate similar experiences. These guidelines list the ingredients or
building blocks as well as the processes followed for developing and
maintaining the services of an Institutional Repository. These include
technological infrastructure; institutional policies on preservation,
publication and dissemination of knowledge; recommendations on incentives for
open access publication; the process of selection, testing and adaptation of
technological tools; the planning and organization of services, and the
dissemination and support within the scientific community that will eventually
lead to the adoption of the ideas that lie behind the open access movement. We
summarize the results obtained regarding the acceptance, adoption and use of
the technological tools used for the publication of our institution's
intellectual production, and we present the main obstacles encountered on the
way.
