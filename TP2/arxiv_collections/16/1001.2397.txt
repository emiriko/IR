In this talk we present the extension of the antenna subtraction method to
include initial states containing one hadron at NNLO. We sketch the
requirements for the different necessary subtraction terms, and we explain how
the antenna functions are integrated over the appropriate phase space by
reducing the integrals to a small set of master integrals. Where applicable,
our results for the integrated antennae were cross-checked against the known
NNLO coefficient functions for deep inelastic scattering processes.
