The many electron correlated scattering (MECS) approach to quantum electronic
transport was investigated in the linear response regime [I. Baldea and H.
Koeppel, Phys. Rev. B. 78, 115315 (2008)]. The authors suggest, based on
numerical calculations, that the manner in which the method imposes boundary
conditions is unable to reproduce the well-known phenomena of conductance
quantization. We introduce an analytical model and demonstrate that conductance
quantization is correctly obtained using open system boundary conditions within
the MECS approach.
