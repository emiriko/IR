Phosphorus (P) in germanium (Ge) delta-doped layers are fabricated in
ultra-high vacuum by adsorption of phosphine molecules onto an atomically flat
clean Ge(001) surface followed by thermal incorporation of P into the lattice
and epitaxial Ge overgrowth by molecular beam epitaxy. Structural and
electrical characterizations show that P atoms are confined, with minimal
diffusion, into an ultra-narrow 2-nm-wide layer with an electrically-active
sheet carrier concentration of 4x10^13 cm-2 at 4.2 K. These results open up the
possibility of ultra-narrow source/drain regions with unprecedented carrier
densities for Ge n-channel field effect transistors.
