In the loop approach to the quantisation of gravity, one uses a Hilbert space
which is too singular for some operators to be realised as derivatives. This is
usually addressed by instead using finite difference operators at the Planck
scale, a process known as ``polymerisation''. In the symmetry reduced example
of loop cosmology, we study an ambiguity in the regularisation which we relate
to the ambiguity of fixing the coefficients of infinitely many higher curvature
counter terms augmenting the Einstein-Hilbert action. Thus the situation is
comparable to he one in a naive perturbative treatment of quantum gravity with
a cut-off where the necessary presence of infinitely many higher derivative
terms compromises predictability. As a by-product, we demonstrate in an
appendix that it is possible to have higher curvature actions for gravity which
still lead to first order equations of motion like in the Friedmann case.
