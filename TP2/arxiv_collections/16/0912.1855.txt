Following my previous study of paper length vs. number of citations in
astronomy (Stanek 2008), some colleagues expressed an interest in knowing if
any correlation exists between citations and the number of authors on an
astronomical paper. At least naively, one would expect papers with more authors
to be cited more. I test this expectation with the same sample of papers as
analyzed in Stanek (2008), selecting all (~30,000) refereed papers from A&A,
AJ, ApJ and MNRAS published between 2000 and 2004. (...) I find that indeed
papers with more authors are on average cited more, but only weakly so:
roughly, the number of citations doubles with ten-fold increase in the number
of authors. While the median number of citations to a 2 author paper is 17, the
median number of citations to a paper with 10 to 20 authors is 32. I find that
most of the papers are written by a small number of authors, with a mode of 2
authors and a median of 3 authors. I also find that papers with more authors
are not longer than papers with fewer authors, in fact a median number of 8 to
10 pages per paper holds for any number of authors. For the same sample of
papers, a median number of citations per paper grew from 15 in June 2008
(Stanek 2008) to 19 in November 2009. Unlike Stanek (2008), I do not conclude
with any career advice, semi-humorous or otherwise.
