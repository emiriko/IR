We have performed a set of 11 three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical core
collapse supernova simulations in order to investigate the dependencies of the
gravitational wave signal on the progenitor's initial conditions. We study the
effects of the initial central angular velocity and different variants of
neutrino transport. Our models are started up from a 15 solar mass progenitor
and incorporate an effective general relativistic gravitational potential and a
finite temperature nuclear equation of state. Furthermore, the electron flavour
neutrino transport is tracked by efficient algorithms for the radiative
transfer of massless fermions. We find that non- and slowly rotating models
show gravitational wave emission due to prompt- and lepton driven convection
that reveals details about the hydrodynamical state of the fluid inside the
protoneutron stars. Furthermore we show that protoneutron stars can become
dynamically unstable to rotational instabilities at T/|W| values as low as ~2 %
at core bounce. We point out that the inclusion of deleptonization during the
postbounce phase is very important for the quantitative GW prediction, as it
enhances the absolute values of the gravitational wave trains up to a factor of
ten with respect to a lepton-conserving treatment.
