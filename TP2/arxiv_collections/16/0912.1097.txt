Equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium transitions of an off-lattice protein
model have been identified and studied. In particular, the out-of-equilibrium
dynamics of the protein undergoing mechanical unfolding is investigated, and by
using a work fluctuation relation, the system free energy landscape is
evaluated. Three different structural transitions are identified along the
unfolding pathways. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the the free and
potential energy profiles in terms of inherent structure formalism allows us to
put in direct correspondence these transitions with the equilibrium thermal
transitions relevant for protein folding/unfolding. Through the study of the
fluctuations of the protein structure at different temperatures, we identify
the dynamical transitions, related to configurational rearrangements of the
protein, which are precursors of the thermal transitions.
