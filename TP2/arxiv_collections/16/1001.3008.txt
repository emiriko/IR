We apply a unitary approach together with a set of hidden-gauge Lagrangians
to study the vector-vector interaction. We study the case of the
$\rho$($\omega$)$D^*$ interaction within the model. In $I=1/2$ we get strong
enough attraction to bind the system. Concretely, we get one resonance for each
spin $J=0,1,2$. For J=1 and 2 these resonances can be easily identified with
the $D^*(2460)$ and $D^*(2640)$. Whereas the state for J=0 with mass
$M\sim2600$ MeV is a prediction of the model. In $I=3/2$ we get a repulsive
interaction and hence no exotic dynamically generated states.
