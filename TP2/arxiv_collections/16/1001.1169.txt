In this paper, we generalized the surface integral equation method for the
evaluation of Casimir force in arbitrary three-dimensional geometries. Similar
to the two-dimensional case, the evaluation of the mean Maxwell stress tensor
is cast into solving a series of three-dimensional scattering problems. The
formulation and solution of the three-dimensional scattering problem is
well-studied in classical computational electromagnetics. This paper
demonstrates that this quantum electrodynamic phenomena can be studied using
the knowledge and techniques of classical electrodynamics.
