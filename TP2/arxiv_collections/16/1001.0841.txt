We study diffusion of a particle in a system composed of K parallel channels,
where the transition rates within the channels are quenched random variables
whereas the inter-channel transition rate v is homogeneous. A variant of the
strong disorder renormalization group method and Monte Carlo simulations are
used. Generally, we observe anomalous diffusion, where the average distance
travelled by the particle, [<x(t)>]_{av}, has a power-law time-dependence
[<x(t)>]_{av} ~ t^{\mu_K(v)}, with a diffusion exponent 0 \le \mu_K(v) \le 1.
In the presence of left-right symmetry of the distribution of random rates, the
recurrent point of the multi-channel system is independent of K, and the
diffusion exponent is found to increase with K and decrease with v. In the
absence of this symmetry, the recurrent point may be shifted with K and the
current can be reversed by varying the lane change rate v.
