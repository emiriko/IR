We give the calibration and scientific performance parameters of the Planck
Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) measured during the ground cryogenic test
campaign. These parameters characterise the instrument response and constitute
our best pre-launch knowledge of the LFI scientific performance. The LFI shows
excellent $1/f$ stability and rejection of instrumental systematic effects;
measured noise performance shows that LFI is the most sensitive instrument of
its kind. The set of measured calibration parameters will be updated during
flight operations through the end of the mission.
