The dynamic software development organizations optimize the usage of
resources to deliver the products in the specified time with the fulfilled
requirements. This requires prevention or repairing of the faults as quick as
possible. In this paper an approach for predicting the run-time errors in java
is introduced. The paper is concerned with faults due to inheritance and
violation of java constraints. The proposed fault prediction model is designed
to separate the faulty classes in the field of software testing. Separated
faulty classes are classified according to the fault occurring in the specific
class. The results are papered by clustering the faults in the class. This
model can be used for predicting software reliability.
