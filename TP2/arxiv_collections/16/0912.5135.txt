Archival Chandra observations are used to study the X-ray emission associated
with star formation in the central region of the nearby SAB(s)cd galaxy NGC
2403. The distribution of X-ray emission is compared to the morphology visible
at other wavelengths using complementary Spitzer, GALEX, and ground-based
Halpha imagery. In general, the brightest extended X-ray emission is associated
with HII regions and to other star-forming structures but is more pervasive;
existing also in regions devoid of strong Halpha and UV emission. This X-ray
emission has the spectral properties of diffuse hot gas (kT ~ 0.2keV) whose
likely origin is in gas shock-heated by stellar winds and supernovae with < 20%
coming from faint unresolved X-ray point sources. This hot gas may be
slowly-cooling extra-planar remnants of past outflow events, or a disk
component that either lingers after local star formation activity has ended or
that has vented from active star-forming regions into a porous interstellar
medium.
