It is well known that steady states of the Vlasov-Poisson system, a widely
used model in non-relativistic galactic dynamics, have negative energy. In this
paper we derive the analogous property for two relativistic generalizations of
the Vlasov-Poisson system: The Nordstr\"om-Vlasov system and the
Einstein-Vlasov system. In the first case we show that the energy of steady
states is bounded by their total rest mass; in the second case, where we also
assume spherical symmetry, we prove an inequality which involves not only the
energy and the rest mass, but also the central redshift. In both cases the
proof makes use of integral inequalities satisfied by time depedent solutions
and which are derived using the vector fields multipliers method.
