Regular Einstein relation, connecting the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion
and the Dember field with mobilities, is generalized for the case of
interacting electron-hole plasma. The calculations are presented for a
non-degenerate plasma injected by light in semiconductors of silicon and
germanium type. The Debye-Huckel correlation and the Wigner-Seitz exchange
terms are considered. The corrections to the mobilities of carriers due to
difference between average and acting electric fields within the electron-hole
plasma is taken into account. The deviation of the generalized relation from
the regular Einstein relation is pronounced at low temperatures and can explain
anomaly of the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion, recently discovered
experimentally.
