We study quantum dynamics of bosonic atoms that are excited to form a phase
kink, or several kinks, by an imprinting potential in a one-dimensional trap.
We calculate dissipation due to quantum and thermal fluctuations in soliton
trajectories, collisions and the core structure. Single-shot runs show weak
filling of a soliton core, typically deeper solitons in the case of stronger
fluctuations and spreading/disappearing solitons due to collisions. We also
analyze a soliton system in an optical lattice that shows especially strong
fluctuation-induced phenomena.
