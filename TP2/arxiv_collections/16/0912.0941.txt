New generation TeV gamma-ray telescopes have discovered many new sources,
including several enigmatic unidentified TeV objects. HESS J0632+057 is a
particularly interesting unidentified TeV source since: it is a point source,
it has a possible hard-spectrum X-ray counterpart and a positionally consistent
Be star, it has evidence of long-term VHE flux variability, and it is
postulated to be a newly detected TeV/X-ray binary. We have obtained Swift
X-ray telescope observations of this source from MJD 54857 to 54965, in an
attempt to ascertain its nature and to investigate the hypothesis that it's a
previously unknown X-ray/TeV binary. Variability and spectral properties
similar to those of the other 3 known X-ray/TeV binaries have been observed,
with measured flux increases by factors of approximately 3. X-ray variability
is present on multiple timescales including days to months; however, no clear
signature of periodicity is present on the timescales probed by these data. If
binary modulation is present and dominating the measured variability, then the
period of the orbit is likely to be more than 54 days (half of this campaign),
or it has a shorter period with a variable degree of flux modulation on
successive high states. If the two high states measured to date are due to
binary modulation, then the favored period is approximately 35-40 days. More
observations are required to determine if this object is truly a binary system
and to determine the extent that the measured variability is due to inter-orbit
flaring effects or periodic binary modulation.
