In the tangent space of some spatially extended dissipative systems one can
observe "physical" modes which are highly involved in the dynamics and are
decoupled from the remaining set of hyperbolically "isolated" degrees of
freedom representing strongly decaying perturbations. This mode splitting is
studied for the Ginzburg-Landau equation at different strength of the spatial
coupling. We observe that isolated modes coincide with eigenmodes of the
homogeneous steady state of the system; that there is a local basis where the
number of non-zero components of the state vector coincides with the number of
"physical" modes; that in a system with finite number of degrees of freedom the
strict mode splitting disappears at finite value of coupling; that above this
value a fussy mode splitting is observed.
