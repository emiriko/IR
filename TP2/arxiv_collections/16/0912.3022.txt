We use magnetic quantum oscillations in the underdoped high Tc superconductor
YBa_2Cu_3O_(6+x) (x=0.56) measured over a broad range of temperatures 100
mK<T<18 K to extract the form of the distribution function describing the
low-lying quasiparticle excitations in high magnetic fields. Despite the
proximity of YBa_2Cu_3O_(6+x) (x=0.56) to a Mott insulating state, various
broken symmetry ground states and/or states with different quasiparticle
statistics, we find that our experimental results can be understood in terms of
quasiparticle excitations obeying Fermi-Dirac statistics as in the Landau Fermi
liquid theory.
