Let F be a family of holomorphic functions and let K be a constant less than
4. Suppose that for all f in F the second iterate of f does not have fixed
points for which the modulus of the multiplier is greater than K. We show that
then F is normal. This is deduced from a result about the multipliers of
iterated polynomials.
