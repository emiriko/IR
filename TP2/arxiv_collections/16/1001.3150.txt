This paper proposes a controlled experiment to further investigate the
usefulness of gaze awareness and gesture recognition in the support of
collaborative work at a distance. We propose to redesign experiments conducted
several years ago with more recent technology that would: a) enable to better
study of the integration of communication modalities, b) allow users to freely
move while collaborating at a distance and c) avoid asymmetries of
communication between collaborators.
