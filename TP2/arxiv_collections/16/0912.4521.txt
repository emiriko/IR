We study the pseudogap Anderson model as a prototype system for critical
Kondo destruction. We obtain finite-temperature (T) scaling functions near its
quantum critical point, using a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method and
also considering a dynamical large-N limit. We are able to determine the
behavior of the scaling functions in the typically-difficult-to-access
quantum-relaxational regime (hbar w < k_B T), and conclude that the relaxation
rates for both the spin and single-particle excitations are linear in
temperature. We discuss the implications of these results for the quantum
critical phenomena in heavy fermion metals.
