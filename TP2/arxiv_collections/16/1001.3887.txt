We discuss a proposal to make small artificial black holes (ABH's) using a
huge laser. Because of Hawking radiation, they would be extremely powerful
energy sources. We investigate the technical problems of using them to make
power plants and starships. The first suggestion is due to Hawking. Next, we
consider what challenges the ABH proposal would pose for a future quantum
theory of gravity. The form of a theory which would allow us to compute the
necessary corrections to classical theory is considered. It is widely believed
that every black hole produces a new baby universe on the other side of its
singularity. If this is true, ABH technology will involve future humanity in
the creation process of universes. Finally, we ponder the effects that the ABH
proposal would have on the culture of a future society, particularly if the
baby universe theory is correct. The changes in our economic life and
understanding of our role in the cosmos would be so profound as to have a
"spiritual" aspect.
