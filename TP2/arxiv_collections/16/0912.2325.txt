We present the first results of our investigation into the ISM environments
of long-duration GRB (LGRB) host galaxies. We apply a new suite of stellar
population synthesis and photoionization models to new, uniform, rest-frame
optical observations of eight LGRB host galaxies ranging from z = 0.01 to z =
0.81. We also compare these hosts to a variety of local and
intermediate-redshift galaxy populations. We find that LGRB host galaxies
generally have low-metallicity ISM environments. As a whole, the ISM properties
of our LGRB hosts set them apart from the general galaxy population, host
galaxies of nearby Type Ic supernovae, and nearby metal-poor galaxies. With
these comparisons we investigate whether LGRB host galaxies may be used as
accurate tracers of star formation in distant galaxies.
