It is shown how to implement quantum feedback and probabilistic error
correction in an open quantum system consisting of a single atom, with ground-
and excited-state Zeeman structure, in a driven two-mode optical cavity. The
ground state superposition is manipulated and controlled through conditional
measurements and external fields, which shield the coherence and correct
quantum errors. Modeling of an experimentally realistic situation demonstrates
the robustness of the proposal for realization in the laboratory.
