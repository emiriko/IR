The ground state hyperfine splitting in positronium, $\Delta
_{\mathrm{HFS}}$, is sensitive to high order corrections of QED. A new
calculation up to $O(\alpha ^3)$ has revealed a $3.9 \sigma$ discrepancy
between the QED prediction and the experimental results. This discrepancy might
either be due to systematic problems in the previous experiments or to
contributions beyond the Standard Model. We propose an experiment to measure
$\Delta_{\mathrm{HFS}}$ employing new methods designed to remedy the systematic
errors which may have affected the previous experiments. Our experiment will
provide an independent check of the discrepancy. The measurement is in progress
and a preliminary result of $\Delta_{\mathrm{HFS}} = 203.399 \pm 0.029
\mathrm{GHz} (143 \mathrm{ppm})$ has been obtained. A measurement with a
precision of O(1) ppm is expected within a few years.
