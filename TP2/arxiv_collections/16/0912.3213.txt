Dense hadronic matter at low temperature is expected to be in crystal and at
high density make a transition to a {\em chirally restored but color-confined}
state which is a novel phase hitherto unexplored. This phase transition is
predicted in both skyrmion matter in 4D and instanton matter in 5D, the former
in the form of half-skyrmions and the latter in the form of half-instantons or
dyons. We predict that when $K^-$'s are embedded in this half-skyrmion or
half-instanton (dyonic) matter which may be reached not far above the normal
density, there arises an enhanced attraction from the soft dilaton field
figuring for the trace anomaly of QCD and the Wess-Zumino term. This attraction
may have relevance for a possible strong binding of anti-kaons in dense nuclear
matter and for kaon condensation in neutron-star matter. Such kaon property in
the half-skyrmion phase is highly non-perturbarive and may not be accessible by
low-order chiral perturbation theory. Relevance of the half-skyrmion or dyonic
matter to compact stars is discussed.
