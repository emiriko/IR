In this brief note we comment on the relation between the ac Josephson effect
and the coherent oscillations of a Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a
double-well potential. The goal is to elucidate the extent to which the latter
is a realization of the former. We detail the correspondence that emerges in
the high occupation limit of the double-well potential, and particularly note
the relation between the two oscillation frequencies.
