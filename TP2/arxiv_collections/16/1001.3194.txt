We study Thomson scattering from the antiferroquadrupole ordering phase in
TmTe. On the basis of the group theoretical treatment, we classify the
selection rules of the scattering intensity governed by the orientation of the
scattering vector G. Then, numerical verification is performed by invoking the
ground states which are deduced from a J=7/2 multiplet model. The obtained
intensity varies drastically depending on the magnitude and direction of G. We
also calculate the scattering intensities under the applied field for H//(001)
and (110). Their results behave differently when the orientation of G is
changed, which is ascribed to the difference of their primary order parameters;
O_{2}^{0} and O_{2}^{2} for H // (001) and (110), respectively. We make
critical comparisons between our results for TmTe and the experimental ones for
CeB_6. First, we assert that the intensities expected from TmTe at several
forbidden Bragg spots are sufficient enough to be experimentally detected.
Second, their intensities at (7/2,1/2,1/2) differ significantly and may be
attributed to the difference of the order parametersbetween the \Gamma_3-type
(O_{2}^{2} and O_{2}^{0}) and \Gamma_5-type (O_{yz}, O_{zx}, and O_{xy})
components, respectively.
