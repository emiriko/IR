Solid state quantum condensates often differ from previous examples of
condensates (such as Helium, ultra-cold atomic gases, and superconductors) in
that the quasiparticles condensing have relatively short lifetimes, and so as
for lasers, external pumping is required to maintain a steady state. On the
other hand, compared to lasers, the quasiparticles are generally more strongly
interacting, and therefore better able to thermalise. This leads to questions
of how to describe such non-equilibrium condensates, and their relation to
equilibrium condensates and lasers. This chapter discusses in detail how the
non-equilibrium Green's function approach can be applied to the description of
such a non-equilibrium condensate, in particular, a system of microcavity
polaritons, driven out of equilibrium by coupling to multiple baths. By
considering the steady states, and fluctuations about them, it is possible to
provide a description that relates both to equilibrium condensation and to
lasing, while at the same time, making clear the differences from simple
lasers.
