We present a kinematic analysis of jet component motion in the VLBI jet of
the BL Lac object S5 1803+784, which does not reveal long-term outward motion
for most of the components. Understanding the complex kinematic phenomena can
possibly provide insights into the differences between quasars and BL Lac
objects. The blazar S5 1803+784 has been studied with VLBI at $\nu$ =1.6, 2.3,
5, 8.4, and 15 GHz between 1993.88 and 2005.68 in 26 observing runs. We
(re)analyzed the data and present Gaussian model-fits. We collected the already
published kinematic information for this source from the literature and
re-identified the components according to the new scenario presented in this
paper. Altogether, 94 epochs of observations have been investigated. A careful
study of the long-term kinematics reveals a new picture for component motion in
S5 1803+784. In contrast to previously discussed motion scenarios, we find that
the jet structure within 12 mas of the core can most easily be described by the
coexistence of several bright jet features that remain on the long-term at
roughly constant core separations (in addition to the already known {\it
stationary} jet component $\sim$ 1.4 mas) and one faint component moving with
an apparent superluminal speed ($\sim$ 19c, based on 3 epochs). While most of
the components maintain long-term roughly constant distances from the core, we
observe significant, smooth changes in their position angles. We report on an
evolution of the whole jet ridge line with time over the almost 12 years of
observations. The width of the jet changes periodically with a period of $\sim$
8 to 9 years. We find a correlation between changes in the position angle and
maxima in the total flux-density. We present evidence for a geometric origin of
the phenomena and discuss possible models.
