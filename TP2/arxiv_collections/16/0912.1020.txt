This paper deals with the performance of Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access (WiMAX), when we enhance its physical layer attributes with
help of different encoding techniques. For this evaluation Space Time Block
Codes (STBC) and Turbo codes are separately introduced into the architecture of
WiMAX that works on adaptive modulation technique.
