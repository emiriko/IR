Point-contact Andreev reflection measurements of Co/ and Cu/tungsten-carbide
(WC$_x$) contacts are presented. Metallic thin films were patterned by
e-beam-lithography and lift-off; tungsten carbide superconducting tips were
grown directly on the pre-patterned samples by decomposition of a
metallo-organic vapour (tungsten hexacarbonyl) under a focused Ga$^+$-ion beam
(FIB). Current-voltage measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic
field clearly showed the signatures of Andreev reflection. The experimental
conductance-voltage curves were analyzed within the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk
theory. The results highlight the possibilities, advantages and disadvantages
of using FIB-produced amorphous WC$_x$ tips for point-contact spectroscopy in
metallic nanostructures.
