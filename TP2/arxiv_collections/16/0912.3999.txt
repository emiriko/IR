Consider the model of bipartite entanglement for a random pure state emerging
in quantum information and quantum chaos, corresponding to the fixed trace
Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE) in Random Matrix Theory. We focus on
correlation functions of Schmidt eigenvalues for the model and prove universal
limits of the correlation functions in the bulk and also at the soft and hard
edges of the spectrum, as these for the LUE. Further we consider the bounded
trace LUE and obtain the same universal limits.
