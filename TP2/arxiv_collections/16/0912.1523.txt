Recently several quantum search algorithms based on quantum walks were
proposed. Those algorithms differ from Grover's algorithm in many aspects. The
goal is to find a marked vertex in a graph faster than classical algorithms.
Since the implementation of those new algorithms in quantum computers or in
other quantum devices is error-prone, it is important to analyze their
robustness under decoherence. In this work we analyze the impact of decoherence
on quantum search algorithms implemented on two-dimensional grids and on
hypercubes.
