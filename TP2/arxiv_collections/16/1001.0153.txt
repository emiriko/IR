A theorem of N. Katz \cite{Ka} p.45, states that an irreducible differential
operator $L$ over a suitable differential field $k$, which has an isotypical
decomposition over the algebraic closure of $k$, is a tensor product
$L=M\otimes_k N$ of an absolutely irreducible operator $M$ over $k$ and an
irreducible operator $N$ over $k$ having a finite differential Galois group.
Using the existence of the tensor decomposition $L=M\otimes N$, an algorithm is
given in \cite{C-W}, which computes an absolutely irreducible factor $F$ of $L$
over a finite extension of $k$. Here, an algorithmic approach to finding $M$
and $N$ is given, based on the knowledge of $F$. This involves a subtle descent
problem for differential operators which can be solved for explicit
differential fields $k$ which are $C_1$-fields.
