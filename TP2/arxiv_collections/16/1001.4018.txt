We consider the 1-loop correction to the energy of folded spinning string
solution in the AdS_3 part of AdS_5 x S^5. The classical string solution is
expressed in terms of elliptic functions so an explicit computation of the
corresponding fluctuation determinants for generic values of the spin appears
to be a non-trivial problem. We show how it can be solved exactly by using the
static gauge expression for the string partition function (which we demonstrate
to be equivalent to the conformal gauge one) and observing that all the
corresponding second order fluctuation operators can be put into the standard
(single-gap) Lam\'e form. We systematically derive the small spin and large
spin expansions of the resulting expression for the string energy and comment
on some of their applications.
