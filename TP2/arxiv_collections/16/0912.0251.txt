A theoretical model for the $Mn_{12}$ acetates is derived including a 'random
field' effect arising from isomer effects in some families of host acetate
materials. Estimates for the important energy scales are given. Phase
boundaries are determined using a mean field approximation. Predictions for
experiment are presented
