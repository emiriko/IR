We obtain the properties of charmed mesons in dense matter using a
coupled-channel approach which accounts for Pauli blocking effects and meson
self-energies in a self-consistent manner. We study the behaviour of
dynamically-generated baryonic resonances together with the open-charm meson
spectral functions in this dense nuclear environment. We discuss the
implications of the in-medium properties of open-charm mesons on the
$D_{s0}(2317)$ and the predicted X(3700) scalar resonances, and on the
formation of $D$-mesic nuclei.
