We investigate in detail the LHC phenomenology of "vectorlike confinement",
where the Standard Model is augmented by a new confining gauge interaction and
new light fermions that carry vectorlike charges under both the Standard Model
and the new gauge group. If the new interaction confines at the TeV scale, this
framework gives rise to a wide range of exotic collider signatures such as the
production of a vector resonance that decays to a pair of collider-stable
charged massive particles (a "di-CHAMP" resonance), to a pair of
collider-stable massive colored particles (a "di-R-hadron resonance), to
multiple photons, $W$s and $Z$s via two intermediate scalars, and/or to
multi-jet final states. To study these signals at the LHC, we set up two
benchmark models: one for the di-CHAMP and multi-photon signals, and the other
for the di-R-hadron and multijet signals. For the di-CHAMP/multi-photon model,
Standard Model backgrounds are negligible, and we show that a full
reconstruction of the spectrum is possible, providing powerful evidence for
vectorlike confinement. For the di-R-hadron/multijet model, we point out that
in addition to the di-R-hadron signal, the rate of the production of four
R-hadrons can also be sizable at the LHC. This, together with the multi-jet
signals studied in earlier work, makes it possible to single out vectorlike
confinement as the underlying dynamics.
