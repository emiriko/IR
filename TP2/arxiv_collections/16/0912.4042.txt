These notes contain the written version of lectures given at the 2009 Les
Houches Summer School "Modern perspectives in lattice QCD: Quantum field theory
and high performance computing." The goal is to provide a pedagogical
introduction to the subject, and not a comprehensive review. Topics covered
include a general introduction, the inclusion of scaling violations in chiral
perturbation theory, partial quenching and mixed actions, chiral perturbation
theory with heavy kaons, and the effects of finite volume, both in the p- and
epsilon-regimes.
