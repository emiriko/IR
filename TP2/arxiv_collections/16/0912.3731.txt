The quasi-two-dimensional electron gas found at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface
offers exciting new functionalities, such as tunable superconductivity, and has
been proposed as a new nanoelectronics fabrication platform. Here we lay out a
new example of an electronic property arising from the interfacial breaking of
inversion symmetry, namely a large Rashba spin-orbit interaction, whose
magnitude can be modulated by the application of an external electric field. By
means of magnetotransport experiments we explore the evolution of the
spin-orbit coupling across the phase diagram of the system. We uncover a steep
rise in Rashba interaction occurring around the doping level where a quantum
critical point separates the insulating and superconducting ground states of
the system.
