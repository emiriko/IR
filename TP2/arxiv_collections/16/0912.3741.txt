The spectral energy distribution (SED) of high-frequency peaked BL Lac
objects (HBL) is characterized by two peaks: one in the UV-X-ray and one in the
GeV-TeV regime. An interesting object for analyzing these broadband
characteristics is PKS 2005-489, which in 2004 showed the softest TeV spectrum
ever measured. In 2009, a multi-wavelength campaign has been conducted with,
for the first time, simultaneous observations by H.E.S.S. (TeV), Fermi/LAT
(GeV), RXTE (keV), Swift (keV, UV, optical) and ATOM (optical) to cover the two
peaks of the SED. During this campaign PKS 2005-489 underwent a high state in
all wavebands which gives the opportunity to study in detail the emission
processes of a high state of this interesting HBL.
