Let $\fa$ be an ideal of a Noetherian local ring $(R,\fm)$ and $M$ a finitely
generated $R$-module. In this paper we introduce some criterions on
Artinianness of formal local cohomology, in particular vanishing and finiteness
of local cohomology modules. We find out the lower and upper bound for
Artinianness of formal local cohomology
