We solve the Dirac equation approximately for the attractive scalar $S(r)$
and repulsive vector $V(r)$ Hulth\'{e}n potentials including a Coulomb-like
tensor potential with arbitrary spin-orbit coupling quantum number $\kappa .$
In the framework of the spin and pseudospin symmetric concept, we obtain the
analytic energy spectrum and the corresponding two-component upper- and
lower-spinors of the two Dirac particles by means of the Nikiforov-Uvarov
method in closed form. The limit of zero tensor coupling and the
non-relativistic solution are obtained. The energy spectrum for various levels
is presented for several $\kappa $ values under the condition of exact spin
symmetry in the presence or absence of tensor coupling.
