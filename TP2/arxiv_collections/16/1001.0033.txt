We present 5201 radial-velocity measurements of 1144 stars, as part of an
ongoing study of the young (150 Myr) open cluster M35 (NGC 2168). We have
observed M35 since 1997, using the Hydra Multi-Object Spectrograph on the WIYN
3.5m telescope. Our stellar sample covers main-sequence stars over a magnitude
range of 13.0<V<16.5 (1.6 - 0.8 Msun) and extends spatially to a radius of 30
arcminutes (7 pc in projection at a distance of 805 pc or 4 core radii). Due to
its youth, M35 provides a sample of late-type stars with a range of rotation
periods. Therefore, we analyze the radial-velocity measurement precision as a
function of the projected rotational velocity. For narrow-lined stars (v sin i
< 10 km/s), the radial velocities have a precision of 0.5 km/s, which degrades
to 1.0 km/s for stars with v sin i = 50 km/s. The radial-velocity distribution
shows a well-defined cluster peak with a central velocity of -8.16 +/- 0.05
km/s, permitting a clean separation of the cluster and field stars. For stars
with >=3 measurements, we derive radial-velocity membership probabilities and
identify radial-velocity variables, finding 360 cluster members, 55 of which
show significant radial- velocity variability. Using these cluster members, we
construct a color-magnitude diagram for our stellar sample cleaned of field
star contamination. We also compare the spatial distribution of the single and
binary cluster members, finding no evidence for mass segregation in our stellar
sample. Accounting for measurement precision, we place an upper limit on the
radial-velocity dispersion of the cluster of 0.81 +/- 0.08 km/s. After
correcting for undetected binaries, we derive a true radial-velocity dispersion
of 0.65 +/- 0.10 km/s.
