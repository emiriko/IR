In the interconnected power system network, instability problems are caused
mainly by the low frequency oscillations of 0.2 to 2.5 Hz. The supplementary
control signal in addition with AVR and high gain excitation systems are
provided by means of Power System Stabilizer (PSS). Conventional power system
stabilizers provide effective damping only on a particular operating point. But
fuzzy based PSS provides good damping for a wide range of operating points. The
bottlenecks faced in designing a fuzzy logic controller can be minimized by
using appropriate optimization techniques like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swam
Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization etc.In this paper the membership
functions of FLC are optimized by the new breed optimization technique called
Genetic Algorithm. This design methodology is implemented on a Single Machine
Infinite Bus (SMIB) system. Simulation results on SMIB show the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed PSS over a wide range of operating conditions
and system configurations.
