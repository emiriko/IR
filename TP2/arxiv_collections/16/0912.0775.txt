We demonstrate a silicon photonic platform using thin buried oxide
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates using localized substrate removal. We
show high confinement silicon strip waveguides, micro-ring resonators and
nanotapers using this technology. Propagation losses for the waveguides using
the cutback method are 3.88 dB/cm for the quasi-TE mode and 5.06 dB/cm for the
quasi-TM mode. Ring resonators with a loaded quality factor (Q) of 46,500 for
the quasi-TM mode and intrinsic Q of 148,000 for the quasi-TE mode have been
obtained. This process will enable the integration of photonic structures with
thin buried oxide SOI based electronics.
