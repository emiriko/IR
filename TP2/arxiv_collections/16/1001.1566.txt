MOJAVE is a VLBI program which monitors a statistically complete,
radio-selected sample of 135 relativistically beamed, flat-spectrum active
galactic nuclei for over more than a decade. In order to understand the
high-energy behavior of this radio complete sample, we are performing Swift
fill-in observations on the complete MOJAVE-I sample since 2007. The complete
study of the spectral energy distribution from radio to X-ray bands on this
radio-selected sample will provide us an opportunity to understand the nature
of AGN. Here we present the preliminary results of the spectral energy
distributions of six gamma-quiet or faint sources from this project: NRAO 140,
PKS 0403-13, PKS B0422+004, PKS 0823+033, 3C 309.1, and 3C 380.
