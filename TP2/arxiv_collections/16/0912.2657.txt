We use the hyper-netted chain approximation of liquid state theory to analyze
the evolution with density of the pair correlation function in a model of soft
spheres with harmonic repulsion. As observed in recent experiments on jammed
soft particles, theory predicts an `anomalous' (nonmonotonic) evolution of the
intensity of the first peak when density is increased at constant temperature.
This structural anomaly is a direct consequence of particle softness, and can
be explained from purely equilibrium considerations, emphasizing the generality
of the phenomenon. This anomaly is also predicted to have a non-trivial,
`${\cal S}$-shaped', evolution with temperature, as a result of a competition
between three distinct effects, which we describe in detail. Computer
simulations support our predictions.
