Quantum Brownian motion in a periodic cosine potential is studied and a
simple estimate of the tunneling effect is obtained in the frames of a
quasi-equilibrium semiclassical approach. It is shown that the latter is
applicable for heavy particles but electrons cannot be described properly since
the quantum effects dominate over the thermal ones. The purely quantum electron
diffusion is investigated at zero temperature and demonstrates that electrons
do not obey the classical Einstein law of Brownian motion in the field of
periodic potentials, since the dispersion of the wave packet increases
logarithmically in time.
