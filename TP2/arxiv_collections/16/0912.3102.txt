We have computed the electronic and hole spectra of a 3D superlattice
consisting of layers of GaAs rods of finite height arranged in a hexagonal
lattice and embedded in an AlGaAs matrix, alternating with spacer layers of
homogeneous AlAs. The spectra are calculated in the envelope function
approximation, with both light-hole and heavy-hole subbands and hole spin
degeneracy taken into account. The application of thick spacers allows to
investigate the band structure of isolated layers of cylindrical rods. We
estimate the ultimate efficiency of solar energy conversion in a solar cell
based on an array of cylindrical quantum dots versus the dot height, and
determine the optimal value of this parameter.
