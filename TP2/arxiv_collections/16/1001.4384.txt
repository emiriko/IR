Recently in (Phys. Rev. D 76, 087502 (2007) and Phys. Rev. D 77, 089903(E)
(2008)) a thin-shell wormhole has been introduced in 5-dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet (EMGB) gravity which was supported by normal
matter. We wish to consider this solution and investigate its stability. Our
analysis shows that for the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) parameter $\alpha <0,$ stability
regions form for a narrow band of finely-tuned mass and charge. For the case
$\alpha >0$, we iterate once more that no stable, normal matter thin-shell
wormhole exists.
