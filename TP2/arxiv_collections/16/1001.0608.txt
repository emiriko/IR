In this paper we consider the problem of testing whether two finite groups
are isomorphic. Whereas the case where both groups are abelian is well
understood and can be solved efficiently, very little is known about the
complexity of isomorphism testing for nonabelian groups. Le Gall has
constructed an efficient classical algorithm for a class of groups
corresponding to one of the most natural ways of constructing nonabelian groups
from abelian groups: the groups that are extensions of an abelian group $A$ by
a cyclic group $Z_m$ with the order of $A$ coprime with $m$. More precisely,
the running time of that algorithm is almost linear in the order of the input
groups. In this paper we present a quantum algorithm solving the same problem
in time polynomial in the logarithm of the order of the input groups. This
algorithm works in the black-box setting and is the first quantum algorithm
solving instances of the nonabelian group isomorphism problem exponentially
faster than the best known classical algorithms.
