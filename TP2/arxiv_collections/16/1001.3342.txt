Brownian dynamics simulations of bidisperse hard discs moving in two
dimensions in a given steady and homogeneous shear flow are presented close to
and above the glasstransition density. The stationary structure functions and
stresses of shear-melted glass are compared quantitatively to parameter-free
numerical calculations of monodisperse hard discs using mode coupling theory
within the integration through transients framework. Theory qualitatively
explains the properties of the yielding glass but quantitatively
overestimatesthe shear-driven stresses and structural anisotropies.
