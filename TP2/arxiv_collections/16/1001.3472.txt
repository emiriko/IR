We present B band photometry of the $\delta$ Scuti star HD 40372 using the
ARIES three channel fast photometer attached to the 104-cm Sampurnanand
telescope in high-speed photometric mode. The star was observed for $\sim$ 5
hours on December 13, 2008. Based on the high quality photometric data, we have
done period analysis by various periodogram analysis techniques. The best
estimate of the period is found to be $\sim 0.067$ days. With this period and
the other stellar parameters determined from $uvby\beta$ photometry available
in the literature, we have calculated the $Q$ value for the star. Comparison of
this $Q$ value with that determined from the model calculations shows that the
star is pulsating in p$_{3}$ mode with $l = 2$.
