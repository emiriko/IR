A family of spherically symmetric solutions with horizon in the model with
m-component anisotropic fluid is presented. The metrics are defined on a
manifold that contains a product of n-1 Ricci-flat "internal" spaces. The
equation of state for any s-th component is defined by a vector U^s belonging
to R^{n + 1}. The solutions are governed by moduli functions H_s obeying
non-linear differential equations with certain boundary conditions imposed. A
simulation of black brane solutions in the model with antisymmetric forms is
considered. An example of solution imitating M_2-M_5 configuration (in D =11
supergravity) corresponding to Lie algebra A_2 is presented.
