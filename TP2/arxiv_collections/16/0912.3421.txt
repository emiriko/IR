We report on recent VLBA/VERA/IVS observational tests of General Relativity.
First, we will summarize the results from the 2005 VLBA experiment that
determined gamma with an accuracy of 0.0003 by measuring the deflection of four
compact radio sources by the solar gravitational field. We discuss the limits
of precision that can be obtained with VLBA experiments in the future. We
describe recent experiments using the three global arrays to measure the
aberration of gravity when Jupiter and Saturn passed within a few arcmin of
bright radio sources. These reductions are still in progress, but the
anticipated positional accuracy of the VLBA experiment may be about 0.01 mas.
