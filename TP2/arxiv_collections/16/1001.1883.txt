Charged lepton flavor violating processes are unobservable in the standard
model, but they are predicted to be enhanced in several extensions to the
standard model, including supersymmetry and models with leptoquarks or
compositeness. We present a search for such processes in a sample of 99M Y(2S)
decays and 117M Y(3S) decays collected with the BABAR detector. We place upper
limits on the branching fractions BF(Y(nS) -> e tau) and BF(Y(nS) -> mu tau) (n
= 2, 3) at the 10^(-6) level and use these results to place lower limits of
order 1 TeV on the mass scale of charged lepton flavor violating effective
operators.
