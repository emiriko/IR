We have investigated the effect of rotation on the polarization of scattered
light for the near-Earth asteroid (1943) Anteros using the Dual Beam Imaging
Polarimeter on the University of Hawaii's 2.2 m telescope. Anteros is an L-type
asteroid that has not been previously observed polarimetrically. We find weak
but significant variations in the polarization of Anteros as a function of
rotation, indicating albedo changes across the surface. Specifically, we find
that Anteros has a background albedo of p_v = 0.18 +/- 0.02 with a dark spot of
p_v < 0.09 covering < 2% of the surface.
