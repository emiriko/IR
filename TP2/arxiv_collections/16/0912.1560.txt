We study the action of irreducible derivations X on some Hilbert's
quasi-regular algebras QRH of germes at 0 of analytic functions on (U,0), where
U is a semi-algebraic set: that is, we show that these algebras are X-finite or
locally X-finite, ie. the degre of the integral projection is finite by
restriction to fibers of elements of QRH, and the differential ideals are
noetherian or locally noetherian. We then give an important application of this
material to the Hilbert's 16th problem about limit cycles: there is no
accumulation of limit cycles on hyperbolic polycycles, inside compact analytic
families of vector fields on the 2-sphere. This is a highly non trivial result
as it includes the case of polycycle that is an accumulation of cycles.
