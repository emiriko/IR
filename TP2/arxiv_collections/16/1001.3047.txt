In this note we consider the algebra $U_q(\hat{sl}_\infty)$ and we study the
category O of its integrable representations. The main motivations are
applications to quantum toroidal algebras, more precisely predictions of
character formulae for representations of quantum toroidal algebras. In this
context, we state a general positivity conjecture for representations of
$U_q(\hat{sl}_\infty)$ viewed as representations of quantum toroidal algebras,
that we prove for Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules.
