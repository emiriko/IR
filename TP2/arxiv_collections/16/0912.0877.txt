The paper presents an analytical description of the growth of a two-component
bubble in a binary liquid-gas solution. We obtain asymptotic self-similar time
dependence of the bubble radius and analytical expressions for the non-steady
profiles of dissolved gases around the bubble. We show that the necessary
condition for the self-similar regime of bubble growth is the constant,
steady-state composition of the bubble. The equation for the steady-state
composition is obtained. We reveal the dependence of the steady-state
composition on the solubility laws of the bubble components. Besides, the
universal, independent from the solubility laws, expressions for the
steady-state composition are obtained for the case of strong supersaturations,
which are typical for the homogeneous nucleation of a bubble.
