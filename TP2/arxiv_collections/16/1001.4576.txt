The Gilbert damping in ferromagnetic semiconductors is theoretically
investigated based on the $s$-$d$ model. In contrast to the situation in
metals, all the spin-conserving scattering in ferromagnetic semiconductors
supplies an additional spin relaxation channel due to the momentum dependent
effective magnetic field of the spin-orbit coupling, thereby modifies the
Gilbert damping. In the presence of a pure spin current, we predict a new
contribution due to the interplay of the anisotropic spin-orbit coupling and a
pure spin current.
