In this paper we discuss possibilities to manipulate a matter-wave with
time-dependent potentials. Assuming a specific setup on an atom chip, we
explore how one can focus, accelerate, reflect, and stop an atomic wave packet,
with, for example, electric fields from an array of electrodes. We also utilize
this method to initiate coherent splitting. Special emphasis is put on the
robustness of the control schemes. We begin with the wave packet of a single
atom, and extend this to a BEC, in the Gross-Pitaevskii picture. In analogy to
laser pulse shaping with its wide variety of applications, we expect this work
to form the base for additional time-dependent potentials eventually leading to
matter-wave pulse shaping with numerous applications
