In this paper we investigate the scalar mode of first-order metric
perturbations over spatially flat FRW spacetime when the holonomy correction is
taken into account in the semi-classical framework of loop quantum cosmology.
By means of the Hamiltonian derivation, the cosmological perturbation equations
is obtained in longitudinal gauge. It turns out that in the presence of metric
perturbation the holonomy effects influence both background and perturbations,
and contribute the non-trivial terms $S_{h1}$ and $S_{h2}$ in the cosmological
perturbation equations.
