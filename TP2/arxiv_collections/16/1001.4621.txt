We consider the factorization and resummation of soft and Coulomb gluons for
pair-production processes of heavy coloured particles at hadron colliders, and
discuss: the construction of a colour basis that diagonalizes the leading soft
function to all orders in perturbation theory; the determination of the
two-loop soft anomalous dimension needed for NNLL resummations; and a general
formula that provides all logarithmically enhanced O(alpha_s^2) correction
requiring as process-independent input only the one-loop hard matching
coefficients.
