We reconsider the perturbative expansion of the Wilson loop in 2d
noncommutative gauge theories, using an improved integration method. For the
class of maximally crossed diagrams in the $\theta \to \infty$ limit we find an
intriguing formula, easily generalizable to all orders in perturbation theory.
