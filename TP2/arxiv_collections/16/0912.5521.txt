We calculated the main dynamic parameters of the spin polarized current
induced magnetic vortex oscillations in nanopillars, such as the range of
current density, where a vortex steady oscillations exist, the oscillation
frequency and orbit radius. We accounted for both the non-linear vortex
frequency and non-linear vortex damping. To describe the vortex excitations by
the spin polarized current we used a generalized Thiele approach to motion of
the vortex core as a collective coordinate. All the calculation results are
represented via the free layer sizes, saturation magnetization, Gilbert damping
and the degree of the spin polarization of the fixed layer. Predictions of the
developed model can be checked experimentally.
