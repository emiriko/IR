In this work the analysis of mixing parameters of the system involving eta,
eta' mesons and some third massive state G is carried out. We use the
generalized mixing scheme with three angles. The framework of the dispersive
approach to Abelian axial anomaly of isoscalar non-singlet current and the
analysis of experimental data of charmonium radiative decays ratio allow us to
get a number of quite strict constraints for the mixing parameters. The
analysis shows that the equal values of axial current coupling constants f_8
and f_0 are preferable which may be considered as a manifestation of SU(3) and
chiral symmetry.
