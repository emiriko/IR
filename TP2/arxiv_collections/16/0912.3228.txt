Real-time heuristic search algorithms are suitable for situated agents that
need to make their decisions in constant time. Since the original work by Korf
nearly two decades ago, numerous extensions have been suggested. One of the
most intriguing extensions is the idea of backtracking wherein the agent
decides to return to a previously visited state as opposed to moving forward
greedily. This idea has been empirically shown to have a significant impact on
various performance measures. The studies have been carried out in particular
empirical testbeds with specific real-time search algorithms that use
backtracking. Consequently, the extent to which the trends observed are
characteristic of backtracking in general is unclear. In this paper, we present
the first entirely theoretical study of backtracking in real-time heuristic
search. In particular, we present upper bounds on the solution cost exponential
and linear in a parameter regulating the amount of backtracking. The results
hold for a wide class of real-time heuristic search algorithms that includes
many existing algorithms as a small subclass.
