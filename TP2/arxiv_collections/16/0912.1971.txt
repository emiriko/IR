We show that the information gained in spectroscopic experiments regarding
the number and distribution of atomic environments can be used as a valuable
constraint in the refinement of the atomic-scale structures of nanostructured
or amorphous materials from pair distribution function (PDF) data. We
illustrate the effectiveness of this approach for three paradigmatic disordered
systems: molecular C60, a-Si, and a-SiO2 . Much improved atomistic models are
attained in each case without any a-priori assumptions regarding coordination
number or local geometry. We propose that this approach may form the basis for
a generalised methodology for structure "solution" from PDF data applicable to
network, nanostructured and molecular systems alike.
