We present new solutions to the nonautonomous nonlinear Schroedinger equation
that may be realized through convenient manipulation of Bose-Einstein
condensates. The procedure is based on the modulation of breathers through an
analytical study of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which is
known to offer a good theoretical model to describe quasi-one-dimensional
cigar-shaped condensates. Using a specific Ansatz, we transform the
nonautonomous nonlinear equation into an autonomous one, which engenders
composed states corresponding to solutions localized in space, with an
oscillating behavior in time. Numerical simulations confirm stability of the
breathers against random perturbation on the input profile of the solutions.
