We build a wonderful model for toric arrangements. We develop the "toric
analog" of the combinatorics of nested sets, which allows to define a family of
smooth open sets covering the model. In this way we prove that the model is
smooth, and we give a precise geometric and combinatorial description of the
normal crossing divisor.
