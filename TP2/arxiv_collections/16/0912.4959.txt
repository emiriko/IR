Non-empty space reading of Maxwell equations as local energy identities
explains why a Coulomb field is carried rigidly by electrons in experiments.
The analytical solution of the Poisson equation defines the sharp radial shape
of charged elementary densities which are proportional to continuous densities
of electric self-energy. Inward and outward longitudinal waves within the
continuous electron reshape its radial energy structure in external fields.
Both Coulomb field and radial charge densities are free from energy
divergences. Non-empty space of electrically charged mass-energy can be
described by complex analytical densities resulting in real values for volume
mass integrals and in imaginary values for volume charge integrals. Imaginary
electric charges in the Newton gravitational law comply with real Coulomb
forces. Unification of forces through complex charges rids them of radiation
self-acceleration.
