The aim of the manuscript is to characterize monotone `metric' in the space
of Markov map. Here, `metric' means the square of the norm defined on the
tangent space, and not necessarily induced from an inner product (this property
hereafter will be called inner-product-assumption), different from usual metric
used in differential geometry. As for metrics in So far, there have been plenty
of literatures on the metric in the space of probability distributions and
quantum states. Among them, Cencov proved the monotone metric in probability
distribution space is unique up to constant multiple, and identical to Fisher
information metric. Petz characterized all the monotone metrics in the quantum
state space using operator mean. As for channels, however, only a little had
been known. In this paper, we impose monotonicity by concatenation of channels
before and after the given channel families, and invariance by tensoring
identity channels. (Notably, we do not use the inner-product-assumption.) To
obtain this result, `resource conversion' technique, which is widely used in
quantum information, is used. We consider distillation from and formation to a
family of channels. Under these axioms, we identify the largest and the
smallest `metrics'. Interestingly, they are not induced from any inner product,
i.e., not a metric. Indeed, one can prove that any `metric' satisfying our
axioms can not be a metric. This result has some impact on the axiomatic study
of the monotone metric in the space of classical and quantum states, since both
conventional theory relies on the inner-product-assumption. Also, we compute
the lower and the upper bound for some concrete examples.
