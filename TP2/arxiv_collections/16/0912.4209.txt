In an attempt to understand the extraordinarily small mass-loss rates of
late-type O dwarfs, mass fluxes in the relevant part of (T_{eff}, g)-space are
derived from first principles using a previously-described code for
constructing moving reversing layers. From these mass fluxes, a weak-wind
domain is identified within which a star's rate of mass loss by a
radiatively-driven wind is less than that due to nuclear burning. The five
weak-wind stars recently analysed by Marcolino et al. (2009) fall within or at
the edge of this domain. But although the theoretical mass fluxes for these
stars are ~ 1.4 dex lower than those derived with the formula of Vink et al.
(2000), the observed rates are still not matched, a failure that may reflect
our poor understanding of low-density supersonic outflows.
  Mass fluxes are also computed for two strong-wind O4 stars analysed by Bouret
et al. (2005). The predictions agree with the sharply reduced mass loss rates
found when Bouret et al. take wind clumping into account.
