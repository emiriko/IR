In current paper we refer to the geometrical classification of the Einstein
equations which has been developed by one of the authors of this paper. This
classification was based on the classical theory for decomposition of the
tensor product of representations into irreducible components, which is studied
in the elementary representation theory for orthogonal groups. We return to
this result for more detailed investigation of classes of the Einstein
equations.
