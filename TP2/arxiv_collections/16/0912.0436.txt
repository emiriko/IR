The motion of a C60 molecule over a graphene sheet at finite temperature is
investigated both theoretically and computationally. We show that a graphene
sheet generates a van der Waals laterally periodic potential, which directly
influences the motion of external objects in its proximity. The translational
motion of a C60 molecule near a graphene sheet is found to be diffusive in the
lateral directions. While, in the perpendicular direction, the motion may be
described as diffusion in an effective harmonic potential which is determined
from the distribution function of the position of the C60 molecule. We also
examine the rotational diffusion of C60 and show that its motion over the
graphene sheet is not a rolling motion.
