Measurement of the semi-inclusive pi+ electroproduction off the proton,
performed with CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab, has been presented. The obtained
fully-differential cross sections, including the azimuthal angle between
hadronic and leptonic planes, phi, allowed us to separate the phi-dependent
terms. While, the phi-independent part of the cross section was found to be in
good agreement with current fragmentation pQCD calculations.
