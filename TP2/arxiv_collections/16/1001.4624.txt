We present a preliminary results of our Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) 2D
probabilistic cellular automata models. The relevant time-scales (emergence of
life, it's diversification and evolution influenced with the global risk
function) are modeled as the probability matrix elements and are chosen in
accordance with the Copernican principle to be well-represented by the data
inferred from the Earth's fossil record. With Fermi's paradox as a main
boundary condition the resulting histories of astrobiological landscape are
discussed.
