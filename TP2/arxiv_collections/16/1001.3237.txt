We apply the holographic principle and the equipartition law of energy to the
apparent horizon of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe and derive the
Friedmann equation describing the dynamics of the universe. We also show that
the equipartition law of energy can be interpreted as the first law of
thermodynamics at the apparent horizon.
