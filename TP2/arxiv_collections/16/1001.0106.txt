The structural profiles and electronic properties of pentacene
(C$_{22}$H$_{14}$) multilayers on Ag(111) surface has been studied within the
density functional theory (DFT) framework. We have performed first-principle
total energy calculations based on the projector augmented wave (PAW) method to
investigate the initial growth patterns of pentacene (Pn) on Ag(111) surface.
In its bulk phase, pentacene crystallizes with a triclinic symmetry while a
thin film phase having an orthorhombic unit cell is energetically less
favorable by 0.12 eV/cell. Pentacene prefers to stay planar on Ag(111) surface
and aligns perfectly along silver rows without any molecular deformation at a
height of 3.9 {\AA}. At one monolayer (ML) coverage the separation between the
molecular layer and the surface plane extends to 4.1 {\AA} due to
intermolecular interactions weakening surface--pentacene attraction. While the
first ML remains flat, the molecules on a second full pentacene layer deposited
on the surface rearrange so that they become skewed with respect to each other.
This adsorption mode is energetically more preferable than the one for which
the molecules form a flat pentacene layer by an energy difference similar to
that obtained for bulk and thin film phases. Moreover, as new layers added,
pentacenes assemble to maintain this tilting for 3 and 4 ML similar to its bulk
phase while the contact layer always remains planar. Therefore, our
calculations indicate bulk-like initial stages for the growth pattern.
