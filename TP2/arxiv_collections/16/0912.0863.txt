In this paper we describe Routhian reduction as a special case of standard
symplectic reduction, also called Marsden-Weinstein reduction. We use this
correspondence to present a generalization of Routhian reduction for
quasi-invariant Lagrangians, i.e. Lagrangians that are invariant up to a total
time derivative. We show how functional Routhian reduction can be seen as a
particular instance of reduction of a quasi-invariant Lagrangian, and we
exhibit a Routhian reduction procedure for the special case of Lagrangians with
quasi-cyclic coordinates. As an application we consider the dynamics of a
charged particle in a magnetic field.
