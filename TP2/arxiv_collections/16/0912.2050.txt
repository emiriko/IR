The entire Kazarian galaxies (KG) catalog is presented which combines
extensive new measurements of their optical parameters with a literature and
database search. The measurements were made using images extracted from the
STScI Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) of Jpg(blue), Fpg(red) and Ipg(NIR) band
photographic sky survey plates obtained by the Palomar and UK Schmidt
telescopes. We provide accurate coordinates, morphological type, spectral and
activity classes, blue apparent diameters, axial ratios, position angles, red,
blue and NIR apparent magnitudes, as well as counts of neighboring objects in a
circle of radius 50 kpc from centers of KG. Special attention was paid to the
individual descriptions of the galaxies in the original Kazarian lists, which
clarified many cases of misidentifications of the objects, particularly among
interacting systems. The total number of individual Kazarian objects in the
database is now 706. We also include the redshifts which are now available for
404 galaxies and the 2MASS infrared magnitudes for 598 KG. The database also
includes extensive notes, which summarize information about the membership of
KG in different systems of galaxies, and about revised activity classes and
redshifts. An atlas of several interesting subclasses of KG is also presented.
