The averaged learning equation (ALEH) applicable to the principal component
analyzer is studied from both quantum information geometry and dynamical system
viewpoints. On the quantum information space (QIS), the space of regular
density matrices endowed with the quantum SLD-Fisher metric, a gradient system
is given as an extension of the ALEH; on the submanifold, consisting of the
diagonal matrices, of the QIS, the gradient flow coincides with the ALEH up to
a local diffeomorphism.
