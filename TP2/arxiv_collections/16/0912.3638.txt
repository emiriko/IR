This work reports the performances of straight and bent active normal
dispersion decreasing fibers (NDDF), with spatial nonlinear variation, to form
parabolic self-similar pulses. The core radius changes along the NDDF length,
thereby altering the transverse field distribution lengthwise. Hence bend loss
is no longer a constant quantity. Including this loss variation, we investigate
the performances of NDDFs as generators of parabolic self-similar pulses. In
view of the small changes of relative refractive index differences during
production, we obtain several NDDFs with variations of core radii. Suitable
choice of index differences and bend radius of curvature of the fibers leads to
obtain similaritons. Even for sufficiently small index differences and bend
radii, parabolic pulses are formed at the cost of higher optimum length in
comparison to straight fibers. The comparative study on the straight and bent
NDDFs with different index difference values is helpful for fiber optic
manufacturers to fabricate the proposed NDDFs.
