A modified perturbation theory in the strength of the nonlinear term is used
to solve the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation with a random potential. It is
demonstrated that in some cases it is more efficient than other methods.
Moreover we obtain error estimates. This approach can be useful for the
solution of other nonlinear differential equations of physical relevance.
