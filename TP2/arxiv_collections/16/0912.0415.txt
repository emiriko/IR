Isobar models for the electromagnetic production of kaons are discussed with
emphasis on the K^+ photoproduction at very small kaon angles and K^0
photoproduction on deuteron. Distorted-wave impuls approximation calculations
of the cross sections for the electroproduction of hypernuclei are presented on
the case of the ^{12}B_\Lambda production.
