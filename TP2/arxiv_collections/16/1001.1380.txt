We derive a forward partial integro-differential equation for prices of call
options in a model where the dynamics of the underlying asset under the pricing
measure is described by a -possibly discontinuous- semimartingale. A uniqueness
theorem is given for the solutions of this equation. This result generalizes
Dupire's forward equation to a large class of non-Markovian models with jumps.
