We have investigated the influence of point defect disorder in the electronic
properties of manganite films. Real-time mapping of ion irradiated samples
conductivity was performed though conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM).
CAFM images show electronic inhomogeneities in the samples with different
physical properties due to spatial fluctuations in the point defect
distribution. As disorder increases, the distance between conducting regions
increases and the metal-insulator transition shifts to lower temperatures.
Transport properties in these systems can be interpreted in terms of a
percolative model. The samples saturation magnetization decreases as the
irradiation dose increases whereas the Curie temperature remains unchanged.
