FeSe is employed as reference material to elucidate the observed high Tc
superconducting behaviour of the related layered iron pnictides. The structural
and ensuing semimetallic band structural forms are here rather unusual, with
the resulting ground state details extremely sensitive to the precise shape of
the Fe-X coordination unit. The superconductivity is presented as coming from a
combination of Resonant Valence Bond (RVB) and Excitonic Insulator physics, and
incorporating Boson-Fermion degeneracy. Although sourced in a very different
fashion the latter leads to some similarites with the high temperature
superconducting (HTSC) cuprates. The Excitonic Insulator behaviour sees SDW,
CDW/PLD and superconductive instabilities all vie for ground state status. The
conflict leads to a very sensitive and complex set of properties, frequently
mirroring HTSC cuprate behaviour. The delicate balance between ground states is
made particularly difficult to unravel by the micro-inhomogeneity of structural
form which it can engender. It is pointed out that several other notable
superconductors, layered in form, semimetallic with indirect overlap and
possessing homopolar bonding, would look to fall into the same general
category, beta-ZrNCl and MgB2 and the high-pressure forms of several elements,
like sulphur, phosphorus, lithium and calcium, being cases in point.
