In this study, the fluctuation-dissipation theory is invoked to shed light on
input-output interindustrial relations at a macroscopic level by its
application to IIP (indices of industrial production) data for Japan.
Statistical noise arising from finiteness of the time series data is carefully
removed by making use of the random matrix theory in an eigenvalue analysis of
the correlation matrix; as a result, two dominant eigenmodes are detected. Our
previous study successfully used these two modes to demonstrate the existence
of intrinsic business cycles. Here a correlation matrix constructed from the
two modes describes genuine interindustrial correlations in a statistically
meaningful way. Further it enables us to quantitatively discuss the
relationship between shipments of final demand goods and production of
intermediate goods in a linear response framework. We also investigate
distinctive external stimuli for the Japanese economy exerted by the current
global economic crisis. These stimuli are derived from residuals of moving
average fluctuations of the IIP remaining after subtracting the long-period
components arising from inherent business cycles. The observation reveals that
the fluctuation-dissipation theory is applicable to an economic system that is
supposed to be far from physical equilibrium.
