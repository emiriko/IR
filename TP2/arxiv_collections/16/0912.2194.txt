We introduce a set of coupled equations for multilayer water waves that
removes the ill-posedness of the multilayer Green-Naghdi (MGN) equations in the
presence of shear. The new well-posed equations are Hamiltonian and in the
absence of imposed background shear they retain the same travelling wave
solutions as MGN. We call the new model the Square Root Depth equations, from
the modified form of their kinetic energy of vertical motion. Our numerical
results show how the Square Root Depth equations model the effects of
multilayer wave propagation and interaction, with and without shear.
