Quantum coherence is of crucial importance for the applicability of donor
based quantum computing. In this Letter we describe the observation of the
interference of conduction paths induced by two donors in a nano-MOSFET
resulting in a Fano resonance. This demonstrates the coherent exchange of
electrons between two donors. In addition, the phase difference between the two
conduction paths can be tuned by means of a magnetic field, in full analogy to
the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
