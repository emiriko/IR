Mean Coulomb energy of 2d Dyson gas in quadratic potential is examined from
combinatorial viewpoint. For beta = 1, we find a recursive relation on mean
energy and obtain its exact (finite N) solution in closed form in terms of the
hypergeometric function 3F2. Using this exact solution, we derive the large-N
asymptotic expansion of mean energy and show, that this expansion contains
half-integer powers of N.
