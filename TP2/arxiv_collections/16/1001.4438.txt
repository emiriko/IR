The lambda-calculus with de Bruijn indices assembles each alpha-class of
lambda-terms in a unique term, using indices instead of variable names.
Intersection types provide finitary type polymorphism and can characterise
normalisable lambda-terms through the property that a term is normalisable if
and only if it is typeable. To be closer to computations and to simplify the
formalisation of the atomic operations involved in beta-contractions, several
calculi of explicit substitution were developed mostly with de Bruijn indices.
Versions of explicit substitutions calculi without types and with simple type
systems are well investigated in contrast to versions with more elaborate type
systems such as intersection types. In previous work, we introduced a de Bruijn
version of the lambda-calculus with an intersection type system and proved that
it preserves subject reduction, a basic property of type systems. In this paper
a version with de Bruijn indices of an intersection type system originally
introduced to characterise principal typings for beta-normal forms is
presented. We present the characterisation in this new system and the
corresponding versions for the type inference and the reconstruction of normal
forms from principal typings algorithms. We briefly discuss the failure of the
subject reduction property and some possible solutions for it.
