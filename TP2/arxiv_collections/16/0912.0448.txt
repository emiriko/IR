We present an algebraic framework for the analysis of combinatorial games.
This framework embraces the classical theory of partizan games as well as a
number of misere games, comply-constrain games, and card games that have been
studied more recently. It focuses on the construction of the quotient monoid of
a game, an idea that has been successively applied to several classes of games.
