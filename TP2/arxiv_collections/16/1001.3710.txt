We report line-by-line control of a coherent discrete spectrum (Raman
sidebands) with a frequency spacing of 10.6 THz that is produced by an
adiabatic Raman process. We show that the spectral phase of the Raman sidebands
is finely controlled to the target (flat relative-spectral-phase). This is
achieved by employing a combination of a spatial phase controller and a
spectral interferometer, which are specifically designed for a high-power
discrete spectrum. We also show that such spectral-phase control produces a
train of Fourier transform limited pulses with an ultrahigh repetition rate of
10.6 THz in the time domain.
