We investigate the magnetic and glassy transitions of the square-lattice XY
model in the presence of random phase shifts. We consider two different
random-shift distributions: the Gaussian distribution and a slightly different
distribution (cosine distribution) which allows the exact determination of the
Nishimori line where magnetic and overlap correlation functions are equal. We
perform Monte Carlo simulations for several values of the temperature and of
the variance of the disorder distribution, in the paramagnetic phase close to
the magnetic and glassy transition lines. We find that, along the transition
line separating the paramagnetic and the quasi-long-range order phases,
magnetic correlation functions show a universal Kosterlitz-Thouless behavior as
in the pure XY model, while overlap correlations show a disorder-dependent
critical behavior. This behavior is observed up to a multicritical point which,
in the cosine model, lies on the Nishimori line. Finally, for large values of
the disorder variance, we observe a universal zero-temperature glassy critical
transition, which is in the same universality class as that occurring in the
gauge-glass model.
