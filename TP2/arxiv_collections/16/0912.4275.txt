We describe Milnor open books and Legendrian surgery diagrams for canonical
contact structures of links of some rational surface singularities. We also
describe an infinite family of Milnor fillable contact 3-manifolds so that the
Milnor genus (resp. Milnor norm) is strictly greater than the support genus
(resp. support norm) of the canonical contact structure, for each member of
this family.
