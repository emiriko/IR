Modern physics, via the standard model with Higgs mechanism and string theory
for example, has supplied ether-like models and emergent general relativity
scenarios that substantially weaken the usual defense of orthodox relativity
and abstract, relational space-time in general. Over a dozen arguments in
support of relativism against space-substances are discussed. It is not known
whether perceived space-time is fundamental or due to a condensed state or
string theoretical membrane. Emergent relativity indicates perhaps a whole
tower of more fundamental space-times. Whether space is best described as a
thing, an emergent phenomenon, or instead Kant's necessary, a priori
pre-condition of the possibility of all phenomena, depends on which space-time
is under consideration. Nevertheless, space-time is fundamentally abstract
relational. This is supported by throughout acknowledging as well as
illustrating the value of space-substance models, yet still keeping firm in
refusing them on the deepest level. The gist is that even while refusing,
physics and philosophy gain more from ether concepts than from plainly refusing
them.
