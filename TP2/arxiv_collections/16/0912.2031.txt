We extract the Boer-Mulders functions for the proton by combining the
unpolarized pd and pp Drell-Yan data measured by the E866/NuSea Collaboration
by the assumption that the $\cos 2\phi$ asymmetry is from the Boer-Mulders
function. Using the extracted Boer-Mulders functions, we present the
predictions for the $\cos 2 \phi$ asymmetries in future pp experiments at
J-PARC and $p \bar{p}$ experiments at PANDA and PAX.
