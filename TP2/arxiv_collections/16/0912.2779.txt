We find exact Fermi coordinates for timelike geodesic observers for a class
of spacetimes that includes anti-de Sitter spacetime, de Sitter spacetime, the
constant density interior Schwarzschild spacetime with positive, zero, and
negative cosmological constant, and the Einstein static universe. Maximal
charts for Fermi coordinates are discussed.
