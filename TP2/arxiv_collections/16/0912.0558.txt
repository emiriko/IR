We report an optimal extraction methodology, for the reduction of
multi-object fibre spectroscopy data, operating in the regime of tightly packed
(and hence significantly overlapping) fibre profiles. The routine minimises
crosstalk between adjacent fibres and statistically weights the extraction to
reduce noise. As an example of the process we use simulations of the numerous
modes of operation of the AAOmega fibre spectrograph and observational data
from the SPIRAL Integral Field Unit at the Anglo-Australian Telescope.
