We explore the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic field in an emerging
flux region. An image of the equivalent width of the He I 10830 A red blended
component shows the presence of filamentary structures that might be
interpreted as magnetic loops. We point out that the magnetic field strength in
the chromosphere resembles a smoothed version of that found in the photosphere
and that it is not correlated at all with the above-mentioned equivalent width
map. Lacking other diagnostics, this suggests that one cannot discard the
possibility that the chromospheric field we infer from the observations is
tracing the lower chromosphere of the active region instead of tracing the
magnetic field along loops. If the He I line is formed within magnetic loops,
we point out a potential problem that appears when interpreting observations
using only one component along the line-of-sight.
