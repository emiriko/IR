GLACIER (Giant Liquid Argon Charge Imaging ExpeRiment) is a large underground
observatory for proton decay search, neutrino astrophysics and CP-violation
studies in the lepton sector. Possible underground sites are studied within the
FP7 LAGUNA project (Europe) and along the JPARC neutrino beam in collaboration
with KEK (Japan). The concept is scalable to very large masses.
