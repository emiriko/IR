Some braneworld models may have observable consequences that, if detected,
would validate a requisite element of string theory. In the infinite
Randall-Sundrum model (RS2), the AdS radius of curvature, L, of the extra
dimension supports a single bound state of the massless graviton on the brane,
thereby reproducing Newtonian gravity in the weak-field limit. However, using
the AdS/CFT correspondence, it has been suggested that one possible consequence
of RS2 is an enormous increase in Hawking radiation emitted by black holes. We
utilize this possibility to derive two novel methods for constraining L via
gravitational wave measurements. We show that the EMRI event rate detected by
LISA can constrain L at the ~1 micron level for optimal cases, while the
observation of a single galactic black hole binary with LISA results in an
optimal constraint of L <= 5 microns.
