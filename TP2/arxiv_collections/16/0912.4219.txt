We show that the strong Nernst effect observed recently in amorphous
superconducting films far above the critical temperature is caused by the
fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter. We employ the quantum
kinetic approach for the derivation of the Nernst coefficient. We present here
the main steps of the calculation and discuss some subtle issues that we
encountered while calculating the Nernst coefficient. In particular, we
demonstrate that in the limit T=0 the contribution of the magnetization ensures
the vanishing of the Nernst signal in accordance with the third law of
thermodynamics. We obtained a striking agreement between our theoretical
calculations and the experimental data in a broad region of temperatures and
magnetic fields.
