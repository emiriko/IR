Uncertainty relations have become the trademark of quantum theory since they
were formulated by Bohr and Heisenberg. This review covers various
generalizations and extensions of the uncertainty relations in quantum theory
that involve the R\'enyi and the Shannon entropies. The advantages of these
entropic uncertainty relations are pointed out and their more direct connection
to the observed phenomena is emphasized. Several remaining open problems are
mentioned
