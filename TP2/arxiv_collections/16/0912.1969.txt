Effect of molecular crowding and confinement experienced by protein in the
cell during unfolding has been studied by modeling a linear polymer chain on a
percolation cluster. It is known that internal structure of the cell changes in
time, however, they do not change significantly from their initial structure.
In order to model this we introduce the correlation among the different
disorder realizations. It was shown that the force-extension behavior for
correlated disorder in both constant force ensemble (CFE) and constant distance
ensemble (CDE) is significantly different than the one obtained in absence of
molecular crowding.
