This paper presents a detailed study of the present VLSI technological
aspects, importance and their replacement or combination with the
Nanotechnology in the VLSI world of silicon semiconductors. Here authors bring
out the nanotechnology in Silicon world which invariably means shrinking
geometry of CMOS devices to nano scale. This also refers to a new world of
nanotechnology where chemists are working in manufacturing of carbon nanotubes
, nano devices of varius materials of nano dimensions without even knowing how
this could change the whole world of Si and CMOS technology and the world we
live in.
