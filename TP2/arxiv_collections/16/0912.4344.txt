We consider a mathematical model for the interactions of an elastic body
fully immersed in a viscous, incompressible fluid. The corresponding composite
PDE system comprises a linearized Navier-Stokes system and a dynamic system of
elasticity; the coupling takes place on the interface between the two regions
occupied by the fluid and the solid, respectively. We specifically study the
regularity of boundary traces (on the interface) for the fluid velocity field.
The obtained trace regularity theory for the fluid component of the system --
of interest in its own right -- establishes, in addition, solvability of the
associated optimal (quadratic) control problems on a finite time interval,
along with well-posedness of the corresponding operator Differential Riccati
equations.
  These results complement the recent advances in the PDE analysis and control
of the Stokes-Lam\'e system.
