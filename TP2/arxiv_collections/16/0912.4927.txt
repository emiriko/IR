We present several results obtained using the BlackHat next-to-leading order
QCD program library, in conjunction with SHERPA. In particular, we present
distributions for vector boson plus 1,2,3-jet production at the Tevatron and at
the asymptotic running energy of the Large Hadron Collider, including new
Z+3-jet distributions. The Z+2-jet predictions for the second-jet P_T
distribution are compared to CDF data. We present the jet-emission probability
at NLO in W+2-jet events at the LHC, where the tagging jets are taken to be the
ones furthest apart in pseudorapidity. We analyze further the large left-handed
W polarization, identified in our previous study, for W bosons produced at high
P_T at the LHC.
