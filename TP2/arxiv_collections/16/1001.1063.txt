New Chandra observations have resolved the structure of the X-ray luminous
southern hotspot in the giant radio quasar 4C74.26 into two distinct features.
The nearer one to the nucleus is an extremely luminous peak, extended some 5
kpc perpendicular to the orientation of the jet; 19 kpc projected further away
from the central nucleus than this is a fainter X-ray arc having similar
symmetry. This arc is co-spatial with near-IR and optical emission imaged with
Gemini, and radio emission imaged with MERLIN. The angular separation of the
double shock structure (itself ~19 kpc or 10 arcsec in size) from the active
nucleus which fuels them of ~550 kpc is a reminder of the challenge of
connecting "unidentified" hard X-ray or Fermi sources with their origins.
