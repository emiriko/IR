Using molecular dynamics simulations, we report a study of the dynamics of
two-dimensional vortex lattices driven over a disordered medium. In strong
disorder, when topological order is lost, we show that the depinning transition
is analogous to a second order critical transition: the velocity-force response
at the onset of motion is continuous and characterized by critical exponents.
Combining studies at zero and nonzero temperature and using a scaling analysis,
two critical expo- nents are evaluated. We find v\sim (F-F_c)^\beta with
\beta=1.3\pm0.1 at T=0 and F>F_c, and v\sim T^{1/\delta} with
\delta^{-1}=0.75\pm0.1 at F=F_c, where F_c is the critical driving force at
which the lattice goes from a pinned state to a sliding one. Both critical
exponents and the scaling function are found to exhibit universality with
regard to the pinning strength and different disorder realizations.
Furthermore, the dynamics is shown to be chaotic in the whole critical region.
