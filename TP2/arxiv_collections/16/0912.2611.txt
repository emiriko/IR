A magnetized large-volume liquid scintillator might be used as a tracking
detector with charge identification to measure high-energy neutrinos. I
consider neutrino oscillations for a beam from a low-energy neutrino factory to
such a detector for the baseline CERN-Pyhasalmi, with the length of 2288 km.
The range to study the oscillation parameters extends to $\sin^2
2\theta_{13}\sim 10^{-4}$ for reasonable assumptions for the detector and the
beam.
