We present a Monte-Carlo approach to prompt-photon production, where photons
and QCD partons are treated democratically. The photon fragmentation function
is modelled by an interleaved QCD+QED parton shower. This known technique is
improved by including higher-order real-emission matrix elements. To this end,
we extend a recently proposed algorithm for merging matrix elements and
truncated parton showers. We exemplify the quality of the Monte-Carlo
predictions by comparing them to measurements of the photon fragmentation
function at LEP and to measurements of prompt photon and diphoton production
from the Tevatron experiments.
