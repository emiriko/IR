We demonstrate that all exact solutions of the Riccati equation by Dai
andWang [C.-Q. Dai, Y.-Y.Wang, Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 181-187] are not new
and cannot be new because the general solution of this equation was obtained
more than one century ago. Moreover we show that some "new solutions" by Dai
and Wang of the Riccati equation do not satisfy this equation. We also
illustrate that the authors did not obtain any new solutions for solution of
the (3+1)-dimensional Burgers system.
