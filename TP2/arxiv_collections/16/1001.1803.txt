The particle and current densities are shown to display damping and undergo
decoherence in ideal quantum gases. The damping is read off from the equations
of motion reminiscent of the Navier-Stokes equations and shows some formal
similarity with Landau damping. The decoherence leads to consistent density and
current histories with characteristic length and time scales given by the ideal
gas.
