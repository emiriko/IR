Construction of the microscopic theory of large-amplitude collective motion,
capable of describing a wide variety of quantum collective phenomena in nuclei,
is a long-standing and fundamental subject in the study of nuclear many-body
systems. Present status of the challenge toward this goal is discussed taking
the shape coexistence/mixing phenomena as typical manifestations of the
large-amplitude collective motion at zero temperature. Some open problems in
rapidly rotating cold nuclei are also briefly discussed in this connection.
