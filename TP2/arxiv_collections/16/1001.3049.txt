The concept of square-mean almost automorphy for stochastic processes is
introduced. The existence and uniqueness of square-mean almost automorphic
solutions to some linear and non-linear stochastic differential equations are
established provided the coefficients satisfy some conditions. The asymptotic
stability of the unique square-mean almost automorphic solution in square-mean
sense is discussed.
