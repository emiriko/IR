We attempt to understand the driving mechanism of a macrospicule and its
relationship with a coronal jet. We study the dynamics of a macrospicule and an
associated coronal jet captured by multi-spacecraft observations. Doppler
velocities both in the macrospicule and the coronal jet are determined by EIS
and SUMER spectra. Their temporal evolution is studied using X-ray and He II
304 images. A blueshift of -120+/-15 km/s is detected on one side of the
macrospicule, while a redshift of 50+/-6 km/s is found at the base of the other
side. The inclination angle of the macrospicule inferred from a stereoscopic
analysis with STEREO suggests that the measured Doppler velocities can be
attributed to a rotating motion of the macrospicule rather than a radial flow
or an expansion. The macrospicule is driven by the unfolding motion of a
twisted magnetic flux rope, while the associated X-ray jet is a radial outflow.
