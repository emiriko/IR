We review recent progress in realizing Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) in a
strongly coupled formulation of type IIB string theory known as F-theory. Our
main emphasis is on the expected low-energy phenomenology of a minimal class of
F-theory GUTs. We introduce the primary ingredients in such constructions, and
then present qualitative features of GUT models in this framework such as GUT
breaking, doublet-triplet splitting, and proton decay. Next, we review
proposals for realizing flavor hierarchies in the quark and lepton sectors. We
discuss possible supersymmetry breaking scenarios, and their consequences for
experiment, as well as geometrically minimal realizations of F-theory GUTs
which incorporate most of these features.
