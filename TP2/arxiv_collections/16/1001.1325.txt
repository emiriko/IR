BV-bands photometric data obtained at the 6-m telescope of the Special
Astrophysical Observatory are used to analyze the structure of 13 large disk
galaxies in the NGC 80 group. Nine of the 13 galaxies under consideration are
classified by us as lenticular galaxies. The stellar populations in the
galaxies are very different, from old ones with ages of T>10 Gyrs (IC 1541) to
relatively young, with the ages of T<2-3 Gyr (IC 1548, NGC 85). In one case,
current star formation is known (UCM 0018+2216). In most of the galaxies, more
precisely in all of them more luminous than M(B) -18, two-tiered
(`antitruncated') stellar disks are detected, whose radial surface brightness
profiles can be fitted by two exponential segments with different scalelengths
-- shorter near the center and longer at the periphery. All dwarf S0 galaxies
with single-scalelength exponential disks are close companions to giant
galaxies. Except for this fact, no dependence of the properties of S0 galaxies
on distance from the center of the group is found. Morphological traces of
minor merger are found in the lenticular galaxy NGC 85. Basing on the last two
points, we conclude that the most probable mechanisms for the transformation of
spirals into lenticular galaxies in groups are gravitational ones, namely,
minor mergers and tidal interactions.
