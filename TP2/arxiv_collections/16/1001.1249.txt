A new approach utilising the concept of ionic charge theory has been used to
explain the inherent properties such as lattice thermal conductivity and bulk
modulus of 3,5 and 2,6 semiconductors. The lattice thermal conductivity of
these semiconductors exhibit a linear relationship when plotted on a log scale
against the nearest neighbour distance but fall on two straight lines according
to the product of the ionic charge of the compounds. On the basis of this
result a simple relationship of lattice thermal conductivity with bulk modulus
is proposed and used to estimate the bulk modulus of these semiconductors. A
fairly good agreement has been found between the experimantal and calculated
values of these parameters for zinc blende structured solids.
