This study elaborates some examples of a simple evolutionary stochastic rate
process where the population rate of change depends on the distribution of
properties--so different cohorts change at different rates. We investigate the
effect on the evolution arising from parametrized perturbations of uniformity
for the initial inhomogeneity. The information geometric neighbourhood system
yields also solutions for a wide range of other initial inhomogeneity
distributions, including approximations to truncated Gaussians of arbitrarily
small variance and distributions with pronounced extreme values. It is found
that, under quite considerable alterations in the shape and variance of the
initial distribution of inhomogeneity in unfitness, the decline of the mean
does change markedly with the variation in starting conditions, but the net
population evolution seems surprisingly stable.
