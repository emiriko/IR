The S-fundamental group scheme is the group scheme corresponding to the
Tannaka category of numerically flat vector bundles. We use determinant line
bundles to prove that the S-fundamental group of a product of two complete
varieties is a product of their S-fundamental groups as conjectured by V. Mehta
and the author. We also compute the abelian part of the S-fundamental group
scheme and the S-fundamental group scheme of an abelian variety or a variety
with trivial etale fundamental group.
