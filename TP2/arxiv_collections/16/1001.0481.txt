We discuss the observed disagreement between the Q^2 distributions of
neutrino-nucleus quasielastic events, measured by a number of recent
experiments, and the predictions of Monte Carlo simulations based on the
relativistic Fermi gas model. The results of our analysis suggest that these
discrepancies are likely to be ascribable to both the breakdown of the impulse
approximation and the limitations of the Fermi gas description. Several issues
related to the extraction of the Q^2 distributions from the experimental data
are also discussed, and new kinematical variables, which would allow for an
improved analysis, are proposed.
