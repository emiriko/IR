The energies of the most energetic extensive air showers observed at the
Yakutsk array have been estimated with help of the all detectors readings
instead of using of the standard procedure with a parameter s(600). The energy
of the most energetic extensive air shower observed at the Yakutsk array
happened to be 200, 200, 180 and 165 EeV with the values of the Xi**2 function
per one degree of freedom 0.9, 1., 0.9 and 1.1 for the primary protons and
helium, oxygen and iron nuclei accordingly.
