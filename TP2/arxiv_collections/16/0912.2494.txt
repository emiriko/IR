Graphene properties can be manipulated by a periodic potential. Based on the
tight-binding model, we study graphene under a one-dimensional (1D) modulated
magnetic field which contains both a uniform and a staggered component. New
chiral current-carrying edge states are generated at the interfaces where the
staggered component changes direction. These edge states lead to an unusual
integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) in graphene, which can be observed
experimentally by a standard four-terminal Hall measurement. When Zeeman spin
splitting is considered, a novel state is predicted where the electron edge
currents with opposite polarization propagate in the opposite directions at one
sample boundary, whereas propagate in the same directions at the other sample
boundary.
