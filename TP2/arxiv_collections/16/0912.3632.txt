The well-known energy problem is discussed in f(R) theory of gravity. We use
the generalized Landau-Lifshitz energy-momentum complex in the framework of
metric f(R) gravity to evaluate the energy density of plane symmetric solutions
for some general f(R) models. In particular, this quantity is found for some
popular choices of f(R) models. The constant scalar curvature condition and the
stability condition for these models are also discussed. Further, we
investigate the energy distribution of cosmic string spacetime.
