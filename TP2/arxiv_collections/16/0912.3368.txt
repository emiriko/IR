We consider an extension of nuMSSM with an extra U(1) that realizes D-term
inflation driven by the right-handed sneutrino. Non-renormalizable terms in the
Kahler potential and the superpotential are considered, the latter controlled
by a suitable discrete R-symmetry. We find that, for subplanckian inflaton
values, the predictions of inflationary parameters are compatible with
observations, establishing the right-handed sneutrino driven inflation as a
viable scenario.
