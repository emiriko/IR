Forty years passed since the optical identification of the first isolated
neutron star (INS), the Crab pulsar. 25 INSs have been now identified in the
optical (O), near-ultraviolet (nUV), or near-infrared (nIR), hereafter UVOIR,
including rotation-powered pulsars (RPPs), magnetars, and X-ray-dim INSs
(XDINSs), while deep investigations have been carried out for compact central
objects (CCOs), Rotating RAdio transients (RRATs), and high-magnetic field
radio pulsars (HBRPs). In this review I describe the status of UVOIR
observations of INSs, their emission properties, and I present the results from
recent observations.
