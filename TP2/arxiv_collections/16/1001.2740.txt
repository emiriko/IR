Coexistence properties of the hard-core attractive Yukawa potential with
inverse-range parameter kappa=9, 10, 12 and 15 are calculated by applying
canonical Monte Carlo simulation. As previously shown for longer ranges, we
show that also for the ranges considered here the coexistence curves scaled by
the critical density and temperature obey the law of corresponding states, and
that a linear relationship between the critical density and the reciprocal of
the critical temperature holds. The simulation results are compared with the
predictions of the self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation, and a good
agreement is found for both the critical points and the coexistence curves,
although some slight discrepancies are present.
