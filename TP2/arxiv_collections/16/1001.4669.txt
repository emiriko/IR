The squeezing dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator are studied for
different types of environment without making the Markovian approximation. The
squeezing dynamics of a coherent state depend on the reservoir spectrum in a
unique way that can, in the weak coupling approximation, be analyzed
analytically. Comparison of squeezing dynamics for Ohmic, sub-Ohmic and
super-Ohmic environments is done showing a clear connection between the
squeezing--non-squeezing oscillations and reservoir structure. Understanding
the effects occurring due to structured reservoirs is important both from a
purely theoretical point of view and in connection with evolving experimental
techniques and future quantum computing applications.
