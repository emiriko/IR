A completely new approach to the Ising model in 1 to 5 dimensions is
developed. We employ $p,q$-binomial coefficients, a generalisation of the
binomial coefficients, to describe the magnetisation distributions of the Ising
model. For the complete graph this distribution corresponds exactly to the
limit case $p=q$. We take our investigation to the simple $d$-dimensional
lattices for $d=1,2,3,4,5$ and fit $p,q$-binomial distributions to our data,
some of which are exact but most are sampled. For $d=1$ and $d=5$ the
magnetisation distributions are remarkably well-fitted by $p,q$-binomial
distributions. For $d=4$ we are only slightly less successful, while for
$d=2,3$ we see some deviations (with exceptions!) between the $p,q$-binomial
and the Ising distribution. We begin the paper by giving results on the
behaviour of the $p,q$-distribution and its moment growth exponents given a
certain parameterization of $p,q$. Since the moment exponents are known for the
Ising model (or at least approximately for $d=3$) we can predict how $p,q$
should behave and compare this to our measured $p,q$. The results speak in
favour of the $p,q$-binomial distribution's correctness regarding their general
behaviour in comparison to the Ising model. The full extent to which they
correctly model the Ising distribution is not settled though.
