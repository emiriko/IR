In this review we discuss several aspects of Cosmic Voids. Voids are a major
component of the large scale distribution of matter and galaxies in the
Universe. They are of instrumental importance for understanding the emergence
of the Cosmic Web. Their relatively simple shape and structure makes them into
useful tools for extracting the value of a variety cosmic parameters, possibly
including even that of the influence of dark energy. Perhaps most promising and
challenging is the issue of the galaxies found within their realm. Not only
does the pristine environment of voids provide a promising testing ground for
assessing the role of environment on the formation and evolution of galaxies,
the dearth of dwarf galaxies may even represent a serious challenge to the
standard view of cosmic structure formation.
