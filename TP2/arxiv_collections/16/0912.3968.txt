Random skew plane partitions of large size distributed according to an
appropriately scaled Schur process develop limit shapes. In the present work we
consider the limit of large random skew plane partitions where the inner
boundary approaches a piecewise linear curve with non-lattice slopes,
describing the limit shape and the local fluctuations in various regions. This
analysis is fairly similar to that in [OR2], but we do find some new behavior.
For instance, the boundary of the limit shape is now a single smooth (not
algebraic) curve, whereas the boundary in [OR2] is singular. We also observe
the bead process introduced in [B] appearing in the asymptotics at the top of
the limit shape.
