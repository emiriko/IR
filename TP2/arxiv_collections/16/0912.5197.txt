We study lattice QCD determinations of the pion mass and decay constant by
means of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). The lattice data are obtained from
large scale simulations with N_f=2 flavours of twisted mass fermions at maximal
twist. We perform a scaling test to the continuum limit of these data and use
ChPT to perform both the chiral and the infinite volume extrapolations.
