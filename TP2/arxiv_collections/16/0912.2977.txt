We address the issue of the fallacy of the gauge concept in electromagnetism.
The role of groupthink in the perpetuation of this concept in the physics
literature is also discussed. Brief, elementary arguments suffice to
demonstrate the fallacy. The simplicity of the proofs indicates that the norms
of the scientific method have been neglected on this topic.
