The CRESST experiment aims for a detection of dark matter in the form of
WIMPs. These particles are expected to scatter elastically off the nuclei of a
target material, thereby depositing energy on the recoiling nucleus. CRESST
uses scintillating CaWO4 crystals as such a target. The energy deposited by an
interacting particle is primarily converted to phonons which are detected by
transition edge sensors. In addition, a small fraction of the interaction
energy is emitted from the crystals in the form of scintillation light which is
measured in coincidence with the phonon signal by a separate cryogenic light
detector for each target crystal. The ratio of light to phonon energy permits
the discrimination between the nuclear recoils expected from WIMPs and events
from radioactive backgrounds which primarily lead to electron recoils. CRESST
has shown the success of this method in a commissioning run in 2007 and, since
then, further investigated possibilities for an even better suppression of
backgrounds. Here, we report on a new class of background events observed in
the course of this work. The consequences of this observation are discussed and
we present the current status of the experiment.
