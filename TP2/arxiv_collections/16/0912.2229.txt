A double quantum dot is formed in a graphene nanoribbon device using three
top gates. These gates independently change the number of electrons on each dot
and tune the inter-dot coupling. Transport through excited states is observed
in the weakly coupled double dot regime. We extract from the measurements all
relevant capacitances of the double dot system, as well as the quantized level
spacing.
