In Gribov-Zwanziger scenario of color confinement, Zwanziger proposed two
types of horizon function in lattice Landau gauge, the first one and the second
one of which foundation was discussed in detail. The second type horizon
function is focussed on in the present study. Its derivation and the horizon
condition are briefly reviewed along the line of Zwanziger, and it is also
reviewed that this horizon condition and Kugo-Ojima color confinement criterion
coincide in the continuum limit. In case of free boundary condition in contrast
to periodic boundary condition, it was shown that the horizon condition holds
for each gauge fixed configuration in Landau gauge. It is clarified that this
fact can be derived from some identity relation which holds on an arbitrary
network of links in Landau gauge. Thus the origin of the pointwise validity of
horizon condition is highlighted.
