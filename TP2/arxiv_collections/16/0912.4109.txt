We have measured the variation of the spontaneous emission rate with
polarization for self-assembled single quantum dots in two-dimensional photonic
crystal membranes. We observe a maximum anisotropy factor of 6 between the
decay rates of the two bright exciton states. This large anisotropy is
attributed to the substantially different projected local density of optical
states for differently oriented dipoles in the photonic crystal.
