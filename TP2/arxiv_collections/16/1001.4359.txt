Prospects for strangeness production in pp collisions at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) are discussed within the statistical model. Firstly, the system
size and the energy dependence of the model parameters are extracted from
existing data and extrapolated to LHC energy. Particular attention is paid to
demonstrate that the chemical decoupling temperature is independent of the
system size. In the energy regime investigated so far, strangeness production
in pp interactions is strongly influenced by the canonical suppression effects.
At LHC energies, this influence might be reduced. Particle ratios with
particular sensitivity to canonical effects are indicated.
  Secondly, the relation between the strangeness production and the
charged-particle multiplicity in pp interactions is investigated. In this
context the multiplicity dependence studied at Tevatron is of particular
interest. There, the trend in relative strangeness production known from
centrality dependent heavy-ion collisions is not seen in multiplicity selected
pp interactions. However, the conclusion from the Tevatron measurements is
based on rather limited data samples with low statistics and number of
observables. We argue, that there is an absolute need at LHC to measure
strangeness production in events with different multiplicities to possibly
disentangle relations and differences between particle production in pp and
heavy-ion collisions.
