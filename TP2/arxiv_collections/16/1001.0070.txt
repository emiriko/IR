PHOTOS Monte Carlo is widely used for simulating QED effects in decay of
intermediate particles and resonances. It can be easily connected to other main
process generators. In this paper we consider decaying processes gamma^* ->
pi^+ pi^-(gamma) and K^\pm -> pi^+ pi^- e^\pm nu (gamma) in the framework of
Scalar QED. These two processes are interesting not only for the technical
aspect of PHOTOS Monte Carlo, but also for precision measurement of
alpha_{QED}(M_Z), g-2, as well as pi pi scattering lengths.
