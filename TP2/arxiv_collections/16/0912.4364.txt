In this talk we discuss mathematical structures associated to Feynman graphs.
Feynman graphs are the backbone of calculations in perturbative quantum field
theory. The mathematical structures -- apart from being of interest in their
own right -- allow to derive algorithms for the computation of these graphs.
Topics covered are the relations of Feynman integrals to periods, shuffle
algebras and multiple polylogarithms.
