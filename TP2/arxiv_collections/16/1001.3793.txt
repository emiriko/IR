We show both experimentally and theoretically the evanescent behaviour of
modes in the Band Gap (BG) of finite Phononic Crystal (PC). Based on
experimental and numerical data we obtain the imaginary part of the wave vector
in good agreement with the complex band structures obtained by the Extended
Plane Wave Expansion (EPWE). The calculated and measured acoustic field of a
localized mode out of the point defect inside the PC presents also evanescent
behaviour. The correct understanding of evanescent modes is fundamental for
designing narrow filters and wave guides based on Phononic Crystals with
defects.
