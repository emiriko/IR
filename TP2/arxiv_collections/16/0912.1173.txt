The electroweak currents of quarks and leptons in the $SO(5) \times U(1)$
gauge-Higgs unification model in the Randall-Sundrum warped space are
determined. The 4D gauge couplings deviate from those in the standard model and
the weak universality is slightly violated. It is shown that the model is free
from 4D anomalies and the deviations of the gauge couplings are tiny, less than
1% except for the top quark. The $Zt_L \bar t_L$, $Zt_R \bar t_R$, $Zb_L \bar
b_L$ and $Zb_R \bar b_R$ couplings deviate from those in the standard model by
-7%, 18%, 0.3% and 0.9% with the warp factor $z_L = 10^{15}$, respectively. The
violation of the $\mu$-$e$, $\tau$-$e$ and $t$-$e$ universality in the charged
current interactions is ${\cal O}(10^{-8})$, ${\cal O}(10^{-6})$ and 2.3%,
respectively.
