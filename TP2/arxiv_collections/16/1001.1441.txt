In this paper we investigate a model (based on the idea of the outflow
dynamics), in which only conformity and anticonformity can lead to the opinion
change. We show that for low level of aniconformity the consensus is still
reachable but spontaneous reorientations between two types of consensus ('all
say yes' or 'all say now') appear.
