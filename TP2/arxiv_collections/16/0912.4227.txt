In this paper we review the role of magneto plasmon polaritons in the Casimir
force calculations. By applying an external constant magnetic field a strong
optical anisotropy is induced on two parallel slabs reducing the reflectivity
and thus the Casimir force. As the external magnetic field increases, the
Casimir force decreases. Thus, with an an external magnetic field the Casimir
force can be controlled.The calculations are done in the Voigt configuration
where the magnetic field is parallel to the slabs. In this configuration the
reflection coefficients for TE and TM modes do not show mode conversion.
