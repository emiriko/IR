We use stochastic computer simulations to study the transport of a spherical
cargo particle along a microtubule-like track on a planar substrate by several
kinesin-like processive motors. Our newly developed adhesive motor dynamics
algorithm combines the numerical integration of a Langevin equation for the
motion of a sphere with kinetic rules for the molecular motors. The Langevin
part includes diffusive motion, the action of the pulling motors, and
hydrodynamic interactions between sphere and wall. The kinetic rules for the
motors include binding to and unbinding from the filament as well as active
motor steps. We find that the simulated mean transport length increases
exponentially with the number of bound motors, in good agreement with earlier
results. The number of motors in binding range to the motor track fluctuates in
time with a Poissonian distribution, both for springs and cables being used as
models for the linker mechanics. Cooperativity in the sense of equal load
sharing only occurs for high values for viscosity and attachment time.
