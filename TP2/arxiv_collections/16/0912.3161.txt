An exact analytical theory is developed for calculating the diffusion
coefficient of charge carriers in strongly anisotropic disordered solids with
one-dimensional hopping transport mode for any dependence of the hopping rates
on space and energy. So far such a theory existed only for calculating the
carrier mobility. The dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the electric
field evidences a linear, non-analytic behavior at low fields for all
considered models of disorder. The mobility, on the contrary, demonstrates a
parabolic, analytic field dependence for a random-barrier model, being linear,
non-analytic for a random energy model. For both models the Einstein relation
between the diffusion coefficient and mobility is proven to be violated at any
finite electric field. The question on whether these non-analytic field
dependences of the transport coefficients and the concomitant violation of the
Einstein's formula are due to the dimensionality of space or due to the
considered models of disorder is resolved in the following paper [Nenashev et
al., arXiv:0912.3169], where analytical calculations and computer simulations
are carried out for two- and three-dimensional systems.
