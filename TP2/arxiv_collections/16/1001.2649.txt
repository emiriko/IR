Weak boson scattering processes provide particularly promising means for
gaining insight into the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking at hadron
colliders. Being very sensitive to interactions in the weak gauge boson sector,
they will help to distinguish the Standard Model from various new physics
scenarios such as extra-dimensional Higgsless models. To unambiguously identify
signatures of new physics, precise predictions for experimentally accessible
observables within realistic selection cuts are crucial, including
next-to-leading order QCD corrections. Here, we review how flexible Monte-Carlo
methods can be employed for precision analyses of weak boson scattering
reactions within the Standard Model and beyond.
