In this contribution we discuss the origin of the extreme helium-rich stars
which inhabit the blue main sequence (bMS) of the Galactic globular cluster
Omega Centauri. In a scenario where the cluster is the surviving remnant of a
dwarf galaxy ingested by the Milky Way many Gyr ago, the peculiar chemical
composition of the bMS stars can be naturally explained by considering the
effects of strong differential galactic winds, which develop owing to multiple
supernova explosions in a shallow potential well.
