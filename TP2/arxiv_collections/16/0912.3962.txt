This paper describes the speed control of a DC series motor for an accurate
and high-speed performance. A neural network based controlling operation with
fuzzy modeling is suggested in this paper. The driver units of these machines
are designed with a Multi-level inverter operation and are controlled by a
common current control mechanism for an accurate and efficient driving
technique for DC series motor. The neuro-fuzzy logic control technique is
introduced to eliminate uncertainties in the plant parameters of the DC Series
motors, and also considered as potential candidate for different applications
to prove adequacy of the proposed control algorithm through simulations. The
simulation result with such an approach is made and observed efficient over
other controlling technique.
