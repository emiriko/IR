The TANAMI (Tracking AGN with Austral Milliarcsecond Interferometry) and
associated programs provide comprehensive radio monitoring of extragalactic
gamma-ray sources south of declination -30 degrees. Joint quasi-simultaneous
observations between the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and ground based
observatories allow us to discriminate between competing theoretical blazar
emission models. High resolution VLBI observations are the only way to
spatially resolve the sub-parsec level emission regions where the high-energy
radiation originates. The gap from radio to gamma-ray energies is spanned with
near simultaneous data from the Swift satellite and ground based optical
observatories. We present early results from the TANAMI program in the context
of this panchromatic suite of observations.
