Two fundamental, and unsolved problems in physics are: i) the resolution of
the "measurement problem" in quantum mechanics ii) the quantization of strongly
nonlinear (nonabelian) gauge theories. The aim of this paper is to suggest that
these two problems might be linked, and that a mutual, simultaneous solution to
both might exist. We propose that the mechanism responsible for the "collapse
of the wave function" in quantum mechanics is the nonlinearities already
present in the theory via nonabelian gauge interactions. Unlike all other
models of spontaneous collapse, our proposal is, to the best of our knowledge,
the only one which does not introduce any new elements into the theory. A
possible experimental test of the model would be to compare the coherence
lengths - here defined as the distance over which quantum mechanical
superposition is still valid - for, \textit{e.g}, electrons and photons in a
double-slit experiment. The electrons should have a finite coherence length,
while photons should have a much longer coherence length (in principle
infinite, if gravity - a very weak effect indeed unless we approach the Planck
scale - is ignored).
