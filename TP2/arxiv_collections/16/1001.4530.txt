We present a large-N theory for the differential conductance, dI/dV, in Kondo
systems measured via scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We demonstrate that
quantum interference between tunneling processes into the conduction band and
into the magnetic f-electron states is crucial in determining the experimental
Fano lineshape of dI/dV. This allows one to uniquely extract the Kondo coupling
and the ratio of the tunneling amplitudes from the experimental dI/dV curve.
Finally, we show that dI/dV directly reflects the strength of the
antiferromagnetic interaction in Kondo lattice systems.
