The new release of the SPECFIND radio cross-identification catalogue,
  SPECFIND V2.0, is presented. It contains 107488 cross-identified objects with
at least three radio sources observed at three independent frequencies.
Compared to the previous release the number of entry radio catalogues is
increased from 20 to 97 containing 115 tables. This large increase was only
made possible by the development of four tools at CDS which use the standards
and infrastructure of the Virtual Observatory (VO). This was done in the
framework of the VO-TECH European Design Study of the Sixth Framework Program.
We give an overview of the different classes of radio sources that a user can
encounter. Due to the increase of frequency coverage of the input radio
catalogues, this release demonstrates that the SPECFIND algorithm is able to
detect spectral breaks around a frequency of ~1 GHz.
