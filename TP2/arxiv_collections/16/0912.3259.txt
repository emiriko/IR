With the LHC up and running, the focus of experimental and theoretical high
energy physics will soon turn to an interpretation of LHC data in terms of the
physics of electroweak symmetry breaking and the TeV scale. We present here a
broad review of models for new TeV-scale physics and their LHC signatures. In
addition, we discuss possible new physics signatures and describe how they can
be linked to specific models of physics beyond the Standard Model. Finally, we
illustrate how the LHC era could culminate in a detailed understanding of the
underlying principles of TeV-scale physics.
