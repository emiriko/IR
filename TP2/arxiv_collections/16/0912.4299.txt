The discovery of some baryon-antibaryon resonances has led us to consider
3q~3\bar{q} systems as possible candidates. We predict their spectrum in the
framework of a constituent model, where the chromo-magnetic interaction plays
the main role. The relevant parameters are fixed by the present knowledge on
tetraquarks. The emerging scenario complies well with experiment. Besides the
description of the baryon-antibaryon resonances, we find evidence for new
tetraquark states, namely the a0(Y) in the hidden strangeness sector and, in
the cs\bar{c}\bar{s} sector, the Y(4140) and the X(4350). A detailed account of
the spectra and the decay channels is provided for future comparisons with
data.
