The start of the physics program at the LHC has added great impetus in the
development of powerful theoretical tools to meet the many challenges that this
collider brings. The production of jets and weak vector bosons is at the center
of most analyses, from machine performance to new physics searches. In this
talk we review some recent advances in the study of jets, in the computation of
quantum corrections to processes with large jet multiplicity and their impact
in W/Z+jets and W/Z+b-jets production at the Tevatron and the LHC.
