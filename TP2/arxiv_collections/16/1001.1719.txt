This paper is devoted to the study of the uniformization of the moduli space
of pairs (X, E) consisting of an algebraic curve and a vector bundle on it. For
this goal, we study the moduli space of 5-tuples (X, x, z, E, \phi), consisting
of a genus g curve, a point on it, a local coordinate, a rank n degree d vector
bundle and a formal trivialization of the bundle at the point. A group acting
on it is found and it is shown that it acts (infinitesimally) transitively on
this moduli space and an identity between central extensions of its Lie algebra
is proved. Furthermore, a geometric explanation for that identity is offered.
