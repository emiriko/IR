A formulation of the one-way speed of light in three-dimensional Euclidean
space is derived by a constructive approach. This formulation is consistent
with the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment in that the harmonic mean of
the outward and return speeds is equal to c, the standard value for the speed
of electromagnetic radiation in vacuum. It is also shown that a shift in
synchronization, proportional to the distance along the line of motion, renders
this speed a constant along all directions.
