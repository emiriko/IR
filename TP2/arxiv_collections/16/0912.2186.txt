We report on the first successful QCD multigrid algorithm which demonstrates
constant convergence rates independent of quark mass and lattice volume for the
Wilson Dirac operator. The new ingredient is the adaptive method for
constructing the near null space on which the coarse grid multigrid Dirac
operator acts. In addition we speculate on future prospects for extending this
algorithm to the Domain Wall and Staggered discretizations, its exceptional
suitability for high performance GPU code and its potential impact on
simulations at the physical pion mass.
