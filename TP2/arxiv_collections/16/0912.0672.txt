Two-loop Feynman integrals of the massive $\phi^4_d$ field theory are
explicitly obtained for generic space dimensions $d$. Corresponding
renormalization-group functions are expressed in a compact form in terms of
Gauss hypergeometric functions. A number of interesting and useful relations is
given for these integrals as well as for several special mathematical functions
and constants.
