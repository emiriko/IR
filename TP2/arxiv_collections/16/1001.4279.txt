This conference summary and outlook provides a personal overview of the
topics and themes of the August 2009 Dresden meeting on quantum criticality and
novel phases. The dichotomy between the local moment and the itinerant views of
magnetism is revisited and refreshed in new materials, new probes and new
theoretical ideas. New universality and apparent zero temperature phases of
matter move us beyond the old ideas of quantum criticality. This is accompanied
by alternative pairing interactions and as yet unidentified phases developing
in the vicinity of quantum critical points. In discussing novel order, the
magnetic analogues of superconductivity are considered as candidate states for
the hidden order that sometimes develops in the vicinity of quantum critical
points in metallic systems. These analogues can be thought of as "pairing" in
the particle-hole channel and are tabulated. This analogy is used to outline a
framework to study the relation between ferromagnetic fluctuations and the
propensity of a metal to nematic type phases which at weak coupling correspond
to Pomeranchuk instabilities. This question can be related to the fundamental
relations of Fermi liquid theory.
