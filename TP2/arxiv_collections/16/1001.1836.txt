Internet and expert systems have offered new ways of sharing and distributing
knowledge, but there is a lack of researches in the area of web based expert
systems. This paper introduces a development of a web-based expert system for
the regulations of civil service in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia named as RCSES.
It is the first time to develop such system (application of civil service
regulations) as well the development of it using web based approach. The
proposed system considers 17 regulations of the civil service system. The
different phases of developing the RCSES system are presented, as knowledge
acquiring and selection, ontology and knowledge representations using XML
format. XML Rule-based knowledge sources and the inference mechanisms were
implemented using ASP.net technique. An interactive tool for entering the
ontology and knowledge base, and the inferencing was built. It gives the
ability to use, modify, update, and extend the existing knowledge base in an
easy way. The knowledge was validated by experts in the domain of civil service
regulations, and the proposed RCSES was tested, verified, and validated by
different technical users and the developers staff. The RCSES system is
compared with other related web based expert systems, that comparison proved
the goodness, usability, and high performance of RCSES.
