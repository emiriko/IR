Contributions from high-order (non-perturbative triple and quadruple) cluster
amplitudes to the dissociation energies, equilibrium distances, and vibrational
constants for the ground states of van der Waals dimers Hg$_2$ and Cn$_2$ are
evaluated. The incorporation of these contributions into the results of
large-scale CCSD(T) calculations leads to non-negligible corrections of the
computed molecular constants for Hg$_2$ (6% for the dissociation energy), and
enables one to attain perfect agreement with the experimental values.
