Viruses utilize various means to circumvent the immune detection in the
biological systems. Several mathematical models have been investigated for the
description of viral dynamics in the biological system of human and various
other species. One common strategy for evasion and recognition of viruses is,
through acquaintance in the systems by means of search engines. In this
perspective a search tool have been developed to provide a wider comprehension
about the structure and other details on viruses which have been narrated in
this paper. This provides an adequate knowledge in evolution and building of
viruses, its functions through information extraction from various websites.
Apart from this, tool aim to automate the activities associated with it in a
self-maintainable, self-sustainable, proactive one which has been evaluated
through analysis made and have been discussed in this paper.
