We report on unusual magnetic properties observed in the nanofluid
room-temperature ferromagnetic graphite (with an average particle size of
l=10nm). More precisely, the measured magnetization exhibits a low-temperature
anomaly (attributed to manifestation of finite size effects below the quantum
temperature) as well as pronounced temperature oscillations above T=50K
(attributed to manifestation of the hard-sphere type pair correlations between
ferromagnetic particles in the nanofluid).
