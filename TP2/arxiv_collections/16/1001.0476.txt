G-Pisa is an experiment investigating the possibility to operate a high
sensitivity laser gyroscope with area less than $1 \rm m^2$ for improving the
performances of the mirrors suspensions of the gravitational wave antenna
Virgo. The experimental set-up consists in a He-Ne ring laser with a 4 mirrors
square cavity. The laser is pumped by an RF discharge where the RF oscillator
includes the laser plasma in order to reach a better stability. The contrast of
the Sagnac fringes is typically above 50% and a stable regime has been reached
with the laser operating both single mode or multimode. The effect of hydrogen
contamination on the laser was also checked. A low-frequency sensitivity, below
$1 \rm Hz$, in the range of $10^{-8} \rm {(rad / s)/ \sqrt{Hz}}$ has been
measured.
