We present results of our pulsar population synthesis of normal pulsars from
the Galactic disk using our previously developed Monte-Carlo code. From our
studies of observed radio pulsars that have clearly identifiable core and cone
components, in which we fit the polarization sweep as well as the pulse
profiles in order to constrain the viewing geometry, we develop a model
describing the luminosity and ratio of radio core-to-cone peak fluxes. In this
model, short period pulsars are more cone-dominated. We explore models of
neutron star evolution with and without magnetic field decay, and with
different initial period distributions. We present preliminary results
including simulated population statistics that are compared with the observed
radio pulsar population. The evolved neutron star populations resulting from
this simulation can be used to model distributions of gamma-ray pulsars for
comparison to Fermi results.
