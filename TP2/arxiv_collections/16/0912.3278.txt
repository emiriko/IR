We propose a simple nanostructured pinning array geometry where a rich
variety of complex vortex shear banding phenomena can be realized. A single row
of pinning sites is removed from a square pinning array. Shear banding effects
arise when vortex motion in the pin-free channel nucleates motion of vortices
in the surrounding pinned regions, creating discrete steps in the vortex
velocity profile away from the channel. Near the global depinning transition,
the width of the band of moving vortices undergoes oscillations or fluctuations
that can span the entire system. We use simulations to show that these effects
should be observable in the transport properties of the system. Similar large
oscillations and shear banding effects are known to occur for sheared complex
fluids in which different dynamical phases coexist.
