A comprehensive analysis of tree-level weak interaction processes at low
energy is presented for the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with SU(2)_L * U(1)_Y
bulk gauge symmetry and brane-localized Higgs sector. The complete form of the
effective weak Hamiltonian is obtained, which results from tree-level exchange
of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gluons and photons, the W^+- and Z^0 bosons and their KK
excitations, as well as the Higgs boson. Exact expressions are used for the
bulk profiles of the various fields, and for the exchange of entire towers of
KK gauge-boson states. A detailed phenomenological analysis is performed for
potential new-physics effects in neutral-meson mixing and in rare decays of
kaons and B mesons, including both inclusive and exclusive processes. We find
that while the predictions for \Delta(F)=2 observables are rather
model-independent, \Delta(F)=1 processes depend sensitively on the exact
realizations of the electroweak gauge and the fermionic sector. In this
context, we emphasize that the localization of the right-handed top quark in
the extra dimension plays a crucial role in the case of rare Z^0-mediated
decays, as it determines the relative size of left- to right-handed couplings.
We also extend earlier studies of quark flavor-changing neutral currents by
examining observables which up to now attracted little attention. These include
D-D(bar) mixing, B-->\tau\nu, B-->X_s (K^*) l^+ l^-, \epsilon_K'/\epsilon_K,
B-->\pi K, B^0-->\phi K_S, B^0-->\eta' K_S, and B^+-->\pi^+\pi^0.
