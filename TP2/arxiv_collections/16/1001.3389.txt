An essential requirement for the future of quantum communication is the
capability to create undistinguishable photons at distant locations. The main
challenge is to control the various sources of timing jitter in order to
conserve temporal undistinguishability. We report on a system that enables a
large tolerance against such jitter by using synchronized sources of photons
with coherence lengths on the order of centimeters.
