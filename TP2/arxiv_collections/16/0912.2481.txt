We microscopically study the effect of the magnetic field (Zeeman splitting)
on the superconducting state in a model for quasi-one-dimensional organic
superconductors (TMTSF)$_{2}X$. We investigate the competition between spin
singlet and spin triplet pairings and the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(FFLO) state by random phase approximation.
While we studied the competition by comparison with the eigenvalue of the gap
equation at a fixed temperature in our previous study (Phys. Rev. Lett.
\textbf{102} (2009) 016403), here we obtain both the $T_c$ for each pairing
state and a phase diagram in the $T$(temperature)-$h_z$(field)-$V_y$(strength
of the charge fluctuation) space. The phase diagram shows that consecutive
transitions from singlet pairing to the FFLO state and further to $S_z=1$
triplet pairing can occur upon increasing the magnetic field when $2k_{F}$
charge fluctuations coexist with $2k_{F}$ spin fluctuations. In the FFLO state,
the singlet d-wave and $S_{z}=0$ triplet $f$-wave components are strongly mixed
especially when the charge fluctuations are strong.
