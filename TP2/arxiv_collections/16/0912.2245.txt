This paper is a sequel of "Solvable symmetric black hole in anti de Sitter
spaces" [arXiv:math.DG/0510442]. In the latter, we described the BTZ black hole
in every dimension by defining the singularity as the closed orbits of the
Iwasawa subgroup of SO(2,n). In this article, we study the horizon of the black
hole and we show that it is expressed as lateral classes of one point of the
space. The computation is given in the four-dimensional case, but it makes no
doubt that it can be generalized to any dimension.
  The main idea is to define an "inclusion map" from AdS_3 into AdS_4 and to
show that all the relevant structure pass trough the inclusion. We prove, for
example, that the inclusion of the three dimensional horizon into AdS_4 belongs
to the four dimensional horizon. Then we deduce the expression of the horizon
in AdS_4.
