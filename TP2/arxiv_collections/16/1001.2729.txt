This is intended to appear as the introduction to "The CBM Physics Book:
compressed baryonic matter in laboratory experiments" (ed. B. Friman, C.
H\"ohne, S. Leupold, J. Knoll, J. Randrup, R. Rapp, P. Senger), to be published
by Springer. At the end there is a new proposal for numerically tractable
models of interacting many-body systems.
