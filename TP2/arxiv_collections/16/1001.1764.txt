We combine new ASTE/AzTEC 1.1 mm maps of the galaxy pair NGC 1512/1510 with
archival Spitzer IRAC and MIPS images covering the wavelength range 3.6--160 um
from the SINGS project to derive accurate dust masses in each galaxy, and in
sub--galactic regions in NGC 1512. The two galaxies form a pair consisting of a
large, high--metallicity spiral (NGC 1512) and a low metallicity, blue compact
dwarf (NGC 1510). The derived total dust masses are (2.4+/-0.6) 10^7 Msun and
(1.7+/-3.6) 10^5 Msun for NGC 1512 and NGC 1510, respectively. The derived
ratio of dust mass to H I gas mass for the galaxy pair (0.0034) is much lower
than expected, while regions within NGC 1512, specifically the central region
and the arms, do not show such unusually low ratios; furthermore, the
dust--to--gas ratio is within expectations for NGC 1510. These results suggest
that a fraction of the H I included in the determination of the M_d/M_HI ratio
of the NGC 1512/1510 pair is not associated with the star forming disks/regions
of either galaxy. We also perform simple two--temperature (warm + cold)
modified--blackbody fits to the far--infrared/mm data. The warm dust
temperature of the low--metallicity NGC 1510 (~36 K) is substantially higher
than that of the high--metallicity NGC 1512 (~24 K). In both galaxies, a
substantial fraction (>93%) of the total dust mass is in a cool dust component,
with temperatures 14--16 K for NGC 1512 and 15--24 K for NGC 1510. In contrast,
the warm dust in the arms and central regions of NGC 1512 represents a much
larger fraction of the total dust content, in agreement with the fact that all
three regions have higher specific star formation rates than the average in the
galaxy.
