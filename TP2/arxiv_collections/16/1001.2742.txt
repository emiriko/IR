After a brief introduction to Deep Inelastic Scattering in the Bjorken limit
and in the Regge Limit we discuss the operator product expansion in terms of
non local string operator and in terms of Wilson lines. We will show how the
high-energy behavior of amplitudes in gauge theories can be reformulated in
terms of the evolution of Wilson-line operators. In the leading order this
evolution is governed by the non-linear Balitsky- Kovchegov (BK) equation. In
order to see if this equation is relevant for existing or future deep inelastic
scattering (DIS) accelerators (like Electron Ion Collider (EIC) or Large Hadron
electron Collider (LHeC)) one needs to know the next-to-leading order (NLO)
corrections. In addition, the NLO corrections define the scale of the
running-coupling constant in the BK equation and therefore determine the
magnitude of the leading-order cross sections. In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD),
the next-to-leading order BK equation has both conformal and non-conformal
parts. The NLO kernel for the composite operators resolves in a sum of the
conformal part and the running-coupling part. The QCD and ${\cal N}=4$ SYM
kernel of the BK equation is presented.
