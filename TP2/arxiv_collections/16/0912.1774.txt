We present an alternative method to estimate the numerical viscosity in
simulations of astrophysical objects, which is based in the damping of fluid
oscillations. We apply the method to general relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations using a spherical coordinates. We perform 1D-spherical and 2D-
axisymmetric simulations of radial oscillations in spherical systems. We
calibrate first the method with simulations with added bulk viscosity and study
the differences between different numerical schemes. We apply the method to
radial oscillations of neutron stars and we conclude that the main source of
numerical viscosity in this case is the surface of the star. We expect that
this method could be useful to compute the resolution requirements and
limitations of the numerical simulations in different astrophysical scenarios
in the future.
