We examine the internal structure of the heavy fermion condensate, showing
that it necessarily involves a d-wave pair of quasiparticles on neighboring
lattice sites, condensed in tandem with a composite pair of electrons bound to
a local moment, within a single unit cell. These two components draw upon the
antiferromagnetic and Kondo interactions to cooperatively enhance the
superconducting transition temperature. The tandem condensate is
electrostatically active, with a small electric quadrupole moment coupling to
strain that is predicted to lead to a superconducting shift in the NQR
frequency.
