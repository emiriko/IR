Models of minimal lepton flavor violation where the seesaw scale is higher
than the relevant flavor scale predict that all lepton flavor violation is
proportional to the charged lepton Yukawa matrix. If extra vector-like leptons
are within the reach of the LHC, it will be possible to test the resulting
predictions in ATLAS/CMS.
