We consider a stochastic differential equations which is driven by a Levy
process. It turns out that the solution process is a Feller process if the
coefficient of the SDE is bounded. Using a probabilistic formula we calculate
the symbol, which appears in the Fourier representation of the generator,
explicitely. Using the symbol we introduce indices which are generalizations of
the well known Blumenthal-Getoor index. These indices are then used to obtain
some fine properties of the solution process.
