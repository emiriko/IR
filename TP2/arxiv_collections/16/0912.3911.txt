We present the first description of mode trapping for sdO models. Mode
trapping of gravity modes caused by the He/H chemical transition is found for a
particular model, providing a selection effect for high radial order trapped
modes. Low- and intermediate-radial order {\em p}-modes (mixed modes with a
majority of nodes in the P-mode region) are found to be trapped by the C-O/He
transition, but with no significant effects on the driving. This region seems
to have also a subtle effect on the trapping of low radial order {\em g}-modes
(mixed modes with a majority of nodes in the G-mode region), but again with no
effect on the driving. We found that for mode trapping to have an influence on
the driving of sdO modes (1) the mode should be trapped in a way that the
amplitude of the eigenfunctions is lower in a damping region and (2) in this
damping region significant energy interchange has to be produced.
