This paper presents the characterization of the optical range of the ALHAMBRA
photometric system, a 20 contiguous, equal-width, medium-band CCD system with
wavelength coverage from 3500A to 9700A. The photometric description of the
system is done by presenting the full response curve as a product of the
filters, CCD and atmospheric transmission curves, and using some first and
second order moments of this response function. We also introduce the set of
standard stars that defines the system, formed by 31 classic spectrophotometric
standard stars which have been used in the calibration of other known
photometric systems, and 288 stars, flux calibrated homogeneously, from the
Next Generation Spectral Library (NGSL). Based on the NGSL, we determine the
transformation equations between Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ugriz
photometry and the ALHAMBRA photometric system, in order to establish some
relations between both systems. Finally we develop and discuss a strategy to
calculate the photometric zero points of the different pointings in the
ALHAMBRA project.
