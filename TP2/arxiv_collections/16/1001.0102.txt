In order to study an intrinsic chemical potential jump between the hole- and
electron-doped high-Tc superconductors, we have performed core-level X-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of Y0.38La0.62Ba1.74La0.26Cu3Oy
(YLBLCO), into which one can dope both holes and electrons with maintaining the
same crystal structure. Unlike the case between the hole-doped system
La_2-xSrxCuO4 and the electron-doped system Nd_2-xCexCuO4, we have estimated
the true chemical potential jump between the hole- and electron-doped YLBLCO to
be ~0.8 eV, which is much smaller than the optical gaps of 1.4-1.7 eV reported
for the parent insulating compounds. We attribute the reduced jump to the
indirect nature of the charge-excitation gap as well as to the polaronic nature
of the doped carriers.
