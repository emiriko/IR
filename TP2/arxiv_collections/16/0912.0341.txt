We assign a measure to an upper semicontinuous function which is subharmonic
with respect to the mean curvature operator, so that it agrees with the mean
curvature of its graph when the function is smooth. We prove that the measure
is weakly continuous with respect to almost everywhere convergence. We also
establish a sharp Harnack inequality for the minimal surface equation, which is
crucial for our proof of the weak continuity. As an application we prove the
existence of weak solutions to the corresponding Dirichlet problem when the
inhomogeneous term is a measure.
