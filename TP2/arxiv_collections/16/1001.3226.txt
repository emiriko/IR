We analyze the geometry of the tower of Lubin-Tate deformation spaces, which
parametrize deformations of a one-dimensional formal module of height h
together with level structure. According to the conjecture of Deligne-Carayol,
these spaces realize the local Langlands correspondence in their l-adic
cohomology. This conjecture is now a theorem, but currently there is no purely
local proof. Working in the equal characteristic case, we find a family of
affinoids in the Lubin-Tate tower with good reduction equal to a rather curious
nonsingular hypersurface, whose equation we present explicitly. Granting a
conjecture on the L-functions of this hypersurface, we find a link between the
conjecture of Deligne-Carayol and the theory of Bushnell-Kutzko types, at least
for certain class of wildly ramified supercuspidal representations of small
conductor.
