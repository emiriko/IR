We present a detailed comparison of three different methods designed to
tackle nonequilibrium quantum transport, namely the functional renormalization
group (fRG), the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG),
and the iterative summation of real-time path integrals (ISPI). For the
nonequilibrium single-impurity Anderson model (including a Zeeman term at the
impurity site), we demonstrate that the three methods are in quantitative
agreement over a wide range of parameters at the particle-hole symmetric point
as well as in the mixed-valence regime. We further compare these techniques
with two quantum Monte Carlo approaches and the time-dependent numerical
renormalization group method.
