We have performed 3D radiation MHD simulations extending from the convection
zone to the corona covering a box 16 Mm$^3$ at 32 km spatial resolution. The
simulations show very fine structure in the chromosphere with acoustic shocks
interacting with the magnetic field. Magnetic flux concentrations have a
temperature lower than the surroundings in the photosphere but higher in the
low chromosphere. The heating is there mostly through ohmic dissipation
preferentially at the edges of the flux concentrations. The magnetic field is
often wound up around the flux concentrations. When acoustic waves travel up
along the field this topology leads to swirling motions seen in chromospheric
diagnostic lines such as the calcium infrared triplet.
