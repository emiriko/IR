The reaction rates of the key stellar reaction of
$^{14}$O($\alpha$,p)$^{17}$F have been reexamined. The previous conclusion, the
6.15-MeV state ($J^{\pi}$=1$^-$) dominating this reaction rate, has been
overthrown by a careful reanalysis of the previous experimental data [J.
G\'{o}mez del Campo {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86}, 43 (2001)].
According to the present $R$-matrix analysis, the previous 1$^-$ assignment for
the 6.15-MeV state is definitely wrong. Most probably, the 6.286-MeV state is
the 1$^-$ state and the 6.15-MeV state is a 3$^-$ one, and hence the resonance
at $E_x$=6.286 MeV ($J^{\pi}$=1$^-$) dominates the reaction rates in the
temperature region of astrophysical interests. The newly calculated reaction
rates for the $^{14}$O($\alpha$,p)$^{17}$F reaction are quite different from
the previous ones, for instance, it's only about 1/6 of the previous value
around 0.4 GK, while it's about 2.4 times larger than the previous value around
2 GK. The astrophysical implications have been discussed based on the present
conclusions.
