Aims: The precise determination of the stellar effective temperature of solar
type stars is of extreme importance for Astrophysics. We present an effective
temperature calibration for FGK dwarf stars using line equivalent width ratios
of spectral absorption lines. Method: The ratios of spectral line equivalent
width can be very sensitive to effective temperature variations for a well
chosen combination of lines. We use the automatic code ARES to measure the
equivalent width of several spectral lines, and use these to calibrate with the
precise effective temperature derived from spectroscopy presented in a previous
work. Results: We present the effective temperature calibration for 433 line
equivalent width ratios built from 171 spectral lines of different chemical
elements. We also make available a free code that uses this calibration and
that can be used as an extension to ARES for the fast and automatic estimation
of spectroscopic effective temperature of solar type stars.
