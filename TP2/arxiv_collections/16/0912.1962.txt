The spin dynamics of the geometrically frustrated triangular antiferromagnet
multiferroic CuCrO2 have been mapped out using inelastic neutron scattering.
The relevant spin Hamiltonian parameters modelling the incommensurate modulated
helicoid have been determined, and correspond to antiferromagnetic nearest and
next-nearest neighbour interactions in the ab plane, with a strong planar
anisotropy. The weakly dispersive excitation along c reflects the essentially
two-dimensional character of the magnetic interactions and according to
classical energy calculations it is weakly ferromagnetic. Our results clearly
point out the relevance of the balance between a ferromagnetic coupling between
adjacent planes and a weakly antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbour
interaction in stabilising the three-dimensional ferroelectric magnetic order
in CuCrO2. This novel insight on the interplay between magnetic interactions in
CuCrO2 should provide a useful basis in the design of new delafossite-based
multiferroic materials.
