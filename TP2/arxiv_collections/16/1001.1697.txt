We apply our recent results on orbital dynamics around a mass-varying central
body to the phenomenon of accretion of Dark Matter-assumed not
self-annihilating-on the Sun and the major bodies of the solar system due to
its motion throughout the Milky Way halo. We inspect its consequences on the
orbits of the planets and their satellites over timescales of the order of the
age of the solar system. It turns out that a solar Dark Matter accretion rate
of \approx 10^-12 yr^-1, inferred from the upper limit \Delta M/M= 0.02-0.05 on
the Sun's Dark Matter content, assumed somehow accumulated during last 4.5 Gyr,
would have displaced the planets faraway by about 10^-2-10^1 au 4.5 Gyr ago.
Another consequence is that the semimajor axis of the Earth's orbit,
approximately equal to the Astronomical Unit, would undergo a secular increase
of 0.02-0.05 m yr^-1, in agreement with the latest observational determinations
of the Astronomical Unit secular increase of 0.07 +/- 0.02 m yr^-1 and 0.05 m
yr^-1. By assuming that the Sun will continue to accrete Dark Matter in the
next billions year at the same rate as in the past, the orbits of its planets
will shrink by about 10^-1-10^1 au (\approx 0.2-0.5 au for the Earth), with
consequences for their fate, especially of the inner planets. On the other
hand, lunar and planetary ephemerides set upper bounds on the secular variation
of the Sun's gravitational parameter GM which are one one order of magnitude
smaller than 10^-12 yr^-1. Dark Matter accretion on planets has, instead, less
relevant consequences for their satellites. Indeed, 4.5 Gyr ago their orbits
would have been just 10^-2-10^1 km wider than now. (Abridged)
