Dissipative effects in electromagnetism on macroscopic scales are examined by
coarse graining the microscopic Maxwell equations with respect to time. We
illustrate a procedure to derive the dissipative effects on the macroscopic
scale by using a Green-Kubo type expression in terms of the microscopic
fluctuations and the correlations between them. The resulting macroscopic
Maxwell equations are formulated within the General Equation for the
Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling (GENERIC) framework,
accounting also for inhomogeneous temperature.
