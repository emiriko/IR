Using particle-in-cell simulations and kinetic theory, we explore the
current-driven turbulence and associated electron heating in the dissipation
region during 3D magnetic reconnection with a guide field. At late time the
turbulence is dominated by the Buneman and lower hybrid instabilities. Both
produce electron holes that co-exist but have very different propagation
speeds. The associated scattering of electrons by the holes enhances electron
heating in the dissipation region.
