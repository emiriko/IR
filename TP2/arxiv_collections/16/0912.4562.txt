We estimate the rates of lepton flavor violating decays of the vector mesons
$\rho, \omega, \phi \to e \mu$. The theoretical tools are based on an effective
Lagrangian approach without referring to any specific realization of the
physics beyond the standard model responsible for lepton flavor violation
(\Lfv). The effective lepton-vector meson couplings are extracted from the
existing experimental bounds on the nuclear $\mu^--e^-$ conversion. In
particular, we derive an upper limit for the \Lfv branching ratio ${\rm
Br}(\phi \to e \mu) \leq1.3 \times 10^{-21}$ which is much more stringent than
the recent experimental result ${\rm Br}(\phi \to e \mu) < 2 \times 10^{-6}$
presented by the SND Collaboration. Very tiny limits on \Lfv decays of vector
mesons derived in this letter make direct experimental observation of these
processes unrealistic.
