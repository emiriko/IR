In this work single capacitor paradox (a variation of the remarkable two
capacitor paradox) is considered in a new, quantum discrete form. Simply
speaking we consider well-known usual, photoelectric effect experimental
device, i.e. photo electric cell, where cathode and anode are equivalently
charged but non-connected. It, obviously, represents a capacitor that
initially, i.e. before action of the photons with individual energy equivalent
to work function, holds corresponding energy of the electrical fields between
cathode and anode. Further, we direct quantum discretely photons, one by one,
toward cathode where according to photo-electrical effect electrons discretely,
one by one, will be emitted and directed toward anode. It causes discrete
discharge of the cell, i.e. capacitor and discrete decrease of the electrical
field. Finally, total discharge of the cell, i.e. capacitor, and total
disappearance of the electrical field and its energy will occur. Given,
seemingly paradoxical, capacitor total energy loss can be simply explained
without any dissipative effects (Joule heating or electromagnetic waves
emission can be neglected as high order small corrections) by work done by the
electrical field by movement of the electrons from cathode to anode.
(Remarkable two capacitors paradox can be, obviously, formulated and explained
in the completely analogous way.)
