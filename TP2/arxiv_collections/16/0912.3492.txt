Using first-principles density functional theory, we investigate the
interfacial magnetoelectric coupling in a tri-component superlattice composed
of a ferromagnetic metal (FM), ferroelectric (FE), and normal metal (NM). Using
Fe/FE/Pt as a model system, we show that a net and cumulative interfacial
magnetization is induced in the FM metal near the FM/FE interface. A carefully
analysis of the magnetic moments in Fe reveals that the interfacial
magnetization is a consequence of a complex interplay of interfacial charge
transfer, chemical bonding, and spin dependent electrostatic screening. The
last effect is linear in the FE polarization, is switchable upon its reversal,
and yields a substantial interfacial magnetoelectric coupling.
