In this paper, we study mixing and large decoherence in continuous-time
quantum walks on one dimensional regular networks, which are constructed by
connecting each node to its $2l$ nearest neighbors($l$ on either side). In our
investigation, the nodes of network are represented by a set of identical
tunnel-coupled quantum dots in which decoherence is induced by continuous
monitoring of each quantum dot with nearby point contact detector. To formulate
the decoherent CTQWs, we use Gurvitz model and then calculate probability
distribution and the bounds of instantaneous and average mixing times. We show
that the mixing times are linearly proportional to the decoherence rate.
Moreover, adding links to cycle network, in appearance of large decoherence,
decreases the mixing times.
