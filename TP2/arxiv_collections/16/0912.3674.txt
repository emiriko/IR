We present an effective dipolar-spin model based on the strong coupling
analysis, which may explain the possible origin of the "spin liquid Mott
insulator". The issue is related to the dimer Mott insulator reminiscent of the
organic triangular lattice system, $\kappa$-ET$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, whose gapless
spin liquid state had been discussed in the context of geometrical frustration
of exchange coupling, $J$, between spins on dimer orbitals. It turns out that
another degrees of freedom within the insulator, {\it quantum electric-dipoles}
on dimers, interacts with each other by the Coulomb interaction and brings
about a significant suppression of $J$ through the dipolar-spin coupling.
