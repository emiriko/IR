Travelling wave in a helical wave guide is considered for electron
acceleration. A first determination of the travelling wave modes using a
partial wave expansion (PWE) and a point matching method is presented. It gives
a rapid solution for moderate deformation of the guide relative to a straight
cylinder. Strong deformations will give higher accelerating gradient but the
PWE diverges. Two methods overcoming this difficulties are suggested.
