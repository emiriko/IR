We discuss the use of information geometry in black hole physics and present
the outcomes. The type of information geometry we utilize in this approach is
the thermodynamic (Ruppeiner) geometry defined on the state space of a given
thermodynamic system in equilibrium. The Ruppeiner geometry can be used to
analyze stability and critical phenomena in black hole physics with results
consistent with those from the Poincare stability analysis for black holes and
black rings. Furthermore other physical phenomena are well encoded in the
Ruppeiner metric such as the sign of specific heat and the extremality of the
solutions. The black hole families we discuss in particular in this manuscript
are the Myers-Perry black holes.
