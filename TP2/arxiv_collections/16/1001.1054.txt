We calculate the $p_T$ distributions of jet conversion photons from {\em
Quark Gluon Plasma} with pre-equilibrium momentum-space anisotropy. A
phenomenological model has been used for the time evolution of hard momentum
scale $p_{\rm hard}(\tau)$ and anisotropy parameter $\xi(\tau)$. As a result of
pre-equilibrium momentum-space anisotropy, we find significant modification of
the jet conversion photon $p_T$ distribution. For example, with {\em fixed
initial condition} (FIC) pre-equilibrium anisotropy, we predict significant
enhancement of the jet-photon $p_T$ distribution in the entire region, whereas
for pre-equilibrium anisotropy with {\em fixed final multiplicity} (FFM),
suppression of the jet conversion photons $p_T$ distribution is observed. The
results with FFM (as it is the most realistic situation) have been compared
with high $p_T$ PHENIX photon data. It is found that the data is reproduced
well if the isotropization time lies within $1.5$ fm/c.
