Very high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-rays have been detected from a wide
range of astronomical objects, such as SNRs, pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae,
AGN, gamma-ray binaries, molecular clouds, and possibly star-forming regions as
well. At lower energies, sources detected using Large Area Telescope (LAT)
aboard Fermi provide a rich set of data which can be used to study the behavior
of cosmic accelerators in the GeV to TeV energy bands. In particular, the
improved angular resolution in both bands compared to previous instruments
significantly reduces source confusion and facilitates the identification of
associated counterparts at lower energies. In this talk, a comprehensive search
for VHE gamma-ray sources which are spatially coincident with Galactic
Fermi/LAT bright sources is performed, and the GeV to TeV spectra of selected
coincident sources are shown. It is found that LAT bright GeV sources are
correlated to TeV sources, in contrast with previous studies using EGRET data.
