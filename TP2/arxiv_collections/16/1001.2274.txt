Network capacity region of multi-queue multi-server queueing system with
random ON-OFF connectivities and stationary arrival processes is derived in
this paper. Specifically, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
stability of the system are derived under general arrival processes with finite
first and second moments. In the case of stationary arrival processes, these
conditions establish the network capacity region of the system. It is also
shown that AS/LCQ (Any Server/Longest Connected Queue) policy stabilizes the
system when it is stabilizable. Furthermore, an upper bound for the average
queue occupancy is derived for this policy.
