Electronic instabilities at the crossing of the Fermi energy with a Van Hove
singularity in the density of states often lead to new phases of matter such as
superconductivity, magnetism or density waves. However, in most materials this
condition is difficult to control. In the case of single-layer graphene, the
singularity is too far from the Fermi energy and hence difficult to reach with
standard doping and gating techniques. Here we report the observation of
low-energy Van Hove singularities in twisted graphene layers seen as two
pronounced peaks in the density of states measured by scanning tunneling
spectroscopy. We demonstrate that a rotation between stacked graphene layers
can generate Van Hove singularities, which can be brought arbitrarily close to
the Fermi energy by varying the angle of rotation. This opens intriguing
prospects for Van Hove singularity engineering of electronic phases.
