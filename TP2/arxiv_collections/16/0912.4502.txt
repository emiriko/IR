In [2] it was proven that the Cass algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm
for constructing level<=2 networks from clusters. Here we demonstrate, for each
k>=0, a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing level-k phylogenetic
networks from clusters. Unlike Cass the algorithm scheme given here is only of
theoretical interest. It does, however, strengthen the hope that efficient
polynomial-time algorithms (and perhaps fixed parameter tractable algorithms)
exist for this problem.
