We present spatial and dynamic information on the s=1/2 distorted kagome
antiferromagnet volborthite, Cu3V2O7(OD)2.2D2O, obtained by polarized and
inelastic neutron scattering. The instantaneous structure factor, S(Q), is
dominated by nearest neighbor pair correlations, with short range order at wave
vectors Q1=0.65(3) {\AA}^-1 and Q2=1.15(5) {\AA}^-1 emerging below 5 K. The
excitation spectrum, S(Q,{\omega}), reveals two steep branches dispersing from
Q1 and Q2, and a flat mode at {\omega}=5.0(2) meV. The results allow us to
identify the cross-over at T*=1 K in 51V NMR and specific heat measurements as
the build-up of correlations at Q_1. We compare our data to theoretical models
proposed for volborthite, and demonstrate that the excitation spectrum can be
explained by spin-wave-like excitations with anisotropic exchange parameters,
as also suggested by recent local density calculations.
