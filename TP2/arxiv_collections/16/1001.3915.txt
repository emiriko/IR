Graphene is considered to be a promising candidate for future
nano-electronics due to its exceptional electronic properties. Unfortunately,
the graphene field-effect-transistors (FETs) cannot be turned off effectively
due to the absence of a bandgap, leading to an on/off current ratio typically
around 5 in top-gated graphene FETs. On the other hand, theoretical
investigations and optical measurements suggest that a bandgap up to a few
hundred meV can be created by the perpendicular E-field in bi-layer graphenes.
Although previous carrier transport measurements in bi-layer graphene
transistors did indicate a gate-induced insulating state at temperature below 1
Kelvin, the electrical (or transport) bandgap was estimated to be a few meV,
and the room temperature on/off current ratio in bi-layer graphene FETs remains
similar to those in single-layer graphene FETs. Here, for the first time, we
report an on/off current ratio of around 100 and 2000 at room temperature and
20 K, respectively in our dual-gate bi-layer graphene FETs. We also measured an
electrical bandgap of >130 and 80 meV at average electric displacements of 2.2
and 1.3 V/nm, respectively. This demonstration reveals the great potential of
bi-layer graphene in applications such as digital electronics,
pseudospintronics, terahertz technology, and infrared nanophotonics.
