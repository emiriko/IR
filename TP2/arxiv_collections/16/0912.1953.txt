I discuss and review recent studies of the signatures of activity in
brightest cluster galaxies. Mid-IR spectra appear to show indications of star
formation in a sample of 9 BCGs from de Messieres et al. (2009). Other
processes like cosmic ray heating and conduction may play a role. The incidence
of emission-line BCGs in X-ray selected clusters is higher than in
optically-selected clusters, and higher still in systems known to be cool
cores. We report early results of a UV and H-alpha survey of the BCGs in the
REXCESS sample, which reveals that this sample has an interestingly low number
of emission-line or UV excess systems. [Note added post facto: fainter
emission-line sources discovered this summer increasses the rate to 22%.]
