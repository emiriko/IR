The electronic and magnetic properties of graphane with H-vacancies are
investigated with the help of quantum-chemistry methods. The hybridization of
the edges is found to be absolutely crucial in defining the size of the
bandgap, which is increased from 3.04 eV to 7.51 eV when the hybridization is
changed from the sp^2 to the sp^3 type. The H-vacancy defects also influence
the size of the gap depending on the number of defects and their distribution
between the two sides of the graphane plane. Further, the H-vacancy defects
induced on one side of the graphane plane and placed on the neighboring carbon
atoms are found to be the source of ferromagnetism which is distinguished by
the high stability of the state with a large spin number in comparison to that
of the singlet state and is expected to persist even at room temperatures.
However, the ferromagnetic ordering of the spins is obtained to be limited by
the concentration of H-vacancy defects and ordering would be preserved if
number of defects do not exceed eight.
