We report that 30-inch scale multiple roll-to-roll transfer and wet chemical
doping considerably enhance the electrical properties of the graphene films
grown on roll-type Cu substrates by chemical vapor deposition. The resulting
graphene films shows a sheet resistance as low as ~30 Ohm/sq at ~90 %
transparency which is superior to commercial transparent electrodes such as
indium tin oxides (ITO). The monolayer of graphene shows sheet resistances as
low as ~125 Ohm/sq with 97.4% optical transmittance and half-integer quantum
Hall effect, indicating the high-quality of these graphene films. As a
practical application, we also fabricated a touch screen panel device based on
the graphene transparent electrodes, showing extraordinary mechanical and
electrical performances.
