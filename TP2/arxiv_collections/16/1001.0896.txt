Aims: We want to place stronger lower limits on the Cosmic Infrared
Background (CIB) brightness at 24, 70 and 160 um and measure the extragalactic
number counts at these wavelengths in an homogeneous way from various surveys.
  Methods: Using Spitzer legacy data over 53.6 deg^2 of various depths, we
build catalogs with the same extraction method at each wavelength. [...] Number
count uncertainties are estimated with a counts-in-cells moment method, in
order to take into account galaxy clustering. Furthermore, we use a stacking
analysis to estimate number counts of sources not detected at 70 and 160 um.
[...]
  Results: Number counts reach 35 muJy (resp. 3.5 mJy and 40 mJy) at 24 um
(resp. 70 and 160um). We reach deeper flux densities of 0.38 mJy at 70 and 3.1
at 160 um using a stacking analysis. [...]
  Conclusions: These counts are integrated to estimate new CIB firm lower
limits of 2.21-0.09+0.09 nW.m^-2.sr^-1 (resp. 5.2-0.4+0.4 and 9.0-1.1+1.1
nW.m^-2.sr^-1) at 24 um (resp. 70 and 160 um), and extrapolated to give new
estimates of the CIB due to galaxies of 2.78-0.16+0.18 nW.m^-2.sr^-1 (resp.
6.4-0.6+0.7 and 14.6-2.9+7.1 nW.m^-2.sr^-1). Products (PSF, counts, CIB
