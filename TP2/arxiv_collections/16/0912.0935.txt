Requiring all massless elementary fields to have conformal scaling symmetry
removes a conflict between gravitational theory and the quantum theory of
elementary particles and fields. Extending this postulate to the scalar field
of the Higgs model, dynamical breaking of both gauge and conformal symmetries
determines parameters for the interacting fields. In uniform isotropic geometry
a modified Friedmann cosmic evolution equation is derived with nonvanishing
cosmological constant. Parameters determined by numerical solution are
consistent with empirical data for redshifts $z\leq z_*=1090$, including
luminosity distances for observed type Ia supernovae and peak structure ratios
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The theory does not require dark
matter.
