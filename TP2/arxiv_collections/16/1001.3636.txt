Dark energy cosmology is considered in a modified Gauss-Bonnet model of
gravity with and without a scalar field. It is shown that these generalizations
of General Relativity endow it with a very rich cosmological structure: it may
naturally lead to an effective cosmological constant, quintessence or phantom
cosmic acceleration, with the possibility to describe the transition from a
decelerating to an accelerating phase explicitly. It is demonstrated here that
these modified GB and scalar-GB theories are perfectly viable as cosmological
models. They can describe the LambdaCDM cosmological era without any need for a
cosmological constant. Specific properties of these theories of gravity in
different particular cases, such as the de Sitter one, are studied.
