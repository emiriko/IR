Based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, we present a holographic description of
various C-odd exchanges in high energy baryon-baryon and baryon-antibaryon
scattering, and calculate their respective contributions to the difference in
the total cross sections. We predict that, due to the warp factor of AdS_5, the
total cross section in pp collisions is larger than in p\bar{p} collisions at
asymptotically high energies.
