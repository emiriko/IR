The data from the DISTO Collaboration on the exclusive pp -> p K+ Lambda
production acquired at T_p = 2.85 GeV have been re-analysed in order to search
for a deeply bound K- pp (= X) state, to be formed in the binary process pp ->
K+ X. The preliminary spectra of the DeltaM_{K+} missing-mass and of the M_{p
Lambda} invariant-mass show, for large transverse-momenta of protons and kaons,
a distinct broad peak with a mass M_X = 2265 +- 2 MeV/c^2 and a width Gamma_X =
118 +- 8 MeV/c^2.
