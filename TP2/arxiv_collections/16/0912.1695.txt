We investigate statistical properties of the passive scalar near boundaries
(walls) in random (turbulent) flows assuming weakness of its diffusion. Then at
advanced stages of the passive scalar mixing its unmixed residue is
concentrated in a narrow diffusive layer near the wall and its transport to
bulk goes through the peripheral region (laminar sublayer). We conducted
Lagrangian numerical simulations of the process for different space dimensions
$d$ and revealed structures responsible for the transport that are passive
scalar tongues pulled from the diffusive boundary layer to bulk. We
investigated statistical properties of the passive scalar and of the passive
scalar integrated along the wall. Moments of both objects demonstrate scaling
behavior outside the diffusive boundary layer. We propose an analytical scheme
for explanation scaling of the passive scalar, the obtained exponents agree
reasonably with numerics in 3d.
