The idea that possible configurations of a physical system can be represented
as points in a multidimensional configuration space ${\cal C}$ is explored. The
notion of spacetime, without ${\cal C}$, does not exist in this theory.
Spacetime is associated with the degrees of freedom of a chosen single particle
within a considered configuration, and is thus a subspace of ${\cal C}$. Finite
dimensional configuration spaces of point particles, and infinite dimensional
configuration spaces of branes are considered. Multidimensionality of a
configuration space has for a consequence the existence of extra interactions,
besides the 4D gravity, both at macroscopic and microscopic scales.
