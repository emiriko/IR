We investigate the dynamics of two tunnel-coupled two-dimensional degenerate
Bose gases. The reduced dimensionality of the clouds enables us to excite
specific angular momentum modes by tuning the coupling strength, thereby
creating striking patterns in the atom density profile. The extreme sensitivity
of the system to the coupling and initial phase difference results in a rich
variety of subsequent dynamics, including vortex production, complex
oscillations in relative atom number and chiral symmetry breaking due to
counter-rotation of the two clouds.
