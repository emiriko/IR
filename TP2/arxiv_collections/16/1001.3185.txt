The composite material, consisting of metallic particles Ag5Pb2O6 diluted in
insulating CuO matrix, has been investigated in a narrow concentration range
separating ballistic tunnel transport from hopping conductivity. The formation
of intergrain conducting bridges between metallic particles has been avoided by
a careful metallurgic treatment. Resistivity is indicated by temperature
dependence lnR~(T0/T)^1/2, and this dependence appeals an attention for
possible one dimensional conductivity which could be looked upon as a property
uniquely associated with an onset of the superconductivity extending up to Tc ~
356 K.
