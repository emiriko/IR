We present a combined analysis of neutron scattering and photoemission
measurements on superconducting FeSe(0.5)Te(0.5). The low-energy magnetic
excitations disperse only in the direction transverse to the characteristic
wave vector (1/2,0,0), whereas the electronic Fermi surface near (1/2,0,0)
appears to consist of four incommensurate pockets. While the spin resonance
occurs at an incommensurate wave vector compatible with nesting, neither
spin-wave nor Fermi-surface-nesting models can describe the magnetic
dispersion. We propose that a coupling of spin and orbital correlations is key
to explaining this behavior. If correct, it follows that these nematic
fluctuations are involved in the resonance and could be relevant to the pairing
mechanism.
