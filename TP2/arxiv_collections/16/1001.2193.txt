Following Craw, Maclagan, Thomas and Nakamura's work on Hilbert schemes for
abelian groups, we give an explicit description of the G-Hilbert scheme for G
equal to a cyclic group of order r, acting on C^3 with weights 1,a,r-a. We
describe how the combinatorial properties of the fan of G-Hilbert scheme
relates to the Euclidean algorithm.
