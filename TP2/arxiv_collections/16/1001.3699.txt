The connection of Gribov's confinement scenario in Coulomb gauge with the
center vortex picture of confinement is investigated. For this purpose we
assume a vacuum wave functional which models the infrared properties of the
theory and in particular shows strict confinement, i.e. an area law of the
Wilson loop. We isolate the center vortex content of this wave functional by
standard lattice methods and investigate their contributions to various static
propagators of the Hamilton approach to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge. We
find that the infrared properties of these quantities, in particular the
infrared divergence of the ghost form factor, are dominated by center vortices.
