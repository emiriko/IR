We show that if the Stokes matrix of a connection with a pole of order two
and no ramification gives rise, when added to its adjoint, to a positive
semi-definite Hermitian form, then the associated integrable twistor structure
(or TERP structure, or non-commutative Hodge structure) is pure and polarized.
