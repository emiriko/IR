We present first-principles investigation of the electronic structure and
magnetic properties of uranium monochalcogenides: US, USe, UTe. The
calculations were performed by using recently developed LDA+U+SO method in
which both Coulomb and spin-orbit interactions have been taken into account in
rotationally invariant form. We discuss the problem of choice of the Coulomb
interaction value. The calculated [111] easy axes agree with those
experimentally observed. The electronic configuration 5$f^3$ was found for all
uranium compounds under investigation.
