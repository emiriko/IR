Angular dependent core-hole screening effects have been found in the cobalt
K-edge x-ray absorption spectrum of LiCoO2, using high-resolution data and
parameter-free GGA+U calculations. The Co 1s core-hole on the absorber causes
strong local attraction. The core-hole screening on the nearest neighbours
cobalt induces a 2 eV shift in the density of states with respect to the
on-site 1s-3d transitions, as detected in the Co K pre-edge spectrum. Our DFT+U
calculations reveal that the off-site screening is different in the
out-of-plane direction, where a 3 eV shift is visible in both calculations and
experiment. The detailed analysis of the inclusion of the core-hole potential
and the Hubbard parameter U shows that the core-hole is essential for the
off-site screening, while U improves the description of the angular dependent
screening effects. In the case of oxygen K-edge, both the core-hole potential
and the Hubbard parameter improve the relative positions of the spectral
features.
