We study the stability of anyonic models on lattices to perturbations. We
establish a cluster expansion for the energy of the perturbed models and use it
to study the stability of the models to local perturbations. We show that the
spectral gap is stable when the model is defined on a sphere, so that there is
no ground state degeneracy. We then consider the toric code Hamiltonian on a
torus with a class of abelian perturbations and show that it is stable when the
torus directions are taken to infinity simultaneously, and is unstable when the
thin torus limit is taken.
