Paraphrasing methods recognize, generate, or extract phrases, sentences, or
longer natural language expressions that convey almost the same information.
Textual entailment methods, on the other hand, recognize, generate, or extract
pairs of natural language expressions, such that a human who reads (and trusts)
the first element of a pair would most likely infer that the other element is
also true. Paraphrasing can be seen as bidirectional textual entailment and
methods from the two areas are often similar. Both kinds of methods are useful,
at least in principle, in a wide range of natural language processing
applications, including question answering, summarization, text generation, and
machine translation. We summarize key ideas from the two areas by considering
in turn recognition, generation, and extraction methods, also pointing to
prominent articles and resources.
