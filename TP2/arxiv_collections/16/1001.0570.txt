The confinement of quarks in hadrons occurs due to formation of QCD string.
At large separation between the quarks the QCD string breaks into pieces due to
light quark-antiquark pair creation. We argue that there exist a critical
background magnetic field e B ~ 16 m_\pi^2, above which the string breaking is
impossible in the transverse directions with respect to the axis of the
magnetic field. Thus, at strong enough magnetic field a new, asymmetrically
confining phase may form. The effect - which can potentially be tested at
LHC/ALICE experiment - leads to abundance of u-quark rich hadrons and to excess
of radially excited mesons in the noncentral heavy-ion collisions compared to
the central ones.
