In their classic 1914 paper, Polya and Schur introduced and characterized two
types of linear operators acting diagonally on the monomial basis of R[x],
sending real-rooted polynomials (resp. polynomials with all nonzero roots of
the same sign) to real-rooted polynomials. Motivated by fundamental properties
of amoebae and discriminants discovered by Gelfand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky,
we introduce two new natural classes of polynomials and describe diagonal
operators preserving these new classes. A pleasant circumstance in our
description is that these classes have a simple explicit description, one of
them coinciding with the class of log-concave sequences.
