We compute one- and two-nucleon kinetic-energy spectra and opening-angle
distributions for the nonmesonic weak decay of several hypernuclei, and compare
our results with some recent data. The decaymics is described by transition
potentials of the one-meson-exchange type, and the nuclear structure aspects by
two versions of the independent-particle shell model (IPSM). In version IPSM-a,
the hole states are treated as stationary, while in version IPSM-b the deep
hole states are considered to be quasi-stationary and are described by
Breit-Wigner distributions.
