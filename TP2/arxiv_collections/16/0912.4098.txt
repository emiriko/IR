It is argued that the usual postulates of quantum mechanics are too strong.
It is conjectured that it is possible to interpret all experiments if we
maintain the formalism of quantum theory without modification, but weaken the
postulates concerning the relation between the formalism and the experiments. A
set of postulates is proposed where realism is insured. Comments on the Bell
theorem are made on the light of the new postulates.
