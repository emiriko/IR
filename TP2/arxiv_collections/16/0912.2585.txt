Employing a catalog of 175 extrasolar planets (exoplanets) detected by the
Doppler-shift method, we constructed the independent and coupled mass-period
functions. It is the first time in this field that the selection effect is
considered in the coupled mass-period functions. Our results are consistent
with those in Tabachnik and Tremaine (2002) with the major differences that we
obtain a flatter mass function but a steeper period function. Moreover, our
coupled mass-period functions show that about 2.5 percent of stars would have a
planet with mass between Earth Mass and Neptune Mass, and about 3 percent of
stars would have a planet with mass between Neptune Mass and Jupiter Mass.
