Our aim is to experimentally study the possibility of distinguishing between
quantum sources of randomness--recently proved to be theoretically
incomputable--and some well-known computable sources of pseudo-randomness.
Incomputability is a necessary, but not sufficient "symptom" of "true
randomness". We base our experimental approach on algorithmic information
theory which provides characterizations of algorithmic random sequences in
terms of the degrees of incompressibility of their finite prefixes. Algorithmic
random sequences are incomputable, but the converse implication is false. We
have performed tests of randomness on pseudo-random strings (finite sequences)
of length $2^{32}$ generated with software (Mathematica, Maple), which are
cyclic (so, strongly computable), the bits of $\pi$, which is computable, but
not cyclic, and strings produced by quantum measurements (with the commercial
device Quantis and by the Vienna IQOQI group). Our empirical tests indicate
quantitative differences, some statistically significant, between computable
and incomputable sources of "randomness".
