This paper addresses copyright protection as a major security demand in
digital marketplaces. Two watermarking techniques are proposed and compared for
compressed and uncompressed video with the intention to show the advantages and
the possible weaknesses in the schemes working in the frequency domain and in
the spatial domain. In this paper a robust video watermarking method is
presented. This method embeds data to the specific bands in the wavelet domain
using motion estimation approach. The algorithm uses the HL and LH bands to add
the watermark where the motion in these bands does not affect the quality of
extracted watermark if the video is subjected to different types of malicious
attacks. Watermark is embedded in an additive way using random Gaussian
distribution in video sequences. The method is tested on different types of
video (compressed DVD quality movie and uncompressed digital camera movie). The
proposed watermarking method in frequency domain has strong robustness against
some attacks such as frame dropping, frame filtering and lossy compression. The
experimental results indicate that the similarity measure before and after
certain attacks is very close to each other in frequency domain in comparison
to the spatial domain.
