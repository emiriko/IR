Perturbative corrections to correlation functions for interacting theories in
de Sitter spacetime often grow secularly with time, due to the properties of
fluctuations on super-Hubble scales. This growth can lead to a breakdown of
perturbation theory at late times. We argue that Dynamical Renormalization
Group (DRG) techniques provide a convenient framework for interpreting and
resumming these secularly growing terms. In the case of a massless scalar field
in de Sitter with quartic self-interaction, the resummed result is also less
singular in the infrared, in precisely the manner expected if a dynamical mass
is generated. We compare this improved infrared behavior with large-N
expansions when applicable.
