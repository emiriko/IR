We present low-frequency observations starting from ~150 MHz with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), and high-frequency observations with the Very
Large Array (VLA) of two large radio galaxies 3C46 and 3C452. These
observations were made with the objectives of estimating their spectral ages
and examining any evidence of diffuse extended emission at low radio
frequencies due to an earlier cycle of activity. While no evidence of extended
emission due to an earlier cycle of activity has been found, the spectral ages
have been estimated to be ~15 and 27 Myr for the oldest relativistic plasma
seen in the regions close to the cores for 3C46 and 3C452 respectively. The
spectra in the vicinity of the hotspots are consistent with a straight spectrum
with injection spectral indices of ~1.0 and 0.78 respectively, somewhat steeper
than theoretical expectations.
