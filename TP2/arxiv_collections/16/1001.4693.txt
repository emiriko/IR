In this article, we study the ${1\over 2}^+$ doubly heavy baryon states
$\Omega_{QQ}$ and $\Xi_{QQ}$ by subtracting the contributions from the
corresponding ${1\over 2}^-$ doubly heavy baryon states with the QCD sum rules,
and make reasonable predictions for their masses. Those doubly heavy baryon
states maybe observed at the Tevatron, the LHCb and the PANDA.
