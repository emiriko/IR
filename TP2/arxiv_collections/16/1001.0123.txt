We explore electron transport properties in honeycomb lattice ribbons with
zigzag edges coupled to two semi-infinite one-dimensional metallic electrodes.
The calculations are based on the tight-binding model and the Green's function
method, which numerically compute the conductance-energy and current-voltage
characteristics as functions of the lengths and widths of the ribbons. Our
numerical results predict that for such a ribbon an energy gap always appears
in the conductance spectrum across the energy E=0. With the increase of the
size of the ribbon, the gap gradually decreases but it never vanishes. This
clearly manifests that a honeycomb lattice ribbon with zigzag edges always
exhibits the semiconducting behavior, and it becomes much more clearly visible
from our presented current-voltage characteristics.
