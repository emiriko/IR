A simple set of algebraic equations is derived for the exact low-temperature
thermodynamics of one-dimensional multi-component strongly attractive fermionic
atoms with enlarged SU(N) spin symmetry and Zeeman splitting. Universal
multi-component Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) phases are thus determined. For
linear Zeeman splitting, the physics of the gapless phase at low temperatures
belongs to the universality class of a two-component asymmetric TLL
corresponding to spin-neutral N-atom composites and spin-(N-1)/2 single atoms.
The equation of states is also obtained to open up the study of multi-component
TLL phases in 1D systems of N-component Fermi gases with population imbalance.
