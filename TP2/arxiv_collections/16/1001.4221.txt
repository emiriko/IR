According to the cosmological model without singularity, there are s-matter
and v-matter which are symmetric and have oppose gravitational masses. In
V-breaking s-matter is similar to dark energy to cause expansion of the
universe with an acceleration now, and v-matter is composed of v-F-matter and
v-W-matter which are symmetric and have the same gravitational masses and forms
the world. The ratio of s-matter to v-matter is changeable. Based on the
cosmological model, we confirm that big bang nucleosynthesis is not spoiled by
that the average energy density of W-matter (mirror matter) is equal to that of
F-matter (ordinary matter). According to the present model, there are three
sorts of dark matter which are v-W-baryon matter (4/27), unknown v-F-matter
(9.5/27) and v-W-matter (9.5/27). Given v-F-baryon matter (4/27) and v-W-baryon
matter can cluster and respectively form the visible galaxies and dark
galaxies. Unknown v-F-matter and v-W-matter cannot cluster to form any
celestial body, loosely distribute in space, are equivalent to cold dark
matter, and their compositions are unknown. The number in a bracket is the
ratio of the density of a sort of matter to total density of v-matter. The
decisive predict is that there are dark celestial bodies and dark galaxies. The
energy of F-matter can transform into the energy of W-matter by such a process
in which the reaction energy is high enough.
