We show that the growth of the heterostructure LaGaO3/SrTiO3 yields the
formation of a highly conductive interface. Our samples were carefully analyzed
by high resolution electron microscopy, in order to assess their crystal
perfection and to evaluate the abruptness of the interface. Their carrier
density and sheet resistance are compared to the case of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 and a
superconducting transition is found. The results open the route to widening the
field of polar-non polar interfaces, pose some phenomenological constrains to
their underlying physics and highlight the chance of tailoring their properties
for future applications by adopting suitable polar materials.
