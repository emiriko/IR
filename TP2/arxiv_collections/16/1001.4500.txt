We use N-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of globular clusters
(GCs) in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Our models adopt a cosmologically
motivated scenario in which the dSph is approximated by a static NFW halo with
a triaxial shape. For a large set of orbits and projection angles we examine
the spatial and velocity distribution of stellar debris deposited during the
complete disruption of stellar clusters. Our simulations show that such debris
appears as shells, isolated clumps and elongated over-densities at low surface
brightness (>26 mag/arcsec^2), reminiscent of substructure observed in several
MW dSphs. Such features arise from the triaxiality of the galaxy potential and
do not dissolve in time. Stellar over-densities reported in several MW dSphs
may thus be the telltale evidence of dark matter haloes being triaxial in
shape.
  We explore a number of kinematic signatures that would help to validate (or
falsify) this scenario. The mean angular momentum of the cluster debris
associated with box and resonant orbits, which are absent in spherical
potentials, is null. As a result, we show that the line-of-sight velocity
distribution may exhibit a characteristic "double-peak" depending on the
oriention of the viewing angle with respect to the progenitor's orbital plane.
Kinematic surveys of dSphs may help to detect and identify substructures
associated with the disruption of stellar clusters, as well as to address the
shape of the dark matter haloes in which dSphs are embedded.
