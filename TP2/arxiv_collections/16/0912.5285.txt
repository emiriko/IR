A search is performed for the standard model Higgs boson in 5.2 fb-1 of
p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV, collected with the D0 detector at the
Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The final state considered is a pair of b jets and
large missing transverse energy, as expected from p-pbar->ZH->vvbb production.
The search is also sensitive to the WH->lvbb channel when the charged lepton is
not identified. For a Higgs boson mass of 115 GeV, a limit is set at the 95%
C.L. on the cross section multiplied by branching fraction for
[p-pbar->(Z/W)H](H->b-bbar) that is a factor of 3.7 larger than the standard
model value, consistent with the factor of 4.6 expected.
