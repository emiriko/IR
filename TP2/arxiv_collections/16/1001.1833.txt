Aiming at monitoring a time series to detect stationarity as soon as
possible, we introduce monitoring procedures based on kernel-weighted
sequential Dickey-Fuller (DF) processes, and related stopping times, which may
be called weighted Dickey-Fuller control charts. Under rather weak assumptions,
(functional) central limit theorems are established under the unit root null
hypothesis and local-to-unity alternatives. For gen- eral dependent and
heterogeneous innovation sequences the limit processes depend on a nuisance
parameter. In this case of practical interest, one can use estimated control
limits obtained from the estimated asymptotic law. Another easy-to-use approach
is to transform the DF processes to obtain limit laws which are invariant with
respect to the nuisance pa- rameter. We provide asymptotic theory for both
approaches and compare their statistical behavior in finite samples by
simulation.
