We consider two optimally mixed neutralino dark matter models, based on
nonuniversal gaugino masses, which were recently proposed by us to achieve WMAP
compatible relic density over a large part of the MSSM parameter space. We
compare the resulting predictions for the spin-independent DM scattering
cross-section with the recent CDMS II data, assuming the possibility of the two
reported candidate events being signal events. For one model the predicted
cross-section agrees with the putative signal over a small part of the
parameter space, while for the other the agreement holds over the entire WMAP
compatible parameter space of the model.
