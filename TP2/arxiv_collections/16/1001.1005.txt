We discuss the IR/visible/VUV continuum emission of the impulsive phase of a
solar flare, using TRACE UV and EUV images to characterize the spectral energy
distribution. This continuum has been poorly observed but dominates the radiant
energy energetically. Recent bolometric observations of solar flares
furthermore point to the impulsive phase as the source of a major fraction of
the radiant energy. This component appears to exhibit a Balmer jump and thus
must originate in an optically thin region above the quiet photosphere, with an
elevated temperature and strong ionization.
