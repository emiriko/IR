We explore the possibility of spontaneous R parity violation in the context
of $A_4$ flavor symmetry. Our model contains $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times
U(1)_Y$ singlet matter chiral superfields which are arranged as triplet of
$A_4$ and as well as few additional Higgs chiral superfields which are singlet
under MSSM gauge group and belong to triplet and singlet representation under
the $A_4$ flavor symmetry. R parity is broken spontaneously by the vacuum
expectation values of the different sneutrino fields and hence we have
neutrino-neutralino as well as neutrino-MSSM gauge singlet higgsino mixings in
our model, in addition to the standard model neutrino- gauge singlet neutrino,
gaugino-higgsino and higgsino-higgsino mixings. Because all of these mixings we
have an extended neutral fermion mass matrix. We explore the low energy
neutrino mass matrix for our model and point out that with some specific
constraints between the sneutrino vacuum expectation values as well as the MSSM
gauge singlet Higgs vacuum expectation values, the low energy neutrino mass
matrix will lead to a tribimaximal mixing matrix. We also analyze the potential
minimization for our model and show that one can realize a higher vacuum
expectation value of the $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ singlet
sneutrino fields even when the other sneutrino vacuum expectation values are
extremely small or even zero.
