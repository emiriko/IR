We discuss the potential of measurements of \sigma(p p -> b\bar{b}) to
constrain new bosonic degrees of freedom at the LHC when pT > \sqrt{s}/11 TeV
for a pseudorapidity cut |\eta| < 2.4. By suppressing the NLO QCD production of
b\bar{b} pairs through simple kinematic constraints we show how to more
efficiently exploit CMS's reach out to 1.5 TeV in pT for B mesons in searches
for new physics. Using this technique we investigate the potential for
discovery of new massive spin one and spin zero SU_c(3) octet bosons by
analyzing their effect on the d\sigma(p p -> b\bar{b})/d pT^2 distribution. In
some cases, the tree level contributions are small and the largest effect of
new physics on the pT tail of the distribution is due to one-loop resonant
s-channel production or interference effects with the LO standard model
production mechanisms q\bar{q}, g g -> b\bar{b}. We explore this possibility in
some detail when the standard model is extended with an (8,2)_{1/2} scalar
motivated by Minimal Flavor Violation.
