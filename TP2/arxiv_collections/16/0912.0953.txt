Any successful model of coronal loops must explain a number of observed
properties. For warm (~ 1 MK) loops, these include: 1. excess density, 2. flat
temperature profile, 3. super-hydrostatic scale height, 4. unstructured
intensity profile, and 5. 1000--5000 s lifetime. We examine whether thermal
nonequilibrium can reproduce the observations by performing hydrodynamic
simulations based on steady coronal heating that decreases exponentially with
height. We consider both monolithic and multi-stranded loops. The simulations
successfully reproduce certain aspects of the observations, including the
excess density, but each of them fails in at least one critical way. Monolithic
models have far too much intensity structure, while multi-strand models are
either too structured or too long-lived. Our results appear to rule out the
widespread existence of heating that is both highly concentrated low in the
corona and steady or quasi-steady (slowly varying or impulsive with a rapid
cadence). Active regions would have a very different appearance if the dominant
heating mechanism had these properties. Thermal nonequilibrium may nonetheless
play an important role in prominences and catastrophic cooling events (e.g.,
coronal rain) that occupy a small fraction of the coronal volume. However,
apparent inconsistencies between the models and observations of cooling events
have yet to be understood.
