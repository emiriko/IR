Migration of charged point defects triggered by the local random
depolarization field is shown to plausibly explain aging of poled ferroelectric
ceramics providing reasonable time and acceptor concentration dependences of
the emerging internal bias field. The theory is based on the evaluation of the
energy of the local depolarization field caused by mismatch of the
polarizations of neighbor grains. The kinetics of charge migration assumes
presence of mobile oxygen vacancies in the material due to the intentional or
unintentional acceptor doping. Satisfactory agreement of the theory with
experiment on the Fe-doped lead zirconate titanate is demonstrated.
