In this paper we study the reconstruction of a bandlimited signal from
samples generated by the integrate and fire model. This sampler allows us to
trade complexity in the reconstruction algorithms for simple hardware
implementations, and is specially convenient in situations where the sampling
device is limited in terms of power, area and bandwidth.
  Although perfect reconstruction for this sampler is impossible, we give a
general approximate reconstruction procedure and bound the corresponding error.
We also show the performance of the proposed algorithm through numerical
simulations.
