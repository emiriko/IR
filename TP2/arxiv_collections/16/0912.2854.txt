We re-examine the three-dimensional spinless Falicov-Kimball model with
dispersive $f$ electrons at half-filling, addressing the dispute about the
formation of an excitonic condensate, which is closely related to the problem
of electronic ferroelectricity. To this end, we work out a slave-boson
functional integral representation of the suchlike extended Falicov-Kimball
model that preserves the $SO(2)\otimes U(1)^{\otimes 2}$ invariance of the
action. We find a spontaneous pairing of $c$ electrons with $f$ holes, building
an excitonic insulator state at low temperatures, also for the case of
initially non-degenerate orbitals. This is in contrast to recent predictions of
scalar slave-boson mean-field theory but corroborates previous Hartree-Fock and
RPA results. Our more precise treatment of correlation effects, however, leads
to a substantial reduction of the critical temperature. The different behavior
of the partial densities of states in the weak and strong inter-orbital Coulomb
interaction regimes supports a BCS-BEC transition scenario.
