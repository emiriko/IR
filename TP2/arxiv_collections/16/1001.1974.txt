For enhancing the protection level of dynamic graph software watermarks and
for the purpose of conducting the analysis which evaluates the effect of
integrating two software protection techniques such as software watermarking
and tamper proofing, constant encoding technique along with the enhancement
through the idea of constant splitting is proposed. In this paper Thomborson
technique has been implemented with the scheme of breaking constants which
enables to encode all constants without having any consideration about their
values with respect to the value of watermark tree. Experimental analysis which
have been conducted and provided in this paper concludes that the constant
encoding process significantly increases the code size, heap space usage, and
execution time, while making the tamper proofed code resilient to variety of
semantic preserving program transformation attacks.
