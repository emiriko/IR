To test effective Hamiltonians for strongly interacting fermions in an
optical lattice, we numerically find the energy spectrum for two fermions
interacting across a Feshbach resonance in a double well potential. From the
spectrum, we determine the range of detunings for which the system can be
described by an effective lattice model, and how the model parameters are
related to the experimental parameters. We find that for a range of strong
interactions the system is well described by an effective $t-J$ model, and the
effective superexchange term, $J$, can be smoothly tuned through zero on either
side of unitarity. Right at and around unitarity, an effective one-band general
Hubbard model is appropriate, with a finite and small on-site energy, due to a
lattice-induced anharmonic coupling between atoms at the scattering threshold
and a weakly bound Feshbach molecule in an excited center of mass state.
