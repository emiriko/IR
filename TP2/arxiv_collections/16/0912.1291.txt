Using the published KTeV samples of K_L --> pi^{\pm} e^{\mp} nu and K_L -->
pi^{\pm} mu^{\mp} nu decays [1], we perform a reanalysis of the scalar and
vector form factors based on the dispersive parameterization [2,3]. We obtain
phase space integrals I^e_K = 0.15446 \pm 0.00025 and I^{mu}_K = 0.10219 \pm
0.00025. For the scalar form factor parameterization, the only free parameter
is the normalized form factor value at the Callan-Treiman point (C); our best
fit results in ln C = 0.1915 \pm 0.0122. We also study the sensitivity of C to
different parametrizations of the vector form factor. The results for the phase
space integrals and C are then used to make tests of the Standard Model.
Finally, we compare our results with lattice QCD calculations of F_K/F_pi and
f_+(0).
