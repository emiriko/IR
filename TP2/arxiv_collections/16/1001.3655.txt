We present a survey on mathematical topics relating to separable states and
entanglement witnesses. The convex cone duality between separable states and
entanglement witnesses is discussed and later generalized to other families of
operators, leading to their characterization via multiplicative properties. The
condition for an operator to be an entanglement witness is rephrased as a
problem of positivity of a family of real polynomials. By solving the latter in
a specific case of a three-parameter family of operators, we obtain explicit
description of entanglement witnesses belonging to that family. A related
problem of block positivity over real numbers is discussed. We also consider a
broad family of block positivity tests and prove that they can never be
sufficient, which should be useful in case of future efforts in that direction.
Finally, we introduce the concept of length of a separable state and present
new results concerning relationships between the length and Schmidt rank. In
particular, we prove that separable states of length lower of equal 3 have
Schmidt ranks equal to their lengths. We also give an example of a state which
has length 4 and Schmidt rank 3.
