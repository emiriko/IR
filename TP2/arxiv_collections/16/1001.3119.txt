We present preliminary STAR results on measurements of multi-strange
particles $\Xi$, $\Omega$ and their anti-particles from Au+Au and Cu+Cu at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=62.4$ GeV collisions. In order to better understand the role of
strangeness enhancement in nucleus-nucleus collisions and its scaling
properties with system size, we compare the results from Au+Au and Cu+Cu
reactions for different event centrality classes. Strangeness enhancement is
discussed in the context of multi-strange to pion ratios. Finally,
$\Omega/\phi$ ratio is shown for different systems and energies for a
systematic study.
