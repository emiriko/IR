Quasi-free photoproduction of eta-mesons off the neutron and off the proton
has been studied using a deuterium target and bremsstrahlung photons produced
by MAMI-C with incident energies up to 1.5 GeV. The eta-mesons were detected in
coincidence with the recoil nucleons thus a fully exclusive measurement was
performed. Preliminary results show a bump-like structure in the excitation
function for the neutron close to W $\approx$ 1675 MeV which is not seen for
the proton. Considering the experimental resolution and using a Breit-Wigner
fit the width of this structure was approximated below 50 MeV.
