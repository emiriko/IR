Positive streamers are thought to propagate by photo-ionization whose
parameters depend on the nitrogen:oxygen ratio. Therefore we study streamers in
nitrogen with 20%, 0.2% and 0.01% oxygen and in pure nitrogen, as well as in
pure oxygen and argon. Our new experimental set-up guarantees contamination of
the pure gases to be well below 1 ppm. Streamers in oxygen are difficult to
measure as they emit considerably less light in the sensitivity range of our
fast ICCD camera than the other gasses. Streamers in pure nitrogen and in all
nitrogen/oxygen mixtures look generally similar, but become somewhat thinner
and branch more with decreasing oxygen content. In pure nitrogen the streamers
can branch so much that they resemble feathers. This feature is even more
pronounced in pure argon, with approximately 10^2 hair tips/cm^3 in the
feathers at 200 mbar; this density could be interpreted as the free electron
density creating avalanches towards the streamer stem. It is remarkable that
the streamer velocity is essentially the same for similar voltage and pressure
in all nitrogen/oxygen mixtures as well as in pure nitrogen, while the oxygen
concentration and therefore the photo-ionization lengths vary by more than five
orders of magnitude. Streamers in argon have essentially the same velocity as
well. The physical similarity of streamers at different pressures is confirmed
in all gases; the minimal diameters are smaller than in earlier measurements.
