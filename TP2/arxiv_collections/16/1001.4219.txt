It is known that there is a phenomenon called "parameter degeneracy" in
neutrino oscillation measurement of lepton mixing parameters; A set of the
oscillation probabilities, e.g., P(nu_mu --> nu_e) and its CP-conjugate
P(bar{nu}_mu --> bar{nu}_e) at a particular neutrino energy does not determine
uniquely the values of theta_13 and delta. With use of the approximate form of
the oscillation probability 'a la Cervera et al., a complete analysis of the
eightfold parameter degeneracy is presented. We propose a unified view of the
various types of the degeneracy as invariance of the oscillation probabilities
under discrete mappings of the mixing parameters. Explicit form of the mapping
is obtained either by symmetry argument, or by deriving exact analytic
expressions of all the degeneracy solutions for a given true solution. Due to
the one-to-one mapping structure the degeneracy solutions are shown to form a
network. We extend our analysis into the parameter degeneracy in T- and
CPT-conjugate measurement as well as to the setup with the golden and the
silver channels, P(nu_e --> nu_mu) and P(nu_e --> nu_tau). Some characteristic
features of the degeneracy solutions in CP-conjugate measurement, in particular
their energy dependences, are illuminated by utilizing the explicit analytic
solutions.
