Although the choice of a factorization scheme is as important as the choice
of a factorization scale, the dependence of theoretical predictions (at finite
order) on the choice of a factorization scheme has been little investigated.
This is due to the fact that the freedom in the choice of a factorization
scheme is enormous, even at NLO. One of the reason why to study factorization
schemes is the possible exploitation of the freedom in their choice in the
construction of NLO Monte Carlo event generators with NLO initial state parton
showers. However, the ZERO factorization scheme, which should be optimal for
such Monte Carlo event generators, has turned out to be practically
inapplicable although it appears at first sight as reasonable. A detailed
analysis has then shown that if some given NLO splitting functions do not
satisfy a certain nontrivial condition, then the corresponding factorization
scheme has some restrictions on its practical applicability. Relevant technical
details of the discussed issues are the content of this short contribution.
