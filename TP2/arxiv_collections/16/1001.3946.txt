Emission spectra of several organic liquid-scintillator mixtures which are
relevant for the proposed LENA detector have been measured by exciting the
medium with electrons of ~10keV. The results are compared with spectra
resulting from ultraviolet light excitation. Good agreement between spectra
measured by both methods has been found.
