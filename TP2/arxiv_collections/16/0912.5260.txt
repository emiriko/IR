Recently many methods have been proposed to create the vector fields, due to
the academic interest and a variety of attractive applications such as for
particle acceleration, optical trapping, particle manipulation, and
fluorescence imaging. For the most of the created vector fields, the spatial
distribution in states of polarization (SoPs) is dependent of azimuthal angle
only. It is very interesting and crucial that if we can introduce the radial
controlling freedom, which undoubtedly opens a new way to provide the
flexibility for creating the desired vector fields and for fulfilling the
requirement on a variety of applications. Here we present a new idea to create
a new kind of vector filed with the radial-variant SoPs. This idea also permits
to create flexibly vector fields with arbitrarily complex distribution of SoPs,
based on a combination of radial and azimuthal dependency. This realization in
both principle and experiment is paramount to be able to implement the focusing
engineering for applications in a variety of realms. Specially arranging the
SoPs of vector fields, purposefully and carefully, is anticipated to lead to
new effects and phenomena that can expand the functionality and enhance the
capability of optical systems, such as the optical trapping.
