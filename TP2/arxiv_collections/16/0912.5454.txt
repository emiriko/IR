The inhibition of the total HI $n\leftrightarrow 1$ transition rate by
delayed resonant reabsorption of HI $(n+1)\to 1$ photons by HI $n\to 1$ line
which is possible due to cosmological redshift is considered semi-analytically.
The method taking into account this effect in the frame of simple three-level
approximation model of recombination is suggested. It is confirmed that the
resonant feedbacks affect ionization fraction at the level about 0.2% for the
epoch of last scattering.
  Similar consideration of HeI $2^1P\leftrightarrow 1^1S$ $\Rightarrow$ HeI
$2^3P\leftrightarrow 1^1S$ feedback for helium is provided. It is confirmed
that allowance of this feedback leads to increase of predicted free electron
fraction by 0.12% at $z\simeq 2300$. It is shown that taking into account
absorption and thermalization of HeI $2^1P\leftrightarrow 1^1S$ resonant
superequilibrium photons (during their redshifting to the HeI
$2^3P\leftrightarrow 1^1S$ frequency) by small amount of neutral hydrogen
($10^{\rm -7} - 10^{\rm -4}$ of total number of hydrogen atoms and ions)
existing in helium recombination epoch is important for correct consideration
of this helium feedback.
