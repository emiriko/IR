In order to investigate the size limit on spatial localized structures in a
nonlinear system, we explore the impact of linear nonlocality on their domains
of existence and stability. Our system of choice is an optical microresonator
containing an additional metamaterial layer in the cavity, allowing the
nonlocal response of the material to become the dominating spatial process. In
that case, our bifurcation analysis shows that this nonlocality imposes a new
limit on the width of localized structures going beyond the traditional
diffraction limit.
