We have theoretically investigated macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) and
the influence of nodal quasiparticles and zero energy bound states (ZES) on MQT
in s-wave/d-wave hybrid Josephson junctions. In contrast to d-wave/d-wave
junctions, the low-energy quasiparticle dissipation resulting from nodal
quasiparticles and ZES is suppressed due to a quasiparticle-tunneling blockade
effect in an isotropic s-wave superconductor. Therefore, the inherent
dissipation in these junctions is found to be weak. This result suggests high
potential of s-wave/d-wave hybrid junctions for applications in quantum
information devices.
