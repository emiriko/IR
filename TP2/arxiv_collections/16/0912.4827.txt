We establish a one-to-one correspondence between a class of Garside groups
admitting a certain presentation and the structure groups of non-degenerate,
involutive and braided set-theoretical solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter
equation. We also characterize indecomposable solutions in terms of
$\Delta$-pure Garside groups.
