We report unfiltered CCD observations of the first confirmed superoutburst of
the dwarf nova RX J1715.6+6856 in August 2009. At quiescence the star was
magnitude 18.3 (CCD, clear). The outburst amplitude was at least 2.4 magnitudes
and it lasted at least 6 days, although the first part of the outburst was
probably missed. Analysis of the light curve revealed superhumps with
peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.1 magnitude, thereby showing it to be a member of
the SU UMa family. The mean superhump period was Psh = 0.07086(78) d with a
superhump period excess of epsilon = 0.038 and an estimated mass ratio q =
0.167. In the final stages of the outburst, as the star approached quiescence,
the superhumps disappeared to be replaced by a modulation corresponding to the
orbital period. The star was regularly monitored between August 2007 and
September 2009 revealing a total of 12 outbursts, with an outburst frequency of
approximately once per month.
