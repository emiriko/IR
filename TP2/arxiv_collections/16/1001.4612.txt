We have studied damping in polycrystalline Al nanomechanical resonators by
measuring the temperature dependence of their resonance frequency and quality
factor over a temperature range of 0.1 - 4 K. Two regimes are clearly
distinguished with a crossover temperature of 1 K. Below 1 K we observe a
logarithmic temperature dependence of the frequency and linear dependence of
damping that cannot be explained by the existing standard models. We attribute
these phenomena to the effect of the two-level systems characterized by the
unexpectedly long (at least two orders of magnitude longer) relaxation times
and discuss possible microscopic models for such systems. We conclude that the
dynamics of the two-level systems is dominated by their interaction with
one-dimensional phonon modes of the resonators.
