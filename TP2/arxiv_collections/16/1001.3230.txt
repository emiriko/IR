Ultracold atoms loaded on optical lattices can provide unprecedented
experimental systems for the quantum simulations and manipulations of many
quantum phases. However, so far, how to detect these quantum phases effectively
remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we show that the optical Bragg
scattering of cold atoms loaded on optical lattices can be used to detect many
quantum phases which include not only the conventional superfluid and Mott
insulating phases, but also other important phases such as various kinds of
density waves (CDW), valence bond solids (VBS), CDW supersolids and VBS
supersolids.
