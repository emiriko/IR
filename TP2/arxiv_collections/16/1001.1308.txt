The (neo-)evolutionary model of a Triple Helix of
University-Industry-Government Relations focuses on the overlay of
expectations, communications, and interactions that potentially feed back on
the institutional arrangements among the carrying agencies. From this
perspective, the evolutionary perspective in economics can be complemented with
the reflexive turn from sociology. The combination provides a richer
understanding of how knowledge-based systems of innovation are shaped and
reconstructed. The communicative capacities of the carrying agents become
crucial to the system's further development, whereas the institutional
arrangements (e.g., national systems) can be expected to remain under
reconstruction. The tension of the differentiation no longer needs to be
resolved, since the network configurations are reproduced by means of
translations among historically changing codes. Some methodological and
epistemological implications for studying innovation systems are explicated.
