A high-nitrogen-concentration diamond sample was subject to 200-keV electron
irradiation using a transmission electron microscope. The optical and
spin-resonance properties of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers were
investigated as a function of the irradiation dose up to 6.4\times1021 e-/cm2.
The microwave transition frequency of the NV- center was found to shift by up
to 0.6% (17.1 MHz) and the linewidth broadened with increasing
electron-irradiation dose. Unexpectedly, the measured magnetic sensitivity is
best at the lowest irradiation dose, even though the NV concentration increases
monotonically with increasing dose. This is in large part due to a sharp
reduction in optically-detected spin contrast at higher doses.
