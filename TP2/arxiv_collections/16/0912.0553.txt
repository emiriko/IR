We present a compact, transportable system that produces Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) near the surface of an integrated atom microchip. The system
occupies a volume of 0.4 m^3 and operates at a repetition rate as high as 0.3
Hz. Evaporative cooling in a chip trap with trap frequencies of several kHz
leads to nearly pure condensates containing 1.9x10^4 87Rb atoms. Partial
condensates are observed at a temperature of 1.58(8) \mu K, close to the
theoretical transition temperature of 1.1 \mu K.
