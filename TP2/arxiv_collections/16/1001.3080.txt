All the concepts and principles necessary to understand quantum mechanics on
an initial level are given in a form suitable for the non-expert. The concepts
explained include visualizing the wave function, wave-particle duality, the
implications of Schrodinger's cat, probability, the uncertainty principle,
collapse of the wave function, and others. However, because of the peculiar,
non-intuitive nature of quantum mechanics, one must understand the potential
interpretations of its mathematics before one can properly understand these
concepts. Thus the paper is organized aorund interpretations, conceptual
pictures that explain the peculiar properties of the theory. The only
interpretation that currently satisfies all the constraints imposed by
experiments and the theory itself makes use of a perceiving Mind which is
outside the laws of quantum mechanics.
