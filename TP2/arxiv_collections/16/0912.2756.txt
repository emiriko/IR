An ultralong photon storage with more than 50% retrieval efficiency is
presented in the three-pulse photon echoes by using a pair of control pulses,
where the control pulses play to freeze atoms dephasing process conditionally
by transferring excited atoms to an auxiliary state and returning them back
later. The observed photon echo decay time much longer than the spin
homogeneous decay time is potential for long distance quantum communications.
