We show that in the Two Higgs Doublet Model (THDM) Type I the partial decay
width of h --> gamma gamma can be considerably larger than in Type II, due to
light charged scalars with a mass about 100 GeV, which are not yet excluded in
Type I. A possible enhancement of the width compared to the SM is analyzed for
different Higgs potentials, subject to constraints from tree-level unitarity,
vacuum stability and electroweak precision tests.
