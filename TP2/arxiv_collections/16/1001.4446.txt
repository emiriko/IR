We present a theoretical study showing that an optically driven excitonic
two-level system in a solid state environment acts as a heat pump by means of
repeated phonon emission or absorption events. We derive a master equation for
the combined phonon bath and two-level system dynamics and analyze the
direction and rate of energy transfer as a function of the externally
accessible driving parameters. We discover that if the driving laser is detuned
from the exciton transition, cooling the phonon environment becomes possible.
