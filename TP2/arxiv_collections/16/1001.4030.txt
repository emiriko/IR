We investigate the quantitative and analytic aspects of the near-parabolic
renormalization scheme introduced by Inou and Shishikura in 2006. These provide
techniques to study the dynamics of some holomorphic maps of the form $f(z) =
e^{2\pi i \alpha} z + \mathcal{O}(z^2)$, including the quadratic polynomials
$e^{2\pi i \alpha} z+z^2$, for some irrational values of $\alpha$. The main
results of the paper concern fine-scale features of the measure-theoretic
attractors of these maps, and their dependence on the data. As a bi-product, we
establish an optimal upper bound on the size of the maximal linearization
domain in terms of the Siegel-Brjuno-Yoccoz series of $\alpha$.
