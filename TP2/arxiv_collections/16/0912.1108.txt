The Tajmar effect is an unexplained acceleration observed by accelerometers
and laser gyroscopes close to rotating supercooled rings. The observed ratio
between the gyroscope and ring accelerations was 3+/-1.2x10^-8. Here, a new
model for inertia which has been tested quite successfully on the Pioneer and
flyby anomalies is applied to this problem. The model assumes that the inertia
of the gyroscope is caused by Unruh radiation that appears as the ring and the
fixed stars accelerate relative to it, and that this radiation is subject to a
Hubble-scale Casimir effect. The model predicts that the sudden acceleration of
the nearby ring causes a slight increase in the inertial mass of the gyroscope,
and, to conserve momentum in the reference frame of the spinning Earth, the
gyroscope rotates clockwise with an acceleration ratio of 1.8+/-0.25x10^-8 in
agreement with the observed ratio. However, this model does not explain the
parity violation seen in some of the gyroscope data. To test these ideas the
Tajmar experiment (setup B) could be exactly reproduced in the southern
hemisphere, since the model predicts that the anomalous acceleration should
then be anticlockwise.
