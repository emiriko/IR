The topology change in quantum gravity is modeled by a Ricci flow. In this
approach we offer to consider the Ricci flow as a statistical system. The
metric in the Ricci flow enumerated by a parameter $\lambda$ is a microscopical
statistical state. The probability of every microscopical state is determined
by the parameter $\lambda$. Numerically the Ricci flow starting from a static
wormhole filled with a phantom Sine-Gordon scalar field is investigated.
