Using the recently developed technique of microsoldering, we perform a
systematic transport study of the influence of PMMA on graphene flakes
revealing a doping effect of up to 3.8x10^12 1/cm^2, but a negligible influence
on mobility and gate voltage induced hysteresis. Moreover, we show that the
microsoldered graphene is free of contamination and exhibits a very similar
intrinsic rippling as has been found for lithographically contacted flakes.
Finally, we demonstrate a current induced closing of the previously found
phonon gap appearing in scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, strongly
non-linear features at higher bias probably caused by vibrations of the flake
and a B-field induced double peak attributed to the 0.Landau level of graphene.
