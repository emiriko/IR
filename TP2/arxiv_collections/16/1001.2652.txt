The Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model is extended and
applied to the antiproton-nucleus interactions in a wide beam momentum range.
The model calculations are compared with the experimental data on $\bar
p$-absorption cross sections on nuclei with an emphasis on extraction of the
real part of an antiproton optical potential. The possibility of the cold
compression of a nucleus by an antiproton in-flight is also considered.
