Taking into account the $\Lambda$ baryon distribution amplitudes and the most
general form of the interpolating current of the $\Lambda_{b}$, the
semileptonic $\Lambda_{b}\rar \Lambda \ell^+\ell^- $ transition is investigated
in the framework of the light cone QCD sum rules. Sum rules for all twelve form
factors responsible for the $\Lambda_{b}\rar \Lambda \ell^+\ell^- $ decay are
constructed. The obtained results for the form factors are used to compute the
branching fraction. A comparison of the obtained results with the existing
predictions of the heavy quark effective theory is presented. The results of
the branching ratio shows the detectability of this channel at the LHCb in the
near future is quite high.
