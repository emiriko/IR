An n-simplex is said to be n-well-centered if its circumcenter lies in its
interior. We introduce several other geometric conditions and an algebraic
condition that can be used to determine whether a simplex is n-well-centered.
These conditions, together with some other observations, are used to describe
restrictions on the local combinatorial structure of simplicial meshes in which
every simplex is well-centered. In particular, it is shown that in a
3-well-centered (2-well-centered) tetrahedral mesh there are at least 7 (9)
edges incident to each interior vertex, and these bounds are sharp. Moreover,
it is shown that, in stark contrast to the 2-dimensional analog, where there
are exactly two vertex links that prevent a well-centered triangle mesh in R^2,
there are infinitely many vertex links that prohibit a well-centered
tetrahedral mesh in R^3.
