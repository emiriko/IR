We use the Ulam method to study spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius
operators of dynamical maps in a chaotic regime. For maps with absorption we
show that the spectrum is characterized by the fractal Weyl law recently
established for nonunitary operators describing poles of quantum chaotic
scattering with the Weyl exponent $\nu=d-1$, where $d$ is the fractal dimension
of corresponding strange set of trajectories nonescaping in future times. In
contrast, for dissipative maps we find the Weyl exponent $\nu=d/2$ where $d$ is
the fractal dimension of strange attractor. The Weyl exponent can be also
expressed via the relation $\nu=d_0/2$ where $d_0$ is the fractal dimension of
the invariant sets. We also discuss the properties of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of such operators characterized by the fractal Weyl law.
