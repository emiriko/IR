The short pulse (SP) equation is a novel model equation describing the
propagation of ultra-short optical pulses in nonlinear media. This article
reviews some recent results about the SP equation. In particular, we focus our
attention on its exact solutions. By using a newly developed method of
solution, we derive multisoliton solutions as well as 1-and 2-phase periodic
solutions and investigate their properties.
