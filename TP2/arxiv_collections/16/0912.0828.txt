A complete adiabatic transport of Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well
trap is investigated within the Landau-Zener (LZ) and Gaussian Landau-Zener
(GLZ) schemes for the case of a small nonlinearity, when the atomic interaction
is weaker than the coupling. The schemes use the constant (LZ) and
time-dependent Gaussian (GLZ) couplings. The mean field calculations show that
LZ and GLZ suggest essentially different transport dynamics. Significant
deviations from the case of a strong coupling are discussed.
