We use the high quality pressure profiles of 239 galaxy clusters made
available by the ACCEPT project (Cavagnolo et al. 2009) in order to derive the
expected Sunyaev Zeldovich (SZ) signal in a variety of cases that hardly find a
counterpart in the simulations. We made use of the Melin et al. (2006) cluster
selection function for both the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck
instruments. We infer a clear effect of the cool core (CC) on the central
Compton parameter y_0. We find that the presence of CCs introduces a small bias
in cluster detection, especially around the mass at which the performance of
the survey begins to decrease. If the CC were removed, a lower overall fraction
of detected clusters would be expected. In order to estimate the presence of
such a bias by means of SZ only surveys, we show that the ratio between y_0 and
y_int anti-correlates with the cluster central cooling time. If multi-band
optical cluster surveys are either available for a cross-match or a follow-up
is planned, we suggest that likely CC clusters are those with a Brightest
Cluster Galaxy (BCG) at least 0.3 magnitudes bluer than the average. A more
robust estimate of the CC presence is given by UV-optical colours of the BCG,
like the NUV-r, whose values can be 4 magnitudes off the NUV-r equivalent of
the red sequence, in clusters with low excess entropy. We also find correlation
of the y_0/y_int ratio with Halpha, IR and radio luminosities. We argue that
the analysis of a combined SZ/optical/UV surveys can be also used to shed light
on the suggested CC evolution with redshift. (abridged)
