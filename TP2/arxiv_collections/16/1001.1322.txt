Effect algebras are a generalization of many structures which arise in
quantum physics and in mathematical economics. We show that, in every modular
Archimedean atomic lattice effect algebra $E$ that is not an orthomodular
lattice there exists an $(o)$-continuous state $\omega$ on $E$, which is
subadditive. Moreover, we show properties of finite and compact elements of
such lattice effect algebras.
