Dispersion and absorption properties of a weak probe field in a three-level
V-type atomic system is studied. By application of indirect incoherent pump
fields the effect of populating upper levels on optical properties of the
atomic medium in presence of a strong coherent pump field is investigated. It
is shown that the slope of dispersion changes from positive to negative just by
changing the intensity of the coherent or indirect incoherent pump fields. It
is demonstrated that the absorption-free subluminal and superluminal light
propagation appears in this system.
