For a three-state Markov system in a stationary state, we discuss whether, on
the basis of data obtained from effective two-state (or on-off) trajectories,
it is possible to discriminate between an equilibrium state and a
non-equilibrium steady state. By calculating the full phase diagram we identify
a large region where such data will be consistent only with non-equilibrium
conditions. This regime is considerably larger than the region with oscillatory
relaxation, which has previously been identified as a sufficient criterion for
non-equilibrium.
