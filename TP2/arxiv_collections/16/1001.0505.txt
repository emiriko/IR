We propose a new method to construct an isotropic cellular automaton
corresponding to a reaction-diffusion equation. The method consists of
replacing the diffusion term and the reaction term of the reaction-diffusion
equation with a random walk of microscopic particles and a discrete vector
field which defines the time evolution of the particles. The cellular automaton
thus obtained can retain isotropy and therefore reproduces the patterns found
in the numerical solutions of the reaction-diffusion equation. As a specific
example, we apply the method to the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction in excitable
media.
