We present 3D spectroscopic observations of a sample of 10 nearby galaxies
with the AAOmega-SPIRAL integral field spectrograph on the 3.9m AAT, the
largest survey of its kind to date. The double-beam spectrograph provides
spatial maps in a range of spectral diagnostics: [OIII] 5007, H-beta, Mg-b,
NaD, [OI] 6300, H-alpha, [NII] 6583, [SII] 6717, 6731. All of the objects in
our survey show extensive wind-driven filamentation along the minor axis, in
addition to large-scale disk rotation. Our sample can be divided into either
starburst galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGN), although some objects
appear to be a combination of these. The total ionizing photon budget available
to both classes of galaxies is sufficient to ionise all of the wind-blown
filamentation out to large radius. We find however that while AGN
photoionisation always dominates in the wind filaments, this is not the case in
starburst galaxies where shock ionisation dominates. This clearly indicates
that after the onset of star formation, there is a substantial delay (> 10 Myr)
before a starburst wind develops. We show why this behavior is expected by
deriving ``ionisation'' and dynamical timescales for both AGNs and starbursts.
We establish a sequence of events that lead to the onset of a galactic wind.
The clear signature provided by the ionisation timescale is arguably the
strongest evidence yet that the starburst phenomenon is an impulsive event. A
well-defined ionisation timescale is not expected in galaxies with a protracted
history of circumnuclear star formation. Our 3D data provide important
templates for comparisons with high redshift galaxies.[Abridged]
