We use a recently derived integral representation of the one-loop effective
action in Einstein-Maxwell theory for an explicit calculation of the part of
the effective action containing the information on the low energy limit of the
five-point amplitudes involving one graviton, four photons and either a scalar
or spinor loop. All available identities are used to get the result into a
relatively compact form.
