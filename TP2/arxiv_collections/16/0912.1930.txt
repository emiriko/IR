We consider Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa (AGT) realization of the Nekrasov
partition function of N=2 SCFT. We focus our attention on the SU(2) theory with
N_f=4 flavor symmetry, whose partition function, according to AGT, is given by
the Liouville four-point function on the sphere. The gauge theory with N_f=4 is
known to exhibit SO(8) symmetry. We explain how the Weyl symmetry
transformations of SO(8) flavor symmetry are realized in the Liouville theory
picture. This is associated to functional properties of the Liouville
four-point function that are a priori unexpected. In turn, this can be thought
of as a non-trivial consistency check of AGT conjecture. We also make some
comments on elementary surface operators and WZW theory.
