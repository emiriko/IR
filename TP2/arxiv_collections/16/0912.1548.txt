Apoptosis is a highly regulated cell death mechanism involved in many
physiological processes. A key component of extrinsically activated apoptosis
is the death receptor Fas, which, on binding to its cognate ligand FasL,
oligomerize to form the death-inducing signaling complex. Motivated by recent
experimental data, we propose a mathematical model of death ligand-receptor
dynamics where FasL acts as a clustering agent for Fas, which form locally
stable signaling platforms through proximity-induced receptor interactions.
Significantly, the model exhibits hysteresis, providing an upstream mechanism
for bistability and robustness. At low receptor concentrations, the bistability
is contingent on the trimerism of FasL. Moreover, irreversible bistability,
representing a committed cell death decision, emerges at high concentrations,
which may be achieved through receptor pre-association or localization onto
membrane lipid rafts. Thus, our model provides a novel theory for these
observed biological phenomena within the unified context of bistability.
Importantly, as Fas interactions initiate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, our
model also suggests a mechanism by which cells may function as bistable
life/death switches independently of any such dynamics in their downstream
components. Our results highlight the role of death receptors in deciding cell
fate and add to the signal processing capabilities attributed to receptor
clustering.
