The formation of one-dimensional carbon chains from graphene nanoribbons is
investigated using it ab initio molecular dynamics. We show under what
conditions it is possible to obtain a linear atomic chain via pulling of the
graphene nanoribbons. The presence of dimers composed of two-coordinated carbon
atoms at the edge of the ribbons is necessary for the formation of the linear
chains, otherwise there is simply the full rupture of the structure. The
presence of Stone-Wales defects close to these dimers may lead to the formation
of longer chains. The local atomic configuration of the suspended atoms
indicates the formation of single and triple bonds, which is a characteristic
of polyynes.
