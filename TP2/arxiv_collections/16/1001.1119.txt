The magnetic phase diagram of Ce$_2$Pd$_2$Sn is investigated through the
field dependence of thermal, transport and magnetic measurements performed at
low temperature. The upper transition, $T_M=4.8$ K is practically not affected
by magnetic field up to B=1 T, whereas the lower one $T_C(B)$ rapidly increases
from 2.1 K joining $T_M$ in a critical point at $T_{cr}=(4.2\pm 0.3$)K for
$B_{cr}=(0.12\pm 0.03)$ T. At that point the intermediate phase, previously
described as an unstable Shastry-Sutherland phase, is suppressed. A detailed
analysis around the critical point reveals a structure in the maximum of the
$\partial M/\partial B(B)$ derivative which could be related to the formation
of a novel phase in that critical region.
