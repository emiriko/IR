We combine advanced image reconstruction techniques from computed X-ray micro
tomography (XCT) with state-of-the-art discrete element method simulations
(DEM) to study granular materials. This "virtual-laboratory" platform allows us
to access quantities, such as frictional forces, which would be otherwise
experimentally immeasurable.
