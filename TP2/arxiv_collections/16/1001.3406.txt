We use a disk formation model to study the effects of galactic outflows
(a.k.a. feedback) on the rotation velocity - stellar mass - disk size, gas
fraction - stellar mass, and gas phase metalicity - stellar mass scaling
relations of disk galaxies. We show that models without outflows are unable to
explain these scaling relations, having both the wrong slopes and
normalization. The problem can be traced to the model galaxies having too many
baryons. Models with outflows can solve this "over-cooling" problem by removing
gas before it has time to turn into stars. Models with both momentum and energy
driven winds can reproduce the observed scaling relations. However, these
models predict different slopes which, with better observations, may be used to
discriminate between these models.
