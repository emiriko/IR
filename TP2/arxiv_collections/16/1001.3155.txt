We study the properties of the Polyakov loop in strongly-coupled gauge
plasmas that are conjectured to be dual to five dimensional theories of gravity
coupled to a nontrivial single scalar field. We find a gravity dual that can
describe the thermodynamic properties and also the expectation value of the
Polyakov loop in the deconfined phase of quenched SU(3) QCD up to $3T_c$.
