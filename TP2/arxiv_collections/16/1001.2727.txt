We present a computer simulation study of a (6,12)-Lennard-Jones fluid
confined to a slit pore, formed by two uniform planes. These interact via a
(3,9)-Lennard-Jones potential with the fluid particles. When the fluid
approaches the liquid-to-solid transition we first observe layering parallel to
the walls. In order to investigate the nature of the freezing transition, we
performed a detailed analysis of the bond-orientational order parameter in the
layers. Changing the distance between the slit wall, we studied howthe
behaviour changes from a quasi-2d crystallization without hysteresis and an
intermediate hexatic phase to a standard 3d nucleation.
