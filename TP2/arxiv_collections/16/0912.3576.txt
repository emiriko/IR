We apply the approximating chiral quark model. This chiral quark model is
based on an effective Lagrangian which the interactions between quarks via
sigma and pions mesons. The field equations have been solved in the mean field
approximation for the hedgehog baryon state. Good results are obtained for
nucleon properties in comparison with original model.
