We propose a version of chaotic inflation, in which a fundamental scale M,
well below the Planck scale M_P, fixes the initial value of the effective
potential. If this scale happens to be the scale of grand unified theories,
there are just enough e-foldings of inflation. An initial epoch of fast-roll
breaks scale-invariance at the largest observable scales.
