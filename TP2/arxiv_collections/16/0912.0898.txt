In this paper, we discuss the available approches of the new governance
structures of standardization, in order to propose new hypothesis on the way
computer sciences languages are dealt with. We consider the example of the XML
language and its applications in order to propose a dynamic analysis of this
governance, focusing on the coordination that is done by companies, and the
strategic usage they have of these arenas to further their goals. We advocate
the development of more of such empirical analysis in order to cover all the
perspectives of possible international policies in this area.
