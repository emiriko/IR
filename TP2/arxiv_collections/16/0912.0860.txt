We study the ground state properties of the two-dimensional spin-1/2
J_1-J_2-Heisenberg model on a square lattice, within diagrammatic
approximations using an auxiliary fermion formulation with exact projection. In
a first approximation we assume a phenomenological width of the pseudofermion
spectral function to calculate the magnetization, susceptibilities and the spin
correlation length within RPA, demonstrating the appearance of a paramagnetic
phase between the Neel ordered and Collinear ordered phases, at sufficiently
large pseudo fermion damping. Secondly we use a Functional Renormalization
Group formulation. We find that the conventional truncation scheme omitting
three-particle and higher order vertices is not sufficient. We therefore
include self-energy renormalizations in the single-scale propagator as recently
proposed by Katanin, to preserve Ward identities in a better way. We find Neel
order at g = J_2/J_1 < 0.4 ... 0.45 and Collinear order at g > 0.66 ... 0.68,
which is in good agreement with results obtained by numerical studies. In the
intervening quantum paramagnetic phase we find enhanced columnar dimer and
plaquette fluctuations of equal strength.
