Both the theoretical and experimental discovery of single-Dirac-cone
topological-insulator-class was reported at arXiv:0812.2078 (2008) [Y. Xia
et.al., Nature Physics 5, 398-402 (2009)

  Here we report the first observation of Spin-Momentum Helical Locking and
Spin-Vortex structures in Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, demonstrate the existence of
Topological-Order at 300K and report a material realization of
topological-transport-regime for helical Dirac fermions. Our results reveal a
one-to-one spin-momentum locked Dirac structure in Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 that is
nearly 100% spin-polarized, which exhibits a tunable topological fermion
density in the vicinity of the Kramers' point and can be driven to the
long-sought topological-transport-regime. The observed topological nodal Dirac
ground state is found to be protected even up to room temperature (300 K). Our
results pave the way for future transport based studies of topological
insulators, and possible room temperature applications of protected
spin-polarized edge channels we observe with spin-ARPES in spintronic
technology. All of these new results are made possible due to the
Spin-resolved-ARPES (Mott polarimetric) technique
