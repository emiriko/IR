We investigate magnetic response in mesoscopic rings and moebius strips
penetrated by magnetic flux $\phi$. Based on a simple tight-binding framework
all the calculations are performed numerically which describe persistent
current and low-field magnetic susceptibility as functions of magnetic flux
$\phi$, total number of electrons $N_e$, system size $N$ and disorder strength
$W$. Our exact analysis may provide some important signatures to study magnetic
response in nano-scale loop geometries.
