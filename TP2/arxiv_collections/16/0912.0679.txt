Let $k$ be a field, $k^*=k\setminus\{0\}$ and $C_2$ the cyclic group of order
2. In this note we compute all the braided monoidal structures on the category
of $k$-vector spaces graded by the Klein group $C_2\times C_2$. Actually, for
the monoidal structures we will compute the explicit form of the 3-cocycles on
$C_2\times C_2$ with coefficients in $k^*$, while for the braided monoidal
structures we will compute the explicit form of the abelian 3-cocycles on
$C_2\times C_2$ with coefficients in $k^*$. In particular, this will allow us
to produce examples of quasi-Hopf algebras and weak braided Hopf algebras, out
of the vector space $k[C_2\times C_2]$.
