We present the results of local tunneling conductivity spatial distribution
detailed theoretical investigations in vicinity of impurity atom for a wide
range of applied bias voltage. We observed Fano resonance in tunneling
conductivity resulting from interference between resonant tunneling channel
through impurity energy level and direct tunneling channel between the
tunneling contact leads. We have found that interference between tunneling
channels strongly modifies form of tunneling conductivity measured by the
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) depending on the distance
value from the impurity.
