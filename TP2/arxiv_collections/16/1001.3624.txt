Non-contact interaction between two parallel flat surfaces is a central
paradigm in sciences. This situation is the starting point for a wealth of
different models: the capacitor description in electrostatics, hydrodynamic
flow, thermal exchange, the Casimir force, direct contact study, third body
confinement such as liquids or films of soft condensed matter. The control of
parallelism is so demanding that no versatile single force machine in this
geometry has been proposed so far. Using a combination of nanopositioning based
on inertial motors and microcrystal shaping with Focused Ion Beams (FIB) we
propose here an experimental set up that should enable one to measure
interactions between movable surfaces separated by gaps in the micrometer and
the nanometer ranges.
