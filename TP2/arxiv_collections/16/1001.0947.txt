The aim of this article is to build on the use of tools from computational
algebra initiated in Craciun, Dickenstein, Shiu, Sturmfels (JSC, 2009), for the
study of general kinetic systems, which have a wide range of applications in
chemistry and biology. We clarify the relation between the algebraic conditions
that must be satisfied by the reaction constants in general (mass action)
kinetics systems for the existence of detailed or complex balancing equilibria.
The main properties of these systems have been set by Horn, Jackson and
Feinberg.
