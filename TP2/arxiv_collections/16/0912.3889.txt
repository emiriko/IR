Z CMa is a binary system which consists of two young stars: A Herbig AeBe
component "Z CMa NW" embedded in a dust cocoon and a less massive component "Z
CMa SE", which is classified as a FU Orionis type star. Recently, the system
showed the largest outburst reported during the almost 90 years of available
observations. During the recent outburst we detect that the Z CMa system is
polarized by 2.6% in the continuum and emission line spectrum, with a position
angle still perpendicular to the jet. From the high level of polarization we
conclude that the outburst is associated with the dust embedded Herbig AeBe NW
component. The main result of our studies is that the bolometric luminosity of
Z CMa remained surprisingly constant during the recent "outburst". We conclude
that either the geometry of the cavity through which the light escapes from the
cocoon has opened a new path, or that the screen of dust, which reflects the
light toward the observer became more efficient causing the observed increase
of the visual brightness by about 2.5 magnitudes.
