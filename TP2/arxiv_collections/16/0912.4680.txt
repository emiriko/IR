Thermally stimulated diffusion of Mn across the (Ga,Mn)As/GaAs interface has
been studied by X-ray photoemission. Ga(0.95)Mn(0.05)As layers were capped with
GaAs of different thickness 4, 6 and 8ML, and Mn diffusing through the GaAs
layers was trapped on the surface by means of amorphous As covering the
surface. It was found that the out diffusion is strongly reduced for the 6 ML
GaAs film, and for the 8 ML film no Mn could be detected.
