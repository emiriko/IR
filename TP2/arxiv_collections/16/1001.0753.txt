We provide direct experimental evidence that the one-dimensional (1D) to
two-dimensional (2D) zigzag transition in a Yukawa cluster exhibits power law
behavior. Configurations of a six-particle dusty (complex) plasma confined in a
biharmonic potential well are characterized as the well anisotropy is reduced.
When the anisotropy is large the particles are in a 1D straight line
configuration. As the anisotropy is decreased the cluster undergoes a zigzag
transition to a 2D configuration. The measured dependence of cluster width on
anisotropy is well described by a power law. A second transition from the
zigzag to an elliptical configuration is also observed. The results are in very
good agreement with a model for particles interacting through a Yukawa
potential.
