In this article we study a general class of non-rotating thin-shell wormholes
with cylindrical symmetry. We consider two physically sound definitions of the
flare-out condition and we show that the less restrictive one allows for the
construction of wormholes with positive energy density at the throat. We also
analyze the mechanical stability of these objects under perturbations
preserving the symmetry, proving that previous results are particular cases of
a general property. We present examples of wormholes corresponding to
Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes.
