Bayesian phylogenetic methods are generating noticeable enthusiasm in the
field of molecular systematics. Many phylogenetic models are often at stake and
different approaches are used to compare them within a Bayesian framework. The
Bayes factor, defined as the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of two competing
models, plays a key role in Bayesian model selection. We focus on an
alternative estimator of the marginal likelihood whose computation is still a
challenging problem. Several computational solutions have been proposed none of
which can be considered outperforming the others simultaneously in terms of
simplicity of implementation, computational burden and precision of the
estimates. Practitioners and researchers, often led by available software, have
privileged so far the simplicity of the harmonic mean estimator (HM) and the
arithmetic mean estimator (AM). However it is known that the resulting
estimates of the Bayesian evidence in favor of one model are biased and often
inaccurate up to having an infinite variance so that the reliability of the
corresponding conclusions is doubtful. Our new implementation of the
generalized harmonic mean (GHM) idea recycles MCMC simulations from the
posterior, shares the computational simplicity of the original HM estimator,
but, unlike it, overcomes the infinite variance issue. The alternative
estimator is applied to simulated phylogenetic data and produces fully
satisfactory results outperforming those simple estimators currently provided
by most of the publicly available software.
