The Veldkamp space, in the sense of Buekenhout and Cohen, of the generalized
quadrangle GQ(4, 2) is shown not to be a (partial) linear space by simply
giving several examples of Veldkamp lines (V-lines) having two or even three
Veldkamp points (V-points) in common. Alongside the ordinary V-lines of size
five, one also finds V-lines of cardinality three and two. There, however,
exists a subspace of the Veldkamp space isomorphic to PG(3, 4) having 45 perps
and 40 plane ovoids as its 85 V-points, with its 357 V-lines being of four
distinct types. A V-line of the first type consists of five perps on a common
line (altogether 27 of them), the second type features three perps and two
ovoids sharing a tricentric triad (240 members), whilst the third and fourth
type each comprises a perp and four ovoids in the rosette centered at the
(common) center of the perp (90). It is also pointed out that 160 non-plane
ovoids (tripods) fall into two distinct orbits -- of sizes 40 and 120 -- with
respect to the stabilizer group of a copy of GQ(2, 2); a tripod of the
first/second orbit sharing with the GQ(2, 2) a tricentric/unicentric triad,
respectively. Finally, three remarkable subconfigurations of V-lines
represented by fans of ovoids through a fixed ovoid are examined in some
detail.
