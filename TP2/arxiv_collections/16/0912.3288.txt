Several transiting super-Earths are expected to be discovered in the coming
few years. While tools to model the interior structure of transiting planets
exist, inferences about the composition are fraught with ambiguities. We
present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly infer about
super-Earth and Neptune-size exoplanet interiors from radius and mass
measurements. We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of
possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core,
silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We apply our model to
CoRoT-7b, GJ 436b, and HAT-P-11b. Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes
is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for
CoRoT-7b observational uncertainties dominate. We further find that our planet
interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT-7b's mass and
radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or
gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a
super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar
observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest
composition constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from Bayesian
statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined
contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to
ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass
and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an
exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained. Detailed quantitative
ranges of plausible compositions, however, can be found.
