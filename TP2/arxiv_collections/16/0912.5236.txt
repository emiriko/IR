In the timescape scenario cosmic acceleration is understand as an apparent
effect, due to gravitational energy gradients that grow when spatial curvature
gradients become significant with the nonlinear growth of cosmic structure.
This affects the calibratation of local geometry to the solutions of the
volume-average evolution equations corrected by backreaction. In this paper I
discuss recent work on defining observational tests for average geometric
quantities which can distinguish the timescape model from a cosmological
constant or other models of dark energy.
