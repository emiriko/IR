We check the universality properties of the two-dimensional Abelian sandpile
model by computing some of its properties on the honeycomb lattice. Exact
expressions for unit height correlation functions in presence of boundaries and
for different boundary conditions are derived. Also, we study the statistics of
the boundaries of avalanche waves by using the theory of SLE and suggest that
these curves are conformally invariant and described by SLE2.
