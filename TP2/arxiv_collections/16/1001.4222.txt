We report the phase control of spatial interference of resonance fluorescence
from two duplicated two-level atoms, driving by two orthogonally polarized
fields. In this closed-loop system, the relative phase is of crucial importance
to the recovery of the interference patten in the fluorescence light even with
strong driving.In order to improve the experimental realizability, we propose a
scheme to recover the visibility with fixed relative phase by adjusting the
relative intensities between the two driving fields or alternatively by using a
standing-wave field.
