A method for construction of analytic function f of the annihilation operator
is given for the first time. f(z) is analytic on some compact domain that does
not separate the complex plane. A new form of the identity is given, which is
well suited for domain of function. Using Runge's polynomial approximation
theorem, such a function f of the annihilation operator is defined on the whole
domain. The constructed operators are given in terms of dyads formed of Fock
states.
