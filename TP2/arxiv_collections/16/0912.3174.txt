We calculate survival probability of a special state which couples randomly
to a regular or chaotic environment. The environment is modelled by a suitably
chosen random matrix ensemble. The exact results exhibit non--perturbative
features as revival of probability and non--ergodicity. The role of background
complexity and of coupling complexity is discussed as well.
