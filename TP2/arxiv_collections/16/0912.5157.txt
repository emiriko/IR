Particle number fluctuations and correlations in nucleus-nucleus collisions
at SPS and RHIC energies have been studied within the Hadron-String-Dynamics
(HSD) transport approach. Event-by-event fluctuations of pion-to-kaon,
proton-to-pion and kaon-to-proton number ratios are calculated for the samples
of most central collision events and compared with the available experimental
data. It has been found that the HSD model can qualitatively reproduce the
measured excitation function for the $K/\pi$ ratio fluctuations in central
Au+Au (or Pb+Pb) collisions from low SPS up to top RHIC energies. These
predictions impose a challenge for future experiments.
