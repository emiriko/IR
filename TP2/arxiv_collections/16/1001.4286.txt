A method is presented for realizing logic operations in a micromechanical
cantilever array based on the timed application of a lattice disturbance to
control the properties of intrinsic localized modes (ILMs). The application of
a specific inhomogeneous field destroys a driver-locked ILM, while the same
operation can create an ILM if initially no-ILM exists. Logic states "1" and
"0" correspond to "present" or "absent" ILM.
