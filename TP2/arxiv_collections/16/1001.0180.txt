We provide a very short approach to several fundamental results for Hopf
algebras with nonzero integrals. Besides being short, our approach is the first
to prove the bijectivity of the antipode without using the uniqueness of the
integrals of Hopf algebras and to obtain the uniqueness of integrals as a
corollary in a way similar to the classical theory of the Haar measure on
compact groups.
