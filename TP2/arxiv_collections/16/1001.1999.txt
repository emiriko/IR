Multifractal properties of the energy time series of short $\alpha$-helix
structures, specifically from a polyalanine family, are investigated through
the MF-DFA technique ({\it{multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis}}).
Estimates for the generalized Hurst exponent $h(q)$ and its associated
multifractal exponents $\tau(q)$ are obtained for several series generated by
numerical simulations of molecular dynamics in different systems from distinct
initial conformations. All simulations were performed using the GROMOS force
field, implemented in the program THOR. The main results have shown that all
series exhibit multifractal behavior depending on the number of residues and
temperature. Moreover, the multifractal spectra reveal important aspects on the
time evolution of the system and suggest that the nucleation process of the
secondary structures during the visits on the energy hyper-surface is an
essential feature of the folding process.
