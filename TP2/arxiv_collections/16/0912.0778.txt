Percolation and jamming phenomena are investigated for anisotropic sequential
deposition of dimers (particles occupying two adjacent adsorption sites) on a
square lattice. The influence of dimer alignment on the electrical conductivity
was examined. The percolation threshold for deposition of dimers was lower than
for deposition of monomers. Nevertheless, the problem belongs to the
universality class of random percolation. The lowest percolation threshold (pc
= 0.562) was observed for isotropic orientation of dimers. It was higher (pc =
0.586) in the case of dimers aligned strictly along one direction. The state of
dimer orientation influenced the concentration dependence of electrical
conductivity. The proposed model seems to be useful for description of the
percolating properties of anisotropic conductors.
