Previous attempts for building a cosmic dynamo including preheating in
inflationary universes [Bassett et al Phys Rev (2001)] has not included mean
field dynamos. Here, a mean field dynamo in cosmic scales on a Riemannian
spatial cosmological section background, is set up. When magnetic fields and
flow velocities are parallel propagated along the Riemannian space dynamo
action is obtained. Turbulent diffusivity ${\beta}$ is coupled with the Ricci
magnetic curvature, as in Marklund and Clarkson [MNRAS (2005)], GR-MHD dynamo
equation. Mean electric field possesses an extra term due to Ricci tensor
coupling with magnetic vector potential in Ohm's law. Goedel universe induces a
mean field dynamo growth rate ${\gamma}=2{\omega}^{2}{\beta}$. In this frame
kinetic helicity vanishes. By considering a universe vorticity,
${\omega}\approx{10^{-16}s^{-1}}$ for galactic dynamos, thus
${\gamma}=2.10^{-32}{\beta}$, and since ${\beta}\approx{10^{26}cm^{2}s^{-1}}$,
the growth rate ${\gamma}\approx{10^{-6}s^{-1}}$. In non-comoving the magnetic
field is expressed as
$B\approx{\sqrt{\frac{2{\beta}}{\gamma}}{\times}10^{-6}G}\approx{10^{10}G}$ a
magnetic field found in the nucleosynthesis era. The Ricci scalar turbulence
spectrum of the cosmic dynamos is computed from the GR-MHD dynamo equation. By
analyzing the Fourier modes of the Ricci scalar, one shows that the energy
spectrum of the curvature turbulent dynamo is similar to the Kolmogorov
spectrum. Similar enhancements of turbulence in Friedmann cosmology have been
obtained by Brandenburg et al [Phys Rev D (1997)].
