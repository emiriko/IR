We analyze mechanisms and regimes of wave packet spreading in nonlinear
disordered media. We predict that wave packets can spread in two regimes of
strong and weak chaos. We discuss resonance probabilities, nonlinear diffusion
equations, and predict a dynamical crossover from strong to weak chaos. The
crossover is controlled by the ratio of nonlinear frequency shifts and the
average eigenvalue spacing of eigenstates of the linear equations within one
localization volume. We consider generalized models in higher lattice
dimensions and obtain critical values for the nonlinearity power, the
dimension, and norm density, which influence possible dynamical outcomes in a
qualitative way.
