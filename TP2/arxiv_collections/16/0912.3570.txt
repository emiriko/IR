For spin-1/2 particles, using a suitable Mach-Zehnder-type setup with a
spin-flipper, we argue that it is a direct consequence of the quantum
mechanical treatment that an experimentally verifiable \textit{subensemble}
mean of the measured values of an arbitrarily chosen spin variable exhibits
dependence on the choice of a comeasurable `path' observable. This, in turn,
enables inferring path-spin contextuality at the level of individual measured
values of spin that are predetermined using a relevant hidden-variable model
applied to our setup.
