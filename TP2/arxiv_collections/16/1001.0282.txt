In this paper a new approach to image watermarking in wavelet domain is
presented. The idea is to hide the watermark data in blocks of the block
segmented image. Two schemes are presented based on this idea by embedding the
watermark data in the low pass wavelet coefficients of each block. Due to low
computational complexity of the proposed approach, this algorithm can be
implemented in real time. Experimental results demonstrate the
impercepti-bility of the proposed method and its high robustness against
various attacks such as filtering, JPEG compres-sion, cropping, noise addition
and geometric distortions.
