The strong coupling constant is a fundamental parameter of nature. It can be
extracted from experiments measuring three-jet events in electron-positron
annihilation. For this extraction precise theoretical calculations for jet
rates and event shapes are needed. In this talk I will discuss the NNLO
calculation for these observables.
