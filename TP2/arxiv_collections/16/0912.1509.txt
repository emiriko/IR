We review and elaborate on certain aspects of the connections between
instanton counting in maximally supersymmetric gauge theories and the
computation of enumerative invariants of smooth varieties. We study in detail
three instances of gauge theories in six, four and two dimensions which
naturally arise in the context of topological string theory on certain
non-compact threefolds. We describe how the instanton counting in these gauge
theories are related to the computation of the entropy of supersymmetric black
holes, and how these results are related to wall-crossing properties of
enumerative invariants such as Donaldson-Thomas and Gromov-Witten invariants.
Some features of moduli spaces of torsion-free sheaves and the computation of
their Euler characteristics are also elucidated.
