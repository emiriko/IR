After the completion of the gallium solar neutrino experiments at the
Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (GALLEX}: 1991-1997; GNO: 1998-2003) we
have retrospectively updated the GALLEX results with the help of new technical
data that were impossible to acquire for principle reasons before the
completion of the low rate measurement phase (that is, before the end of the
GNO solar runs). Subsequent high rate experiments have allowed the calibration
of absolute internal counter efficiencies and of an advanced pulse shape
analysis for counter background discrimination. The updated overall result for
GALLEX (only) is (73.4 +7.1 -7.3) SNU. This is 5.3% below the old value of
(77.5 + 7.5 -7.8) SNU (PLB 447 (1999) 127-133) with a substantially reduced
error. A similar reduction is obtained from the reanalysis of the 51Cr neutrino
source experiments of 1994/1995.
