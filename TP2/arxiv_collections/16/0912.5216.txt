We discuss possible radio bursts which can be generated during binary neutron
stars mergers associated with short gamma-ray bursts. Low-frequency radio band
appear to be advantageous due to the time delay of a radio signal propagating
in the intergalactic medium, which makes it possible to use short gamma-ray
burst alerts to search for specific regions on the sky by low-frequency radio
instruments, especially LOFAR. The LOFAR sensitivity will allow significant
detection of such bursts up to redshifts z~0.3 with a rate of ~25 events per
year.
