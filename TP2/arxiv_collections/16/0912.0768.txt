Based the Alfven wave oscillation model (AWOM) and relativistic precession
model (RPM) for twin kHz QPOs, we estimate the emission positions of most
detected kHz QPOs to be at r=18+-3 km (R/15km) except Cir X-1 at r = 30\+-5 km
(R/15km). For the proposed Keplerian frequency as an upper limit to kHz QPO,
the spin effects in Kerr Spacetime are discussed, which have about a 5% (2%)
modification for that of the Schwarzchild case for the spin frequency of 1000
(400) Hz.The application to the four typical QPO sources, Cir X-1, Sco X-1, SAX
J1808.4-3658 and XTE 1807-294, is mentioned.
