Let X be a projective irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold. The second
integral cohomology of X is a lattice with respect to the Beauville-Bogomolov
pairing. A divisor E on X is called a prime exceptional divisor, if E is
reduced and irreducible and of negative Beauville-Bogomolov degree.
  Let E be a prime exceptional divisor on X. We first observe that associated
to E is a monodromy involution of the integral cohomology of X, which acts on
the second cohomology lattice as the reflection by the cohomology class of E
(Theorem 1.1).
  We then specialize to the case that X is deformation equivalent to the
Hilbert scheme of length n zero-dimensional subschemes of a K3 surface. We
determine the set of classes of exceptional divisors on X (Theorem 1.11). This
leads to a determination of the closure of the movable cone of X.
