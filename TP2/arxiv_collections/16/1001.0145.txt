We calculate nucleosynthesis of proton-rich isotopes in the
carbon-deflagration model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The seed abundances
are obtained by calculating the s-process nucleosynthesis that is expected to
occur in the repeating helium shell flashes on the carbon-oxygen (CO) white
dwarf (WD) during mass accretion from a binary companion. When the deflagration
wave passes through the outer layer of the CO WD, p-nuclei are produced by
photodisintegration reactions on s-nuclei in a region with the peak temperature
ranging from 1.9 to 3.6 x10^9 K. We confirm the sensitivity of the p-process on
the initial distribution of s-nuclei. We show that the initial C/O ratio in the
WD does not much affect the yield of p-nuclei. On the other hand, the abundance
of 22Ne left after the s-processing has a large influence on the p-process via
22Ne(alpha,n) reaction. We find that about 50% of p-nuclides are co-produced
when normalized to their solar abundances in all adopted cases of seed
distribution. Mo and Ru, which are largely underproduced in Type II supernovae
(SNe II), are produced more than in SNe II although they are underproduced with
respect to the yield levels of other p-nuclides. The ratios between p-nuclei
and iron in the ejecta are larger than the solar ratios by a factor of 1.2. We
also compare the yields of oxygen, iron, and p-nuclides in SNe Ia and SNe II
and suggest that SNe Ia could make a larger contribution than SNe II to the
solar system content of p-nuclei.
