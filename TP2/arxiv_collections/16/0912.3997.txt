We consider the problem of neutrino masses and mixing in the framework of
flipped SU(5). The right-handed neutrino mass, generated through the operation
of a seesaw mechanism by a sector of gauge singlets, leads naturally, at a
subsequent level, to the standard seesaw mechanism resulting into three light
neutrino states with masses of the desired phenomenological order of magnitude.
In this framework we study simple Ansatze for the singlet couplings for which
hierarchical neutrino masses emerge naturally, parametrized in terms of the
Cabbibo parameter. The resulting neutrino mixing matrices are characterized by
a hierarchical structure, in which theta-(13) is always predicted to be the
smallest. Finally, we discuss a possible factorized parametrization of the
neutrino mass that, in addition to Cabbibo mixing, encodes also mixing due to
the singlet sector.
