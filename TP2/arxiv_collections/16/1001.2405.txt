Dendritic Cells (DCs) are innate immune system cells which have the power to
activate or suppress the immune system. The behaviour of human of human DCs is
abstracted to form an algorithm suitable for anomaly detection. We test this
algorithm on the real-time problem of port scan detection. Our results show a
significant difference in artificial DC behaviour for an outgoing portscan when
compared to behaviour for normal processes.
