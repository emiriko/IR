Among all biometric, dorsal hand vein pattern is attracting the attention of
researchers, of late. Extensive research is being carried out on various
techniques in the hope of finding an efficient one which can be applied on
dorsal hand vein pattern to improve its accuracy and matching time. One of the
crucial step in biometric is the extraction of features. In this paper, we
propose a method based on quadratic inference function to the dorsal hand vein
features to extract its features. The biometric system developed was tested on
a database of 100 images. The false acceptance rate (FAR), false rejection rate
(FRR) and the matching time are being computed.
