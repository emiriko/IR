The Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) is an array of cryogenically cooled
radiometers on board the Planck satellite, designed to measure the temperature
and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave backgrond (CMB) at 30, 44
and 70 GHz. The thermal requirements of the LFI, and in particular the
stringent limits to acceptable thermal fluctuations in the 20 K focal plane,
are a critical element to achieve the instrument scientific performance.
Thermal tests were carried out as part of the on-ground calibration campaign at
various stages of instrument integration. In this paper we describe the results
and analysis of the tests on the LFI flight model (FM) performed at Thales
Laboratories in Milan (Italy) during 2006, with the purpose of experimentally
sampling the thermal transfer functions and consequently validating the
numerical thermal model describing the dynamic response of the LFI focal plane.
This model has been used extensively to assess the ability of LFI to achieve
its scientific goals: its validation is therefore extremely important in the
context of the Planck mission. Our analysis shows that the measured thermal
properties of the instrument show a thermal damping level better than
predicted, therefore further reducing the expected systematic effect induced in
the LFI maps. We then propose an explanation of the increased damping in terms
of non-ideal thermal contacts.
