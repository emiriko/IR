I present a progress report on including all the lines in the linelists,
including all the lines in the opacities, including all the lines in the model
atmosphere and spectrum synthesis calculations, producing high-resolution,
high-signal-to-noise atlases that show (not quite) all the lines, so that
finally we can determine the properties of stars from a few of the lines.
