In the eighth century BC something peculiar seems to happen on Sicily. The
archaeological record starts to show the arrival of Greek material culture. By
the fifth century BC the island is effectively 'Hellenised' and ancient
historians record the political and military action of poleis, Greek
city-states. Each polis has traditionally been seen as the offshoot of a city
elsewhere. Genealogies of cities ultimately end in cities found in the cities
of the Peloponnese and the Aegean. The 'Greek' identity of the Sicilian cities
is part of a wider debate on the concept of Identity in the ancient world. This
paper considers if there is a contribution archaeoastronomers can make to such
discussions by considering the alignments of Greek temples. Greek religion was
intimately related to notions of civic identity and what it meant to be
'Greek'. I propose a method of studying small samples of temples, which
combines both alignment analysis and historical context. Therefore it may be
possible that a study of the temples may yield useful information about
collective identities. However, as this method shows, the more ambiguous the
cultural data the less certain any astronomical patterns may be.
