We formulate a complete microscopic theory of a coupled pair of bound
magnetic polarons, the bound-magnetic-polaron molecule (BMPM) in a diluted
magnetic semiconductor (DMS) by taking into account both a proper two-body
nature of the impurity-electron wave function and within the general
spin-rotation-invariant approach to the electronic states. We also take into
account both the Heisenberg and the antiferromagnetic kinetic-exchange
interactions, as well as the ferromagnetic coupling within the common spin BMPM
cloud. The thermodynamic fluctuations of the spin cloud within the polaron
effective Bohr radius of each polaron are taken as Gaussian.
