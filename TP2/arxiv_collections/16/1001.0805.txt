The LEPS collaboration has recently reported a measurement of the reaction
$\gamma n\to K^+\Sigma^{*-}(1385)$ with linearly polarized photon beam at
resonance region. The observed beam asymmetry is sizably negative at
$E_\gamma=1.8-2.4 \mathrm{GeV}$, in contrast to the presented theoretical
prediction. In this paper, we calculate this process in the framework of the
effective Lagrangian approach. By including a newly proposed
$\Sigma(J^P={1\over2}^-)$ state with mass around 1380~MeV, the experimental
data for both $\gamma n$ and $\gamma p$ experiments can be well reproduced. It
is found that the $\Sigma({1\over2}^-)$ and/or the contact term may play
important role and deserve further investigation.
