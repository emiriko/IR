A recent observation of the two candidate events of the dark matter recoiling
at CDMS-II is suggestive of dark matter with a mass not far above 100GeV. We
propose a model of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking where the lightest
neutralino is identified as dark matter which may provide the observed signals.
