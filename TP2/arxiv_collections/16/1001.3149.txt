In a strong-coupling picture of ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking, a composite
electroweak-neutral state in the TeV mass range, carrying a global
(quasi-)conserved charge, makes a plausible Dark Matter (DM) candidate, with
the ongoing direct DM searches being precisely sensitive to the expected
signals. To exploit the crucial interplay between direct DM searches and the
LHC, we consider a composite iso-singlet vector $V$, mixed with the hypercharge
gauge field, as the essential mediator of the interaction between the DM
particle and the nucleus. Based on a suitable effective chiral Lagrangian, we
give the expected properties and production rates of $V$, showing its possible
discovery at the maximal LHC energy with about 100 fb^{-1} of integrated
luminosity.
