Evolution needs long times and large numbers of samples or species. Our
finely tuned physics can therefore not have evolved during the fast changes of
a single Big-Bang universe, but the cosmological scales for time and for the
number of universes in the multiverse satisfy that condition. Planck and
Chandrasekhar equations show that multiverse.
  A variety of observations show the origin of our physics. The multiverse is
being fed by the debris of its decaying universes, which is transported on the
accelerated expansion. New universes originate from clouds of that debris,
which is re-energized by the gravity at the center of the cloud when the proton
density is reached. That epoch occurs much later than a Big Bang. It marks the
beginning of our universe with a photon burst, which may have been observed by
spacecraft as the radiation signature with a wider curvature than that of the
cosmic background radiation. A test for black holes, published by Karl
Schwarzschild in 1916, also confirms that beginning.
