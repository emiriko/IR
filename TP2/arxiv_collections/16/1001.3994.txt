We briefly review the recent progress in the study of higher order
corrections to hadron scattering processes involving top quark pairs in the
final state. In particular, we discuss the Monte-Carlo simulation of the $pp
\to t \bar{t} b \bar{b}$ process at the next-to-leading order with the help of
the {\tt Helac-NLO} system, and the status of the soft-gluon resummation
program for $pp \to t \bar{t}$ near threshold at the next-to-next-to-leading
order.
