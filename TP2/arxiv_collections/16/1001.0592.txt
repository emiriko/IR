Innovative auction methods can be exploited to increase profits, with
Shubik's famous "dollar auction" perhaps being the most widely known example.
Recently, some mainstream e-commerce web sites have apparently achieved the
same end on a much broader scale, by using "pay-per-bid" auctions to sell
items, from video games to bars of gold. In these auctions, bidders incur a
cost for placing each bid in addition to (or sometimes in lieu of) the winner's
final purchase cost. Thus even when a winner's purchase cost is a small
fraction of the item's intrinsic value, the auctioneer can still profit
handsomely from the bid fees. Our work provides novel analyses for these
auctions, based on both modeling and datasets derived from auctions at
Swoopo.com, the leading pay-per-bid auction site. While previous modeling work
predicts profit-free equilibria, we analyze the impact of information asymmetry
broadly, as well as Swoopo features such as bidpacks and the Swoop It Now
option specifically, to quantify the effects of imperfect information in these
auctions. We find that even small asymmetries across players (cheaper bids,
better estimates of other players' intent, different valuations of items,
committed players willing to play "chicken") can increase the auction duration
well beyond that predicted by previous work and thus skew the auctioneer's
profit disproportionately. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of a
dataset of thousands of live auctions we observed on Swoopo, which enables us
also to examine behavioral factors, such as the power of aggressive bidding.
Ultimately, our findings show that even with fully rational players, if players
overlook or are unaware any of these factors, the result is outsized profits
for pay-per-bid auctioneers.
