Recently, a novel adaptive wave model for financial option pricing has been
proposed in the form of adaptive nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation
[Ivancevic a], as a high-complexity alternative to the linear
Black-Scholes-Merton model [Black-Scholes-Merton]. Its quantum-mechanical basis
has been elaborated in [Ivancevic b]. Both the solitary and shock-wave
solutions of the nonlinear model, as well as its linear (periodic) quantum
simplification are shown to successfully fit the Black-Scholes data, and define
the financial Greeks. This initial wave model (called the Ivancevic option
pricing model) has been further extended in [Yan], by providing the new NLS
solutions in the form of rogue waves (one-rogon and two-rogon solutions). In
this letter, I propose a new financial research program, with a goal to develop
a general wave-type model for realistic option-pricing prediction and control.
