Motivated by the need for a solid state strange quark matter to better
explain some observational phenomena, we discussed possibility of color singlet
cluster formation in cold strange quark matter by a rough calculation following
the excluded volume method proposed by Clark et al (1986) and adopted quark
mass density dependent model with cubic scaling. It is found that 70% to 75% of
volume and 80% to 90% of baryon number is in clusters at temperature from 10MeV
to 50MeV and 1 to 10 times nuclear density.
