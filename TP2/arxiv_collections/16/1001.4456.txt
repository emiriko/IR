We implemented sink particles in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
hydrodynamics code FLASH. Sink particles are created in regions of local
gravitational collapse, and their trajectories and accretion can be followed
over many dynamical times. We perform a series of tests including the time
integration of circular and elliptical orbits, the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert
sphere and a rotating, fragmenting cloud core. We compare the collapse of a
highly unstable singular isothermal sphere to the theory by Shu (1977), and
show that the sink particle accretion rate is in excellent agreement with the
theoretical prediction.
  To model eccentric orbits and close encounters of sink particles accurately,
we show that a very small timestep is often required, for which we implemented
subcycling of the N-body system. We emphasize that a sole density threshold for
sink particle creation is insufficient in supersonic flows, if the density
threshold is below the opacity limit. In that case, the density can exceed the
threshold in strong shocks that do not necessarily lead to local collapse.
Additional checks for bound state, gravitational potential minimum, Jeans
instability and converging flows are absolutely necessary for a meaningful
creation of sink particles.
  We apply our new sink particle module for FLASH to the formation of a stellar
cluster, and compare to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code with sink
particles. Our comparison shows encouraging agreement of gas properties,
indicated by column density distributions and radial profiles, and of sink
particle formation times and positions. We find excellent agreement in the
number of sink particles formed, and in their accretion and mass distributions.
