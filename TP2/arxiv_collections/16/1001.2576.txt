In this paper we describe a HepML format and a corresponding C++ library
developed for keeping complete description of parton level events in a unified
and flexible form. HepML tags contain enough information to understand what
kind of physics the simulated events describe and how the events have been
prepared. A HepML block can be included into event files in the LHEF format.
The structure of the HepML block is described by means of several XML Schemas.
The Schemas define necessary information for the HepML block and how this
information should be located within the block. The library libhepml is a C++
library intended for parsing and serialization of HepML tags, and representing
the HepML block in computer memory. The library is an API for external
software. For example, Matrix Element Monte Carlo event generators can use the
library for preparing and writing a header of a LHEF file in the form of HepML
tags. In turn, Showering and Hadronization event generators can parse the HepML
header and get the information in the form of C++ classes. libhepml can be used
in C++, C, and Fortran programs. All necessary parts of HepML have been
prepared and we present the project to the HEP community.
