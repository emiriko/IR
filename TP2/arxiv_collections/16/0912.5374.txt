Contact effects in devices incorporating strongly-correlated electronic
materials are comparatively unexplored. We have investigated the
electrically-driven phase transition in magnetite (100) thin films by
four-terminal methods. In the lateral configuration, the channel length is less
than 2 $\mu$m, and voltage-probe wires $\sim$100 nm in width are directly
patterned within the channel. Multilead measurements quantitatively separate
the contributions of each electrode interface and the magnetite channel. We
demonstrate that on the onset of the transition contact resistances at both
source and drain electrodes and the resistance of magnetite channel decrease
abruptly. Temperature dependent electrical measurements below the Verwey
temperature indicate thermally activated transport over the charge gap. The
behavior of the magnetite system at a transition point is consistent with a
theoretically predicted transition mechanism of charge gap closure by electric
field.
