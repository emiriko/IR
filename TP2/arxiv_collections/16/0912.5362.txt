This paper has two parts, for a specific multiverse, and for the origin of
our universe as it resulted from that multiverse. The first is based on the
Planck domain and a Chandrasekhar equation that have quantum, relativity,
gravity, and atomic physics in unified operation. The multiverse is an
evolutionary system whereby universes survive only when they have those
physics, and near-critical mass such that they do not collapse, nor expand too
fast.
  The second part is based on 15 sets of observations of nucleosynthesis and
particle properties, aging and demise for our universe, as well as of its early
stages. The multiverse is supplied by debris from the aging universes, arriving
on the accelerated expansion of intergalactic space. New universes accrete from
the debris, which is re-energized and re-constituted gravitationally. In the
process, the basic particle properties appear to have been preserved such that
our universe originated much later, than it would have done in a Big Bang. The
limit of Schwarzschild provides a confirmation, and information on dark energy.
