Exciton spin dynamics in quasi-spherical CdS quantum dots is studied in
detail experimentally and theoretically. Exciton states are calculated using
the 6-band k.p Hamiltonian. It is shown that for various sets of Luttinger
parameters, when the wurtzite lattice crystal field splitting and Coulomb
interaction between the electron-hole pair are taken into account exactly, both
the electron and hole wavefunction in the lowest exciton state are of S-type.
This rules out the spatial-symmetry-induced origin of the dark exciton in CdS
quantum dots. The exciton bleaching dynamics is studied using time- and
polarization-resolved transient absorption technique of ultrafast laser
spectroscopy. Several samples with a different mean size of CdS quantum dots in
different glass matrices were investigated. This enabled the separation of
effects that are typical for one particular sample from those that are general
for this type of material. The experimentally determined dependence of the
electron spin relaxation rate on the radius of quantum dots agrees well with
that computed theoretically.
