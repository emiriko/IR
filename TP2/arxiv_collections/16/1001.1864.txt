We show that the peculiar surface abundance patterns of Carbon Enhanced Metal
Poor (CEMP) stars has been inherited from material having been processed by H-
and He-burning phases in a previous generation of stars (hereafter called the
``Source Stars''). In this previous generation, some mixing must have occurred
between the He- and the H-burning regions in order to explain the high observed
abundances of nitrogen. In addition, it is necessary to postulate that a very
small fraction of the carbon-oxygen core has been expelled (either by winds or
by the supernova explosion). Therefore only the most outer layers should have
been released by the Source Stars. Some of the CEMP stars may be He-rich if the
matter from the Source Star is not too much diluted with the InterStellar
Medium (ISM). Those stars formed from nearly pure ejecta would also be Li-poor.
