We present a data storage scheme for sensor networks that achieves the
targets of encryption and distributed storage simultaneously. We partition the
data to be stored into numerous pieces such that at least a specific number of
them have to be brought together to recreate the data. The procedure for
creation of partitions does not use any encryption key and the pieces are
implicitly secure. These pieces are then distributed over random sensors for
storage. Capture or malfunction of one or more (less than a threshold number of
sensors) does not compromise the data. The scheme provides protection against
compromise of data in specific sensors due to physical capture or malfunction.
