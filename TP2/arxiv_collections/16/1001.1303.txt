We suggest that LISA Pathfinder could be used to subject TEVES, and in
particular the non-relativistic MOND phenomenology it incorporates, to a
direct, controlled experimental test, in just a few years' time. The basic
concept is to fly LISA Pathfinder through the region around the Sun-Earth
saddle point, following its nominal mission, in order to look for anomalous
gravity gradients. We examine various strategies to reach the saddle point, and
conclude that the preferred strategy, resulting in relatively short transfer
times of order one year, probably involves a lunar fly-by. We present robust
estimates of the MOND gravity gradients that LISA Pathfinder should be exposed
to, and conclude that if the gradiometer on-board the spacecraft achieves its
nominal performance, these gradients will not just be detected, but measured
and characterised in some detail, should they exist. Conversely, given the
large predicted signal based on standard assumptions, a null result would most
likely spell the end of TEVES/MOND.
