We present a study of the inelastic decay rate of quasiparticles in a
two-dimensional electron gas with spin-orbit interaction. The study is done
within the G0W0 approximation. The spin-orbit interaction is taken in the most
general form that includes both Rashba and Dresselhaus contributions linear in
magnitude of the electron 2D momentum. Spin-orbit interaction effect on the
inelastic decay rate is examined at different parameters characterizing the
interaction strength in the electron gas.
