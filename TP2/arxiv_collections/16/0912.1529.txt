We present the results of a search for UV and optical counterparts of the SSS
population in M31. We find that out of the 56 sources we included in our
search, 16 are associated with regions of ongoing or recent star formation. We
discuss two particularly interesting sources that are identified optically as
early type stars, one of which displayed long term X-ray evolution similar to
that observed in classical novae. We discuss the physical origin of supersoft
X-rays in these and the other SSS in young regions, and their possible link to
the so-called "prompt" component of the Type Ia supernova population.
