There are at least two ways to interpret numerical degrees of belief in terms
of betting: (1) you can offer to bet at the odds defined by the degrees of
belief, or (2) you can judge that a strategy for taking advantage of such
betting offers will not multiply the capital it risks by a large factor. Both
interpretations can be applied to ordinary additive probabilities and used to
justify updating by conditioning. Only the second can be applied to
Dempster-Shafer degrees of belief and used to justify Dempster's rule of
combination.
