We demonstrate the use of an optical frequency comb to coherently control and
entangle atomic qubits. A train of off-resonant ultrafast laser pulses is used
to efficiently and coherently transfer population between electronic and
vibrational states of trapped atomic ions and implement an entangling quantum
logic gate with high fidelity. This technique can be extended to the high field
regime where operations can be performed faster than the trap frequency. This
general approach can be applied to more complex quantum systems, such as large
collections of interacting atoms or molecules.
