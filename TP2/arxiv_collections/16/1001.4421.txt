The possibility of using hexagonal structures in general and graphene in
particular to emulate the Dirac equation is the basis of our considerations. We
show that Dirac oscillators with or without restmass can be emulated by
distorting a tight binding model on a hexagonal structure. In a quest to make a
toy model for such relativistic equations we first show that a hexagonal
lattice of attractive potential wells would be a good candidate. First we
consider the corresponding one-dimensional model giving rise to a
one-dimensional Dirac oscillator, and then construct explicitly the
deformations needed in the two-dimensional case. Finally we discuss, how such a
model can be implemented as an electromagnetic billiard using arrays of
dielectric resonators between two conducting plates that ensure evanescent
modes outside the resonators for transversal electric modes, and describe an
appropriate experimental setup.
