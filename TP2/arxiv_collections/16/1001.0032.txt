In addition to its great potential for characterizing extra-solar planetary
systems the Kepler mission is providing unique data on stellar oscillations. A
key aspect of Kepler asteroseismology is the application to solar-like
oscillations of main-sequence stars. As an example we here consider an initial
analysis of data for three stars in the Kepler field for which planetary
transits were known from ground-based observations. For one of these, HAT-P-7,
we obtain a detailed frequency spectrum and hence strong constraints on the
stellar properties. The remaining two stars show definite evidence for
solar-like oscillations, yielding a preliminary estimate of their mean
densities.
