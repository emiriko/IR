We study proton rich nucleosynthesis in windlike outflows from gamma-ray
bursts accretion disks with the aim to determine if such outflows are a site of
the vp-process. The efficacy of this vp-process depends on thermodynamic and
hydrodynamic factors. We discuss the importance of the entropy of the material,
the outflow rate, the initial ejection point and accretion rate of the disk. In
some cases the vp-process pushes the nucleosynthesis out to A~100 and produces
light p-nuclei. However, even when these nuclei are not produced, neutrino
induced interactions can significantly alter the abundance pattern and cannot
be neglected.
