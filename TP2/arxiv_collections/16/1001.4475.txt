We consider a generalization of stochastic bandits where the set of arms,
$\cX$, is allowed to be a generic measurable space and the mean-payoff function
is "locally Lipschitz" with respect to a dissimilarity function that is known
to the decision maker. Under this condition we construct an arm selection
policy, called HOO (hierarchical optimistic optimization), with improved regret
bounds compared to previous results for a large class of problems. In
particular, our results imply that if $\cX$ is the unit hypercube in a
Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a finite number of global
maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally continuous with a
known smoothness degree, then the expected regret of HOO is bounded up to a
logarithmic factor by $\sqrt{n}$, i.e., the rate of growth of the regret is
independent of the dimension of the space. We also prove the minimax optimality
of our algorithm when the dissimilarity is a metric. Our basic strategy has
quadratic computational complexity as a function of the number of time steps
and does not rely on the doubling trick. We also introduce a modified strategy,
which relies on the doubling trick but runs in linearithmic time. Both results
are improvements with respect to previous approaches.
