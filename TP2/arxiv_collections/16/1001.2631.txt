We have investigated the domain wall resistance for two types of domain walls
in a (Ga,Mn)As Hall bar with perpendicular magnetization. A sizeable positive
intrinsic DWR is inferred for domain walls that are pinned at an etching step,
which is quite consistent with earlier observations. However, much lower
intrinsic domain wall resistance is obtained when domain walls are formed by
pinning lines in unetched material. This indicates that the spin transport
across a domain wall is strongly influenced by the nature of the pinning.
