An analysis is given connecting event rates for the direct detection of
neutralino dark matter with the possible signatures of supersymmetry at the
LHC. It is shown that if an effect is seen in the direct detection experiments
at a level of $O(10^{-44})$ cm$^2$ for the neutralino-proton cross section,
then within the mSUGRA model the next heavier particle above the neutralino is
either a stau, a chargino, or a CP odd/CP even (A/H) Higgs boson. Further, the
collider analysis shows that models with a neutralino-proton cross section at
the level of $(1-5)\times 10^{-44}$ cm$^2$ could be probed with as little as 1
fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity at the LHC at $\sqrt s=10$ TeV. The most
recent limit from the five tower CDMS II result on WIMP-nucleon cross section
is discussed in this context. It is argued that the conclusions of the analysis
given here are more broadly applicable with inclusion of non-universalities in
the SUGRA models.
