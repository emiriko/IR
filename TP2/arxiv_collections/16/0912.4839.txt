The present paper is concerned with large-time behavior of solutions to an
outflow problem for an ideal polytropic model of compressible viscous gases in
one-dimensional half space, and with a convergence rate of solutions toward a
corresponding stationary solution. With the aid of center manifold theory, we
prove the existence of the stationary solution, under a smallness condition on
the boundary data. We also investigate, by employing an energy method, the time
asymptotic stability of the stationary solution under suitable smallness
assumptions, and estimate the convergence rate which coincides with the spatial
decay rate of the initial perturbation. The proof is mainly based on a priori
estimates, which are derived by a time and space weighted energy method.
