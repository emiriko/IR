The induced charge density, $\rho_{ind}(\bm r)$, generated in graphene by the
potential well of the finite radius $R$ is considered. The result for
$\rho_{ind}(\bm r)$ is derived for large distances $r\gg R$. We also obtained
the induced charges outside of the radius $r\gg R$ and inside of this radius
for subcritical and supercritical regimes. The consideration is based on the
convenient representation of the induced charge density via the Green's
function of electron in the field.
