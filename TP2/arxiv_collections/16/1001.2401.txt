We present a catalog of detailed visual classifications for 14034 galaxies in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4 (DR4). Our sample includes
nearly all spectroscopically-targeted galaxies in the redshift range 0.01<z<0.1
down to an apparent extinction-corrected limit of g<16 mag. In addition to
T-Types we record the existence of bars, rings, lenses, tails, warps, dust
lanes, arm flocculence and multiplicity. This sample defines a comprehensive
local galaxy sample which we will use in future papers to study low redshift
morphology. It will also prove useful for calibrating automated galaxy
classification algorithms. In this paper we describe the classification
methodology used, detail the systematics and biases of our sample and summarize
the overall statistical properties of the sample, noting the most obvious
trends that are relevant for general comparisons of our catalog with previously
published work.
