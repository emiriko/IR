We say that a subset $S\subseteq F_N$ is \emph{spectrally rigid} if whenever
$T_1, T_2\in cv_N$ are points of the (unprojectivized) Outer space such that
$||g||_{T_1}=||g||_{T_2}$ for every $g\in S$ then $T_1=T_2$ in $\cvn$. It is
well-known that $F_N$ itself is spectrally rigid; it also follows from the
result of Smillie and Vogtmann that there does not exist a finite spectrally
rigid subset of $F_N$. We prove that if $A$ is a free basis of $F_N$ (where
$N\ge 2$) then almost every trajectory of a non-backtracking simple random walk
on $F_N$ with respect to $A$ is a spectrally rigid subset of $F_N$.
