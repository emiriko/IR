Squeezed correlations of particle-antiparticle pairs were predicted to exist
if the hadron masses were modified in the hot and dense medium formed in high
energy heavy ion collisions. Although well-established theoretically, they have
not yet been observed experimentally. We suggest here a clear method to search
for such signal, by analyzing the squeezed correlation functions in terms of
measurable quantities. We illustrate this suggestion for simulated phi-phi
pairs at RHIC energies.
