We address the difficult question of inferring plausible node mobility based
only on information from wireless contact traces. Working with mobility
information allows richer protocol simulations, particularly in dense networks,
but requires complex set-ups to measure, whereas contact information is easier
to measure but only allows for simplistic simulation models. In a contact trace
a lot of node movement information is irretrievably lost so the original
positions and velocities are in general out of reach. We propose a fast
heuristic algorithm, inspired by dynamic force-based graph drawing, capable of
inferring a plausible movement from any contact trace, and evaluate it on both
synthetic and real-life contact traces. Our results reveal that (i) the quality
of the inferred mobility is directly linked to the precision of the measured
contact trace, and (ii) the simple addition of appropriate anticipation forces
between nodes leads to an accurate inferred mobility.
