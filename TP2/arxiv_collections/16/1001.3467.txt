The process of two pion production in the electron-polarized proton
scattering is investigated. In the Weizs\"acker-Williams approximation the
differential spectral distributions and the spin-momentum correlations are
considered. The spin correlation effects caused by $\rho$-meson widths are
estimated to be of an order of several per cent. Both channels of the
$\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\pi^+\pi^0$ creation are considered. The effects of
intermediate excited baryons are not considered. The spectral distributions on
pion energy fractions in polarized and unpolarized cases are presented
analytically and numerically.
