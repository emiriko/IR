First solid state quantum computer was built using transmons (cooper pair
boxes). The operation of the computer is limited because of using a number of
the rigit cooper boxes working with fixed frequency at temperatures of
superconducting material. Here, we propose a novel architecture of quantum
computer based on a flexible wire circuit of many coupled quantum nodes
containing controlled atomic (molecular) ensembles. We demonstrate wide
opportunities of the proposed computer. Firstly, we reveal a perfect storage of
external photon qubits to multi-mode quantum memory node and demonstrate a
reversible exchange of the qubits between any arbitrary nodes. We found optimal
parameters of atoms in the circuit and self quantum modes for quantum
processing. The predicted perfect storage has been observed experimentally for
microwave radiation on the lithium phthalocyaninate molecule ensemble. Then
also, for the first time we show a realization of the efficient basic two-qubit
gate with direct coupling of two arbitrary nodes by using appropriate atomic
frequency shifts in the circuit nodes. Proposed two-qubit gate runs with a
speed drastically accelerated proportionally to the number of atoms in the
node. The direct coupling and accelerated two-qubit gate can be realized for
large number of the circuit nodes. Finally, we describe two and
three-dimensional scalable architectures that pave the road to construction of
universal multi-qubit quantum computer operating at room temperatures.
