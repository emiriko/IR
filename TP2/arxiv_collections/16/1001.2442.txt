Generic non-magnetic disorder effects onto those topological quantum critical
points (TQCP), which intervene the three-dimensional topological insulator and
an ordinary insulator, are investigated. We first show that, in such 3-d TQCP,
any backward scattering process mediated by the chemical-potential-type
impurity is always canceled by its time-reversal (T-reversal) counter-process,
because of the non-trivial Berry phase supported by these two processes in the
momentum space. However, this cancellation can be generalized into only those
backward scattering processes which conserve a certain internal degree of
freedom, i.e. the parity density, while the `absolute' stability of the TQCP
against any non-magnetic disorders is required by the bulk-edge correspondence.
Motivated by this, we further derive the self-consistent-Born phase diagram in
the presence of generic non-magnetic disorder potentials and argue the
behaviour of the quantum conductivity correction in such cases. The distinction
and similarity between the case with only the chemical-potential-type disorder
and that with the generic non-magnetic disorders are finally summarized.
