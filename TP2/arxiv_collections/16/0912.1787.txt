We study the wash-out of a cosmological baryon asymmetry produced via
leptogenesis by subsequent interactions. Therefore we focus on a scenario in
which a lepton asymmetry is established in the out-of-equilibrium decays of the
next-to-lightest right-handed neutrino. We apply the full classical Boltzmann
equations without the assumption of kinetic equilibrium and including all
quantum statistical factors to calculate the wash-out of the lepton asymmetry
by interactions of the lightest right-handed state. We include scattering
processes with top quarks in our analysis. This is of particular interest since
the wash-out is enhanced by scatterings and the use of mode equations with
quantum statistical distribution functions. In this way we provide a
restriction on the parameter space for this scenarios.
