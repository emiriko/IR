We present the details of predicting atmospheric turbulence by mining Zernike
moment data obtained from simulations as well as experiments. Temporally
correlated optical wave-fronts were simulated such that they followed
Kolmogorov phase statistics. The wave-fronts reconstructed either by modal or
zonal methods can be represented in terms of Zernike moments. The servo lag
error in adaptive optics is minimized by predicting Zernike moments in the near
future by using the data from the immediate past. It is shown statistically
that the prediction accuracy depends on the number of past phase screens used
for prediction and servo lag time scales. The algorithm is optimized in terms
of these parameters for real time and efficient operation of the adaptive
optics system. On an average, we report more than 3% improvement in the
wave-front compensation after prediction. This analysis helps in optimizing the
design parameters for sensing and correction in closed loop adaptive optics
systems.
