In the absence of low energy supersymmetry, we show that (a) the dark matter
particle alone at the TeV scale can improve gauge coupling unification, raising
the unification scale up to the lower bound imposed by proton decay, and (b)
the dark matter stability can automatically follow from the grand unification
symmetry. Within reasonably simple unified models, a unique candidate
satisfying these two properties is singled out: a fermion isotriplet with zero
hypercharge, member of a 45 (or larger) representation of SO(10). We discuss
the phenomenological signatures of this TeV scale fermion, which can be tested
in direct and indirect future dark matter searches. The proton decay rate into
e^+ \pi^0 is predicted close to the present bound.
