We consider a system composed of a two-level system (i.e. a qubit) and a
harmonic oscillator in the ultrastrong-coupling regime, where the coupling
strength is comparable to the qubit and oscillator energy scales. Special
emphasis is placed on the possibility of preparing nonclassical states in this
system. These nonclassical states include squeezed states, Schrodinger-cat
states and entangled states. We start by comparing the predictions of a number
of analytical methods that can be used to describe the system under different
assumptions, thus analyzing the properties of the system in various parameter
regimes. We then examine the ground state of the system and analyze its
nonclassical properties. We finally discuss some questions related to the
possible experimental observation of the nonclassical states and the effect of
decoherence.
