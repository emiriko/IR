We propose two nonlinear Kalman smoothers that rely on Student's t
distributions. The T-Robust smoother finds the maximum a posteriori likelihood
(MAP) solution for Gaussian process noise and Student's t observation noise,
and is extremely robust against outliers, outperforming the recently proposed
l1-Laplace smoother in extreme situations (e.g. 50% or more outliers). The
second estimator, which we call the T-Trend smoother, is able to follow sudden
changes in the process model, and is derived as a MAP solver for a model with
Student's t-process noise and Gaussian observation noise. We design specialized
methods to solve both problems which exploit the special structure of the
Student's t-distribution, and provide a convergence theory. Both smoothers can
be implemented with only minor modifications to an existing L2 smoother
implementation. Numerical results for linear and nonlinear models illustrating
both robust and fast tracking applications are presented.
