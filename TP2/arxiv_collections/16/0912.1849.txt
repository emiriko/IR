We perform a global fit on parity-conserving electron-quark interactions via
spin-1 unparticle exchange. Besides the peculiar features of unparticle
exchange due to non-integral values for the scaling dimension d_U and a
non-trivial phase factor exp (-id_U \pi) associated with a time-like unparticle
propagator, the energy dependence s^{-2 + d_U} of the unparticle contributions
in the scattering amplitudes are also taken into account. The high energy data
sets taken into consideration in our analysis are from (1) deep inelastic
scattering at high Q^2 from ZEUS and H1, (2) Drell-Yan production at Run II of
CDF and DO, and (3) e^+e^- --> hadrons at LEPII. The hadronic data at LEPII by
itself indicated a 3-4 sigma preference of new physics over the Standard Model.
However, when all data sets are combined, no preference for unparticle effects
can be given. We thus deduce an improved 95% confidence level limit on the
unparticle energy scale \Lambda_\U.
