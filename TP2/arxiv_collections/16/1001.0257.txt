The most important open problem in Monotone Operator Theory concerns the
maximal monotonicity of the sum of two maximal monotone operators provided that
Rockafellar's constraint qualification holds.
  In this note, we provide a new maximal monotonicity result for the sum of a
maximal monotone relation and the subdifferential operator of a proper, lower
semicontinuous, sublinear function. The proof relies on Rockafellar's formula
for the Fenchel conjugate of the sum as well as some results on the Fitzpatrick
function.
