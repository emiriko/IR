A previous analysis of methanol and formaldehyde towards the Orion Bar
concluded that the two molecular species may trace different physical
components, methanol the clumpy material, and formaldehyde the interclump
medium. To verify this hypothesis, we performed multi-line mapping observations
of the two molecules to study their spatial distributions. The observations
were performed with the IRAM-30m telescope at 218 and 241 GHz, with an angular
resolution of ~11''. Additional data for H2CO from the Plateau de Bure array
are also discussed. The data were analysed using an LVG approach.
  Both molecules are detected in our single-dish data. Our data show that CH3OH
peaks towards the clumps of the Bar, but its intensity decreases below the
detection threshold in the interclump material. When averaging over a large
region of the interclump medium, the strongest CH3OH line is detected with a
peak intensity of ~0.06K. Formaldehyde also peaks on the clumps, but it is also
detected in the interclump gas. We verified that the weak intensity of CH3OH in
the interclump medium is not caused by the different excitation conditions of
the interclump material, but reflects a decrease in the column density of
methanol. The abundance of CH3OH relative to H2CO decreases by at least one
order of magnitude from the dense clumps to the interclump medium.
