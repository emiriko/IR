We present results from ongoing science projects conducted by members of the
Faulkes Telescope (FT) team and Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope
(LCOGT). Many of these projects incorporate observations carried out and
analysed by FT users, comprising amateur astronomers and schools.
  We also discuss plans for the further development of the LCOGT network.
