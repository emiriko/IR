We present the improved distance moduli of 30 galaxies in the Canes Venatici
I Cloud using advanced Tip of Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method (Makarov et.al.
2006). The method was determined for accurate estimation of the distances even
if TRGB situated near photometric limit. The data were taken from the Archive
of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Based on ACS and WFPC2 images of the HST
we construct the color-magnitude diagrams of the resolved stellar population of
the galaxies using Dolphot and HSTPhot packages.
  New refined method of the distance determination allows us to clarify the 3D
structure of the Canes Venatici I Cloud. It consists of the central group of
galaxies around M94 and the outskirt which is situated in gravitational field
of the "core". The mass and mass-to-light ratio of the CVn have been estimated.
