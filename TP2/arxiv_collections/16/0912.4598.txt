This paper extends k-means algorithms from the Euclidean domain to the domain
of graphs. To recompute the centroids, we apply subgradient methods for solving
the optimization-based formulation of the sample mean of graphs. To accelerate
the k-means algorithm for graphs without trading computational time against
solution quality, we avoid unnecessary graph distance calculations by
exploiting the triangle inequality of the underlying distance metric following
Elkan's k-means algorithm proposed in \cite{Elkan03}. In experiments we show
that the accelerated k-means algorithm are faster than the standard k-means
algorithm for graphs provided there is a cluster structure in the data.
