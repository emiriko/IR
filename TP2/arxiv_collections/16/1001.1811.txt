The observed late-time acceleration of the cosmic expansion constitutes a
fundamental problem in modern theoretical physics and cosmology. In an attempt
to weight the validity of a large number of dark energy models, I use the
recent measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe, the clustering of
galaxies the CMB fluctuations as well as the large scale structure formation,
to put tight constraints on the different models.
