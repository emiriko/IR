The adsorption of a collagen fragment on both a hydrophobic,
hydrogen-terminated and a hydrophilic, natively oxidised Si surface is
investigated using all-atom molecular dynamics. While favourable direct
protein-surface interactions via localised contact points characterise adhesion
to the hydrophilic surface, evenly spread surface/molecule contacts and
stabilisation of the helical structure occurs upon adsorption on the
hydrophobic surface. In the latter case, we find that adhesion is accompanied
by a mutual fit between the hydrophilic/hydrophobic pattern within the protein
and the layered water structure at the solid/liquid interface, which may
provide an additional driving force to the classic hydrophobic effect.
