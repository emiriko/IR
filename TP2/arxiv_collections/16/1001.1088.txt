After reviewing recently suggested operational "principles of the
quantumness", I address the problem on whether Quantum Theory (QT) and Special
Relativity (SR) are unrelated theories, or instead, if the one implies the
other. I show how SR can be indeed derived from causality of QT, within the
computational paradigm "the universe is a huge quantum computer", reformulating
QFT as a Quantum-Computational Field Theory (QCFT). In QCFT SR emerges from the
fabric of the computational network, which also naturally embeds gauge
invariance. In this scheme even the quantization rule and the Planck constant
can in principle be derived as emergent from the underlying causal tapestry of
space-time. In this way QT remains the only theory operating the huge computer
of the universe. Is QCFT only a speculative tautology (theory as simulation of
reality), or does it have a scientific value? The answer will come from Occam's
razor, depending on the mathematical simplicity of QCFT. Here I will just start
scratching the surface of QCFT, analyzing simple field theories, including
Dirac's. The number of problems and unmotivated recipes that plague QFT
strongly motivates us to undertake the QCFT project, since QCFT makes all such
problems manifest, and forces a re-foundation of QFT.
