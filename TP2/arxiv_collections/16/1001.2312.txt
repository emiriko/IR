We discuss a general framework for the inclusion of heavy quark mass
contributions to deep-inelastic structure functions and their perturbative
matching to structure functions computed in variable-mass schemes. Our approach
is based on the so-called FONLL method, previously introduced and applied to
heavy quark hadroproduction and photoproduction. We define our framework,
provide expressions up to second order in the strong coupling, and use them to
construct matched expressions for structure functions up to NNLO. After
checking explicitly the consistency of our results, we perform a study of the
phenomenological impact of heavy quark terms, and compare results obtained at
various perturbative orders, and with various prescriptions for the treatment
of subleading terms, specifically those related to threshold behaviour. We also
consider the heavy quark structure function F2c and discuss issues related to
the presence of mass singularities in their coefficient functions.
