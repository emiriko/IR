We propose that for conformal field theories admitting gravity duals, the
thermal conductivity is fixed by the central charges in a universal manner.
Though we do not have a proof as yet, we have checked our proposal against
several examples. This proposal, if correct, allows us to express electrical
conductivity in terms of thermodynamical quantities even in the presence of
chemical potential.
