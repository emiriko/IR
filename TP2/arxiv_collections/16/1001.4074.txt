We propose a class of E6-based local orbifold Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)
which yield an exceptional supersymmetric standard model as their low energy
theory including leptoquark and unhiggs exotics and a Z' at the TeV scale.
Unification is achieved in two steps through an intermediate scale symmetry
breaking.
