We carry out a systematic construction of the coarse-grained dynamical
equation of motion for the orientational order parameter for a two-dimensional
active nematic, that is a nonequilibrium steady state with uniaxial, apolar
orientational order. Using the dynamical renormalization group, we show that
the leading nonlinearities in this equation are marginally \textit{irrelevant}.
We discover a special limit of parameters in which the equation of motion for
the angle field of bears a close relation to the 2d stochastic Burgers
equation. We find nevertheless that, unlike for the Burgers problem, the
nonlinearity is marginally irrelevant even in this special limit, as a result
of of a hidden fluctuation-dissipation relation. 2d active nematics therefore
have quasi-long-range order, just like their equilibrium counterparts
