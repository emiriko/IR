Highly correlated electron materials are systems in which many new states of
matter can emerge. A particular situation which favours the formation of exotic
phases of the electron liquid in complex materials is that where a quantum
critical point (QCP) is present the phase diagram. Neighbouring regions in
parameter space reveal unusual physical properties, described as non-Fermi
liquid behaviour.
  One of the important problems in quantum criticality is to find out how the
Fermi surface (FS) of a material evolves near a QCP. The traditional method for
studying the FS of materials is the de Haas van Alphen effect (dHvA). A quantum
critical end point (QCEP) has been reported in the highly correlated metal
Sr3Ru2O7, which is tuned using a magnetic field high enough to perform the dHvA
experiment. It moreover features a new emergent phase in the vicinity of the
QCEP, a nematic type of electron ordering.
  The subject of this thesis is the study of the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 using the dHvA
effect. Three aspects were explored. The first was the determination of the FS
at fields both above and below that where the QCEP arises. The second was the
search for quantum oscillations inside the nematic phase. The third was a
reinvestigation of the behaviour of the quasiparticle effective masses near the
FS.
  A complete robust model for the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 at zero fields was determined.
Moreover, the new measurements of the quasiparticle masses revealed that no
mass enhancements exist anywhere around the QCEP. Finally, we report dHvA
oscillations inside the nematic phase, which suggests that the carriers consist
of Landau quasiparticles.
