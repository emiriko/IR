We present the scattering approach which is nowadays the best tool for
describing the Casimir force in realistic experimental configurations. After
reminders on the simple geometries of 1d space and specular scatterers in 3d
space, we discuss the case of stationary arbitrarily shaped mirrors in
electromagnetic vacuum. We then review specific calculations based on the
scattering approach, dealing for example with the forces or torques between
nanostructured surfaces and with the force between a plane and a sphere. In
these various cases, we account for the material dependence of the forces, and
show that the geometry dependence goes beyond the trivial {\it Proximity Force
Approximation} often used for discussing experiments.
