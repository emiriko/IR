We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential undergoing
a dynamical transition from the regime of Josephson oscillations to the regime
of self-trapping. We analyze the statistical properties of the ground state (or
the highest excited state) of the Hamiltonian in these two regimes for
attractive (repulsive) interactions. We demonstrate that it is impossible to
describe the transition within the mean-field theory. In contrast, the
transition proceeds through a strongly correlated delocalized state, with large
quantum fluctuations, and spontaneous breaking of the symmetry.
