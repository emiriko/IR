In the present paper we numerically construct new charged anti-de Sitter
black holes coupled to nonlinear Born-Infeld electrodynamics within a certain
class of scalar-tensor theories. The properties of the solutions are
investigated both numerically and analytically. We also study the
thermodynamics of the black holes in the canonical ensemble. For large values
of the Born-Infeld parameter and for a certain interval of the charge values we
find the existence of a first-order phase transition between small and very
large black holes. An unexpected result is that for a certain small charge
subinterval two phase transitions have been observed, one of zeroth and one of
first order. It is important to note that such phase transitions are also
observed for pure Einstein-Born-Infeld-AdS black holes.
