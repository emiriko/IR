The paper of Little et al. (PloS Comput Biol 2009 5(10) e1000539) outlined a
system of reaction-diffusion equations that were used to describe induction of
atherosclerotic disease. These were solved by considering an equilibrium
solution and small perturbations around this equilibrium. Here we consider
slight variant sets of assumptions that could be used to derive equilibrium
solutions. In general they do not imply any change in the numerical results
relating to monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) presented in that
paper.
