Extrasolar planetary host stars are enriched in key planet-building elements.
These enrichments have the potential to drastically alter the building blocks
available for terrestrial planet formation. Here we report on the combination
of dynamical models of late-stage terrestrial planet formation within known
extrasolar planetary systems with chemical equilibrium models of the
composition of solid material within the disk. This allows us to constrain the
bulk elemental composition of extrasolar terrestrial planets. A wide variety of
resulting planetary compositions exist, ranging from those that are essentially
"Earth-like", containing metallic Fe and Mg-silicates, to those that are
dominated by graphite and SiC. This implies that a diverse range of terrestrial
planets are likely to exist within extrasolar planetary systems.
