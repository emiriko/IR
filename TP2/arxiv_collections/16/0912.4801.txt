Bianchi type V string cosmological models with bulk viscosity for massive
string are investigated. The bulk viscosity is assumed to vary with time in
such a manner that it is related to simple power function of the energy
density. Using generation technique (Camci~et~al., 2001), it is shown that
Einstein's field equations are solvable for any arbitrary cosmic scale
function. Solution for particular form of cosmic scale functions are also
obtained. It is found that solutions based on generation technique are relevant
to the observational results. Some physical and geometrical aspect of the
models are also discussed.
