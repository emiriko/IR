In applying Vibration-Transit (V-T) theory of liquid dynamics to the
thermodynamic properties of monatomic liquids, the point has been reached where
an improved model is needed for the small (approx. 10%) transit contribution.
Toward this goal, an analysis of the available high-temperature experimental
entropy data for elemental liquids was recently completed [D. C. Wallace, E. D.
Chisolm, and N. Bock, Phys. Rev. B 79, 051201 (2009)]. This analysis yields a
common curve of transit entropy vs. T/\theta_{tr}, where T is temperature and
\theta_{tr} is a scaling temperature for each element. In the present paper, a
statistical mechanics model is constructed for the transit partition function,
and is calibrated to the experimental transit entropy curve. The model has two
scalar parameters, and captures the temperature scaling of experiment. The
calibrated model fits the experimental liquid entropy to high accuracy at all
temperatures. With no additional parameters, the model also agrees with both
experiment and molecular dynamics for the internal energy vs. T for Na. With
the calibrated transit model, V-T theory provides equations subject to ab
initio evaluation for thermodynamic properties of monatomic liquids. This will
allow the range of applicability of the theory, and its overall accuracy, to be
determined. More generally, the hypothesis of V-T theory, which divides the
many-atom potential energy valleys into random and symmetric classes, can also
be tested for its application beyond monatomic systems.
