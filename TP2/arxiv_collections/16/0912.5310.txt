We give an almost complete classification of empty lattice simplices in
dimension 4 using the conjectural results of Mori-Morrison-Morrison, later
proved by Sankaran and Bober. In particular, all of these simplices correspond
to cyclic quotient singularities, and all but finitely many of them have width
bounded by 2.
