Our Universe is full of regions where extreme physical conditions are
realized. Among the most intriguing cases are the so-called magnetars: neutron
stars with very dense cores and super-strong magnetic fields. In this paper I
review the current understanding of the physical properties of quark matter at
ultra-high density in the presence of very large magnetic fields. I will
discuss the main results on this topic, the main challenges that still remain,
and how they could be related to the physics of magnetars.
