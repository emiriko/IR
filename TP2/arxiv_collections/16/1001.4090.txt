We consider general theoretical models of water and in particular the nature
of the motions of the hydrogen nuclei. If the motion of hydrogen nuclei is
classical, then the thermodynamic pressure equation of state for heavy water
wherein the hydrogen nuclei are deuterons is identical to the pressure equation
of state for light water wherein the hydrogen nuclei are protons. Since the
experimental thermodynamic phase diagram for light water is clearly measurably
different from the experimental thermodynamic phase diagram for heavy water,
one may deduce that the motions of hydrogen nuclei are quantum mechanical in
nature. This conclusion is in physical agreement with a recent analysis of
X-ray, neutron and deep inelastic neutron scattering data.
