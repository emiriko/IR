The importance of the theory of pseudo-differential operators in the study of
non linear integrable systems is point out. Principally, the algebra $\Xi $ of
nonlinear (local and nonlocal) differential operators, acting on the ring of
analytic functions $u_{s}(x, t)$, is studied. It is shown in particular that
this space splits into several classes of subalgebras $\Sigma_{jr}, j=0,\pm 1,
r=\pm 1$ completely specified by the quantum numbers: $s$ and $(p,q)$
describing respectively the conformal weight (or spin) and the lowest and
highest degrees. The algebra ${\huge \Sigma}_{++}$ (and its dual $\Sigma_{--}$)
of local (pure nonlocal) differential operators is important in the sense that
it gives rise to the explicit form of the second hamiltonian structure of the
KdV system and that we call also the Gelfand-Dickey Poisson bracket. This is
explicitly done in several previous studies, see for the moment \cite{4, 5,
14}. Some results concerning the KdV and Boussinesq hierarchies are derived
explicitly.
