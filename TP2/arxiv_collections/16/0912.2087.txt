The deposition of atomically thin highly uniform chemically derived graphene
(CDG) films on 300 mm SiO2/Si wafers is reported. We demonstrate that the very
thin films can be lifted off to form uniform membranes than can be
free-standing or transferred onto any substrate. Detailed maps of thickness
using Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) height profiles
reveal that the film thickness is very uniform and highly controllable, ranging
from 1-2 layers up to 30 layers. After reduction using a variety of methods,
the CDG films are transparent and electrically active with FET devices yielding
exceptionally high mobilities of ~ 15 cm2/Vs and sheet resistance of ~ 1 k
Ohm/sq at ~ 70 % transparency.
