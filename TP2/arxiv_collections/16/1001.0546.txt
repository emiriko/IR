We show that minuscule entropic forces, on the order of 100 fN, can prevent
the formation of DNA loops--a ubiquitous means of regulating the expression of
genes. We observe a tenfold decrease in the rate of LacI-mediated DNA loop
formation when a tension of 200 fN is applied to the substrate DNA, biasing the
thermal fluctuations that drive loop formation and breakdown events.
Conversely, once looped, the DNA-protein complex is insensitive to applied
force. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a simple polymer model
of loop formation in DNA, and show that an anti-parallel topology is the
preferred LacI-DNA loop conformation for a generic loop-forming construct.
