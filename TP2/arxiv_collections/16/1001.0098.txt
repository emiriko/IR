We study the dynamics of the relative phase of a bilayer of two-dimensional
superfluids after the two superfluids have been decoupled. We find that on
short time scales the relative phase shows "light cone" like dynamics and
creates a metastable superfluid state, which can be supercritical. We also
demonstrate similar light cone dynamics for the transverse field Ising model.
On longer time scales the supercritical state relaxes to a disordered state due
to dynamical vortex unbinding. This scenario of dynamically suppressed vortex
proliferation constitutes a reverse-Kibble-Zurek effect. We study this effect
both numerically using truncated Wigner approximation and analytically within a
newly suggested time dependent renormalization group approach (RG). In
particular, within RG we show that there are two possible fixed points for the
real time evolution corresponding to the superfluid and normal steady states.
So depending on the initial conditions and the microscopic parameters of the
Hamiltonian the system undergoes a non-equilibrium phase transition of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless type. The time scales for the vortex unbinding near the
critical point are exponentially divergent, similar to the equilibrium case.
