We examine a spatially discrete reaction diffusion model based on the
interactions that create a periodic pattern in the Drosophila eye imaginal
disc. This model is capable of generating a regular hexagonal pattern of gene
expression behind a moving front, as observed in the fly system. In order to
better understand the novel switch and template mechanism behind this pattern
formation, we present here a detailed study of the model's behavior in one
dimension, using a combination of analytic methods and numerical searches of
parameter space. We find that patterns are created robustly provided that there
is an appropriate separation of timescales and that self-activation is
sufficiently strong, and we derive expressions in this limit for the front
speed and the pattern wavelength. Moving fronts in pattern-forming systems near
an initial linear instability generically select a unique pattern, but our
model operates in a strongly nonlinear regime where the final pattern depends
on the initial conditions as well as on parameter values. Our work highlights
the important role that cellularization and cell-autonomous feedback can play
in biological pattern formation.
