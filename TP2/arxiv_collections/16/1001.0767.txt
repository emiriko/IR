This paper surveys the field of quantum computer algorithms. It gives a taste
of both the breadth and the depth of the known algorithms for quantum
computers, focusing on some of the more recent results. It begins with a brief
review of quantum Fourier transform based algorithms, followed by quantum
searching and some of its early generalizations. It continues with a more
in-depth description of two more recent developments: algorithms developed in
the quantum walk paradigm, followed by tensor network evaluation algorithms
(which include approximating the Tutte polynomial).
