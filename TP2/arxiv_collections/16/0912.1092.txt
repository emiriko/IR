Nowadays, using cryptographic systems play an effective role in security and
safety technologies. One of the most applied kind of cryptography is Symmetric
Cryptography and its applications. New aspects of symmetric Cryptography
methodologies and applications has been presented by this paper. Security-based
networks and some complex technologies such as RFID and parallel security
settings has been intro-duced by using Symmetric Cryptography is the main base
of discussion in this paper. Designing an unique protocol for Symmetric
Cryptography in security networks elements is our focus. Reviewing benefits of
using these methodologies has been pre-sented and discussed in this paper.
