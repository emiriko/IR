The evolutionary effect of recombination depends crucially on the epistatic
interactions between linked loci. A paradigmatic case where recombination is
known to be strongly disadvantageous is a two-locus fitness landscape dis-
playing reciprocal sign epistasis with two fitness peaks of unequal height.
Focusing on the occurrence of bistability in the equilibrium solutions, we
consider here the deterministic, haploid two-locus model with reversible mu-
tations, selection and recombination. We find analytic formulae for the criti-
cal recombination probability rc above which two stable stationary solutions
appear which are localized on each of the two fitness peaks. We also derive the
stationary genotype frequencies in various parameter regimes. When the
recombination rate is close to rc and the fitness difference between the two
peaks is small, we obtain a compact description in terms of a cubic polyno-
mial which is analogous to the Landau theory of physical phase transitions.
