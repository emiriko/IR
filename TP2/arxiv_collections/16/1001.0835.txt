We investigate a model system consisting of a Morse oscillator strongly
coupled to a doubly-degenerate bending degree of freedom and show that
Canonical Perturbation Theory is able to provide a fairly precise, though not
exact, approximation of the Hamiltonian up to the dissociation threshold.
Quantum mechanical results and classical ones are discussed in this Letter.
