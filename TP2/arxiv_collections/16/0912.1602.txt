The evolution of the entanglement between two oscillators coupled to a common
thermal environment is non-trivial. The long time limit has three qualitatively
different behaviors (phases) depending on parameters such as the temperature of
the bath ({\em Phys. Rev. Lett.} \textbf{100}, 220401). The phases include
cases with non-vanishing long-term entanglement, others with a final
disentangled state, and situations displaying an infinite sequence of events of
disappearance and revival of entanglement. We describe an experiment to realize
these different scenarios in an ion trap. The motional degrees of freedom of
two ions are used to simulate the system while the coupling to an extra
(central) ion, which is continuously laser cooled, is the gateway to a
decohering reservoir. The scheme proposed allows for the observation and
control of motional entanglement dynamics, and is an example of a class of
simulations of quantum open systems in the non-Markovian regime.
