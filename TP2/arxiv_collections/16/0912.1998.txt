Two field 2-forms on the space-time manifold, in a relationship of duality,
are presented and included in the extended phase-space structure used to
describe relativistic particles having both electric and magnetic charges. By
exterior derivatives, these forms yield the two groups of Maxwell equations,
while specific integrality conditions ensure magnetic monopole or electric
charge quantization. Some properties of the common characteristic vector of the
dual 2-forms are discussed. It is shown that the coupled energy-density
continuity equation and the eikonal equation represent a classical,
infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system.
