One of the difficulties in calculating the capacity of certain Poisson
channels is that H(lambda), the entropy of the Poisson distribution with mean
lambda, is not available in a simple form. In this work we derive upper and
lower bounds for H(lambda) that are asymptotically tight and easy to compute.
The derivation of such bounds involves only simple probabilistic and analytic
tools. This complements the asymptotic expansions of Knessl (1998), Jacquet and
Szpankowski (1999), and Flajolet (1999). The same method yields tight bounds on
the relative entropy D(n, p) between a binomial and a Poisson, thus refining
the work of Harremoes and Ruzankin (2004). Bounds on the entropy of the
binomial also follow easily.
