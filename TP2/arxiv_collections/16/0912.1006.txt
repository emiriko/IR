The theory of elastic interaction of micron size axially symmetric colloidal
particles immersed into confined nematic liquid crystal has been proposed.
General formulas are obtained for the self energy of one colloidal particle and
interaction energy between two particles in arbitrary confined NLC with strong
anchoring condition on the bounding surface. Particular cases of dipole-dipole
interaction in the homeotropic and planar nematic cell with thickness $L$ are
considered and found to be exponentially screened on far distances with decay
length $\lambda_{dd}=\frac{L}{\pi}$. It is predicted that bounding surfaces in
the planar cell crucially change the attraction and repulsion zones of usual
dipole-dipole interaction. As well it is predicted that \textit{the decay
length} in quadrupolar interaction is \textit{two times smaller} than for the
dipolar case.
