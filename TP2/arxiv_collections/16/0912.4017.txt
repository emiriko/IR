In this paper we will prove that there exists a covariant functor, called
algebraic anabelian functor, from the category of algebraic schemes over a
given field to the category of outer homomorphism sets of groups. The algebraic
anabelian functor, given in a canonical manner, is full and faithful. It
reformulates the anabelian geometry over a field. As an application of the
anabelian functor, we will also give a proof of the section conjecture of
Grothendieck for the case of algebraic schemes.
