We study temperature dependent upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ of a
SrFe$_{1.85}$Co$_{0.15}$As$_{2}$ single crystal (\textit{T$_c$}=20.2 K) along
\textit{ab}-plane and \textit{c}-axis through resistivity measurements up to 50
T. For the both crystalline directions, $H_{\rm c2}$ becomes nearly isotropic
at zero temperature limit, reaching $\sim$ 48 T. The temperature dependence of
the $H_{\rm c2}$ curves is explained by interplay between orbital and Pauli
limiting behaviors combined with the two band effects.
