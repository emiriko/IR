Several spatially continuous pedestrian dynamics models have been validated
against empirical data. We try to reproduce the experimental fundamental
diagram (velocity versus density) with simulations. In addition to this
quantitative criterion, we tried to reproduce stop-and-go waves as a
qualitative criterion. Stop-and-go waves are a characteristic phenomenon for
the single file movement. Only one of three investigated models satisfies both
criteria.
