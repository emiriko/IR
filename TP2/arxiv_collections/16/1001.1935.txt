The effective bottom Yukawa couplings are analyzed for the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model at two-loop accuracy within
SUSY-QCD. They include the resummation of the dominant corrections for large
values of tg(beta). In particular the two-loop SUSY-QCD corrections to the
leading SUSY-QCD and top-induced SUSY-electroweak contributions are addressed.
The residual theoretical uncertainties range at the per-cent level.
