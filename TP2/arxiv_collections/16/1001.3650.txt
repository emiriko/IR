The thermodynamics and critical exponents and amplitudes of high temperature
and dense matter near the chiral critical point are studied. The parameterized
equation of state matches on to that calculated with lattice QCD at zero
chemical potential and to the known properties of nuclear matter at zero
temperature. The extent to which finite size effects wash out the phase
separation near the critical point is determined.
