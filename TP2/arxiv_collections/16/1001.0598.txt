Recent Swift observations suggest that the traditional long vs. short GRB
classification scheme does not always associate GRBs to the two physically
motivated model types, i.e. Type II (massive star origin) vs. Type I (compact
star origin). We propose a new phenomenological classification method of GRBs
by introducing a new parameter epsilon=E_{gamma, iso,52}/E^{5/3}_{p,z,2}, where
E_{\gamma,iso} is the isotropic gamma-ray energy (in units of 10^{52} erg), and
E_{p,z} is the cosmic rest frame spectral peak energy (in units of 100 keV).
For those short GRBs with "extended emission", both quantities are defined for
the short/hard spike only. With the current complete sample of GRBs with
redshift and E_p measurements, the epsilon parameter shows a clear bimodal
distribution with a separation at epsilon ~ 0.03. The high-epsilon region
encloses the typical long GRBs with high-luminosity, some high-z
"rest-frame-short" GRBs (such as GRB 090423 and GRB 080913), as well as some
high-z short GRBs (such as GRB 090426). All these GRBs have been claimed to be
of the Type II origin based on other observational properties in the
literature. All the GRBs that are argued to be of the Type I origin are found
to be clustered in the low-epsilon region. They can be separated from some
nearby low-luminosity long GRBs (in 3sigma) by an additional T_{90} criterion,
i.e. T_{90,z}<~ 5 s in the Swift/BAT band. We suggest that this new
classification scheme can better match the physically-motivated Type II/I
classification scheme.
