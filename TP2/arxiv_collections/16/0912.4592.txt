We derive the expression for spontaneous emission rate in finite
one-dimensional photonic crystal with arbitrary defects using the effective
resonator model to describe electromagnetic field distributions in the
structure. We obtain explicit formulas for contributions of different types of
modes, i.e. radiation, substrate and guided modes. Formal calculations are
illustrated with a few numerical examples, which demonstrate that the
application of effective resonator model simplifies interpretation of results.
