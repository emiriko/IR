Variational principles are developed within the framework of a spinor
representation of the surface geometry to examine the equilibrium properties of
a membrane or interface. This is a far-reaching generalization of the
Weierstrass-Enneper representation for minimal surfaces, introduced by
mathematicians in the nineties, permitting the relaxation of the vanishing mean
curvature constraint. In this representation the surface geometry is described
by a spinor field, satisfying a two-dimensional Dirac equation, coupled through
a potential associated with the mean curvature. As an application, the
mesoscopic model for a fluid membrane as a surface described by the
Canham-Helfrich energy quadratic in the mean curvature is examined. An explicit
construction is provided of the conserved complex-valued stress tensor
characterizing this surface.
