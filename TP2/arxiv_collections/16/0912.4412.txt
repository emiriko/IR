In this paper, by introducing and constructing several new structures about
the decomposition phenomenon in algebra, we study the sum-factor collapse
property of an arbitrary ring. As an application, we study and analyze several
classical problems in additive number theory by this new algebraic and
combinatory method. Some further questions are also presented and discussed.
