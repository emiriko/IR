In this letter, we investigate the production of light dark matter particles
at LHC in light of the model (N = 2 SUSY inspired) proposed in Ref. [1] and
demonstrate that they will be copiously produced if the colored messengers Fq
are lighter than 1 TeV. We expect up to a million events if the Fq mass is
about 500 GeV, assuming a ~1 inverse fb luminosity. In addition, we show that,
even if the Fq mass is above a few TeV, searches for Fq production at LHC are
promising because a kinematical signature can be used to separate the signal
from background. This signature is similar to that expected in supersymmetric
scenarios. Hence, our study shows that most of the Fq mass range could be
constrained using LHC data. This should encourage further studies since they
could infirm/confirm the MeV DM scenario.
