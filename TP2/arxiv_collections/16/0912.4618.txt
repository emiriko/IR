In the third part of this series we introduce consistent relative value
measures for CDS-Bond basis trades using the bond-implied CDS term structure
derived from fitted survival rate curves. We explain why this measure is better
than the traditionally used Z-spread or Libor OAS and offer simplified hedging
and trading strategies which take advantage of the relative value across the
entire range of maturities of cash and synthetic credit markets.
