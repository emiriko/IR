We systematically investigate the vacuum stability and nuclear properties in
the effective chiral model with higher order terms in $\sigma$. We evaluate the
model parameters by considering the saturation properties of nuclear matter as
well as the normal vacuum to be globally stable at zero and finite baryon
densities. We can find parameter sets giving moderate equations of state, and
apply these models to finite nuclei.
