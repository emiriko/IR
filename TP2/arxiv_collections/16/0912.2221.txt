Basic aspects of phononless resonant capture of monoenergetic electron
antineutrinos (Moessbauer antineutrinos) emitted in boundstate beta-decay in
the 3H - 3He system are considered. It is shown that stochastic magnetic
relaxation phenomena as well as the direct influence of solid-state effects on
the energy of the electron antineutrino will cause line broadening by a factor
of more than 10^(13). Lattice expansion and contraction after the
transformation of the nucleus will drastically reduce the probability for
phononless transitions. Thus, the observation of Moessbauer electron
antineutrinos of the 3H - 3He system will most probably be unsuccessful. As a
possible alternative, the Rare-Earth system 163Ho - 163Dy is briefly discussed.
