The Fermi LAT has released a list of the most significant 205 sources with
three months of Fermi data (Bright Source List). The Milagro Gamma-Ray
Observatory is sensitive to gamma rays above 100 GeV with a peak sensitivity
between 10 and 30 TeV, overlapping and extending the energy range of Fermi. Of
the 34 Galactic LAT sources in the field of view of Milagro, 6 are observed
with significance greater than 5 sigma and 14 are observed at greater than 3
sigma. Of these 14 sources, 9 are pulsars. Since the VHE emission detected by
Milagro is often found to be extended and likely un-pulsed, the VHE component
presumably arises from the pulsar winds. Six of the 14 sources have not been
previously detected at TeV energies. The details of the Milagro survey will be
presented. We will also present the energy spectra of the high-significance
detections. Should the full 1-year source list be available prior to the
symposium, we will expand our analysis to include the larger Fermi catalog.
