In a previous study it was demonstrated that Dirac's relativistic quantum
equation for free electrons (DRQM)can be obtained from Maxwell's classical
electromagnetic field equations (MaxEq). This raises fundamental issues about
the demarcation between the classical and quantum domain and about spin. In the
present study it is assumed, however, that the derivation is physically
relevant to cases where it is difficult to distinguish between classical and
quantum physics. The possibility of operating gauges on electron level is
studied in view of the effect on the larger physical scale which provides a
means to give experimental support to the presented pre-1900 history challenge.
