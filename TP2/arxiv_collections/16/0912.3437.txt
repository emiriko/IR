We consider the elastic scattering in deformed space with minimal length. We
give the basic relation for the elastic scattering in deformed space. We also
investigate the partial wave method in deformed space. It is shown that the
relations for the scattering amplitude and cross-section formally coincides
with ordinary ones.
