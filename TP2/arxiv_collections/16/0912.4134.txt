Inelastic neutron scattering is used to probe the collective spin excitations
of the near optimally-doped superconductor Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 ($x$=0.065).
Previous measurements on the antiferromagnetically ordered parents of this
material show a strongly anisotropic spin-wave velocity. Here we measure the
magnetic excitations up to 80 meV and show that a similar anisotropy persists
for superconducting compositions. The dispersive mode measured here connects
directly with the spin resonance previously observed in this compound. When
placed on an absolute scale, our measurements show that the local- or
wavevector- integrated susceptibility is larger in magnitude than that of the
ordered parents over the energy range probed.
