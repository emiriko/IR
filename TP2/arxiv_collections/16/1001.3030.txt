A Delta-groupoid is an algebraic structure which axiomatizes the
combinatorics of a truncated tetrahedron. By considering two simplest examples
coming from knot theory, we illustrate how can one associate a Delta-groupoid
to an ideal triangulation of a three-manifold. We also describe in detail the
rings associated with the Delta-groupoids of these examples.
