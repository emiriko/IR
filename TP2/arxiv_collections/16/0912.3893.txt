In this paper we continue to study a special class of Passarino-Veltman
functions J arising at the reduction of infrared divergent box diagrams. We
describe a procedure of separation of two types of singularities, infrared and
mass singularities, which are absorbed in simple C0 functions. The infrared
divergences of C0's can be regularized then by any method: photon mass,
dimensionally or by the width of an unstable particle. Functions J, in turn,
are represented as certain linear combinations of the standard D0 and C0
Passarino-Veltman functions. The former are free of both types of singularities
and are expressed as explicit and compact linear combinations of logarithms and
dilogarithm functions. We present extensive comparisons of numerical results
with those obtained with the aid of the LoopTools package.
