We give a delocalization estimate for eigenfunctions of the discrete
Laplacian on large $d+1$-regular graphs, showing that any subset of the graph
supporting $\epsilon$ of the $L^2$ mass of an eigenfunction must be large. For
graphs satisfying a mild girth-like condition, this bound will be exponential
in the size of the graph.
