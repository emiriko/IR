The Magnus expansion is a universal finite type invariant of pure braids with
values in the space of horizontal chord diagrams. The Conway polynomial
composed with the short circuit map from braids to knots gives rise to a series
of finite type invariants of pure braids and thus factors through the Magnus
map. We describe explicitly the resulting mapping from horizontal chord
diagrams on 3 strands to univariate polynomials and evaluate it on the Drinfeld
associator obtaining, conjecturally, a beautiful generating function whose
coefficients are integer combinations of multiple zeta values.
