We review progress in developing epitaxial graphene as a material for carbon
electronics. In particular, improvements in epitaxial graphene growth,
interface control and the understanding of multilayer epitaxial graphene's
electronic properties are discussed. Although graphene grown on both polar
faces of SiC is addressed, our discussions will focus on graphene grown on the
(000-1) C-face of SiC. The unique properties of C-face multilayer epitaxial
graphene have become apparent. These films behave electronically like a stack
of nearly independent graphene sheets rather than a thin Bernal-stacked
graphite sample. The origin of multilayer graphene's electronic behavior is its
unique highly-ordered stacking of non-Bernal rotated graphene planes. While
these rotations do not significantly affect the inter-layer interactions, they
do break the stacking symmetry of graphite. It is this broken symmetry that
causes each sheet to behave like an isolated graphene plane.
