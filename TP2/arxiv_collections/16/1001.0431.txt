We use Green's function method to study the Heisenberg model of LaFeAsO with
the striped antiferromagnetic collinear spin structure. In addition to the
intra-layer spin couplings $J_{1a},J_{1b},J_2$ and the inter-layer coupling
$J_c$, we further consider the contributions of the single-ion anisotropy
$J_s$. The analytical expressions for the magnetic phase-transition temperature
$T_N$ and the spin spectrum gap $\Delta$ are obtained. According to the
experimental temperature $T_N=138$K and the previous estimations of the
coupling interactions, we make a further discussion about the magnitude and the
effects of the single-ion anisotropy $J_s$. We find that the magnitudes of
$J_s$ and $J_c$ can compete. The dependences of the transition temperature
$T_N$, the zero-temperature average spin and the spin spectrum gap on the
single-ion anisotropy are investigated. We find they both increase as $J_s$
increases. The spin spectrum gap at low temperature $T\to0$ is calculated as a
function of $J_s$, the result of which is a useful reference for the future
experimental researches.
