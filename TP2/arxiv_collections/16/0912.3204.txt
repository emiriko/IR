We develop an exact solution to the problem of one dimensional chiral bosons
interacting via an s-wave Feshbach resonance. This problem is integrable, being
the quantum analog of a classical two-wave model solved by the inverse
scattering method thirty years ago. Its solution describes one or two branches
of dressed chiral right moving molecules depending on the chemical potential
(particle density). We also briefly discuss the possibility of experimental
realization of such a system.
