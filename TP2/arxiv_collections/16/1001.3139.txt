We propose a new analytical form of the quark-gluon plasma equation of state
(EoS). This new EoS satisfies all qualitative features observed in the lattice
QCD calculations and gives a good quantitative description of the lattice
results in the SU(3) gluodynamics. The energy density for the suggested EoS
looks similar to that in the bag model, but requires a negative value of the
bag constant.
