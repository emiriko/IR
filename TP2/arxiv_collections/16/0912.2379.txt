We study the ergodic theory of a one-parameter family of interval maps
T_alpha arising from generalized continued fraction algorithms. First of all,
we prove the dependence of the metric entropy of T_alpha to be
Hoelder-continuous in the parameter alpha. Moreover, we prove a central limit
theorem for possibly unbounded observables whose bounded variation grows
moderately. This class of functions is large enough to cover the case of
Birkhoff averages converging to the entropy.
