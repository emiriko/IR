Delta I=3/2, K to Pi Pi matrix elements are calculated on 68 configurations
of quenched 24^3 x 64 lattices using the DBW2 action, and domain wall fermions
with L_s=16. The lattice spacing is a^(-1)=1.3 GeV, corresponding to a physical
volume of (3.6 fm)^3, which allows us to simulate a pion mass of m_Pi=227.6(6)
MeV and a kaon mass of m_K=564(2) MeV. Twisted boundary conditions are used to
give the two pions momentum. One twist corresponds to a pion momentum of
p=Pi/L=170 MeV, which represents a decay that is nearly on-shell. Results for
time separations of 20, 24, 28, and 32 between the kaon and the two pions are
computed and an error weighted average is performed to reduced the error. The
matrix elements are then found to have errors of order 3-4% for momentum 0 and
Pi/L, 7% for momentum sqrt(2)*Pi/L, and 15% for momentum sqrt(3)*Pi/L.
