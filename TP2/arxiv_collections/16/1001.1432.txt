Prior to the invention of the telescope many astronomers worked out theories
of the motion of the Moon. The purpose of such theories was to be able to
predict the position of the Moon in the sky. These geometrical models implied a
certain range of distance of the Moon. Ptolemy's model, in fact, predicted that
the Moon was nearly twice as far away at apogee than at perigee. Measurements
of the angular size of the Moon were within the capabilities of pre-telescopic
astronomers. These could have helped refine the models of the motion of the
Moon, but hardly anyone seems to have made any measurements that have come down
to us. Using a piece of cardboard with a small hole punched in it which slides
up and down a yardstick, we show that it is possible to determine an
approximate value of the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit. From 64 observations
taken over 14 cycles of the Moon's phases we find find epsilon ~ 0.041 +/-
0.004. A typical measurement uncertainty of the Moon's angular size is +/- 0.7
arcmin. Since the Moon's angular size ranges from 29.4 to 33.5 arcmin,
carefully taken naked eye data are accurate enough to demonstrate the periodic
variations of the Moon's angular size.
