The isomonodromic tau function of the Fuchsian differential equations
associated to Frobenius structures on Hurwitz spaces can be viewed as a section
of a line bundle on the space of admissible covers. We study the asymptotic
behavior of the tau function near the boundary of this space and compute its
divisor. This yields an explicit formula for the pullback of the Hodge class to
the space of admissible covers in terms of the classes of compactification
divisors.
