We review recent works on supersymmetry breaking and gauge mediation. We
survey our current understanding of dynamical supersymmetry breaking mechanisms
and describe new model building tools using duality, meta-stability, and
stringy construction. We discuss phenomenological constraints and their
solutions, paying attentions to issues with gaugino masses and electroweak
symmetry breaking.
