It is accepted by the majority of scientific community that the Universe is
currently in an accelerated epoch. In order to explain this shock of late 90's,
a lot of dark energy candidates have been proposed. We study in the context of
f (R) gravity, how some modifications on General Relativity could reproduce
such behavior of the cosmic evolution. It is showed that in general, an f (R)
theory can be reconstructed from a non-minimal scalar-tensor theory, where a
desired cosmological solution can be achieved. Some viable models are studied
as well as its cosmological evolution, and the possibility that inflationary
epoch is also a result of these fine modifications.
