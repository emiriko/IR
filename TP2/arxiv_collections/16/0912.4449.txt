Magnetic reconnection in the low atmosphere, e.g. chromosphere, is
investigated in various physical environments. Its implications for the
origination of explosive events (small--scale jets) are discussed. A
2.5-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model in Cartesian
coordinates is used. It is found that the temperature and velocity of the
outflow jets as a result of magnetic reconnection are strongly dependent on the
physical environments, e.g. the magnitude of the magnetic field strength and
the plasma density. If the magnetic field strength is weak and the density is
high, the temperature of the jets is very low (~10,000 K) as well as its
velocity (~40 km/s). However, if environments with stronger magnetic field
strength (20 G) and smaller density (electron density Ne=2x10^{10} cm^{-3}) are
considered, the outflow jets reach higher temperatures of up to 600,000 K and a
line-of-sight velocity of up to 130 km/s which is comparable with the
observational values of jet-like events.
