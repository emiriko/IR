We discuss the broad band X-ray properties of one of the largest samples of
X-ray selected type-1 AGN to date (487 objects in total), drawn from the
XMM-Newton Wide Angle Survey. The objects cover 2-10 keV luminosities from
~10^{42}-10^{45} erg s^{-1} and are detected up to redshift ~4. We constrain
the overall properties of the broad band continuum, soft excess and X-ray
absorption, along with their dependence on the X-ray luminosity and redshift
and we discuss the implications for models of AGN emission. We constrained the
mean spectral index of the broad band X-ray continuum to <Gamma>=1.96+-0.02
with intrinsic dispersion sigma=0.27_{-0.02}^{+0.01}. The continuum becomes
harder at faint fluxes and at higher redshifts and luminosities. The dependence
of Gamma with flux is likely due to undetected absorption rather than to
spectral variation. We found a strong dependence of the detection efficiency of
objects on the spectral shape which can have a strong impact on the measured
mean continuum shapes of sources at different redshifts and luminosities. We
detected excess absorption in ~3% of our objects, with column densities ~a few
x10^{22} cm^{-2}. The apparent mismatch between the optical classification and
X-ray properties of these objects is a challenge for the standard AGN
unification model. We found that the fraction of objects with detected soft
excess is ~36%. Using a thermal model, we constrained the soft excess mean
temperature and intrinsic dispersion to <kT>~100 eV and sigma~34 eV. The origin
of the soft excess as thermal emission from the accretion disk or Compton
scattered disk emission is ruled out on the basis of the temperatures detected
and the lack of correlation of the measured temperature with the X-ray
luminosity (abridged).
