Under the assumption of thermal wind balance and effective entropy mixing in
constant rotation surfaces, the isorotational contours of the solar convective
zone may be reproduced with great fidelity. Even at this early stage of
development, this helioseismology fit may be used to put a lower bound on the
midlatitude {\em radial} solar entropy gradient, which in good accord with
standard mixing length theory. In this paper, we generalize this solar
calculation to fully convective stars (and potentially planets), retaining the
assumptions of thermal wind balance and effective entropy mixing in
isorotational surfaces. It is found that each isorotation contour is of the
form $R^2 = A+B\Phi(r)$, where $R$ is the radius from the rotation axis,
$\Phi(r)$ is the (assumed spherical) gravitational potential, and $A$ and $B$
are constant along the contour. This result is applied to simple models of
fully convective stars. Both solar-like surface rotation profiles (angular
velocity decreasing toward the poles) as well as "antisolar" profiles (angular
velocity increasing toward the poles) are modeled; the latter bear some
suggestive resemblance to numerical simulations. We also perform exploratory
studies of zonal surface flows similar to those seen in Jupiter and Saturn. In
addition to providing a practical framework for understanding the results of
large scale numerical simulations, our findings may also prove useful in
dynamical calculations for which a simple but viable model for the background
rotation profile in a convecting fluid is needed. Finally, our work bears
directly on an important goal of the CoRoT program: to elucidate the internal
structure of rotating, convecting stars.
