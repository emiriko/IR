We briefly review what a quantum computer is, what it promises to do for us,
and why it is so hard to build one. Among the first applications anticipated to
bear fruit is quantum simulation of quantum systems. While most quantum
computation is an extension of classical digital computation, quantum
simulation differs fundamentally in how the data is encoded in the quantum
computer. To perform a quantum simulation, the Hilbert space of the system to
be simulated is mapped directly onto the Hilbert space of the (logical) qubits
in the quantum computer. This type of direct correspondence is how data is
encoded in a classical analogue computer. There is no binary encoding, and
increasing precision becomes exponentially costly: an extra bit of precision
doubles the size of the computer. This has important consequences for both the
precision and error correction requirements of quantum simulation, and
significant open questions remain about its practicality. It also means that
the quantum version of analogue computers, continuous variable quantum
computers (CVQC) becomes an equally efficient architecture for quantum
simulation. Lessons from past use of classical analogue computers can help us
to build better quantum simulators in future.
