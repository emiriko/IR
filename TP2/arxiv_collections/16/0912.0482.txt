The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) dark matter search experiment is currently
being deployed at the Homestake Laboratory in South Dakota. We will highlight
the main elements of design which make the experiment a very strong competitor
in the field of direct detection, as well as an easily scalable concept. We
will also present its potential reach for supersymmetric dark matter detection,
within various timeframes ranging from 1 year to 5 years or more.
