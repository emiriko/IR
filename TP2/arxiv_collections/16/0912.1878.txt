According to SDSS DR5 spectra the spectrophotometric investigations of seven
HII regions of six Kazarian galaxies are conducted. The abundances of heavy
elements and helium and also quantity of ionizing stars and star formation rate
are determined. The oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H) lies in the range 7.94 - 8.35.
The mean log(S/O), log(Ar/O) and log(Ne/O) abundance ratios are equal to:
-1.63, -2.37 and -0.78, respectively. The log(N/O) abundance ratio of
investigated HII regions is in the interval -0.63 to -1.37. They occupy the
same area in the diagram N/O - O/H as the high-excitation HII regions. Most
likely, the ages of investigated HII regions are larger than 100-300 Myr,
required for the enrichment in nitrogen by intermediate-mass stars. The star
formation rate is one order as in HII regions in spiral and irregular galaxies,
and is in the interval 0.05 - 0.81 M year-1.
