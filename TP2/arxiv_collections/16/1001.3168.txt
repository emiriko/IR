Numerous measurements showed that the crack tip opening angle (CTOA) is
nearly constant upon stable ductile fracture in Al alloys which widely used in
modern transportation industry. The atomic structure of the very tip of a crack
front has remained unknown, however. We have carried out a first-principles
density functional theory study to reveal the precise alignment of atoms near
the crack tip in single-crystalline Al. The calculations demonstrate that the
CTOA increases with the opening displacement, thus the observed constant CTOA
in millimeter scale is an entirely plastic effect during ductile crack.
Besides, we find no significant crack tunneling (crack-front blunting), which
can be accounted for from the very small relaxation of the Al free surface. The
atomic structure thus obtained provides a solid basis for larger scale
simulations using for example finite element method.
