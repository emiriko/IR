We prove the local Gross-Prasad conjecture for generic L-packets of
representations of special orthogonal groups. The proof uses the same result
for tempered L-packets proved in a preceding paper, and irreducibility results
for the induced representations of whose the elements of the L-packets are
Langlands quotients.
