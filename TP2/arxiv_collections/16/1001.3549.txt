Nucleation of a solid in solid is initiated by the appearance of distinct
dynamical heterogeneities, consisting of `active' particles whose trajectories
show an abrupt transition from ballistic to diffusive, coincident with the
discontinuous transition in microstructure from a {\it twinned martensite} to
{\it ferrite}. The active particles exhibit intermittent jamming and flow. The
nature of active particle trajectories decides the fate of the transforming
solid -- on suppressing single particle diffusion, the transformation proceeds
via rare string-like correlated excitations, giving rise to twinned martensitic
nuclei. These string-like excitations flow along ridges in the potential energy
topography set up by inactive particles. We characterize this transition using
a thermodynamics in the space of trajectories in terms of a dynamical action
for the active particles confined by the inactive particles. Our study brings
together the physics of glass, jamming, plasticity and solid nucleation.
