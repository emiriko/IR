A dual-purpose ion-accelerator concept, capable of serving as radiation
source in a versatile, nuclear-reaction-based cargo inspection system, is
presented. The system will automatically and reliably detect small,
operationally-relevant quantities of concealed explosives and special nuclear
materials (SNM). It will be cost-effective, employing largely-common hardware,
but different reactions/DAQ-modes. Typical expected throughput is 10-20
aviation containers/hr.
