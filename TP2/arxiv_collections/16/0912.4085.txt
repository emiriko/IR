Optical interferometry is by far the most sensitive displacement measurement
technique available, with sensitivities at the 10^-20 m/rootHz level in the
large-scale gravitational-wave interferometers currently in operation. Second
generation interferometers will experience a 10-fold improvement in sensitivity
and be mainly limited by quantum noise, close to the Standard Quantum Limit
(SQL), once considered as the ultimate displacement sensitivity achievable by
interferometry. In this Letter, we experimentally demonstrate one of the
techniques envisioned to go beyond the SQL: amplification of a signal by
radiation-pressure back-action in a detuned cavity.
