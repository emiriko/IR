We study transport properties of a strongly interacting superfluid mixture of
two Fermi-liquids. A typical example of such matter is the neutron-proton
liquid in the cores of neutron stars. To describe the mixture, we employ the
Landau theory of Fermi-liquids, generalized to allow for the effects of
superfluidity. We formulate the kinetic equation and analyze linear response of
the system to vector (e.g., electromagnetic) perturbation. In particular, we
calculate the transverse and longitudinal polarization functions for both
liquid components. We demonstrate, that they can be expressed through the
Landau parameters of the mixture and polarization functions of noninteracting
matter (when the Landau quasiparticle interaction is neglected). Our results
can be used, e.g., for studies of the kinetic coefficients and low-frequency
long-wavelength collective modes in superfluid Fermi-mixtures.
