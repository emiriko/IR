Association rule mining plays vital part in knowledge mining. The difficult
task is discovering knowledge or useful rules from the large number of rules
generated for reduced support. For pruning or grouping rules, several
techniques are used such as rule structure cover methods, informative cover
methods, rule clustering, etc. Another way of selecting association rules is
based on interestingness measures such as support, confidence, correlation, and
so on. In this paper, we study how rule clusters of the pattern Xi - Y are
distributed over different interestingness measures.
