The layered ternary sp conductor NaAlSi, possessing the iron-pnictide "111"
crystal structure, superconducts at 7 K. Using density functional methods, we
show that this compound is an intrinsic (self-doped) low-carrier-density
semimetal with a number of unusual features. Covalent Al-Si valence bands
provide the holes, and free-electron-like Al 3s bands, which propagate in the
channel between the neighboring Si layers, dip just below the Fermi level to
create the electron carriers. The Fermi level (and therefore the
superconducting carriers) lies in a narrow and sharp peak within a pseudogap in
the density of states. The small peak arises from valence bands which are
nearly of pure Si, quasi-two-dimensional, flat, and coupled to Al conduction
bands. Isostructural NaAlGe, which is not superconducting above 1.6 K, has
almost exactly the same band structure except for one missing piece of small
Fermi surface. Certain deformation potentials induced by Si and Na
displacements along the c-axis are calculated and discussed. It seems likely
that the mechanism of pairing is related to that of several other lightly doped
two-dimensional nonmagnetic semiconductors (TiNCl, ZrNCl, HfNCl), which is not
well understood but apparently not of phonon origin.
