The Rosenblatt process is a self-similar non-Gaussian process which lives in
second Wiener chaos, and occurs as the limit of correlated random sequences in
so-called \textquotedblleft non-central limit theorems\textquotedblright. It
shares the same covariance as fractional Brownian motion. We study the
asymptotic distribution of the quadratic variations of the Rosenblatt process
based on long filters, including filters based on high-order finite-difference
and wavelet-based schemes. We find exact formulas for the limiting
distributions, which we then use to devise strongly consistent estimators of
the self-similarity parameter $H$. Unlike the case of fractional Brownian
motion, no matter now high the filter orders are, the estimators are never
asymptotically normal, converging instead in the mean square to the observed
value of the Rosenblatt process at time 1.
