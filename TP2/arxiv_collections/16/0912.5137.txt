We study thermal entanglement in a two-superconducting-qubit system in two
cases, either identical or distinct. By calculating the concurrence of system,
we find that the entangled degree of the system is greatly enhanced in the case
of very low temperature and Josephson energies for the identical
superconducting qubits, and our result is in a good agreement with the
experimental data.
