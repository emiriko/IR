I review recent developments in POWHEG, a method for interfacing
parton-shower generators with NLO QCD computations. I illustrate recent
progress in understanding several features of the method, and in clarifying
similarity and differences with respect to MC@NLO. Furthermore, I briefly
describe a recently introduced framework, the POWHEG BOX, that allows the
automatic POWHEG implementation of any given NLO calculation, and has been
recently applied to Z+jet production and to Higgs production via vector-boson
fusion.
