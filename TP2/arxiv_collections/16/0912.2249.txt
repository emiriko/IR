Lattice results for the gluon propagator in SU(2) pure gauge theory obtained
on large lattices are presented. Simulated annealing is used throughout to fix
the Landau gauge. We concentrate on checks for Gribov copy effects and for
scaling properties. Our findings are similar to the ones in the SU(3) case,
supporting the decoupling-type infrared behaviour of the gluon propagator.
