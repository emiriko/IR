The dynamics of a degree of freedom associated to an axial vector in contact
with a heat bath is decribed by means of a probability distribution function
obeying a Fokker-Planck equation. The equation is derived by using mesoscopic
non-equilibrium thermodynamics and permits a formulation of a dynamical theory
for the axial degree of freedom (orientation, polarization) and its associated
order parameter. The theory is used to describe dielectric relaxation in
homogeneous and non-homogeneous systems in the presence of strong electric
fields. In the homogeneous case, we obtain the dependence of the relaxation
time on the external field as observed in experiments. In the non-homogeneous
case, our model account for the two observed maxima of the dielectric loss
giving a good quantitative description of experimental data at all frequencies,
especially for systems with low molecular mass.
