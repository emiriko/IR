We investigate the recurrence properties of the time series of quantum
mechanical expectation values, in terms of two representative models for a
single-mode radiation field interacting with a nonlinear medium. From
recurrence-time distributions, return maps and recurrence plots, we conclude
that the dynamics of appropriate observables pertaining to the field can vary
from quasiperiodicity to hyperbolicity, depending on the extent of the
nonlinearity and of the departure from coherence of the initial state of the
field. We establish that, in a simple bipartite model in which the field is
effectively an open quantum system, a decaying exponential recurrence-time
distribution, characteristic of a hyperbolic dynamical system, is associated
with chaotic temporal evolution as characterized by a positive Liapunov
exponent.
