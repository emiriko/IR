In this paper, we study almost sure central limit theorems for sequences of
functionals of general Gaussian fields. We apply our result to non-linear
functions of stationary Gaussian sequences. We obtain almost sure central limit
theorems for these non-linear functions when they converge in law to a normal
distribution.
