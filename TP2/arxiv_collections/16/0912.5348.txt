We consider knot theories possessing a {\em parity}: each crossing is decreed
{\em odd} or {\em even} according to some universal rule. If this rule
satisfies some simple axioms concerning the behaviour under Reidemeister moves,
this leads to a possibility of constructing new invariants and proving
minimality and non-triviality theorems for knots from these classes, and
constructing maps from knots to knots.
  Our main example is virtual knot theory and its simplifaction, {\em free knot
theory}. By using Gauss diagrams, we show the existence of non-trivial free
knots (counterexample to Turaev's conjecture), and construct simple and deep
invariants made out of parity. Some invariants are valued in graph-like objects
and some other are valued in groups.
  We discuss applications of parity to virtual knots and ways of extending
well-known invariants.
  The existence of a non-trivial parity for classical knots remains an open
problem.
