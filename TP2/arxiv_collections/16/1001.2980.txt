Three different evaluations of the energy dependence of the
transmission-detection function of a two-stage cylindrical electron analyzer
have been obtained by resorting to three established procedures. Their relative
merits have been tested as follows. First they have been used to correct raw
XPS spectra of clean Cu, Ag and Au surfaces. Next, the secondary electron
background has been subtracted using Tougaard's method. Finally, the primary
electron spectra so obtained have been reanalyzed by peak area measurement in
the frame of the modern formalism for quantitative XPS analysis. Ideally a
constant residual value should thus be obtained. The variability of these
residuals with peak energy allows an objective rating of the initial
transmission-detection functions.
