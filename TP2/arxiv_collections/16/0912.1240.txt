With the development of high contrast imaging techniques and infrared
detectors, vast efforts have been devoted during the past decade to detect and
characterize lighter, cooler and closer companions to nearby stars, and
ultimately image new planetary systems. Complementary to other observing
techniques (radial velocity, transit, micro-lensing, pulsar-timing), this
approach has opened a new astrophysical window to study the physical properties
and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs and planets. I here will briefly
present the observing challenge, the different observing techniques, strategies
and samples of current exoplanet imaging searches that have been selected in
the context of the LAOG-Planet Imaging Surveys. I will finally describe the
most recent results that led to the discovery of giant planets probably formed
like the ones of our solar system, offering exciting and attractive
perspectives for the future generation of deep imaging instruments.
