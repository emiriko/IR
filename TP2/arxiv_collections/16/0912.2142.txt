An updated grid of stellar yields for low to intermediate-mass
thermally-pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are presented. The models
cover a range in metallicity Z = 0.02, 0.008, 0.004, and 0.0001, and masses
between 1Msun to 6Msun. New intermediate-mass Z = 0.0001 AGB models are also
presented, along with a finer mass grid than used in previous studies. The
yields are computed using an updated reaction rate network that includes the
latest NeNa and MgAl proton capture rates, with the main result that between ~6
to 30 times less Na is produced by intermediate-mass models with hot bottom
burning. In low-mass AGB models we investigate the effect on the production of
light elements of including some partial mixing of protons into the intershell
region during the deepest extent of each third dredge-up episode. The protons
are captured by the abundant 12C to form a 13C pocket. The 13C pocket increases
the yields of 19F, 23Na, the neutron-rich Mg and Si isotopes, 60Fe, and 31P.
The increase in 31P is by factors of ~4 to 20, depending on the metallicity.
Any structural changes caused by the addition of the 13C pocket into the
He-intershell are ignored. However, the models considered are of low mass and
any such feedback is likely to be small. Further study is required to test the
accuracy of the yields from the partial-mixing models. For each mass and
metallicity, the yields are presented in a tabular form suitable for use in
galactic chemical evolution studies or for comparison to the composition of
planetary nebulae.
