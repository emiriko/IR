The magnetic moments of spin ${1/2}{^+}$ and spin ${3/2}{^+}$ charmed baryons
have been calculated in chiral constituent quark model ($\chi$CQM). The effects
of configuration mixing and quark masses have also been investigated. The
results are not only in good agreement with existing experimental data but also
show improvement over other phenomenological models.
