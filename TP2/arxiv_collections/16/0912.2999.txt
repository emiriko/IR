We present observations and analysis of the broadband afterglow of Swift GRB
071025. Using optical and infrared (RIYJHK) photometry, we derive a photometric
redshift of 4.4 < z < 5.2; at this redshift our simultaneous multicolour
observations begin at ~30 s after the GRB trigger in the host frame and during
the initial rising phase of the afterglow. We associate the light curve peak at
580 s in the observer frame with the formation of the forward shock, giving an
estimate of the initial Lorentz factor Gamma_0 ~ 200. The red spectral energy
distribution (even in regions not affected by the Lyman-alpha break) provides
secure evidence of a large dust column. However, the inferred extinction curve
shows a prominent flat component between 2000-3000 Angstroms in the rest-frame,
inconsistent with any locally observed template but well-fit by models of dust
formed by supernovae. Time-dependent fits to the extinction profile reveal no
evidence of dust destruction and limit the decrease in the extinction column to
Delta A_3000 < 0.54 mag after t = 50 s in the rest frame. Our observations
provide evidence of a transition in dust properties at z~5, in agreement with
studies of high-z quasars, and suggest that SN-formed dust continues to
dominate the opacity of typical galaxies at this redshift.
