We investigate nonsupersymmetric $\BC^4/\BZ_N$ orbifold singularities using
their description in terms of the string worldsheet conformal field theory and
its close relation with the toric geometry description of these singularities
and their possible resolutions. Analytic and numerical study strongly suggest
the absence of nonsupersymmetric Type II terminal singularities (i.e. with no
marginal or relevant blowup modes) so that there are always moduli or closed
string tachyons that give rise to resolutions of these singularities, although
supersymmetric and Type 0 terminal singularities do exist. Using gauged linear
sigma models, we analyze the phase structure of these singularities, which
often involves 4-dimensional flip transitions, occurring between resolution
endpoints of distinct topology. We then discuss 4-dim analogs of unstable
conifold-like singularities that exhibit flips, in particular their Type II GSO
projection and the phase structure. We also briefly discuss aspects of
M2-branes stacked at such singularities and nonsupersymmetric $AdS_4\times
S^7/\BZ_N$ backgrounds.
