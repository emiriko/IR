Theoretical predictions for the decay width of Standard Model Higgs boson
into bottom quarks and tau-leptons, in the case when M_H< 2M_W, are briefly
reviewed.
  The effects of higher order perturbative QCD (up to alpha_s^4-level) and QED
corrections are considered. The uncertainties of the decay width of Higgs boson
into bb and tau+tau- are discussed.
