We build spherically symmetric wormholes within the DGP theory. We calculate
the energy localized on the shell, and we find that for certain values of the
parameters wormholes could be supported by matter not violating the energy
conditions. We also show that it could exist solitonic shells charaterized by
zero pressure and zero energy; thereafter we make some observations regarding
their dynamic on the phase plane.
