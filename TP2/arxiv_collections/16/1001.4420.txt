We study the complexity of the popular one player combinatorial game known as
Flood-It. In this game the player is given an n by n board of tiles where each
tile is allocated one of c colours. The goal is to make the colours of all
tiles equal via the shortest possible sequence of flooding operations. In the
standard version, a flooding operation consists of the player choosing a colour
k, which then changes the colour of all the tiles in the monochromatic region
connected to the top left tile to k. After this operation has been performed,
neighbouring regions which are already of the chosen colour k will then also
become connected, thereby extending the monochromatic region of the board. We
show that finding the minimum number of flooding operations is NP-hard for c>=3
and that this even holds when the player can perform flooding operations from
any position on the board. However, we show that this "free" variant is in P
for c=2. We also prove that for an unbounded number of colours, Flood-It
remains NP-hard for boards of height at least 3, but is in P for boards of
height 2. Next we show how a c-1 approximation and a randomised 2c/3
approximation algorithm can be derived, and that no polynomial time constant
factor, independent of c, approximation algorithm exists unless P=NP. We then
investigate how many moves are required for the "most demanding" n by n boards
(those requiring the most moves) and show that the number grows as fast as
Theta(n*c^0.5). Finally, we consider boards where the colours of the tiles are
chosen at random and show that for c>=2, the number of moves required to flood
the whole board is Omega(n) with high probability.
