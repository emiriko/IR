Adiabatic techniques are well known tools in multi-level electron systems to
transfer population between different states with high fidelity. Recently it
has been realised that these ideas can also be used in ultra-cold atom systems
to achieve coherent manipulation of the atomic centre-of-mass states. Here we
present an investigation into a realistic setup using three atomic waveguides
created on top of an atom chip and show that such systems hold large potential
for the observation of adiabatic phenomena in experiments.
