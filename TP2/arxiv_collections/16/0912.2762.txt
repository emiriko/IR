The purpose of these lectures is to introduce the notion of a Stokes-perverse
sheaf as a receptacle for the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for holonomic
D-modules. They develop the original idea of P. Deligne in dimension one, and
make it enter the frame of perverse sheaves. They also give a first step for a
general definition in higher dimension, and make explicit particular cases of
the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, relying on recent results of T. Mochizuki.
