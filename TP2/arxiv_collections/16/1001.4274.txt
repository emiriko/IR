Automatically extracting organization names from the affiliation sentences of
articles related to biomedicine is of great interest to the pharmaceutical
marketing industry, health care funding agencies and public health officials.
It will also be useful for other scientists in normalizing author names,
automatically creating citations, indexing articles and identifying potential
resources or collaborators. Today there are more than 18 million articles
related to biomedical research indexed in PubMed, and information derived from
them could be used effectively to save the great amount of time and resources
spent by government agencies in understanding the scientific landscape,
including key opinion leaders and centers of excellence. Our process for
extracting organization names involves multi-layered rule matching with
multiple dictionaries. The system achieves 99.6% f-measure in extracting
organization names.
