We address the equilibrium concept of a reverse auction game so that no one
can enhance the individual payoff by a unilateral change when all the others
follow a certain strategy. In this approach the combinatorial possibilities to
consider become very much involved even for a small number of players, which
has hindered a precise analysis in previous works. We here present a systematic
way to reach the solution for a general number of players, and show that this
game is an example of conflict between the group and the individual interests.
