We study the equation of state of neutron matter using a family of unitarity
potentials all of which are constructed to have infinite $^1S_0$ scattering
lengths $a_s$. For such system, a quantity of much interest is the ratio
$\xi=E_0/E_0^{free}$ where $E_0$ is the true ground-state energy of the system,
and $E_0^{free}$ is that for the non-interacting system. In the limit of
$a_s\to \pm \infty$, often referred to as the unitary limit, this ratio is
expected to approach a universal constant, namely $\xi\sim 0.44(1)$. In the
present work we calculate this ratio $\xi$ using a family of hard-core
square-well potentials whose $a_s$ can be exactly obtained, thus enabling us to
have many potentials of different ranges and strengths, all with infinite
$a_s$. We have also calculated $\xi$ using a unitarity CDBonn potential
obtained by slightly scaling its meson parameters. The ratios $\xi$ given by
these different unitarity potentials are all close to each other and also
remarkably close to 0.44, suggesting that the above ratio $\xi$ is indifferent
to the details of the underlying interactions as long as they have infinite
scattering length. A sum-rule and scaling constraint for the renormalized
low-momentum interaction in neutron matter at the unitary limit is discussed.
