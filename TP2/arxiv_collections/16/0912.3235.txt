Detailed experimental and theoretical investigations on two coupled fiber
lasers, each with many longitudinal modes, reveal that the behavior of the
longitudinal modes depends on both the coupling strength as well as the
detuning between them. For low to moderate coupling strength only longitudinal
modes which are common for both lasers phase-lock while those that are not
common gradually disappear. For larger coupling strengths, the longitudinal
modes that are not common reappear and phase-lock. When the coupling strength
approaches unity the coupled lasers behave as a single long cavity with
correspondingly denser longitudinal modes. Finally, we show that the gradual
increase in phase-locking as a function of the coupling strength results from
competition between phase-locked and non phase-locked longitudinal modes.
