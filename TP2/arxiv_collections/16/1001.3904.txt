We consider soliton formation in thermal nonlinear media bounded by
rectangular cross-sections and uncover a new class of nonlinear stationary
topological state. Specifically, we find that stationary higher-order vortex
states in standard shapes do not exist, but rather they take the form of
multiple, spatially separated single-charge singularities nested in an
elliptical beam. Double-charge states are found to be remarkably robust despite
their shape asymmetry and the phase-singularity splitting. States with higher
topological charges are found to be unstable.
