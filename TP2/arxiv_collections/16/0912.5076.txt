We demonstrate the fabrication of graphene nanogap with crystallographically
matching edges on SiO2Si substrates by divulsion. The current-voltage
measurement is then performed in a high-vacuum chamber for a graphene nanogap
with few hundred nanometers separation. The parallel edges help to build
uniform electrical field and allow us to perform electron emission study on
individual graphene. It was found that current-voltage characteristics are
governed by the space-charge-limited flow of current at low biases while the FN
model fits the I-V curves in high voltage regime. We also examined
electrostatic gating effect of the vacuum electronic device. Graphene nanogap
with atomically parallel edges may open up opportunities for both fundamental
and applied research of vacuum nanoelectronics.
