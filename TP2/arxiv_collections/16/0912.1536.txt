We study the correspondence between the tachyon, K-essence and dilaton scalar
field models with the interacting new agegraphic dark energy model in the
non-flat FRW universe. We reconstruct the potentials and the dynamics for these
scalar field models, which describe accelerated expansion of the universe.
