We show that the measure on markings of $\mathbf {Z}_n^d$, $d\geq3$, with
elements of ${0,1}$ given by i.i.d. fair coin flips on the range $\mathcal {R}$
of a random walk $X$ run until time $T$ and 0 otherwise becomes
indistinguishable from the uniform measure on such markings at the threshold
$T=1/2T_{{\mathrm {cov}}}(\mathbf {Z}_n^d)$. As a consequence of our methods,
we show that the total variation mixing time of the random walk on the
lamplighter graph $\mathbf {Z}_2\wr \mathbf {Z}_n^d$, $d\geq3$, has a cutoff
with threshold $1/2T_{{\mathrm {cov}}}(\mathbf {Z}_n^d)$. We give a general
criterion under which both of these results hold; other examples for which this
applies include bounded degree expander families, the intersection of an
infinite supercritical percolation cluster with an increasing family of balls,
the hypercube and the Caley graph of the symmetric group generated by
transpositions. The proof also yields precise asymptotics for the decay of
correlation in the uncovered set.
