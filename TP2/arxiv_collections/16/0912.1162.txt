Quantum parameter estimation has many applications, from gravitational wave
detection to quantum key distribution. We present the first experimental
demonstration of the time-symmetric technique of quantum smoothing. We consider
both adaptive and non-adaptive quantum smoothing, and show that both are better
than their well-known time-asymmetric counterparts (quantum filtering). For the
problem of estimating a stochastically varying phase shift on a coherent beam,
our theory predicts that adaptive quantum smoothing (the best scheme) gives an
estimate with a mean-square error up to $2\sqrt{2}$ times smaller than that
from non-adaptive quantum filtering (the standard quantum limit). The
experimentally measured improvement is $2.24 \pm 0.14$.
