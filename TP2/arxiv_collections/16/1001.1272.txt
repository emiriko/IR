In this lecture, we give a first introduction to neutron stars, based on
fundamental physical principles. After outlining their amazing macroscopic
properties, as obtained from observations, we infer the extreme conditions of
matter in their interiors. We then describe two crucial physical phenomena
which characterize compact stars, gravitational stability of strongly
degenerate matter and neutronization of nuclear matter with increasing density,
and explain how the formation and properties of neutron stars are a consequence
of the extreme compression of matter under gravity. Finally, we describe how
astronomical observations of various external macroscopic features can give
invaluable information about the exotic microscopic scenario inside: neutrons
stars represent a unique probe to study super-dense, isospin-asymmetric,
superfluid, bulk hadronic matter.
