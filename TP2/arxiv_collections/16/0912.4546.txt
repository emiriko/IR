Decoding sparse quantum codes can be accomplished by syndrome-based decoding
using a belief propagation (BP) algorithm.We significantly improve this
decoding scheme by developing a new feedback adjustment strategy for the
standard BP algorithm. In our feedback procedure, we exploit much of the
information from stabilizers, not just the syndrome but also the values of the
frustrated checks on individual qubits of the code and the channel model.
Furthermore we show that our decoding algorithm is superior to belief
propagation algorithms using only the syndrome in the feedback procedure for
all cases of the depolarizing channel. Our algorithm does not increase the
measurement overhead compared to the previous method, as the extra information
comes for free from the requisite stabilizer measurements.
