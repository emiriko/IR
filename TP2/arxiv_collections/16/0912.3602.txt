Let X be a smooth projective curve of genus g \textgreater{}1 defined over an
algebraically closed field k of characteristic p \textgreater{}0. For p
sufficiently large (explicitly given in terms of r,g) we construct an atlas for
the locus of all Frobenius-destabilized bundles (i.e. we construct all
Frobenius-destabilized bundles of degree zero up to isomorphism). This is done
by exhibiting a surjective morphism from a certain Quot-scheme onto the locus
of stable Frobenius-destabilized bundles. Further we show that there is a
bijective correspondence between the set of stable vector bundles E over X such
that the pull-back F^*(E) under the Frobenius morphism of X has maximal
Harder-Narasimhan polygon and the set of opers having zero p-curvature. We also
show that, after fixing the determinant, these sets are finite, which enables
us to derive the dimension of certain Quot-schemes and certain loci of stable
Frobenius-destabilized vector bundles over X. The finiteness is proved by
studying the properties of the Hitchin-Mochizuki morphism; an alternative
approach to finiteness has been realized in a recent preprint by Chen and Zhu.
In particular we prove a generalization of a result of Mochizuki to higher
ranks.
