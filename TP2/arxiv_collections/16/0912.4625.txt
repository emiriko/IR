The recent experimental data on Coulomb breakup of the nucleus $^{31}$Ne are
interpreted in terms of deformation. The measured large one-neutron removal
cross-section indicates that the ground state of $^{31}$Ne is either s- or
p-halo. The data can be most easily interpreted as the spin of the ground state
being 3/2$^-$ coming from either the Nilsson level [330 1/2] or [321 3/2]
depending on the neutron separation energy $S_n$. However, the possibility of
1/2$^{+}$ coming from [200 1/2] is not excluded. It is suggested that if the
large ambiguity in the measured value of $S_n$ of $^{31}$Ne, 0.29$\pm1.64$ MeV,
can be reduced by an order of magnitude, say to be $\pm$100 keV, one may get a
clear picture of the spin-parity of the halo ground state.
