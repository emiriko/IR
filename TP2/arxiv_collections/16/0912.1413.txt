We study the effect of a large magnetic field on the chiral and diquark
condensates in a regime of moderately dense quark matter. Our focus is on the
inter-dependence of the two condensates through non-perturbative quark mass and
strong coupling effects, which we address in a 2-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
(NJL) model. For magnetic fields $eB\lesssim 0.01$ GeV$^2$ (corresponding to
$B\lesssim 10^{18}$G), our results agree qualitatively with the zero-field
study of Huang et al., who found a mixed broken phase region where the chiral
and superconducting gap are both non-zero. For $eB\gtrsim 0.01$ GeV$^2$ and
moderate diquark-to-scalar coupling ratio $G_D/G_S$, we find that the chiral
and superconducting transitions become weaker but with little change in either
transition density. For large $G_D/G_S$ however, such a large magnetic field
disrupts the mixed broken phase region and changes a smooth crossover found in
the zero-field case to a first-order transition at neutron star interior
densities.
