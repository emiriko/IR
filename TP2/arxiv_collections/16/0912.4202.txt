The symmetries that govern the laws of nature can be spontaneously broken,
enabling the occurrence of ordered states. Crystals arise from the breaking of
translation symmetry, magnets from broken spin rotation symmetry and massive
particles break a phase rotation symmetry. Time translation symmetry can be
spontaneously broken in exactly the same way. The order associated with this
form of spontaneous symmetry breaking is characterised by the emergence of
quantum state reduction: systems which spontaneously break time translation
symmetry act as ideal measurement machines. In this review the breaking of time
translation symmetry is first compared to that of other symmetries such as
spatial translations and rotations. It is then discussed how broken time
translation symmetry gives rise to the process of quantum state reduction and
how it generates a pointer basis, Born's rule, etc. After a comparison between
this model and alternative approaches to the problem of quantum state
reduction, the experimental implications and possible tests of broken time
translation symmetry in realistic experimental settings are discussed.
