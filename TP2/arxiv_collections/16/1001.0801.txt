The frustration of antiferromagnetic interactions on the loosely connected
kagome lattice associated to the enhancement of quantum fluctuations for S=1/2
spins was acknowledged long ago as a keypoint to stabilize novel ground states
of magnetic matter. Only very recently, the model compound Herbersmithite,
ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2, a structurally perfect kagome antiferromagnet, could be
synthesized and enables a close comparison to theories. We review and classify
various experimental results obtained over the past years and underline some of
the pending issues.
