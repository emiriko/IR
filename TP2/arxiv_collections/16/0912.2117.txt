The temperature and field dependence of harmonics in voltage $V_n=V'_n-iV"_n$
using the screening technique have been measured for
$\mathrm{Y}\mathrm{Ba}_{2}\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ superconducting
thin films. Using the Sun model we obtained the curves for the
temperature-dependent critical current density $J_c(T)$. In addition, we
applied the criterion proposed by Acosta et al. to compute $J_c(T)$. Also, we
made used of the empirical law $J_c \propto (1-T/T_c)^n$ as an input in our
calculations to reproduce experimental harmonic generation up to the fifth
harmonic. We found that most models fit well the fundamental voltage but higher
harmonics are poorly reproduced. Such behavior suggests the idea that higher
harmonics contain information concerning complex processes like flux creep or
thermally assisted flux flow.
