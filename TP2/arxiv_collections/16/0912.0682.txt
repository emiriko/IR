We have obtained metallicities of ~ 360 red giant stars distributed in 15
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) fields from near-infrared spectra covering the
CaII triplet lines using the VLT + FORS2. The errors of the derived [Fe/H]
values range from 0.09 to 0.35 dex per star, with a mean of 0.17 dex. The
metallicity distribution of the whole sample shows a mean value of [Fe/H] =
-1.00 +- 0.02, with a dispersion of 0.32 +- 0.01, in agreement with global mean
[Fe/H] values found in previous studies. We find no evidence of a metallicity
gradient in the SMC. In fact, on analysing the metallicity distribution of each
field, we derived mean values of [Fe/H] = -0.99 +- 0.08 and [Fe/H] = -1.02 +-
0.07 for fields located closer and farther than 4 deg. from the center of the
galaxy, respectively. In addition, there is a clear tendency for the field
stars to be more metal-poor than the corresponding cluster they surround,
independent of their positions in the galaxy and of the clusters' age. We argue
that this most likely stems from the field stars being somewhat older and
therefore somewhat more metal-poor than most of our clusters.
