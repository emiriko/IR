A cellular automaton (CA) is a parallel synchronous computing model, which
consists in a juxtaposition of finite automata (cells) whose state evolves
according to that of their neighbors. Its trace is the set of infinite words
representing the sequence of states taken by some particular cell. In this
paper we study the ultimate trace of CA and partial CA (a CA restricted to a
particular subshift). The ultimate trace is the trace observed after a long
time run of the CA. We give sufficient conditions for a set of infinite words
to be the trace of some CA and prove the undecidability of all properties over
traces that are stable by ultimate coincidence.
