The discovery of a new family of high Tc materials, the iron arsenides
(FeAs), has led to a resurgence of interest in superconductivity. Several
important traits of these materials are now apparent, for example, layers of
iron tetrahedrally coordinated by arsenic are crucial structural ingredients.
It is also now well established that the parent non-superconducting phases are
itinerant magnets, and that superconductivity can be induced by either chemical
substitution or application of pressure, in sharp contrast to the cuprate
family of materials. The structure and properties of chemically substituted
samples are known to be intimately linked, however, remarkably little is known
about this relationship when high pressure is used to induce superconductivity
in undoped compounds. Here we show that the key structural features in
BaFe2As2, namely suppression of the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition
and reduction in the As-Fe-As bond angle and Fe-Fe distance, show the same
behavior under pressure as found in chemically substituted samples. Using
experimentally derived structural data, we show that the electronic structure
evolves similarly in both cases. These results suggest that modification of the
Fermi surface by structural distortions is more important than charge doping
for inducing superconductivity in BaFe2As2.
