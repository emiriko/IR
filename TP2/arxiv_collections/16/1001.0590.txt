The two-dimensional model of itinerant electrons coupled to an
anti-ferromagnetic order parameter is considered. In the mean field solution
the Fermi surface undergoes reconstruction, and breaks into disconnected
``pockets''. We have studied the effect of the thermal fluctuations of the
order parameter on the spectral density in such system. These fluctuations lead
to a finite width of the spectral line scaling linearly with temperature. Due
to the thermal fluctuations the quasi-particle spectral weight is transfered
into a magnetic Brillouin zone. This can be interpreted as restoration of
``arcs'' of the non-interacting Fermi surface.
