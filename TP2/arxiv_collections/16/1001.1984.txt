In computational molecular biology, gene regulatory binding sites prediction
in whole genome remains a challenge for the researchers. Now a days, the genome
wide regulatory binding site prediction tools required either direct pattern
sequence or weight matrix. Although there are known transcription factor
binding sites databases available for genome wide prediction but no tool is
available which can construct different weight matrices as per need of user or
tools available for large data set scanning by first aligning the input
upstream or promoter sequences and than construct the matrices in different
level and file format. Considering this, we developed a DNA MATRIX tool for
searching putative regulatory binding sites in gene upstream sequences. This
tool uses the simple biological rule based heuristic algorithm for weight
matrix construction, which can be transformed into different formats after
motif alignment and therefore provides the possibility to identify the most
potential conserved binding sites in the regulated genes. The user may
construct and save specific weight or frequency matrices in different form and
file formats based on user based selection of conserved aligned block of short
sequences ranges from 6 to 20 base pairs and prior nucleotide frequency before
weight scoring.
