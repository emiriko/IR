With references to recent observational results on the nebula IC59, we
applied our previously developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code
which is based on Radiative Driven Implosion (RDI) model, to investigate the
possible formation mechanism for the observed morphological structures of
differently shaped BRCs. The simulation results confirmed the existence of the
4th type morphology of BRCs -- type M BRC. We are able to find the necessary
condition for the appearance of the type M BRC based on the fact that the
simulated physical properties of the cloud are consistent with observations on
IC59. More importantly, the prospect of RDI triggered star formation by RDI
model in all of the observed type M BRCs is ruthlessly eliminated.
