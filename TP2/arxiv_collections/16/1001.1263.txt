We show how hydrogenation of graphene nanoribbons at small concentrations can
open new venues towards carbon-based spintronics applications regardless of any
especific edge termination or passivation of the nanoribbons. Density
functional theory calculations show that an adsorbed H atom induces a spin
density on the surrounding $\pi$ orbitals whose symmetry and degree of
localization depends on the distance to the edges of the nanoribbon. As
expected for graphene-based systems, these induced magnetic moments interact
ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically depending on the relative adsorption
graphene sublattice, but the magnitude of the interactions are found to
strongly vary with the position of the H atoms relative to the edges. We also
calculate, with the help of the Hubbard model, the transport properties of
hydrogenated armchair semiconducting graphene nanoribbons in the diluted regime
and show how the exchange coupling between H atoms can be exploited in the
design of novel magnetoresistive devices.
