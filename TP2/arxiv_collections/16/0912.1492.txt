We study the issue of the electrodynamics theory in noncommutative curved
space time (NCCST) with a new star-product. In this paper, the motion equation
of electrodynamics and canonical energy-momentum tensor in noncommutative
curved space time will be found. The most important point is the assumption of
the noncommutative parameter ($\theta$) be $x^{\m}$-independent.
