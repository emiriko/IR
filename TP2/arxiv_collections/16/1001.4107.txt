A common application of spreadsheets is the development of models that
deliver projections of the future financial statements of companies established
to pursue ventures that are subject to project financing. A survey of 11 such
spreadsheets prepared by a range of organisations shows that the amount of
self-testing included in such models ranges between one formula of testing for
each three formulae of calculation, down to essentially no self-testing at all.
