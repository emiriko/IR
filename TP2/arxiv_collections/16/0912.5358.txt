It is shown that the curious identity of Simons follows immediately from
Euler's series transformation formula and also from an identity due to
Ljunggren. The relation of Simons' identity to Legendre's polynomials is also
discussed. At the end we use the generalized Euler series transformation to
obtain two recent binomial identities of Munarini.
