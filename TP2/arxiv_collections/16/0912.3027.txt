A new view on the Kowalevski top and the Kowalevski integration procedure is
presented. For more than a century, the Kowalevski 1889 case, attracts full
attention of a wide community as the highlight of the classical theory of
integrable systems. Despite hundreds of papers on the subject, the Kowalevski
integration is still understood as a magic recipe, an unbelievable sequence of
skilful tricks, unexpected identities and smart changes of variables. The
novelty of our present approach is based on our four observations. The first
one is that the so-called fundamental Kowalevski equation is an instance of a
pencil equation of the theory of conics which leads us to a new geometric
interpretation of the Kowalevski variables $w, x_1, x_2$ as the pencil
parameter and the Darboux coordinates, respectively. The second is observation
of the key algebraic property of the pencil equation which is followed by
introduction and study of a new class of {\bf discriminantly separable
polynomials}. All steps of the Kowalevski integration procedure are now derived
as easy and transparent logical consequences of our theory of discriminantly
separable polynomials. The third observation connects the Kowalevski
integration and the pencil equation with the theory of multi-valued groups. The
Kowalevski change of variables is now recognized as an example of a two-valued
group operation and its action. The final observation is surprising equivalence
of the associativity of the two-valued group operation and its action to $n=3$
case of the Great Poncelet Theorem for pencils of conics.
