We propose a particular encoding for bipartite entangled states derived from
multipartite cluster-type entangled coherent states (CTECSs). We investigate
the effects of amplitude damping on the entanglement content of this bipartite
state, as well as its usefulness as a quantum channel for teleportation. We
find interesting relationships among the amplitude of the coherent states
constituting the CTECSs, the number of subsystems forming the logical qubits
(redundancy), and the extent to which amplitude damping affects the
entanglement of the channel. For instance, in the sense of sudden death of
entanglement, given a fixed value of the initial coherent state amplitude, the
entanglement life span is shortened if redundancy is increased.
