Controlling the bandgap of carbon nanostructures is key to the development
and mainstream application of carbon-based nanoelectronic devices. We report
density functional theory calculations of the effect of silicon impurities on
the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We have found that Si
adatoms open up a bandgap in intrinsically metallic CNTs even when the linear
density of Si atoms is low enough that they do not create a bonded adatom
chain. The bandgap opened in metallic CNTs can range between 0.10 eV and 0.47
eV, depending on adsorption site, linear density of Si adatoms, and CNT
chirality.
