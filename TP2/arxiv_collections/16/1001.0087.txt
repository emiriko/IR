We discuss the information that can be obtained from an analysis of
fluctuations in heavy ion collisions within the context of the statistical
model of particle production. We then examine the recently published
experimental data on ratio fluctuations, and use it to obtain constraints on
the statistical properties (physically relevant ensemble, degree of chemical
equilibration, scaling across energies and system sizes) and freeze-out
dynamics (amount of reinteraction between chemical and thermal freeze-out) of
the system.
