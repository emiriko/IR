I present a perturbative calculation of the spectrum of the Faddeev-Popov
operator in Coulomb gauge in three dimensions, and Landau gauge in two and
three dimensions, with an ansatz for the gluon propagator as the
non-perturbative input. The results show how the low-lying Faddeev-Popov
eigenvalue spectrum is modified as the first Gribov horizon is approached, and
how the spectra can differ in Coulomb and Landau gauges.
