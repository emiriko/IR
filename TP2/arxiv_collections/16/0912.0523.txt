We give a complete definition of the entanglement gap separating low-energy,
topological levels, from high-energy, generic ones, in the "entanglement
spectrum" of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states. By removing the magnetic
length inherent in the FQH problem - a procedure which we call taking the
"conformal limit", we find that the entanglement spectrum of an incompressible
ground-state of a generic (i.e. Coulomb) lowest Landau Level Hamiltonian
re-arranges into a low-(entanglement) energy part separated by a full gap from
the high energy entanglement levels. As previously observed, the counting of
these levels starts off as the counting of modes of the edge theory of the FQH
state, but quickly develops finite-size effects which we show can also serve as
a fingerprint of the FQH state. As the sphere manifold where the FQH resides
grows, the level spacing of the states at the same angular momentum goes to
zero, suggestive of the presence of relativistic gapless edge-states. By using
the adiabatic continuity of the low entanglement energy levels, we investigate
whether two states are topologically connected.
