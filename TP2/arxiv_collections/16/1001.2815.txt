We prove the following "linkage" theorem: two p-regular graphs of the same
genus can be obtained from one another by a finite alternating sequence of
one-edge-contractions; moreover this preserves 3-edge-connectivity. We use the
linkage theorem to prove that various moduli spaces of tropical curves are
connected through codimension one.
