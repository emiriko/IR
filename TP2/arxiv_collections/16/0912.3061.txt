Combining recent results on rational solutions of the Riccati-Schr\"odinger
equations for shape invariant potentials to the scheme developed by Fellows and
Smith in the case of the one dimensional harmonic oscillator, we show that it
is possible to generate an infinite set of solvable rational extensions for
every translationally shape invariant potential of the second category.
