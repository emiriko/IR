Spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is an established property of low-energy
quantum chromodynamics, but finding direct evidence for it from nuclear
structure data is a difficult challenge. Indeed, phenomenologically successful
energy-density functional approaches do not even have explicit pions. Are there
smoking guns for chiral symmetry in nuclei?
