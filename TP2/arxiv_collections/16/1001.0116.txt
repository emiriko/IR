With Girardeau's Fermi-Bose mapping, we have constructed the eigenstates of a
TG gas in an external magnetic field. When the number of bosons $N$ is
commensurate with the number of potential cycles $M$, the probability of this
TG gas in the ground state is bigger than the TG gas raised by Girardeau in
1960. Through the comparison of properties between this TG gas and Fermi gas,
we find that the following issues are always of the same: their average value
of particle's coordinate and potential energy, system's total momentum,
single-particle density and the pair distribution function. But the reduced
single-particle matrices and their momentum distributions between them are
different.
