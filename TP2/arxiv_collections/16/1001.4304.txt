What is physics? What are the limits of what physics can say about the world?
In seeking ever-broader theoretical `umbrellas' for physical phenomena, we are
seeking unifying principles. Emergent phenomena have turned out to be some of
the most difficult to explain, causing a `clash of umbrellas' so-to-speak, at
the interface between the quantum and classical domains. This essay explores
the role of articulation in this particularly vexing problem and ultimately
addresses the question of whether the language and mathematics we use to
describe the universe is sufficient in its present form and application.
