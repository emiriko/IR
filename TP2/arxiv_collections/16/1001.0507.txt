We present the first results of the application of supervised classification
methods to the Kepler Q1 long-cadence light curves of a subsample of 2288 stars
measured in the asteroseismology program of the mission. The methods,
originally developed in the framework of the CoRoT and Gaia space missions, are
capable of identifying the most common types of stellar variability in a
reliable way. Many new variables have been discovered, among which a large
fraction are eclipsing/ellipsoidal binaries unknown prior to launch. A
comparison is made between our classification from the Kepler data and the
pre-launch class based on data from the ground, showing that the latter needs
significant improvement. The noise properties of the Kepler data are compared
to those of the exoplanet program of the CoRoT satellite. We find that Kepler
improves on CoRoT by a factor 2 to 2.3 in point-to-point scatter.
