We enumerate rooted 2-connected and 3-connected surface maps with respect to
vertices and edges. We also derive the bivariate version of the large
face-width result for random 3-connected maps. These results are then used to
derive asymptotic formulas for the number of labelled graphs of genus g
(1-connected, 2-connected, and 3-connected graphs.)
