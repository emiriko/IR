This letter reports experimental results on a new type of soliton: the random
temporal dark soliton. One excites an incoherent large-amplitude propagating
spin-wave packet in a ferromagnetic film strip with a repulsive, instantaneous
nonlinearity. One then observes the random formation of dark solitons from this
wave packet. The solitons appear randomly in time and in position relative to
the entire wave packet. They can be gray or black. For wide and/or very strong
spin-wave packets, one also observes multiple dark solitons. In spite of the
randomness of the initial wave packets and the random formation processes, the
solitons show signatures that are found for conventional coherent dark
solitons.
