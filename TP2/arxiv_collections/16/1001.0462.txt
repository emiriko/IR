The point of view of these notes on the topic is to bring out the flavor that
Representation Theory is an extension of the first course on Group Theory. We
also emphasize the importance of base field. These notes cover completely the
theory over complex numbers which is Character Theory. A large number of worked
out examples are the main feature of these notes. The prerequisite for this
note is basic group theory and linear algebra.
