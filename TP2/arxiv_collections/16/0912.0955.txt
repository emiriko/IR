This study investigates the use of ear as a biometric for authentication and
shows experimental results obtained on a newly created dataset of 420 images.
Images are passed to a quality module in order to reduce False Rejection Rate.
The Principal Component Analysis (eigen ear) approach was used, obtaining 90.7
percent recognition rate. Improvement in recognition results is obtained when
ear biometric is fused with face biometric. The fusion is done at decision
level, achieving a recognition rate of 96 percent.
