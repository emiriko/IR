Bridging algorithms are global Monte Carlo moves which allow for an efficient
sampling of single polymer chains. In this manuscript we discuss the adaptation
of three bridging algorithms from lattice to continuum models, and give details
on the corrections to the acceptance rules which are required to fulfill
detailed balance. For the first time we are able to compare the efficiency of
the moves by analyzing the occurrence of knots in globular states. For a
flexible homopolymer chain of length N=1000, independent configurations can be
generated up to two orders of magnitude faster than with slithering snake
moves.
