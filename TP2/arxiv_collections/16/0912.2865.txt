We obtain an easy sufficient condition for the Brauer group of a diagonal
quartic surface D over Q to be algebraic. We also give an upper bound for the
order of the quotient of the Brauer group of D by the image of the Brauer group
of Q. The proof is based on the isomorphism of the Fermat quartic surface with
a Kummer surface due to Masumi Mizukami.
