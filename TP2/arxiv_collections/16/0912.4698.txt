A unitary model of the final state kaon pion interaction amplitudes in the B
--> K pi pi decays is constructed. The weak decay penguin amplitudes, derived
in QCD factorization, are supplemented by phenomenological contributions. The
strange kaon- pion scalar and vector form factors are used to calculate the
kaon pion effective mass and helicity angle distributions, branching ratios, CP
asymmetries and the phase difference between the B0 and anti B0 decay
amplitudes to K*(892) pi. The fit on the phenomenological parameters leads to a
good agreement with the experimental data, particularly for the
  B --> K*(892) pi decays. However, our predicted B+- --> K*0(1430) pi+-,
K*0(1430)--> K+-pi-+ branching fraction is smaller than the results of the
Belle and BaBar collaborations, obtained from isobar model analyses. A new
parameterization of the S-wave kaon- pion effective mass distribution, which
can be used in future experimental Dalitz plot analyses, is proposed.
