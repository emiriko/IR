Motivated by the detection of a recent outburst of the massive luminous blue
variable LMC-R71, which reached an absolute magnitude M_V = -9.3 mag, we
undertook a systematic study of the optical variability of 1268 massive stars
in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using a recent catalog by Bonanos et al. (2009)
as the input. The ASAS All Star Catalog (Pojmanski 2002) provided well-sampled
light curves of these bright stars spanning 10 years. Combining the two
catalogs resulted in 599 matches, on which we performed a variability search.
We identified 117 variable stars, 38 of which were not known before, despite
their brightness and large amplitude of variation. We found 13 periodic stars
that we classify as eclipsing binary (EB) stars, eight of which are newly
discovered bright, massive eclipsing binaries composed of OB type stars. The
remaining 104 variables are either semi- or non-periodic, the majority (85)
being red supergiants. Most (26) of the newly discovered variables in this
category are also red supergiants with only three B and four O stars.
