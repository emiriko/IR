In the context of the problem of what micro-states are responsible for the
entropy of black holes, we consider as a physical toy model the electromagnetic
Coulomb solution. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in the presence of an
external source of charge Q, the quantum state corresponding to the Coulomb
solution is identified as a coherent state of longitudinal and temporal photons
in a Hilbert space with negative norm states.
