We show that all M-theory backgrounds which admit more than 29 Killing
spinors are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we find that the
supercovariant curvature of all backgrounds which preserve 30 supersymmetries,
subject to field equations and Bianchi identities, vanishes, and that there are
no such solutions which arise as discrete quotients of maximally supersymmetric
backgrounds.
