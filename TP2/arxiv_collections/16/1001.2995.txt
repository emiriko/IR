The complex evolution of turbulent mixing in Rayleigh-Taylor convection is
studied in terms of eddy diffusiviy models for the mean temperature profile. It
is found that a non-linear model, derived within the general framework of
Prandtl mixing theory, reproduces accurately the evolution of turbulent
profiles obtained from numerical simulations. Our model allows to give very
precise predictions for the turbulent heat flux and for the Nusselt number in
the ultimate state regime of thermal convection.
