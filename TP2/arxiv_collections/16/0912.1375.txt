In previous works it was shown that protein 3D-conformations could be encoded
into discrete sequences called dominance partition sequences (DPS), that
generated a linear partition of molecular conformational space into regions of
molecular conformations that have the same DPS. In this work we describe
procedures for building in a cubic lattice the set of 3D-conformations that are
compatible with a given DPS. Furthermore, this set can be structured as a graph
upon which a combinatorial algorithm can be applied for computing the mean
energy of the conformations in a cell.
