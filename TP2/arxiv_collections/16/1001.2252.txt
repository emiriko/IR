New measurements of the masses and decay branching fractions of charmonium
and bottomonium states using the data collected by the CLEO detector are
presented. These include CLEO identification of the singlet states eta_c'(2S),
hc(1P), and eta_b(1S). Comparison with other experimental measurements and
theoretical models is also presented.
