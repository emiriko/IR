Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a peculiar subclass of mobile ad hoc
networks that raise a number of technical challenges, notably from the point of
view of their mobility models. In this paper, we provide a thorough analysis of
the connectivity of such networks by leveraging on well-known results of
percolation theory. By means of simulations, we study the influence of a number
of parameters, including vehicle density, proportion of equipped vehicles, and
radio communication range. We also study the influence of traffic lights and
roadside units. Our results provide insights on the behavior of connectivity.
We believe this paper to be a valuable framework to assess the feasibility and
performance of future applications relying on vehicular connectivity in urban
scenarios.
