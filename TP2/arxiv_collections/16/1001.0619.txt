We introduce the idea of a geometric categorical Lie algebra action on
derived categories of coherent sheaves. The main result is that such an action
induces an action of the braid group associated to the Lie algebra. The same
proof shows that strong categorical actions in the sense of Khovanov-Lauda and
Rouquier also lead to braid group actions. As an example, we construct a braid
group action on derived categories of coherent sheaves on cotangent bundles to
partial flag varieties.
