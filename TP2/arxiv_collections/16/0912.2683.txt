A comprehensive investigation of the frequency-noise spectral density of a
free-running mid-infrared quantum-cascade laser is presented for the first
time. It provides direct evidence of the leveling of this noise down to a white
noise plateau, corresponding to an intrinsic linewidth of a few hundred Hz. The
experiment is in agreement with the most recent theory on the fundamental
mechanism of line broadening in quantum-cascade lasers, which provides a new
insight into the Schawlow-Townes formula and predicts a narrowing beyond the
limit set by the radiative lifetime of the upper level.
