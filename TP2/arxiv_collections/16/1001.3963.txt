The GZK neutrino flux characterization would give insights into cosmological
source evolution, source spectra and composition at injection from the partial
recovery of the degraded information carried by the ultra high energy cosmic
rays. The flux is expected to be at levels necessitating a much larger
instrumented volume ($>$100 km$^3$) than those currently operating. First
suggested by Askaryan, both radio and acoustic detection techniques could
render this quest possible thanks to longer wave attenuation lengths (predicted
to exceed a kilometer) allowing for a much sparser instrumentation compared to
optical detection technique. We present the current acoustic R&D activities at
our lab developing adapted devices, report on the obtained sensitivies and
triangulation capabilities we obtained, and define some of the requirements for
the construction of a full scale detector.
