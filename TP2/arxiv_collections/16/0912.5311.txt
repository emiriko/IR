In Kelly et al. [Phys. Rev. D, 76:024008, 2007], we presented new binary
black-hole initial data adapted to puncture evolutions in numerical relativity.
This data satisfies the constraint equations to 2.5 post-Newtonian order, and
contains a transverse-traceless "wavy" metric contribution, violating the
standard assumption of conformal flatness. We report on progress in evolving
this data with a modern moving-puncture implementation of the BSSN equations in
several numerical codes. We discuss the effect of the new metric terms on junk
radiation and continuity of physical radiation extracted.
