The paper is concerned with the problem of explosive solutions for a class of
nonlinear stochastic wave equations in a domain
$\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d\leq3$. Under appropriate conditions on
the initial data, the nonlinear term and the noise intensity is proved in
Theorem 3.1 that the $L^2$-norm of the solution will blow up at a finite time
in the mean-square sense. An example is given to show an application of the
theorem.
