We use two available methods, the Duhem-Gibbs relation and the entropy
formula in terms of particle phase space distributions, to calculate the
entropy in a quark combination model. The entropy of the system extracted from
the Duhem-Gibbs relation is found to increase in hadronization if the average
temperature of the hadronic phase is lower than that of the quark phase. The
increase of the entropy can also be confirmed from the entropy formula if the
volume of the hadronic phase is larger than 2.5-3.0 times that of the quark
phase. So whether the entropy increases or decreases during combination depends
on the temperature before and after combination and on how much expansion the
system undergoes during combination. The current study provides an example to
shed light on the entropy issue in the quark combination model.
