We reveal cosmic star-formation history obscured by dust using deep infrared
observation with the AKARI. A continuous filter coverage in the mid-IR
wavelength (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 24um) by the AKARI satellite
allows us to estimate restframe 8um and 12um luminosities without using a large
extrapolation based on a SED fit, which was the largest uncertainty in previous
work. We found that restframe 8um (0.38<z<2.2), 12um (0.15<z<1.16), and total
infrared (TIR) luminosity functions (LFs) (0.2<z<1.6) constructed from the
AKARI NEP deep data, show a continuous and strong evolution toward higher
redshift. In terms of cosmic infrared luminosity density (Omega_IR), which was
obtained by integrating analytic fits to the LFs, we found a good agreement
with previous work at z<1.2, with Omega_IR propto (1+z)^4.4+-1.0. When we
separate contributions to Omega_IR by LIRGs and ULIRGs, we found more IR
luminous sources are increasingly more important at higher redshift. We found
that the ULIRG (LIRG) contribution increases by a factor of 10 (1.8) from
z=0.35 to z=1.4.
