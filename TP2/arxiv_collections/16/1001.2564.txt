At intermediate redshifts, many galaxies seem to be perturbed or suffering
from an interaction. Considering that disk galaxies may have formed and evolved
through minor mergers or through major mergers, it is important to understand
the mechanisms at play during each type of merger in order to be able to
establish the outcome of such an event. In some cases, only the use of both
morphological and kinematical information can disentangle the actual
configuration of an encounter at intermediate redshift.
  In this work, we present the morphological and kinematical analysis of a
system at z=0.74 in order to understand its configuration, interacting stage
and evolution. Using the integral field spectrograph GIRAFFE, long-slit
spectroscopy by FORS2 and direct optical images from the HST-ACS and ISAAC
near-infrared images, we disentangle the morphology of this system, its
star-formation history and its extended kinematics in order to propose a
possible configuration for the system. Numerical simulations are used to test
different interacting scenarii. We identify this system as a face-on disk
galaxy with a very bright bar in interaction with a smaller companion with a
mass ratio of 3:1. The relevance of kinematical information and the constraints
it imposes on the interpretation of the observations of distant galaxies is
particularly strengthened in this case.
  This object is amongst the best example on how one may misinterpret
morphology in the absence of kinematical information.
