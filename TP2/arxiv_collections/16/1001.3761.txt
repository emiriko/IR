We study the energy of quasi-particles in graphene within the Hartree-Fock
approximation. The quasi-particles are confined via an inhomogeneous magnetic
field and interact via the Coulomb potential. We show that the associated
functional has a minimizer and determine the stability conditions for the
N-particle problem in such a graphene quantum dot.
