We have obtained the zero-temperature phase diagram of the kagome
antiferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in Schwinger-boson
mean-field theory. We find quantum phase transitions (first or second order)
between different topological spin liquids and Neel ordered phases (either the
$\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ state or the so-called Q=0 state). In the regime of
small Schwinger-boson density, the results bear some resemblances with exact
diagonalization results and we briefly discuss some issues of the mean-field
treatment. We calculate the equal-time structure factor (and its angular
average to allow for a direct comparison with experiments on powder samples),
which extends earlier work on the classical kagome to the quantum regime. We
also discuss the dynamical structure factors of the topological spin liquid and
the Neel ordered phase.
