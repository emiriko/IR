One of the most challenging problems we face in our understanding of planet
formation is how Jupiter and Saturn could have formed before the the solar
nebula dispersed. The most popular model of giant planet formation is the
so-called 'core accretion' model. In this model a large planetary embryo formed
first, mainly by two-body accretion. This is then followed by a period of
inflow of nebular gas directly onto the growing planet. The core accretion
model has an Achilles heel, namely the very first step. We have undertaken the
most comprehensive study of this process to date. In this study we numerically
integrate the orbits of a number of planetary embryos embedded in a swarm of
planetesimals. In these experiments we have included: 1) aerodynamic gas drag,
2) collisional damping between planetesimals, 3) enhanced embryo cross-sections
due to their atmospheres, 4) planetesimal fragmentation, and 5) planetesimal
driven migration. We find that the gravitational interaction between the
embryos and the planetesimals lead to the wholesale redistribution of material
- regions are cleared of material and gaps open near the embryos. Indeed, in
90% of our simulations without fragmentation, the region near that embryos is
cleared of planetesimals before much growth can occur. The remaining 10%,
however, the embryos undergo a burst of outward migration that significantly
increases growth. On timescales of ~100,000 years, the outer embryo can migrate
~6 AU and grow to roughly 30 Earth-masses. We also find that the inclusion of
planetesimal fragmentation tends to inhibit growth.
