Transition State Theory forms the basis of computing reaction rates in
chemical and other systems. Recently it has been shown how transition state
theory can rigorously be realized in phase space using an explicit algorithm.
The quantization has been demonstrated to lead to an efficient procedure to
compute cumulative reaction probabilities and the associated Gamov-Siegert
resonances. In this letter these results are used to express the cumulative
reaction probability as an absolutely convergent sum over periodic orbits
contained in the transition state.
