We explore unification of dark matter and dark energy in a theory containing
a scalar field of non-Lagrangian type, obtained by direct insertion of a
kinetic term into the energy-momentum tensor. This scalar is different from
quintessence, having an equation of state between -1 and 0 and a zero sound
speed in its rest frame. We solve the equations of motion for an exponential
potential via a rewriting as an autonomous system, and demonstrate the
observational viability of the scenario, for sufficiently small exponential
potential parameter \lambda, by comparison to a compilation of kinematical
cosmological data.
