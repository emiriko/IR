We report the discovery of serendipitous electrocaloric effects in commercial
multilayer capacitors based on ferroelectric BaTiO3. Direct thermometry records
~0.5 K changes due to 300 kV cm-1, over a wide range of temperatures near and
above room temperature. Similar results are obtained indirectly, via
thermodynamic analysis of ferroelectric hysteresis loops. We compare and
contrast these two results. Optimised electrocaloric multilayer capacitors
could find applications in future cooling technologies.
