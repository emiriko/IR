The so called \emph{quantum game theory} has recently been proclaimed as one
of the new branches in the development of both quantum information theory and
game theory. However, the notion of a quantum game itself has never been
strictly defined, which has led to a lot of conceptual confusion among
different authors. In this paper we introduce a new conceptual framework of a
\emph{scenario} and an \emph{implementation} of a game. It is shown that the
procedures of "quantization" of games proposed in the literature lead in fact
to several different games which can be defined within the same scenario, but
apart from this they may have nothing in common with the original game. Within
the framework we put forward, a lot of conceptual misunderstandings that have
arisen around "quantum games" can be stated clearly and resolved uniquely. In
particular, the proclaimed essential role of entanglement in several static
"quantum games", and their connection with Bell inequalities, is disproved.
