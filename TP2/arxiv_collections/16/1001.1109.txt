Nature's materials are complex, multifunctional, hierarchical and responsive
and in most instances functionality on the nanoscale is combined with
performance on the macroscale. Materials engineers have just started to produce
complex nanomaterials. Biomimicry and biomimetics deal with knowledge transfer
from nature to technology. Inspired by the 'Biomimicry and Design Workshops'
and the 'Biomimicry Innovation Method' by the US based Biomimicry Guild, '3D
Corporate Tourism', a solution based approach to innovation in nanomaterials
research, is proposed. The three main pillars of this integrated concept are
discover, develop and design. Biologists, research and development engineers as
well as designers jointly work in an environment with high inspirational
potential and construct first prototypes and designs on site. This joint
approach yields new links, networks and collaborations between communities of
thinkers in different countries in order to stimulate and enhance creative and
application oriented problem solving for society.
