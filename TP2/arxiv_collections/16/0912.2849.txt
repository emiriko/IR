The dynamic structure factor of a harmonically trapped Bose gas has been
calculated well above the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature by treating
the gas cloud as a canonical ensemble of noninteracting classical particles.
The static structure factor is found to vanish as wavenumber squared in the
long-wavelength limit. We also incorporate a relaxation mechanism
phenomenologically by including a stochastic friction force to study the
dynamic structure factor. A significant temperature dependence of the
density-fluctuation spectra is found. The Debye-Waller factor has been
calculated for the trapped thermal cloud as function of wavenumber and of
particle number. A substantial difference is found between clouds of small and
large particle number.
