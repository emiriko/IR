We undertake another attempt towards seismic modelling of the most intensive
studied main sequence pulsators of the early B spectral type, $\nu$ Eridani.
Our analysis is extended by a requirement of fitting not only pulsational
frequencies but also the complex amplitude of the bolometric flux variation,
$f$, related to each mode frequency. This approach, called {\it complex
asteroseismology}, provides a unique test of stellar parameters, atmospheres
and opacities. In particular, the concordance of the empirical and theoretical
values of $f$ we obtained for the high-order g mode opens a new gate in seismic
studies of the main-sequence hybrid pulsators. The most intriguing and
challenging result is that whereas an agreement of the theoretical and
empirical values of $f$ for the radial mode can be achieved only with the OPAL
data, a preference for the OP tables is derived from the analysis of the
high-order gravity mode.
