Using first-principles calculations, we systematically study the dissociation
of O$_2$ molecules on different ultrathin Pb(111) films. Based on our previous
work revealing the molecular adsorption precursor states for O$_2$, we further
explore that why there are two nearly degenerate adsorption states on Pb(111)
ultrathin films, but no precursor adsorption states exist at all on the
Mg(0001) and Al(111) surfaces. And the reason is concluded to be the different
surface electronic structures. For the O$_2$ dissociation, we consider both the
reaction channels from gas-like and molecularly adsorbed O$_2$ molecules. We
find that the energy barrier for O$_2$ dissociation from the molecular
adsorption precursor states is always smaller than from O$_2$ gases. The most
energetically favorable dissociation process is found to be the same on
different Pb(111) films, and the energy barriers are found to be modulated by
the quantum size effects of Pb(111) films.
