We study the Fe/W(110) monolayer system through a combination of first
principles calculations and atomistic spin dynamics simulations. We focus on
the dispersion of the spin waves parallel to the [001] direction. Our results
compare favorably with the experimental data of Prokop et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
102, 177206], and correctly capture a drastic softening of the magnon spectrum,
with respect to bulk bcc Fe. The suggested shortcoming of the itinerant
electron model, in particular that given by density functional theory, is
refuted. We also demonstrate that finite temperature effects are significant,
and that atomistic spin dynamics simulations represent a powerful tool with
which to include these.
