Since its launch in June 2008, the Large Area Telescope (LAT), onboard the
\emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has greatly added to our understanding
of gamma-ray pulsars. Its fine point spread function and large effective area,
combined with the time-differencing method, make it the first gamma-ray
instrument capable of discovering a new population of gamma-ray pulsars. We
will present the recent discovery of the youngest (~4600 yr) radio-quiet
gamma-ray pulsar discovered in a blind frequency search so far: PSR J1022-5746,
a pulsar associated with an extended TeV source. We also present
multiwavelength observations of the source, including X-ray observations.
