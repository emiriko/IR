We report on an experimental violation of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
(Bell-CHSH) inequality using energy-time entangled photons. The experiment is
not free of the locality and detection loopholes, but is the first violation of
the Bell-CHSH inequality using energy-time entangled photons which is free of
the postselection loophole described by Aerts et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 2872
(1999)].
