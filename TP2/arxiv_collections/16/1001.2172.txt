Transportation networks play a crucial role in human mobility, the exchange
of goods, and the spread of invasive species. With 90% of world trade carried
by sea, the global network of merchant ships provides one of the most important
modes of transportation. Here we use information about the itineraries of
16,363 cargo ships during the year 2007 to construct a network of links between
ports. We show that the network has several features which set it apart from
other transportation networks. In particular, most ships can be classified in
three categories: bulk dry carriers, container ships and oil tankers. These
three categories do not only differ in the ships' physical characteristics, but
also in their mobility patterns and networks. Container ships follow regularly
repeating paths whereas bulk dry carriers and oil tankers move less predictably
between ports. The network of all ship movements possesses a heavy-tailed
distribution for the connectivity of ports and for the loads transported on the
links with systematic differences between ship types. The data analyzed in this
paper improve current assumptions based on gravity models of ship movements, an
important step towards understanding patterns of global trade and bioinvasion.
