We study the possibility to describe multiple M0-brane system in the frame of
superembedding approach. The simplest framework is provided by the maximally
supersymmetric non-Abelian SU(N) Yang-Mills supermultiplet on the d=1 N=16
superspace the embedding of which to the target D=11 supergravity superspace is
determined by the so-called superembedding equation, characteristic of the
worldline superspace of a single M0-brane. We use it to obtain a covariant
generalization of the Matrix model equations describing the multiple M0-system
in flat target superspace.
