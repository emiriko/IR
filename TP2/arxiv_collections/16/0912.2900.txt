We study global controllability of 'rotating' multidimensional rigid body
(MRB) controlled by application of few torques. Study by methods of geometric
control requires analysis of algebraic structure introduced by the quadratic
term of Euler-Frahm equation. We discuss problems, which arise in the course of
this analysis, and establish several global controllability criteria for damped
and non damped cases.
