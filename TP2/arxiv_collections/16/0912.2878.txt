The paper presents an adaptive over-relaxation method for calculating the
electric potential and field intensity, for a complex tunnel transistor
structure involving a split gate and a shielding boundary. The accuracy and
speed of the method has been numerically tested and found satisfactory for the
study of such devices by calculating the tunneling currents for the obtained
potential distribution.
