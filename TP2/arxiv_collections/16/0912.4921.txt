We suggest a possible realization of a solid-state memory capacitive
(memcapacitive) system. Our approach relies on the slow polarization rate of a
medium between plates of a regular capacitor. To achieve this goal, we consider
a multi-layer structure embedded in a capacitor. The multi-layer structure is
formed by metallic layers separated by an insulator so that non-linear
electronic transport (tunneling) between the layers can occur. The suggested
memcapacitor shows hysteretic charge-voltage and capacitance-voltage curves,
and both negative and diverging capacitance within certain ranges of the field.
This proposal can be easily realized experimentally, and indicates the
possibility of information storage in memcapacitive devices.
