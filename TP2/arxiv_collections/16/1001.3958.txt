The low energy infrared scaling of the multi-color 2-dimensional quantum
chromodynamics is determined in the framework of its bosonized model by using
the functional renormalization group method with gliding sharp cut-off k in
momentum space in the local potential approximation. The model exhibits a
single phase with a superuniversal effective potential.
