The influence of local magnetic moment formation around three kinds of
vacancies on the electron conduction through metallic single-wall carbon
nanotubes is studied by use of the Landauer formalism within the coherent
regime. The method is based on the single-band tight-binding Hamiltonian, a
surface Green's function calculation, and the mean-field Hubbard model. The
numerical results show that the electronic transport is spin-polarized due to
the localized magnetic moments and it is strongly dependent on the geometry of
the vacancies. For all kinds of vacancies, by including the effects of local
magnetic moments, the electron scattering increases with respect to the
nonmagnetic vacancies case and hence, the current-voltage characteristic of the
system changes. In addition, a high value for the electron-spin polarization
can be obtained by applying a suitable gate voltage.
