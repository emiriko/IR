A program is outlined, and first results described, in which fully
three-dimensional, time dependent simulations of hydrodynamic turbulence are
used as a basis for theoretical investigation of the physics of turbulence in
stars. The inadequacy of the treatment of turbulent convection as a diffusive
process is discussed. A generalization to rotation and magnetohydrodynamics is
indicated, as are connection to simulations of 3D stellar atmospheres.
