We perform a detailed parton level study on the feasibility of the detection
of a Higgs boson in the gluon fusion process $pp (gg+gq) \to h + jet \to \tau^+
\tau^- + jet$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The obtained results are
applied to a few chosen Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios where the
branching ratio of a Higgs boson decaying into a $\tau^+ \tau^-$ pair is
enhanced as compared to the Standard Model (SM) case. We present the parameter
space of the BSM scenarios that can be observed at the LHC and conclude that
some regions of the parameter space can be probed with just a few $fb^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity. Noticeably, our results are presented in a form which
potentially allows their application to any generic model giving rise to a $pp
(gg+gq) \to h + jet \to \tau^+ \tau^- + jet$ signature.
