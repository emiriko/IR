We consider a time independent Schrodinger type equation derived from the
equations of motion that drives a single scalar field in a standard cosmology
model for inflation in a flat space-time with a Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
metric with a cosmological constant. We find that all the 1-dimensional bound
state solutions of quantum mechanics lead to at least one exact solution for
the dynamical equations of standard cosmology, and that these solutions
resemble the most recurrent inflationary solutions found in the literature. The
analogies derived from this approach may be used to realize a deeper
understanding of the dynamics of the model.
