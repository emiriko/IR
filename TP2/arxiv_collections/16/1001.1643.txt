In this paper we investigate gradings on tame blocks of group algebras whose
defect group is dihedral. We classify gradings on an arbitrary dihedral block
up to graded Morita equivalence. We do this by computing the group of outer
automorphisms that fix the isomorphism classes of simple modules. We also show
how to grade these blocks via transfer of gradings via dervied equivalences.
