In this article, we assume that the narrow structure X(4350) is a scalar
$\bar{c}c-{D}_s^\ast {\bar {D}}_s^\ast$ mixing state, and study its mass using
the QCD sum rules. The numerical result $M_X=(4.37\pm0.15)\,\rm{GeV}$ is in
good agreement with the experimental data, the X(4350) may be a scalar
$\bar{c}c-{D}_s^\ast {\bar {D}}_s^\ast$ mixing state. Other possibility, such
as a scalar (tensor) $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state is not excluded.
