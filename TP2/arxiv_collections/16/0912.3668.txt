We consider an alternative explanation of newly found growth of neutral pion
transition form factor with virtuality of one of photon. It is based on Sudakov
suppression of quark-photon vertex. Some applications to scattering and
annihilation channels are considered including the relevant experiments with
lepton-proton scattering.
