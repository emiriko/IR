We investigate the normal state of the '11' iron-based superconductor
FeSe0.42Te0.58 by angle resolved photoemission. Our data reveal a highly
renormalized quasiparticle dispersion characteristic of a strongly correlated
metal. We find sheet dependent effective carrier masses between ~ 3 - 16 m_e
corresponding to a mass enhancement over band structure values of m*/m_band ~ 6
- 20. This is nearly an order of magnitude higher than the renormalization
reported previously for iron-arsenide superconductors of the '1111' and '122'
families but fully consistent with the bulk specific heat.
