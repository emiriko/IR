In this paper we study the isotropic cases of static charged fluid spheres in
general relativity. For this purpose we consider two different specialization
and under these we solve the Einstein-Maxwell field equations in isotropic
coordinates. The analytical solutions thus we obtained are matched to the
exterior Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions which concern with the values for the
metric coefficients $e^{\nu}$ and $e^{\mu}$. We derive the pressure, density,
pressure-to-density ratio at the centre of the charged fluid sphere and
boundary $R$ of the star. Our conclusion is that static charged fluid spheres
provide a good connection to compact stars.
