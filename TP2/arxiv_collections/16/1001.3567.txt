We give a coalgebra structure on 1-vertex irreducible graphs which is that of
a cocommutative coassociative graded connected coalgebra. We generalize the
coproduct to the algebraic representation of graphs so as to express a bare
1-particle irreducible n-point function in terms of its loop order
contributions. The algebraic representation is so that graphs can be evaluated
as Feynman graphs.
