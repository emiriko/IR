We demonstrate that a p-n junction created electrically in HgTe quantum wells
with inverted band-structure exhibits interesting intraband and interband
tunneling processes. We find a perfect intraband transmission for electrons
injected perpendicularly to the interface of the p-n junction. The opacity and
transparency of electrons through the p-n junction can be tuned by changing the
incidence angle, the Fermi energy and the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit
interaction. The occurrence of a conductance plateau due to the formation of
topological edge states in a quasi-one-dimensional p-n junction can be switched
on and off by tuning the gate voltage. The spin orientation can be
substantially rotated when the samples exhibit a moderately strong Rashba
spin-orbit interaction.
