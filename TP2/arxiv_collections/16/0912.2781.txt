We present a detailed study of the physical properties of the nebular
material in multiple knots of the blue compact dwarf galaxy Haro 15. Using long
slit and echelle spectroscopy, obtained at Las Campanas Observatory, we study
the physical conditions (electron density and temperature), ionic and total
chemical abundances of several atoms, reddening and ionization structure. The
latter was derived by comparing the oxygen and sulphur ionic ratios to their
corresponding observed emission line ratios (the eta and eta' plots) in
different regions of the galaxy. Applying direct and empirical methods for
abundance determination, we perform a comparative analysis between these
regions.
