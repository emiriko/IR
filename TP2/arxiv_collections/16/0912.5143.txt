In this work we modify the wave-corpuscle mechanics for elementary charges
introduced by us recently. This modification is designed to better describe
electromagnetic (EM) phenomena at atomic scales. It includes a modification of
the concept of the classical EM field and a new model for the elementary charge
which we call a balanced charge (b-charge). A b-charge does not interact with
itself electromagnetically, and every b-charge possesses its own elementary EM
field. The EM energy is naturally partitioned as the interaction energy between
pairs of different b-charges. We construct EM theory of b-charges (BEM) based
on a relativistic Lagrangian with the following properties: (i) b-charges
interact only through their elementary EM potentials and fields; (ii) the field
equations for the elementary EM fields are exactly the Maxwell equations with
proper currents; (iii) a free charge moves uniformly preserving up to the
Lorentz contraction its shape; (iv) the Newton equations with the Lorentz
forces hold approximately when charges are well separated and move with
non-relativistic velocities. The BEM theory can be characterized as
neoclassical one which covers the macroscopic as well as the atomic spatial
scales, it describes EM phenomena at atomic scale differently than the
classical EM theory. It yields in macroscopic regimes the Newton equations with
Lorentz forces for centers of well separated charges moving with
nonrelativistic velocities. Applied to atomic scales it yields a hydrogen atom
model with a frequency spectrum matching the same for the Schrodinger model
with any desired accuracy.
