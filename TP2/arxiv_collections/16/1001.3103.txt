In this paper we provide strong evidence that there is no ambiguity in the
choice of the horizon function underlying the Gribov-Zwanziger action. We show
that there is only one correct possibility which is determined by the
requirement of multiplicative renormalizability. As a consequence, this means
that relations derived from other horizon functions cannot be given a
consistent interpretation in terms of a local and renormalizable quantum field
theory. In addition, we also discuss that the Kugo-Ojima functions $u(p^2)$ and
$w(p^2)$ can only be defined after renormalization of the underlying Green
function(s).
