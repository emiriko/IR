We present the first of a two-part Mathematica notebook collection that
implements a symbolic approach for the application of the density matrix
expansion (DME) to the Hartree-Fock (HF) energy from a chiral effective field
theory (EFT) three-nucleon interaction at N$^2$LO. The final output from the
notebooks is a Skyrme-like energy density functional that provides a
quasi-local approximation to the nonlocal HF energy. In this paper, we discuss
the derivation of the HF energy and its simplification in terms of the
scalar/vector-isoscalar/isovector parts of the one-body density matrix.
Furthermore, a set of steps is described and illustrated on how to extend the
approach to other three-nucleon interactions.
