The role of $\ell_{1}$-norm in Quantum Mechanics (QM) has been studied
through Wigner's D-functions where $\ell_{1}$-norm means
$\sum_{i}\left|C_{i}\right|$ for $\left|\Psi\right\rangle
=\sum_{i}C_{i}\left|\psi_{i}\right\rangle $ if $\left|\psi_{i}\right\rangle $
are uni-orthogonal and normalized basis. It was shown that the present two
types of transformation matrix acting on the natural basis in physics consist
in an unified braiding matrix, which can be viewed as a particular solution of
the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). The maximum of the $\ell_{1}$-norm is connected
with the maximally entangled states and topological quantum field theory (TQFT)
with two-component anyons while the minimum leads to the permutation for
fermions or bosons.
