We have implemented a code for Z' + n jets production in ALPGEN, with Z'
decays into several final states, including l+ l- and t tbar. The MLM
prescription is used for matching the matrix element with the parton shower,
including in this way the leading soft and collinear corrections. In order to
demonstrate its capabilities, we perform a combined analysis of Z' -> t tbar
and Z' -> t tbar j production for a heavy leptophobic gauge boson. It is found
that the effect of the extra jet cannot only be accounted for by a K factor
multiplying the leading-order cross section. In fact, the combined analysis for
Z' -> t tbar and Z' -> t tbar j presented improves the statistical significance
of the signal by 25% (8.55 sigma versus 6.77 sigma for a Z' mass of 1 TeV),
compared with the results of an inclusive analysis carried out on the same
sample of t tbar + t tbar j events.
