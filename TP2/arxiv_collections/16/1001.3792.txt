We present experimental evidence that a bubble moving in a fluid in which a
well-chosen acoustic noise is superimposed can be significantly slowed down for
moderate acoustic pressures. Through mean velocity measurements, we show that a
condition for this effect to occur is for the acoustic noise spectrum to match
or overlap the bubble's fundamental resonant mode. By rendering the bubble's
oscillations and translational movements using high speed video, we evidence
that radial oscillations have no effect on the mean velocity, while above a
critical sound pressure threshold, Faraday waves are triggered and are
responsible for the bubble's drag increase.
