In this paper we prove the global well-posedness for a three-dimensional
Boussinesq system with axisymmetric initial data. This system couples the
Navier-Stokes equation with a transport-diffusion equation governing the
temperature. Our result holds uniformly with respect to the heat conductivity
coefficient $\kappa \geq 0$ which may vanish.
