We present 7 sequential weekly observations of NGC 5548 conducted in 2007
with the \textit{Suzaku} X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) in the 0.2-12 keV
band and Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) in 10-600 keV band. The iron K$\alpha$ line
is well detected in all seven observations and K$\beta$ line is also detected
in four observations. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the Fe K
lines using both the width of the line and the reverberation mapping method.
  With the co-added XIS and HXD spectra, we identify Fe K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$
line at 6.396$_{-0.007}^{+0.009}$ keV and 7.08$_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ keV,
respectively. The width of line obtained from the co-added spectra is
38$_{-18}^{+16}$ eV ($\textrm{FWHM}=4200_{-2000}^{+1800}$ km/s) which
corresponds to a radius of 20$_{-10}^{+50}$ light days, for the virial
production of $1.220\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ in NCG 5548.
  To quantitatively investigate the origin of the narrow Fe line by the
reverberation mapping method, we compare the observed light curves of Fe
K$\alpha$ line with the predicted ones, which are obtained by convolving the
continuum light curve with the transfer functions in a thin shell and an
inclined disk. The best-fit result is given by the disk case with $i=30^\circ$
which is better than a fit to a constant flux of the Fe K line at the 92.7%
level (F-test). We find that the emitting radius obtained from the light curve
is 25-37 light days, which is consistent with the radius derived from the Fe K
line width. Combining the results of the line width and variation, the most
likely site for the origin of the narrow iron lines is 20-40 light days away
from the central engine, though other possibilities are not completely ruled
out. (abridged)
