We study a class of parametrizations of convex cones of positive semidefinite
matrices with prescribed zeros. Each such cone corresponds to a graph whose
non-edges determine the prescribed zeros. Each parametrization in this class is
a polynomial map associated with a simplicial complex supported on cliques of
the graph. The images of the maps are convex cones, and the maps can only be
surjective onto the cone of zero-constrained positive semidefinite matrices
when the associated graph is chordal and the simplicial complex is the clique
complex of the graph. Our main result gives a semi-algebraic description of the
image of the parametrizations for chordless cycles. The work is motivated by
the fact that the considered maps correspond to Gaussian statistical models
with hidden variables.
