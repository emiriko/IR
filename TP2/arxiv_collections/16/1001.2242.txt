For a complete hyperbolic three manifold M, we consider the representations
of its fundamental group obtained by composing a lift of the holonomy with
complex finite dimensional representations of SL(2,C). We prove a vanishing
result for the cohomology of M with coefficients twisted by these
representations, using techniques of Matsushima-Murakami. We give some
applications to local rigidity.
