A strong coupling between convection and pulsations is known to play a major
role in the disappearance of unstable modes close to the red edge of the
classical Cepheid instability strip. As mean-field models of time-dependent
convection rely on weakly-constrained parameters, we tackle this problem by the
means of 2-D Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of kappa-mechanism with
convection.
  Using a linear stability analysis, we first determine the physical conditions
favourable to the kappa-mechanism to occur inside a purely-radiative layer.
Both the instability strips and the nonlinear saturation of unstable modes are
then confirmed by the corresponding DNS. We next present the new simulations
with convection, where a convective zone and the driving region overlap. The
coupling between the convective motions and acoustic modes is then addressed by
using projections onto an acoustic subspace.
