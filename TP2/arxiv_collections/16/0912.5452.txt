This text aims at discussing the relations between the cosmic acceleration
and the theory of gravitation and more generally with the hypotheses underlying
the construction of our cosmological model, such as the validity of general
relativity on astrophysical scales and the Copernican principle. We hope to
illustrate that cosmological data have now the potential of testing these
hypotheses, which go beyond the measurements of its parameters.
