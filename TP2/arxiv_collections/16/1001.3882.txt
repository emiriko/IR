Fluorescence lifetimes of nitrogen-vacancy color centers in individual
diamond nanocrystals were measured at the interface between a glass substrate
and a strongly scattering medium. Comparison of the results with values
recorded from the same nanocrystals at the glass-air interface revealed
fluctuations of fluorescence lifetimes in the scattering medium. After
discussing a range of possible systematic effects, we attribute the observed
lengthening of the lifetimes to the reduction of the local density of states.
Our approach is very promising for exploring the strong three-dimensional
localization of light directly on the microscopic scale.
