We describe an efficient implementation of a coherent statistic for
continuous gravitational wave searches from neutron stars. The algorithm works
by transforming the data taken by a gravitational wave detector from a moving
Earth bound frame to one that sits at the Solar System barycenter. Many
practical difficulties arise in the implementation of this algorithm, some of
which have not been discussed previously. These difficulties include
constraints of small computer memory, discreteness of the data, losses due to
interpolation and gaps in real data. This implementation is considerably more
efficient than previous implementations of these kinds of searches on Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave (LIGO) detector data.
