We derive the dispersionless Hirota equations of the universal Whitham
hierarchy from the kernel formula approach proposed by Carroll and Kodama.
Besides, we also verify the associativity equations in this hierarchy from the
dispersionless Hirota equations and give a realization of the associative
algebra with structure constants expressed in terms of the residue formulas.
