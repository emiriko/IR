We review the current status of calculations of the two pion decays of the
kaon using the first-principles methods of lattice gauge theory and the
significant challenges that these calculations pose. While a calculation with
controlled errors at even the 10-20% level has not yet been performed, present
results suggest that such a calculation of the real and imaginary parts of the
Delta I = 3/2 amplitude should be accomplished within the next two years. The
more difficult Delta I = 1/2 amplitude may also be now within reach.
