In this series of lectures it is illustrated how one can study the strong
dynamics of nuclei by means of the electroweak probe. In particular, the most
important steps to derive the cross sections in first order perturbation theory
are reviewed. In the derivation the focus is put on the main ingredients
entering the hadronic part (response functions), i.e. the initial and final
states of the system and the operators relevant for the reaction. Emphasis is
put on the electromagnetic interaction with few-nucleon systems. The Lorentz
integral transform method to calculate the response functions ab initio is
described. A few examples of the comparison between theoretical and
experimental results are shown. The dependence of the response functions on the
nuclear interaction and in particular on three-body forces is emphasized.
