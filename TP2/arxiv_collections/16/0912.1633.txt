Recent theoretical and experimental results demonstrate a close connection
between the super Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) gas and a 1D hard sphere Bose (HSB) gas
with hard sphere diameter nearly equal to the 1D scattering length $a_{1D}$ of
the sTG gas, a highly excited gas-like state with nodes only at interparticle
separations $|x_{j\ell}|=x_{node}\approx a_{1D}$. It is shown herein that when
the coupling constant $g_B$ in the Lieb-Liniger interaction
$g_B\delta(x_{j\ell})$ is negative and $|x_{12}|\ge x_{node}$, the sTG and HSB
wave functions for $N=2$ particles are not merely similar, but identical; the
only difference between the sTG and HSB wave functions is that the sTG wave
function allows a small penetration into the region $|x_{12}|<x_{node}$,
whereas for a HSB gas with hard sphere diameter $a_{h.s.}=x_{node}$, the HSB
wave function vanishes when all $|x_{12}|<a_{h.s.}$. Arguments are given
suggesting that the same theorem holds also for $N>2$. The sTG and HSB wave
functions for N=2 are given exactly in terms of a parabolic cylinder function,
and for $N\ge 2$, $x_{node}$ is given accurately by a simple parabola. The
metastability of the sTG phase generated by a sudden change of the coupling
constant from large positive to large negative values is explained in terms of
the very small overlap between the ground state of the Tonks-Girardeau gas and
collapsed cluster states.
