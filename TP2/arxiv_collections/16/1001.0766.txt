It is well known that for a given Poisson structure one has infinitely many
star products related through the Kontsevich gauge transformations. These gauge
transformations have an infinite functional dimension (i.e., correspond to an
infinite number of degrees of freedom per point of the base manifold). We show
that on a symplectic manifold this freedom may be almost completely eliminated
if one extends the star product to all tensor fields in a covariant way and
impose some natural conditions on the tensor algebra. The remaining ambiguity
either correspond to constant renormalizations to the symplectic structure, or
to maps between classically equivalent field theory actions. We also discuss
how one can introduce the Riemannian metric in this approach and the
consequences of our results for noncommutative gravity theories.
