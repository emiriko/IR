Coupled-channel Kbar-N dynamics near threshold and its repercussions in
few-body Kbar-nuclear systems are briefly reviewed, highlighting studies of a
K^-pp quasibound state. In heavier nuclei, the extension of mean-field
calculations to multi-Kbar nuclear and hypernuclear quasibound states is
discussed. It is concluded that strangeness in finite self-bound systems is
realized through hyperons, with no room for kaon condensation.
