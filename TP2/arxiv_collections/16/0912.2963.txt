We consider bipartitions of one-dimensional extended systems whose
probability distribution functions describe stationary states of stochastic
models. We define estimators of the shared information between the two
subsystems. If the correlation length is finite, the estimators stay finite for
large system sizes. If the correlation length diverges, so do the estimators.
The definition of the estimators is inspired by information theory. We look at
several models and compare the behavior of the estimators in the finite-size
scaling limit. Analytical and numerical methods as well as Monte Carlo
simulations are used. We show how the finite-size scaling functions change for
various phase transitions, including the case where one has conformal
invariance.
