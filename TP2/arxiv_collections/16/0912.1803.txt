The four LEP experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL successfully recorded
e+e- collision data during the years 1989 to 2000. As part of the ordinary
evolution in High Energy Physics, these experiments can not be repeated and
their data is therefore unique. This article briefly reviews the data
preservation efforts undertaken by the four experiments beyond the end of data
taking. The current status of the preserved data and associated tools is
summarised.
