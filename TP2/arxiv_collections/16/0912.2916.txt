We consider sufficient conditions for a degree sequence $\pi$ to be forcibly
$k$-factor graphical. We note that previous work on degrees and factors has
focused primarily on finding conditions for a degree sequence to be potentially
$k$-factor graphical.
  We first give a theorem for $\pi$ to be forcibly 1-factor graphical and, more
generally, forcibly graphical with deficiency at most $\beta\ge0$. These
theorems are equal in strength to Chv\'atal's well-known hamiltonian theorem,
i.e., the best monotone degree condition for hamiltonicity. We then give an
equally strong theorem for $\pi$ to be forcibly 2-factor graphical.
Unfortunately, the number of nonredundant conditions that must be checked
increases significantly in moving from $k=1$ to $k=2$, and we conjecture that
the number of nonredundant conditions in a best monotone theorem for a
$k$-factor will increase superpolynomially in $k$.
  This suggests the desirability of finding a theorem for $\pi$ to be forcibly
$k$-factor graphical whose algorithmic complexity grows more slowly. In the
final section, we present such a theorem for any $k\ge2$, based on Tutte's
well-known factor theorem. While this theorem is not best monotone, we show
that it is nevertheless tight in a precise way, and give examples illustrating
this tightness.
