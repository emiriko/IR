The final-state spectrum of $\beta$ decaying tritium anions T$^-$ was
calculated. The wavefunctions describing the initial T$^-$ ground state and the
final $^3$He states were obtained by the full configuration-interaction method.
The transition probability was calculated within the sudden approximation. The
transition probability into the electronic continuum is extracted from the
complex-scaled resolvent and is shown to converge for very high-energies to an
approximate analytical model probability distribution.
