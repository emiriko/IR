We generalized the squeeze and displacement operators of the one-dimensional
harmonic oscillator to the three-dimensional case and based on these operators
we construct the corresponding coherent and squeezed states. We have also
calculated the Wigner function for the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator
and from the analysis of time evolution of this function, the quantum Liouville
equation is also presented. Further properties of the quantum states including
Mandel's Q and quadrature squeezing parameters are discussed as well.
