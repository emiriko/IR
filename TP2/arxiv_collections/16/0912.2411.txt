We study the potential of International Linear Collider (ILC) at sqrt(s) =
500 GeV to probe new dark matter motivated scenario where the bottom squark
(sbottom) is the next to lightest supersymmetric particle. For this scenario,
which is virtually impossible for the LHC to test, the ILC has a potential to
cover a large fraction of the parameter space. The challenge is due to a very
low energy of jets, below 20-30 GeV, which pushes the jet clustering and
flavour tagging algorithms to their limits. The process of sbottom pair
production was studied within the SiD detector concept. We demonstrate that ILC
offers a unique opportunity to test the SUSY parameter space motivated by the
sbottom neutralino co-annihilation scenario in cases when the sbottom
production is kinematically accessible. The study was done with the full SiD
simulation and reconstruction chain including all Standard Model and beam
backgrounds.
