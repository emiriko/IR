In this talk, we report our present work on the chiral magnetic effect (CME)
under a strong magnetic field at low temperature. To this end, we use the
instanton vacuum with the finite instanton-number fluctuation Delta, which
relates to the nontrivial topological charge Q_t. We compute the vacuum
expectation values of the local chiral density <rho_chi>, chiral charge density
<n_chi> and induced electromagnetic current <j_mu>. We observed that the
longitudinal EM current is much larger than the transverse one,
|j_perp/j_parallel| ~ Q_t, and the <n_chi> equals to the |<j_(3,4)>|. It also
turns out that the CME becomes insensitive to the magnetic field as T
increases, since the instanton effect decreases.
