A free-electron like band has recently been observed in a monolayer of PTCDA
(3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride) molecules on Ag(111) by
two-photon photoemission [Schwalb et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 146801 (2008)]
and scanning tunneling spectroscopy [Temirov et al., Nature 444, 350 (2006)].
Using density functional theory calculations, we find that the observed
free-electron like band originates from the Shockley surface state band being
dramatically shifted up in energy by the interaction with the adsorbed
molecules while it acquires also a substantial admixture with a molecular band.
