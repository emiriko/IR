A competitive learning model was introduced in Ref. 1 (A. Mehta and J. M.
Luck, Phys. Rev. E 60, 5, 1999), in which the learning is outcome-related.
Every individual chooses between a pair of existing strategies or types, guided
by a combination of two factors: tendency to conform to the local majority,
\em{and} a preference for the type with higher perceived success \em{among its
neighbors}, based on their relative outcomes. Here, an extension of the
\em{interfacial model} of Ref. 1 is proposed, in which individuals additionally
take into account their \em{own} outcomes in arriving at their outcome-based
choices. Three possible update rules for handling bulk sites are considered.
The corresponding phase diagrams, obtained at coexistence, show systematic
departures from the original interfacial model. Possible relationships of these
variants with the \em{cooperative model} of Ref. 1 are also touched upon.
