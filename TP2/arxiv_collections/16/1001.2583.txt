The next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors are likely
to observe gravitational waves from the coalescences of compact-objects
binaries. We describe the state of the art for predictions of the rate of
compact-binary coalescences and report on initial efforts to develop a
framework for converting gravitational-wave observations into improved
constraints on astrophysical parameters.
