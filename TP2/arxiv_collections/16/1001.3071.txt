We report measurements of absolute transition frequencies and hyperfine
coupling constants for the 8S_{1/2}, 9S_{1/2}, 7D_{3/2}, and 7D_{5/2} states in
^{133}Cs vapor. The stepwise excitation through either the 6P_{1/2} or 6P_{3/2}
intermediate state is performed directly with broadband laser light from a
stabilized femtosecond laser optical-frequency comb. The laser beam is split,
counter-propagated and focused into a room-temperature Cs vapor cell. The
repetition rate of the frequency comb is scanned and we detect the fluorescence
on the 7P_{1/2,3/2} -> 6S_{1/2} branches of the decay of the excited states.
The excitations to the different states are isolated by the introduction of
narrow-bandwidth interference filters in the laser beam paths. Using a
nonlinear least-squares method we find measurements of transition frequencies
and hyperfine coupling constants that are in agreement with other recent
measurements for the 8S state and provide improvement by two orders of
magnitude over previously published results for the 9S and 7D states.
