Using a frequentist analysis of experimental constraints within two versions
of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, we derive the
predictions for the top quark mass, m_t, and the W boson mass, m_W. We find
that the supersymmetric predictions for both m_t and m_W, obtained by
incorporating all the relevant experimental information and state-of-the-art
theoretical predictions, are highly compatible with the experimental values
with small remaining uncertainties, yielding an improvement compared to the
case of the Standard Model.
