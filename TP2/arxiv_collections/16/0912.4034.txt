We review recent theoretical work on two closely related issues: excitation
of an isolated quantum condensed matter system driven adiabatically across a
continuous quantum phase transition or a gapless phase, and apparent relaxation
of an excited system after a sudden quench of a parameter in its Hamiltonian.
Accordingly the review is divided into two parts. The first part revolves
around a quantum version of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism including also phenomena
that go beyond this simple paradigm. What they have in common is that
excitation of a gapless many-body system scales with a power of the driving
rate. The second part attempts a systematic presentation of recent results and
conjectures on apparent relaxation of a pure state of an isolated quantum
many-body system after its excitation by a sudden quench. This research is
motivated in part by recent experimental developments in the physics of
ultracold atoms with potential applications in the adiabatic quantum state
preparation and quantum computation.
