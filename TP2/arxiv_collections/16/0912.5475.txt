Here we briefly report on first results of self-consistent simulation of
non-stationary electron-positron cascades in the polar cap of pulsar using
specially developed hybrid PIC/Monte-Carlo numerical code. We consider the case
of Ruderman-Sutherland cascade -- when particles cannot be extracted from the
surface of the neutrons star.
