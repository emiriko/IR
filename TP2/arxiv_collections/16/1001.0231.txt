It is shown that the electric dipole moment of the tau lepton several orders
of magnitude larger than predicted by the standard model can be generated from
mixings in models with vector like mutiplets. The EDM of the tau lepton arises
from loops involving the exchange of the W, the charginos, the neutralinos, the
sleptons, the mirror leptons, and the mirror sleptons. The EDM of the Dirac tau
neutrino is also computed from loops involving the exhange of the W, the
charginos, the mirror leptons and mirror sleptons. A numerical analysis is
presented and it is shown that the EDMs of the tau lepton and of the tau
neutrino which lie just a couple of orders of magnitude below the sensitivity
of the current experiment can be achieved. Thus the predictions of the model
are testable in improved experiment on the EDM of the tau and of the tau
neutrino.
