We study the quark mass function on hypercubic lattices, in a large range of
physical volumes and cutoffs. To avoid the very large Wilson term artefact, we
exploit the relation between the quark mass function and the pseudoscalar
vertex in the continuum. We extrapolate to the chiral limit.
  In function of the physical volume, we observe a striking discontinuity in
the properties of chiral extrapolation around a physical volume $L_c 6
(GeV}^{-1}=1.2 fm$. It is present in the quark mass function, which collapses
to zero, as well as in the pion mass and the quark condensate as directly
calculated from the pseudoscalar correlator. It is strongly reminiscent of the
phenomenon of chiral symmetry restoration observed by Neuberger and Narayanan
at $N_C=\infty$ around the same physical length.
  In the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, we confirm that the OPE of the
quark mass function, involving the quark condensate, is not operative at the
available momenta, even taking into account the unusually large high order
corrections to the Wilson coefficient calculated by Chetyrkin and Maier ; the
gap remains large, around a factor 2, even at the largest momenta available to
us (p \simeg GeV)
