We study the W/Z pair production via two-photon exchange at the LHC and give
the sensitivities on trilinear and quartic gauge anomalous couplings between
photons and W/Z bosons for an integrated luminosity of 30 and 200 fb^{-1}. For
simplicity and to obtain lower backgrounds, only the leptonic decays of the
electroweak bosons are considered.
