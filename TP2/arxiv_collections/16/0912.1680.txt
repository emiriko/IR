We show that a well-known simple formula for the explicit infrared poles of
one-loop QCD amplitudes has a corresponding simple counterpart in unintegrated
form. The unintegrated formula approximates the integrand of one-loop QCD
amplitudes in all soft and collinear singular regions. It thus defines a local
counter-term for the infrared singularities and can be used as an ingredient
for the numerical calculation of one-loop amplitudes.
