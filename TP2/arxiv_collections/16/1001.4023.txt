The idea of a World digital mathematics library (DML) has been around since
the turn of the 21th century. We feel that it is time to make it a reality,
starting in a modest way from successful bricks that have already been built,
but with an ambitious goal in mind. After a brief historical overview of
publishing mathematics, an estimate of the size and a characterisation of the
bulk of documents to be included in the DML, we turn to proposing a model for a
Reference Digital Mathematics Library--a network of institutions where the
digital documents would be physically archived. This pattern based rather on
the bottom-up strategy seems to be more practicable and consistent with the
digital nature of the DML. After describing the model we summarise what can and
should be done in order to accomplish the vision. The current state of some of
the local libraries that could contribute to the global views are described
with more details.
