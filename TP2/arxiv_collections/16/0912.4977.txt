The Cohen-Lenstra heuristic is a universal principle that assigns to each
group a probability that tells how often this group should occur "in nature".
The most important, but not the only, applications are sequences of class
groups, which behave like random sequences of groups with respect to the
so-called Cohen-Lenstra probability measure.
  So far, it was only possible to define this probability measure for finite
abelian $p$-groups. We prove that it is also possible to define an analogous
probability measure on the set of \emph{all} finite abelian groups when
restricting to the $\Sigma$-algebra on the set of all finite abelian groups
that is generated by uniform properties, thereby solving a problem that was
open since 1984.
