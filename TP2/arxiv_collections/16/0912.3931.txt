We examine the molecular-atomic transition in liquid hydrogen as it relates
to metallization. Pair potentials are obtained from first principles molecular
dynamics and compared with potentials derived from quadratic response. The
results provide insight into the nature of covalent bonding under extreme
conditions. Based on this analysis, we construct a schematic
dissociation-metallization phase diagram and suggest experimental approaches
that should significantly reduce the pressures necessary for the realization of
the elusive metallic phase of hydrogen.
