Wavefunction correction scheme, which was developed as a variance reduction
tool for the pure and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) computations by
Anderson and Freihaut, is applied to the DMC computations of fermions without
using the fixed-node constraint. This technique is found to be suitable for the
non fixed-node calculations because of the significant decreases observed in
the computation times for calculating results with certain statistical error
values in the benchmark computations.
