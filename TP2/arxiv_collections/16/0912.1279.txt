We consider a partially asymmetric exclusion process (PASEP) on a finite
number of sites with open and directed boundary conditions. Its partition
function was calculated by Blythe, Evans, Colaiori, and Essler. It is known to
be a generating function of permutation tableaux by the combinatorial
interpretation of Corteel and Williams.
  We prove bijectively two new combinatorial interpretations. The first one is
in terms of weighted Motzkin paths called Laguerre histories and is obtained by
refining a bijection of Foata and Zeilberger. Secondly we show that this
partition function is the generating function of permutations with respect to
right-to-left minima, right-to-left maxima, ascents, and 31-2 patterns, by
refining a bijection of Francon and Viennot.
  Then we give a new formula for the partition function which generalizes the
one of Blythe & al. It is proved in two combinatorial ways. The first proof is
an enumeration of lattice paths which are known to be a solution of the Matrix
Ansatz of Derrida & al. The second proof relies on a previous enumeration of
rook placements, which appear in the combinatorial interpretation of a related
normal ordering problem. We also obtain a closed formula for the moments of
Al-Salam-Chihara polynomials.
