It is proposed that primary nucleation of amorphous microspherulites of
hydrated silica in natural proto-precious-opal can be followed by a long range
superlattice ordering process by means of electrostatic self-assembly.
Necessary conditions in the thermodynamics are a high surface charge density on
microspherulite surfaces, a long Debye length and an appropriate number density
of nucleation centres. A further chemical requirement is a high alkaline
environmental pH from 9 to 10. It is also proposed that the characteristic
concentric spherical shell-like structure of spherulites, centred on primary
nuclei, are due to sequential deposition of intrinsic salts which precipitate
out when the corresponding solubility limits in the liquid are successively
exceeded. It can be that the better-known sedimentation of microspherulites
under gravity only plays part in the final stabilization period of overall
growth.
