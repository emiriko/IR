We present the most sensitive 3 mm-survey to date of protoplanetary disks
carried in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region (average rms of about 0.3
mJy), using the IRAM PdBI. With our high detection rate of 17/19, we provide
the first detections at wavelengths longer than about 1 mm for 12 sources. This
enables us to study statistically the mm SED slopes and dust properties of
faint disks and compare them to brighter disks using a uniform analysis method.
With these new data and literature measurements at sub-millimeter and
millimeter wavelengths, we analyze the dust properties of a sample of 21
isolated disks around T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region.
Together with the information about the disks spatial extension from sub/mm-mm
interferometric studies, we derive from the observed sub-mm/mm spectral energy
distribution constraints on the dust opacity law at these wavelengths, using
two-layer flared disk models and a self-consistent dust model that takes
properly into account the variation of the dust opacity with grain growth. We
find evidence for the presence in the disk midplane of dust particles that have
grown to sizes as large as at least 1 millimeter in all the disks of our
sample, confirming what was previously observed on smaller brighter objects.
This indicates that the dust coagulation from ISM dust to mm-sized grains is a
very fast process in protoplanetary disks, that appears to occur before a young
stellar object enters the Class II evolutionary stage. Also, the amount of
these large grains in the disk outer regions is stationary throughout all the
Class II evolutionary stage, indicating that mechanisms slowing down the dust
inward migration are playing an important role in the Taurus-Auriga
protoplanetary disks.
