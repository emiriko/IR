We report ab initio relativistic correlation calculations of potential curves
and spectroscopic constants for four lowest-lying electronic states of the lead
monofluoride. We also calculated parameters of the spin-rotational Hamiltonian
for the ground and the first excited states including P,T-odd and P-odd terms.
In particular, we have obtained hyperfine constants of the $^{207}$Pb nucleus.
For the $^2\Pi_{1/2}$ state $A_\perp=-6859.6$ MHz, $A_\|=9726.9$ MHz and for
the A$^2\Sigma^+_{1/2}$ $A_\perp=1720.8$ MHz, $A_\|=3073.3$ MHz. Our values of
the ground state hyperfine constants are in good agreement with the previous
theoretical studies. We discuss and explain seeming disagreement in the sign of
the constant $A_\perp$ with the recent experimental data. The effective
electric field on the electron $E_{eff}$, which is important for the planned
experiment to search for the electric dipole moment of the electron, is found
to be 3.3 * 10^{10} V/cm.
