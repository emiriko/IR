We propose an effective lagrangian for the coupling of the neutral pion with
gluons whose strength is determined by a low energy theorem. We calculate the
contribution of the gluonic components arising from this interaction to the
pion transition form factor $\gamma^*\gamma^*\to\pi^0 $ using the instanton
liquid model to describe the QCD vacuum. We find that this contribution is
large and might explain the anomalous behavior of the form factor at large
virtuality of one of the photons, a feature which was recently discovered by
the BaBar Collaboration.
