Recently, spherically symmetric, static wormholes supported by exotic dust
and a radial magnetic field have been derived and argued to be stable with
respect to linear radial fluctuations. In this report we point out that these
wormholes are unstable due to the formation of shell-crossing singularities
when the nonlinearities of the theory are taken into account.
