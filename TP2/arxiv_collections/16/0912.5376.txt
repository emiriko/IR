The integral representation of the Hadamard product of two functions is used
to prove several Euler-type series transformation formulas. As applications we
obtain three binomial identities involving harmonic numbers and an identity for
the Laguerre polynomials. We also evaluate in a closed form certain power
series with harmonic numbers
