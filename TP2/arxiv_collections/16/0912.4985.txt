We identify two candidate magnetars in archival X-ray observations of HESS
detected shell-type SNRs. X-ray point sources in CTB 37B coincident with HESS
J1713-381 and in G353.6-0.7 coincident with HESS J1731-347 both have AXP-like
spectra, much softer than those of ordinary, rotation powered pulsars, and no
optical/IR counterparts. The spectrum of CXOU J171405.7-381031 in CTB 37B has a
hard excess above 6 keV, which may be similar to such components seen in some
AXPs. A new Chandra observation of this object reveals a highly significant
pulsed signal at P = 3.82 s with pulsed fraction f_p = 0.31. Analysis of an
XMM-Newton observation of the second candidate, XMMU J173203.3-344518 in
G353.6-0.7, yields only marginal evidence for a 1 s period. If it is not a
magnetar, then it could be a weakly magnetized central compact object (CCO).
Considering that these HESS sources previously attributed to the SNR shells are
possibly centrally peaked, we hypothesize that their pulsars may contribute to
diffuse TeV emission. These identifications potentially double the number of
magnetar/SNR associations in the Galaxy, and can be used to investigate the
energetics and asymmetries of the supernovae that give rise to magnetars.
