LTE abundances of light elements in extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars have
been previously derived from high quality spectra. New derivations, free from
the NLTE effects, will better constrain the models of the Galactic chemical
evolution and the yields of the very first supernovae. The NLTE profiles of the
magnesium and potassium lines have been computed in a sample of 53 extremely
metal-poor stars with a modified version of the program MULTI and adjusted to
the observed lines in order to derive the abundances of these elements. The
NLTE corrections for magnesium and potassium are in good agreement with the
works found in the literature. The abundances are slightly changed, reaching a
better precision: the scatter around the mean of the abundance ratios has
decreased. Magnesium may be used with confidence as reference element. Together
with previously determined NLTE abundances of sodium and aluminum, the new
ratios are displayed, for comparison, along the theoretical trends proposed by
some models of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, using different models of
supernovae.
