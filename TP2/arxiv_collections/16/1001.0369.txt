We investigate the interplay of quark and meson degrees of freedom in a
physical state representing a near-threshold resonance for the case of a single
continuum channel. We demonstrate that such a near-threshold resonance may
possess quite peculiar properties if both quark and meson dynamics generate
weakly coupled near-threshold poles in the S-matrix. In particular, the
scattering t-matrix may possess zeros in this case. We also discuss possible
implications for production reactions as well as studies within lattice QCD.
