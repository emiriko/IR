JBotSim is a java library that offers basic primitives for prototyping,
running, and visualizing distributed algorithms in dynamic networks. With
JBotSim, one can implement an idea in minutes and interact with it ({\it e.g.
}, add, move, or delete nodes) while it is running. JBotSim is well suited to
prepare live demonstrations of your algorithms to colleagues or students; it
can also be used to evaluate performance at the algorithmic level (number of
messages, number of rounds, etc.). Unlike most tools, JBotSim is not an
integrated environment. It is a lightweight library to be used in your program.
In this paper, we present an overview of its distinctive features and
architecture.
