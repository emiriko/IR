A cluster of galaxies is a huge system bounded by gravitation, and cosmic
rays are thought to be confined in the system, thus it should contain much
non-thermal components. Many theories predict significant gamma-ray emission
that could be detectable by state-of-the-art gamma-ray telescopes. Some
clusters have already been studied by using Fermi gamma-ray space telescope in
the GeV band and Cherenkov telescopes in the TeV band, but most clusters are
not studied in both energy bands. Here I present results on GeV gamma-ray
emission from clusters of galaxies which have been given upper limits by
Cherenkov telescopes using Fermi archival data.
