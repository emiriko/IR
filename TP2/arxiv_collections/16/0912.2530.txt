We review the superembedding approach to M-branes and Dp-branes, in its form
based on the universal (D and p-independent) superembedding equation, and its
recent application in searching for supersymmetric and Lorentz covariant
description of multiple Dp-brane systems. In particular, we present the
structure of the multiple D0-brane equation as follows from our superembedding
description and show that it describes the dielectric effect firstly noticed by
Emparan and then by Myers. We also discuss briefly the relation with the
boundary fermion approach by Howe, Lindstrom and Wulff.
