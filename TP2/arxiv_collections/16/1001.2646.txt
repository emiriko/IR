We analyze the large-scale two-dimensional sidereal anisotropy of multi-TeV
cosmic rays by Tibet Air Shower Array, with the data taken from 1999 November
to 2008 December. To explore temporal variations of the anisotropy, the data
set is divided into nine intervals, each in a time span of about one year. The
sidereal anisotropy of magnitude about 0.1% appears fairly stable from year to
year over the entire observation period of nine years. This indicates that the
anisotropy of TeV Galactic cosmic rays remains insensitive to solar activities
since the observation period covers more than a half of the 23rd solar cycle.
