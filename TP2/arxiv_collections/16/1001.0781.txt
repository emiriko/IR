The superconducting transition temperature, Tc, of the SrTiO3/LaAlO3
interface was varied by the electric field effect. The anisotropy of the upper
critical field and the normal state magneto-transport were studied as a
function of gate voltage. The spin-orbit coupling energy is extracted. This
tunable energy scale is used to explain the strong gate dependence of the
mobility and of the anomalous Hall signal observed. The spin-orbit coupling
energy follows Tc for the electric field range under study.
