Urea titration of RNA by urea is an effective approach to investigate the
forces stabilizing this biologically important molecule. We used all atom
molecular dynamics simulations using two urea force fields and two RNA
constructs to elucidate in atomic detail the destabilization mechanism of
folded RNA in aqueous urea solutions. Urea denatures RNA by forming multiple
hydrogen bonds with the RNA bases and has little influence on the
phosphodiester backbone. Most significantly we discovered that urea engages in
stacking interactions with the bases. We also estimate, for the first time,
m-value for RNA, which is a measure of the strength of urea-RNA interactions.
Our work provides a conceptual understanding of the mechanism by which urea
enhances RNA folding rates.
