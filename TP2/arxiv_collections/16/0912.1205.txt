The half lives of proton radioactivity of proton emitters are investigated
theoretically. Proton-nucleus interaction potentials are obtained by folding
the densities of the daughter nuclei with a finite range effective
nucleon-nucleon interaction having Yukawa form. The Wood-Saxon density
distributions for the nuclei used in calculating the nuclear as well as the
Coulomb interaction potentials are predictions of the interaction. The quantum
mechanical tunneling probability is calculated within the WKB framework. These
calculations provide reasonable estimates for the observed proton radioactivity
lifetimes. The effects of neutron-proton effective mass splitting in neutron
rich asymmetric matter as well as the nuclear matter incompressibility on the
decay probability are investigated.
