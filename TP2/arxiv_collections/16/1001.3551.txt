Adaptive Monte Carlo methods are recent variance reduction techniques. In
this work, we propose a mathematical setting which greatly relaxes the
assumptions needed by for the adaptive importance sampling techniques presented
by Vazquez-Abad and Dufresne, Fu and Su, and Arouna. We establish the
convergence and asymptotic normality of the adaptive Monte Carlo estimator
under local assumptions which are easily verifiable in practice. We present one
way of approximating the optimal importance sampling parameter using a randomly
truncated stochastic algorithm. Finally, we apply this technique to some
examples of valuation of financial derivatives.
