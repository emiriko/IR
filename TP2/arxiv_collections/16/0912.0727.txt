The Lawson homology of a smooth projective variety with a $\C^*$-action is
given in terms of that of the fixed point set of this action. We also consider
such a decomposition for the Lawson homology of certain singular projective
varieties with a $\C^*$-action. As applications, we calculate the Lawson
homology and higher Chow groups for several examples.
