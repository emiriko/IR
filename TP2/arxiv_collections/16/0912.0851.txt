The elecrooptical response of graphene due to heating and drift of carriers
is studied theoretically. Real and imaginary parts of the dynamic conductivity
tensor are calculated for the case of effective momentum relaxation, when
anisotropic contributions are small. We use the quasiequilibrium distribution
of electrons and holes, characterized by the effective temperature of carriers
and by concentrations, which are controlled by gate voltage and in-plane
electric field. The geometry of normal propagation of probe radiation is
considered, spectral and field dependences of the reflection coefficient and
the relative absorption are analyzed. The ellipticity degree of the reflected
and transmitted radiation due to small birefringence of graphene sheet with
current have also been determined.
