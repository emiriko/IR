This paper gives an overview of a proposed strategy for the "Cows and
Herders" scenario given in the Multi-Agent Programming Contest 2009. The
strategy is to be implemented using the Jason platform, based on the
agent-oriented programming language Agent-Speak. The paper describes the
agents, their goals and the strategies they should follow. The basis for the
paper and for participating in the contest is a new course given in spring 2009
and our main objective is to show that we are able to implement complex
multi-agent systems with the knowledge gained in an introductory course on
multi-agent systems.
