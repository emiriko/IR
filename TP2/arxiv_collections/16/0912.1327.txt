We address the global persistence of analyticity and Gevrey-class regularity
of solutions to the two and three-dimensional visco-elastic second-grade fluid
equations. We obtain an explicit novel lower bound on the radius of analyticity
of the solutions to the second-grade fluid equations that does not vanish as
$t\to \infty$. Applications to the damped Euler equations are given.
