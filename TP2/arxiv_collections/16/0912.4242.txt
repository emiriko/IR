We propose how to realize a three-step controlled-phase gate of one qubit
simultaneously controlling $n$ qubits in a cavity or coupled to a resonator.
The $n$ two-qubit controlled-phase gates, forming this multiqubit phase gate,
can be performed simultaneously. The operation time of this phase gate is
independent of the number $n$ of qubits. This phase gate controlling at once
$n$ qubits is insensitive to the initial state of the cavity mode and can be
used to produce an analogous CNOT gate simultaneously acting on $n$ qubits. We
present two alternative approaches to implement this gate. One approach is
based on tuning the qubit frequency while the other method tunes the resonator
frequency. Using superconducting qubits coupled to a resonator as an example,
we show how to implement the proposed gate with one superconducting qubit
simultaneously controlling $n$ qubits selected from $N$ qubits coupled to a
resonator ($1<n<N$). We also give a discussion on realizing the proposed gate
with atoms, by using one cavity initially in an arbitrary state.
