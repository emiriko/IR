A search programme for pulsating subdwarf B stars was conducted with the
Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma over 59 nights between 1999 and 2009. The
purpose of the programme was to significantly extend the number of rapidly
pulsating sdB stars to better understand the properties of this new group of
variable compact stars. Candidates were selected initially from the HS and HE
surveys, but were supplemented with additional objects from other surveys.
Short sequences of time-series photometry were made on the candidates to
determine the presence of rapid pulsations. In total twenty new pulsators were
found in this survey, most of which have already been published and some
extensively studied. We present four new short period pulsators, bringing the
total of such pulsators up to 49. We also give limits on pulsation amplitudes
for 285 objects with no obvious periodic variations, summarise the results of
the survey, and provide improved physical parameters on the composite pulsators
for which only preliminary estimates were published earlier.
