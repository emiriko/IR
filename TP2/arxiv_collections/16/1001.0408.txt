We have carried out calculations of current-voltage characteristics for the
electron tunnel current through a junction with a thin insulating ferroelectric
barrier assuming that interface transmissions for the left and right interfaces
noticeably differ due to dissimilarity of the interfaces. Obtained conductance
versus voltage and current versus voltage curves exhibit well distinguishable
asymmetric hysteresis. We show that the asymmetry in the hysteretic effects
could originate from the asymmetric bias voltage profile inside the junction.
In particular, we analyze the hysteresis asymmetries occurring when the bias
voltage distribution is low sensitive to the spontaneous polarization reversal.
