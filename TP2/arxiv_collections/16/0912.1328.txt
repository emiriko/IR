We present in this Letter a free-energy approach to the dynamics of a fluid
near a nanostructured surface. The model accounts both for the static phase
equilibrium in the vicinity of the surface (wetting angles, Cassie-Wenzel
transition) and the dynamical properties like liquid slippage at the boundary.
This method bridges the gap between phenomenological phase-field approaches and
more macroscopic lattice-Boltzmann models.
