Based upon the rate equations for the photon distribution function obtained
in the previous paper, we study the inverse Compton scattering process for
high-energy nonthermal electrons. Assuming the power-law electron distribution,
we find a scaling law in the probability distribution function P_1(s), where
the peak height and peak position depend only on the power index parameter. We
solved the rate equation analytically. It is found that the spectral intensity
function also has the scaling law, where the peak height and peak position
depend only on the power index parameter. The present study will be
particularly important to the analysis of the X-ray and gamma-ray emission
models from various astrophysical objects such as radio galaxies and supernova
remnants.
