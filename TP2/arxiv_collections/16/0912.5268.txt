We report a comprehensive study of magnetic properties of Ni3TeO6. The system
crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric rhombohedral lattice, space group R3.
There are three differently coordinated Ni atoms in the unit cell. Two of them
form an almost planar honeycomb lattice, while the third one is placed between
the layers. Magnetization and specific heat measurements revealed a single
magnetic ordering at TN = 52 K. Below TN the susceptibility with the magnetic
field parallel to the c-axis drops towards zero while the perpendicular
susceptibility remains constant, a characteristic of antiferromagnetic
materials. Neutron diffraction confirmed that the system is antiferromagnet
below TN with ferromagnetic ab-planes stacked antiferromagnetically along the
c-axis. All Ni moments are in the S = 1 spin state and point along the c-axis.
