In this paper we will be concerned with a class of packing and covering
problems which includes Vertex Cover and Independent Set. Typically, one can
write an LP relaxation and then round the solution. In this paper, we explain
why the simple LP-based rounding algorithm for the \\VC problem is optimal
assuming the UGC. Complementing Raghavendra's result, our result generalizes to
a class of strict, covering/packing type CSPs.
