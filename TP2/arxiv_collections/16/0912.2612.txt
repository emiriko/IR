Magnetic Faraday rotation is widely used in optics and MW. In uniform
magneto-optical materials, this effect is very weak. One way to enhance it is
to incorporate the magnetic material into a high-Q optical resonator. One
problem with magneto-optical resonators is that along with Faraday rotation,
the absorption and linear birefringence can also increase dramatically,
compromising the device performance. Another problem is strong ellipticity of
the output light. We discuss how the above problems can be addressed in the
cases of optical microcavities and a slow wave resonators. We show that a slow
wave resonator has a fundamental advantage when it comes to Faraday rotation
enhancement in lossy magnetic materials.
