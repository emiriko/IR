Probability distributions of money, income, and energy consumption per capita
are studied for ensembles of economic agents. The principle of entropy
maximization for partitioning of a limited resource gives exponential
distributions for the investigated variables. A non-equilibrium difference of
money temperatures between different systems generates net fluxes of money and
population. To describe income distribution, a stochastic process with additive
and multiplicative components is introduced. The resultant distribution
interpolates between exponential at the low end and power law at the high end,
in agreement with the empirical data for USA. We show that the increase of
income inequality in USA originates primarily from the increase of the income
fraction going to the upper tail, which now exceeds 20% of the total income.
Analyzing the data from the World Resources Institute, we find that the
distribution of energy consumption per capita around the world can be
approximately described by the exponential function. Comparing the data for
1990, 2000, and 2005, we discuss the effect of globalization on the inequality
of energy consumption.
