Neutron scattering and magnetization measurements have been performed on the
stuffed pyrochlore system Tb2+xTi2-2xNbxO7. We find that despite the
introduction of chemical disorder and increasingly antiferromagnetic
interactions, a spin glass transition does not occur for T >= 1.5 K and
cooperative paramagnetic behavior exists for all x. For x = 1, Tb3NbO7, an
antiferromagnetically ordered state coexisting with cooperative paramagnetic
behavior is seen without applying any external fields or pressure, a situation
advantageous for studying this cooperative behavior.
