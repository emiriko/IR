A ratchet effect (the rectification of an ac injected current) which is
purely magnetic in origin has been observed in a superconducting-magnetic
nanostructure hybrid. The hybrid consists of a superconducting Nb film in
contact with an array of nanoscale magnetic triangles, circular rings or
elliptical rings. The arrays were placed into well-defined remanent magnetic
states by application of different magnetic field cycles. The stray fields from
these remanent states provide a magnetic landscape which influences the motion
of superconducting vortices. We examined both randomly varying landscapes from
demagnetized samples, and ordered landscapes from samples at remanence after
saturation in which the magnetic rings form parallel onion states containing
two domain walls. The ratchet effect is absent if the rings are in the
demagnetized state or if the vortices propagate parallel to the magnetic
reflection symmetry axis (perpendicular to the magnetic domain walls) in the
ordered onion state. On the other hand, when the vortices move perpendicular to
the magnetic reflection symmetry axis in the ordered onion state (parallel to
the domain walls) a clear ratchet effect is observed. This behavior differs
qualitatively from that observed in samples containing arrays of triangular Ni
nanostructures, which show a ratchet of structural origin.
