We consider the capture of inelastic dark matter in white dwarves by
inelastic spin-independent scattering on nuclei. We show that if the dark
matter annihilates to standard-model particles then, under the assumption of
primordial globular cluster formation, the observation of cold white dwarves in
the globular cluster M4 appears inconsistent with explanations of the observed
DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signal based on spin-independent inelastic dark
matter scattering. Alternatively if the inelastic dark matter scenario were to
be confirmed and it was found to annihilate to standard-model particles then
this would imply a much lower dark matter density in the core of M4 than would
be expected if it were to have formed in a dark matter halo. Finally we argue
that cold white dwarves constitute a unique dark matter probe, complementary to
other direct and indirect detection searches.
