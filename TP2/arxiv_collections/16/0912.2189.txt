A new version of Monte Carlo generator ELRADGEN for simulation of real photon
emission in elastic electron-proton scattering is presented. The extensions in
the new version include opportunity to deal with polarized particles:
longitudinally polarized electron and arbitrary polarized proton. Simulation
strategy, specifications of used kinematics, structure of the contributions to
the observed cross section, cross-checks, and numerical results for BLAST
experimental setup are presented and briefly discussed.
