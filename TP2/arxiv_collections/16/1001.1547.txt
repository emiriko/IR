The rise of nucleon UHECR above GZK astronomy made by protons is puzzled by
three main mysteries: an unexpected nearby Virgo UHECR suppression, a rich
crowded clustering frozen vertically (north-south) along Cen A, a composition
suggesting nuclei and not nucleons. The UHECR map, initially consistent with
GZK volumes, to day seem to be not much correlated with expected Super Galactic
Plane. Moreover slant depth data of UHECR from AUGER airshower shape do not
favor the proton but points to a nuclei, while HIRES, on the contrary favors
mostly nucleons. We tried to solve the contradictions assuming UHECR as light
nuclei (mostly He) spread by planar galactic fields, randomly at vertical axis.
The He fragility and its mass and charge explains the Virgo absence (due to
opacity above few Mpc) and the Cen A spread clustering (a quarter of the whole
sample). However more events and rare doublets and clustering elsewhere are
waiting for an answer. Here we foresee hint of new UHECR component: galactic
ones. Moreover a careful updated views of UHECR sky over different
(Radio,IR,Optics, X,gamma, TeV) background are also favoring forgotten
revolutionary Z-shower model. Both Z-Shower, proton GZK and Lightest nuclei
UHECR models have dramatic influence on expected UHE neutrino Astronomy: to be
soon revealed by UHE tau neutrino induced air-showers in different ways.
