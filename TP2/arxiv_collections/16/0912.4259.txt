In a volume-limited sample of 63 ultracool dwarfs of spectral type M7-M9.5,
we have obtained high-resolution spectroscopy with UVES at the Very Large
Telescope and HIRES at Keck Observatory. In this second paper, we present
projected rotation velocities, average magnetic field strengths, and
chromospheric emission from the Halpha line. We confirm earlier results that
the mean level of normalized Halpha luminosity decreases with lower
temperature, and we find that the scatter among Halpha luminosities is larger
at lower temperature. We measure average magnetic fields between 0 and 4kG with
no indication for a dependence on temperature between M7 and M9.5. For a given
temperature, Halpha luminosity is related to magnetic field strength,
consistent with results in earlier stars. A few very slowly rotating stars show
very weak magnetic fields and Halpha emission, all stars rotating faster than
our detection limit show magnetic fields of at least a few hundred Gauss. In
contrast to earlier-type stars, we observe magnetic fields weaker than 1kG in
stars rotating faster than ~3km/s, but we find no correlation between rotation
and magnetic flux generation among them. We interpret this as a fundamental
change in the dynamo mechanism; in ultracool dwarfs, magnetic field generation
is predominantly achieved by a turbulent dynamo, while other mechanisms can
operate more efficiently at earlier spectral type.
