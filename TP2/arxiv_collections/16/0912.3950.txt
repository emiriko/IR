It was proposed that spin ice, a class of rare earth titanates, hosts
elementary excitations akin to magnetic monopoles. Recently, Bramwell and
co-workers [arXiv:arXiv:0907.0956] measured the Wien effect in Dy2Ti2O7,
directly probing the nature of these monopoles and making dysprosium titanate
the first example of a magnetolyte.
