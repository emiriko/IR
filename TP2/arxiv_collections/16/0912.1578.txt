We construct (q,t)-Catalan polynomials and q-Fuss-Catalan polynomials for any
irreducible complex reflection group W. The two main ingredients in this
construction are Rouquier's formulation of shift functors for the rational
Cherednik algebras of W, and Opdam's analysis of permutations of the
irreducible representations of W arising from the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
connection.
