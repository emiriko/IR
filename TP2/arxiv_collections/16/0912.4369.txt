In this paper we show how the non-relativistic transport equations for a
simple fluid can be obtained using a 3+1 representation. A pseudo-galilean
transformation is introduced in order to obtain the Euler conservation laws.
The interpretation of such transformation as well as the implications and
potential extensions of the formalism are briefly discussed.
