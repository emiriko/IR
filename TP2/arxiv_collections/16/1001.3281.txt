We present protocols for creating entangled states of two modes of the
electromagnetic field, by using a beam of atoms crossing microwave resonators.
The atoms are driven by a transverse, classical field and pump correlated
photons into (i) two modes of a cavity and (ii) the modes of two distant
cavities. The protocols are based on a stochastic dynamics, characterized by
random arrival times of the atoms and by random interaction times between atoms
and cavity modes. The resulting effective model yields a master equation, whose
steady state is an entangled state of the cavity modes. In this respect, the
atoms act like a quantum reservoir, pulling the cavity modes into an entangled,
Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR) state, whose degree of entanglement is controlled
by the intensity and the frequency of the transverse field. This scheme is
robust against stochastic fluctuations in the atomic beam, and it does not
require atomic detection nor velocity selection.
