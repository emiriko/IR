The Very high Angular resolution ULtraviolet Telescope (VAULT) is a sounding
rocket payload built to study the crucial interface between the solar
chromosphere and the corona by observing the strongest line in the solar
spectrum, the Ly-a line at 1216 {\AA}. In two flights, VAULT succeeded in
obtaining the first ever sub-arcsecond (0.5") images of this region with high
sensitivity and cadence. Detailed analyses of those observations have
contributed significantly to new ideas about the nature of the transition
region. Here, we present a broad overview of the Ly-a atmosphere as revealed by
the VAULT observations, and bring together past results and new analyses from
the second VAULT flight to create a synthesis of our current knowledge of the
high-resolution Ly-a Sun. We hope that this work will serve as a good reference
for the design of upcoming Ly-a telescopes and observing plans.
