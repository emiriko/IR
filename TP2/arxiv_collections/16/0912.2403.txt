We study the DC conductivity and the diffusion constant for asymptotically
Lifshitz black branes in $(d+2)$- dimensions with arbitrary dynamical exponent
$z$. For a solvable example with $z=2, d=4$, we calculate the real-time
correlation functions, from which we can read off the corresponding
conductivity and diffusion constant. For black branes with arbitrary $z$ and
$d$, we work out the conductivity and obtain the diffusion constant by making
use of the Einstein relation. All the results agree with those obtained via the
membrane paradigm.
