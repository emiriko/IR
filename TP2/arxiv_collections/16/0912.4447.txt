The ability of bridging thiophenolate groups to transmit magnetic exchange
interactions between paramagnetic Ni(II) ions has been examined. For this
purpose, dinuclear and trinuclear Ni(II)-complexes were prepared and fully
characterized by IR- and UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, static
magnetization measurements and high-field electron spin resonance (HF-ESR). We
compare structural and magnetic properties of the two Ni(II)-complexes and
discuss the relationships between magnetic interactions and chemical bonding.
