X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) has emerged as a unique
technique allowing the measurement of dynamics in materials on mesoscopic
lengthscales. In particular, applications in soft matter physics cover a broad
range of topics which include, but are not limited to, nanostructured materials
such as colloidal suspensions or polymers, dynamics at liquid surfaces,
membranes and interfaces, and the glass or gel transition. One of the most
common problems associated with the use of bright X-ray beams with soft
materials is beam induced radiation damage, and this is likely to become an
even more limiting factor at future synchrotron and free electron laser
sources. Flowing the sample during data acquisition is one of the simplest
method allowing to limit the radiation damage. In addition to distributing the
dose over many different scatterers, the method also enables new
functionalities such as time-resolved studies in mixing cells. Here, we further
develop an experimental technique that was recently proposed combining XPCS and
continuously flowing samples. More specifically, we use a model system to show
how the macroscopic advective response to flow and the microscopic dissipative
dynamics (diffusion) can be quantified from the X-ray data. The method has many
potential applications, e.g. dynamics of glasses and gels under continuous
shear/flow, protein aggregations processes, the interplay between dynamics and
rheology in complex fluids.
