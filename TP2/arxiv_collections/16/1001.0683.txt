To learn how to introduce automated regression testing to existing medium
scale Open Source projects, a long-term field experiment was performed with the
Open Source project FreeCol. Results indicate that (1) introducing testing is
both beneficial for the project and feasible for an outside innovator, (2)
testing can enhance communication between developers, (3) signaling is
important for engaging the project participants to fill a newly vacant position
left by a withdrawal of the innovator. Five prescriptive strategies are
extracted for the innovator and two conjectures offered about the ability of an
Open Source project to learn about innovations.
