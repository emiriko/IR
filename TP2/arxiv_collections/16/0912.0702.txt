Examples of small contingency tables on binary random variables with large
integer programming gaps on the lower bounds of cell entries were constructed
by Sullivant. We argue here that the margins for which these constructed large
gaps occur are rarely encountered, thus reopening the question of whether
linear programming is an effective heuristic for detecting disclosures when
releasing margins of multi-way tables. The notion of ``rarely encountered'' is
made precise through the language of standard pairs.
