In this paper, A new image steganography scheme is proposed which is a kind
of spatial domain technique. In order to hide secret data in cover-image, the
first component alteration technique is used. Techniques used so far focuses
only on the two or four bits of a pixel in a image (at the most five bits at
the edge of an image) which results in less peak to signal noise ratio and high
root mean square error. In this technique, 8 bits of blue components of pixels
are replaced with secret data bits. Proposed scheme can embed more data than
previous schemes and shows better image quality. To prove this scheme, several
experiments are performed, and are compared the experimental results with the
related previous works.
