We analyze the dynamics toward cultural consensus in the Axelrod model on
scale-free networks. By looking at the microscopic dynamics of the model, we
are able to show how culture traits spread across different cultural features.
We compare the diffusion at the level of cultural features to the growth of
cultural consensus at the global level, finding important differences between
these two processes. In particular, we show that even when most of the cultural
features have reached macroscopic consensus, there are still no signals of
globalization. Finally, we analyze the topology of consensus clusters both for
global culture and at the feature level of representation.
