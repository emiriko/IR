The highest energy cosmic ray event reported by the Auger Observatory has an
energy of 148 EeV. It does not correlate with any nearby (z$<$0.024) object
capable of originating such a high energy event. Intrigued by the fact that the
highest energy event ever recorded (by the Fly's Eye collaboration) points to a
faraway quasar with very high radio luminosity and large Faraday rotation
measurement, we have searched for a similar source for the Auger event. We find
that the Auger highest energy event points to a quasar with similar
characteristics to the one correlated to the Fly's Eye event. We also find the
same kind of correlation for one of the highest energy AGASA events. We
conclude that so far these types of quasars are the best source candidates for
both Auger and Fly's Eye highest energy events. We discuss a few exotic
candidates that could reach us from gigaparsec distances.
