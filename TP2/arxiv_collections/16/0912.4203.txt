We study the strong-coupling limit beta=0 of lattice SU(2) Landau gauge
Yang-Mills theory. In this limit the lattice spacing is infinite, and thus all
momenta in physical units are infinitesimally small. Hence, the infrared
behavior can be assessed at sufficiently large lattice momenta. Our results
show that at the lattice volumes used here, the Gribov ambiguity has an
enormous effect on the ghost propagator in all dimensions. This underlines the
severity of the Gribov problem and calls for refined studies also at finite
beta. In turn, the gluon propagator only mildly depends on the Gribov
ambiguity.
