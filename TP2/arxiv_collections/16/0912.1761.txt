We review the information on the spin and orbital angular momentum structure
of the nucleon encoded in the T-even transverse momentum dependent parton
distributions within light-cone quark models. Model results for azimuthal spin
asymmetries in semi-inclusive lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering are
discussed, showing a good agreement with available experimental data and
providing predictions to be further tested by future CLAS, COMPASS and HERMES
data.
