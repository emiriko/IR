The incidence of Dengue epidemiologic disease has grown in recent decades. In
this paper an application of optimal control in Dengue epidemics is presented.
The mathematical model includes the dynamic of Dengue mosquito, the affected
persons, the people's motivation to combat the mosquito and the inherent social
cost of the disease, such as cost with ill individuals, educations and sanitary
campaigns. The dynamic model presents a set of nonlinear ordinary differential
equations. The problem was discretized through Euler and Runge Kutta schemes,
and solved using nonlinear optimization packages. The computational results as
well as the main conclusions are shown.
