We present here a new powerful diagnostic plot to select heavily obscured AGN
in the local universe by combining infrared (Spitzer, IRAS) and X-ray (XMM)
information. On the basis of this plot, we selected a sample of X-ray obscured
sources in the 2XMM catalogue and found seven newly discovered Compton-thick
AGN candidates.
