The status of the solar axion search with the CERN Axion Solar Telescope
(CAST) will be discussed. Results from the first part of CAST phase II where
the magnet bores were filled with \hefour gas at variable pressure in order to
scan \ma up to 0.4 eV will be presented. From the absence of excess X-rays when
the magnet was pointing to the Sun, we set a typical upper limit on the
axion-photon coupling of $\gag \lesssim 2.17 \times10^{-10}$GeV$^{-1}$ at 95%
CL for \ma$<0.4$ eV, the exact result depending on the pressure setting. Our
search for axions with masses up to about 1.2 eV using \hethree as a buffer gas
is, since last year, in progress in the second part of CAST phase II.
Expectations for sensibilities will be given. Near future perspectives as well
as more long term options for a new helioscope experiment will be evoked.
