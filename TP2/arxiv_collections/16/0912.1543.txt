Uncertainty in the determination of emission angles of signal and idler
photons is investigated. The role of divergence of the pump beam, width of the
pump spectrum, and size of the crystal is elucidated. Experimental data
obtained by an iCCD camera are in a good agreement with a numerical model that
provides angular and spectral characteristics of the signal and idler fields.
