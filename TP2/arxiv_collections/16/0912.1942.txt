Around $\theta_{\pi}= 90^\circ$, the coupling to the $\rho^\circ N$ channel
leads to a good accounting of the charged pion exclusive photoproduction cross
section in the energy range 3 $<E_{\gamma}<$ 10 GeV, where experimental data
exist. Starting from a Regge Pole approach that successfully describes vector
meson production, the singular part of the corresponding box diagrams (where
the intermediate vector meson-baryon pair propagates on-shell) is evaluated
without any further assumptions (unitarity). Such a treatment provides an
explanation of the $s^{-7}$ scaling of the cross section. Elastic rescattering
of the charged pion improves the basic Regge pole model at forward and backward
angles.
