A basic assumption behind the inequalities used for testing noncontextual
hidden variable models is that the observables measured on the same individual
system are perfectly compatible. However, compatibility is not perfect in
actual experiments using sequential measurements. We discuss the resulting
"compatibility loophole" and present several methods to rule out certain hidden
variable models which obey a kind of extended noncontextuality. Finally, we
present a detailed analysis of experimental imperfections in a recent trapped
ion experiment and apply our analysis to that case.
