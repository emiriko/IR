In this paper, we have tried to find out the origin of magnetism in Gold
nanoparticles (Au- NPs). We observe that upon incorporating Gold nanoparticles
(Au-NPs) in Fe3O4 nanoparticle medium the net magnetisation increases compared
to the pure Fe3O4 nanoparticle medium. This increase of magnetization can be
attributed to the large orbital magnetic moment formation at the Au/magnetic
particle interface indicating that magnetism observed in Au-NPs is an
interfacial effect. This interfacial effect has been supported by the
observation of sudden transition from positive saturated magnetisation to a
negative diamagnetic contribution as a function of magnetic field on citrate
coated gold Au-NPs.
