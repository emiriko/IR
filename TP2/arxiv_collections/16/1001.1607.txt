The angular-dependent magnetoresistance and the Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations are studied in a topological insulator Bi_{0.91}Sb_{0.09}, where
the two-dimensional (2D) surface states coexist with a three-dimensional (3D)
bulk Fermi surface (FS). Two distinct types of oscillatory phenomena are
discovered in the angular-dependence: The one observed at lower fields is shown
to originate from the surface state, which resides on the (2\bar{1}\bar{1})
plane, giving a new way to distinguish the 2D surface state from the 3D FS. The
other one, which becomes prominent at higher fields, probably comes from the
(111) plane and is obviously of unknown origin, pointing to new physics in
transport properties of topological insulators.
