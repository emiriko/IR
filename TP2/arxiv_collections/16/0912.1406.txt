We propose to couple an on-chip high finesse superconducting cavity to the
lateral-motion and spin state of a single electron trapped on the surface of
superfluid helium. We estimate the motional coherence times to exceed 15
microseconds, while energy will be coherently exchanged with the cavity photons
in less than 10 nanoseconds for charge states and faster than 1 microsecond for
spin states, making the system attractive for quantum information processing
and cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments. Strong interaction with cavity
photons will provide the means for both nondestructive readout and coupling of
distant electrons.
