With the current development of multiprocessor systems, strive for computing
data on such processor have also increased exponentially. If the multi core
processors are not fully utilized, then even though we have the computing power
the speed is not available to the end users for their respective applications.
In accordance to this, the users or application designers also have to design
newer applications taking care of the computing infrastructure available
within. Our approach is to use the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)
as backend and MATLAB as the front end to design an application for
implementing steganography. Steganography is the term used for hiding
information in the cover object like Image, Audio or Video data. As the
computing required for multimedia data is much more than the text information,
we have been successful in implementing image Steganography with the help of
technology for the next generation.
