The simplest version of the Duflo-Zuker mass model (due entirely to the late
Jean Duflo) is described by following step by step the published computer code.
The model contains six macroscopic monopole terms leading asymptotically to a
Liquid Drop form, three microscopic terms supposed to mock configuration mixing
(multipole) corrections to the monopole shell effects, and one term in charge
of detecting deformed nuclei and calculating their masses. A careful analysis
of the model suggests a program of future developments that includes a
complementary approach to masses based on an independently determined monopole
Hamiltonian, a better description of deformations and specific suggestions for
the treatment of three body forces.
