We use joint observations obtained with the Hinode space observatory and the
Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) installed at the DST of the
NSO/SP to investigate the morphology and dynamics of (a) non-magnetic and (b)
magnetic regions in the fluctosphere. In inter-network regions with no
significant magnetic flux contributions above the detection limit of IBIS, we
find intensity structures with similar characteristics as those seen in
numerical simulations by Wedemeyer-B\"ohm (2008). The magnetic flux elements in
the network are stable and seem to resemble the spatially extended counterparts
to the underlying photospheric magnetic elements. We will explain some of the
difficulties in deriving the magnetic field vector from observations of the
fluctosphere.
