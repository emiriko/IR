Thermal Bogoliubov transformation is an essential ingredient of the thermo
field dynamics -- the real time formalism in quantum field and many-body
theories at finite temperatures developed by H. Umezawa and coworkers. The
approach to study properties of hot nuclei which is based on the extension of
the well-known Quasiparticle-Phonon Model to finite temperatures employing the
TFD formalism is presented. A distinctive feature of the QPM-TFD combination is
a possibility to go beyond the standard approximations like the thermal
Hartree-Fock or the thermal RPA ones.
