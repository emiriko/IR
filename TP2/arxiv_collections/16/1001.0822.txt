Using first-principles approaches, we have investigated the thermoelectric
properties and the energy conversion efficiency of the paired metal-Br-Al
junction. Owing to the narrow states in the vicinity of the chemical potential,
the nanojunction has large Seebeck coefficients such that it can be considered
an efficient thermoelectric power generator. We also consider the nanojunction
in a three-terminal geometry, where the current, voltage, power, and efficiency
can be efficiently modulated by the gate voltages. Such current-voltage
characteristics could be useful in the design of nano-scale electronic devices
such, as a transistor or switch. Notably, the nanojunction as a transistor with
a fixed finite temperature difference between electrodes can power itself using
the Seebeck effect.
