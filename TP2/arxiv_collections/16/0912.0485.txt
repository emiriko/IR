We present a protocol to evaluate the expectation value of the correlations
of measurement outcomes for ensembles of quantum systems, and use it to
experimentally demonstrate--under an assumption of fair sampling--the violation
of an inequality that is satisfied by any non-contextual hidden-variables
(NCHV) theory. The experiment is performed on an ensemble of molecular nuclear
spins in the solid state, using established Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
techniques for quantum information processing (QIP).
