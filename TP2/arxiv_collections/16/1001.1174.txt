Doppler observations from Keck Observatory reveal the presence of a planet
with Msini of 2.1 Mjup orbiting the M3V star HIP79431. This is the sixth giant
planet to be detected in Doppler surveys of M dwarfs and it is one of the most
massive planets discovered around an M dwarf star. The planet has an orbital
period of 111.7 days and an orbital eccentricity of 0.29. The host star is
metal rich, with an estimated [Fe/H] = +0.4. This is the first planet to emerge
from our new survey of 1600 M-to-K dwarf stars.
