The distribution is calculated of the electron spin polarization under
current-driven spin injection from a probe to a ferromagnetic film. It is shown
that the main parameters determining difference of the spin polarization from
the equilibrium value are the current density and the spin polarization of the
probe material, while the relation between the probe diameter and the spin
diffusion length influences the result very weakly, to a certain extent. A
possibility is shown of reaching inverse population of the spin subbands at
distances from the probe boundary comparable with the spin diffusion length.
