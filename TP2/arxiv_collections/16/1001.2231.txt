We exactly reformulate the lattice CP(N-1) spin model on a D dimensional
torus as a loop model whose configurations correspond to the complete set of
strong coupling graphs of the original system. A Monte Carlo algorithm is
described and tested that samples the loop model with its configurations stored
and manipulated as a linked list. Complete absence of critical slowing down and
correspondingly small errors are found at D=2 for several observables including
the mass gap. Using two different standard lattice actions universality is
demonstrated in a finite size scaling study. The topological charge is
identified in the loop model but not yet investigated numerically.
