Measurement of magnetic fields on the few-hundred-kilometer length scale is
significant for a variety of geophysical applications including mapping of
crustal magnetism and ocean-circulation measurements, yet available techniques
for such measurements are very expensive or of limited accuracy. We propose a
scheme for remote detection of magnetic fields using the naturally occurring
atomic-sodium-rich layer in the mesosphere and existing high-power lasers
developed for laser guide-star applications. The proposed scheme offers
dramatic reduction in cost, opening the way to large-scale magnetic mapping
missions.
