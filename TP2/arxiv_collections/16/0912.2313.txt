Asynchronous rotation and orbital eccentricity lead to time-dependent
irradiation of the close-in gas giant exoplanets -- the hot Jupiters. This
time-dependent surface heating gives rise to fluid motions which propagate
throughout the planet. We investigate the ability of this "thermal tide" to
produce a quadrupole moment which can couple to the stellar gravitational tidal
force. While previous investigations discussed planets with solid surfaces,
here we focus on entirely fluid planets in order to understand gas giants with
small cores. The Coriolis force, thermal diffusion and self-gravity of the
perturbations are ignored for simplicity. First, we examine the response to
thermal forcing through analytic solutions of the fluid equations which treat
the forcing frequency as a small parameter. In the "equilibrium tide" limit of
zero frequency, fluid motion is present but does not induce a quadrupole
moment. In the next approximation, finite frequency corrections to the
equilibrium tide do lead to a nonzero quadrupole moment, the sign of which
torques the planet {\it away} from synchronous spin. We then numerically solve
the boundary value problem for the thermally forced, linear response of a
planet with neutrally stratified interior and stably stratified envelope. The
numerical results find quadrupole moments in agreement with the analytic
non-resonant result at sufficiently long forcing period. Surprisingly, in the
range of forcing periods of 1-30 days, the induced quadrupole moments can be
far larger than the analytic result due to response of internal gravity waves
which propagate in the radiative envelope. We discuss the relevance of our
results for the spin, eccentricity and thermal evolution of hot Jupiters.
