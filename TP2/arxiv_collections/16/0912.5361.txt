The CDMS Collaboration has reported two candidate events for dark matter. If
the events are due to the elastic scattering of dark matter, the dark matter
would be a WIMP dark matter with its mass of the order of 10-100GeV and its
scattering cross section with a nucleon is about 10^-43cm^2. We show that such
a dark matter is properly realized as a neutralino dark matter in the light
higgs boson scenario of the MSSM. The lightest higgs boson mass can be lighter
than 114.4GeV in the scenario because of a suppressed interaction between higgs
boson and Z bosons. As a result, a large scattering cross section between the
dark matter and ordinary matter is obtained.
