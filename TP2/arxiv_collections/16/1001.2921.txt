One of the unintended consequences of the New Public Management (NPM) in
universities is often feared to be a division between elite institutions
focused on research and large institutions with teaching missions. However,
institutional isomorphisms provide counter-incentives. For example, university
rankings focus on certain output parameters such as publications, but not on
others (e.g., patents). In this study, we apply Gini coefficients to university
rankings in order to assess whether universities are becoming more unequal, at
the level of both the world and individual nations. Our results do not support
the thesis that universities are becoming more unequal. If anything, we
predominantly find homogenization, both at the level of the global comparisons
and nationally. In a more restricted dataset (using only publications in the
natural and life sciences), we find increasing inequality for those countries,
which used NPM during the 1990s, but not during the 2000s. Our findings suggest
that increased output steering from the policy side leads to a global
conformation to performance standards.
