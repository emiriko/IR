The paradoxes of thermodynamics and statistical physics are unavoidable in
the study of physical paradoxes because of their importance at the time they
came to be as well as the frequency of their appearance in historical studies
of physics. In this work paradoxes are presented together with the historical
studies of their creation, their solutions are given and they are analysed
according to a number of characteristics: is it an exparadox, is it of
theoretic or experimental nature, is it a thought experiment and the type of
paradox it belongs to.
