We calculate the S-wave scattering lengths for charmed mesons scattering off
Goldstone bosons and explore their quark mass dependence using chiral
perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order as well as a unitarized version
of it. The quark mass dependence of all scattering lengths determined in a
recent lattice calculation can be reproduced by the unitarized version. We also
discuss signals of possible bound states in these observables.
