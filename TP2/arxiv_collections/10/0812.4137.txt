The vortex streets produced by a flapping foil of span-to-chord aspect ratio
of 4:1 are studied in a hydrodynamic tunnel experiment. In particular, the
mechanisms giving rise to the symmetry breaking of the reverse B\'enard-von
K\'arm\'an vortex street that characterizes fish-like swimming and forward
flapping flight are examined. Two-dimensional particle image velocimetry
measurements in the mid-plane perpendicular to the span axis of the foil are
used to characterize the different flow regimes. The deflection angle of the
mean jet flow with respect to the horizontal observed in the average velocity
field is used as a measure of the asymmetry of the vortex street. Time series
of the vorticity field are used to calculate the advection velocity of the
vortices with respect to the free-stream, defined as the phase velocity
$U_{phase}$, as well as the circulation $\Gamma$ of each vortex and the spacing
$\xi$ between consecutive vortices in the near wake. The observation that the
symmetry breaking results from the formation of a dipolar structure from each
couple of counter-rotating vortices shed on each flapping period serves as
starting point to build a model for the symmetry breaking threshold. A symmetry
breaking criterion based on the relation between the phase velocity of the
vortex street and an idealized self-advection velocity of two consecutive
counter-rotating vortices in the near wake is established. The predicted
threshold for symmetry breaking accounts well for the deflected wake regimes
observed in the present experiments and may be useful to explain other
experimental and numerical observations of similar deflected propulsive vortex
streets reported in the literature.
