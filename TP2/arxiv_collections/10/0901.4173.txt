We present the results of a wide-field survey for distant Sedna-like bodies
in the outer solar system using the 1.2-m Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar
Observatory. We searched ~12,000 square degrees down to a mean limiting
magnitude of 21.3 in R. A total number of 53 Kuiper belt objects and Centaurs
have been detected; 25 of which were discovered in this survey. No additional
Sedna-like bodies with perihelia beyond 70 AU were found despite a sensitivity
to motions out to ~1000 AU. We place constraints on the size and distribution
of objects on Sedna orbits.
