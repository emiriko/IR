We classify different classes of entangled states arise in a two-qubit
system. Some of these classes are of Bell's state types, while others are of
the Werner's state types. The degree of entanglement is quantified for
different values of the atomic and the cavity parameters. We show that it is
possible to generate entangled state with high degree of entanglement by
controlling the detuning and the number of photon inside the cavity.
