We propose a non-magnetic, pseudospin-based version of a spin valve, in which
the pseudospin polarization in neighboring regions of a graphene bilayer is
controlled by external gates. Numerical calculations demonstrate a large on-off
ratio of such a device. This finding holds promise for the realization of
pseudospintronics: a form of electronics based upon the manipulation of
pseudospin analogous to the control of physical spin in spintronics
applications.
