Let S be a projective K3 surface. It is proved that the 0-dimensional cusps
of the Kahler moduli of S are in one-to-one correspondence with the twisted
Fourier-Mukai partners of S. This leads to a counting formula for the
0-dimensional cusps of the Kahler moduli. Applications to rational maps between
K3 surfaces with large Picard numbers are given. When the Picard number of S is
1, the bijective correspondence is calculated explicitly.
