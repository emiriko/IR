Coefficients in the expansions of the form $\partial
P_{n}(\lambda;z)}/\partial\lambda=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{nk}(\lambda)P_{k}(\lambda;z)$,
where $P_{n}(\lambda;z)$ is the $n$th classical (the generalized Laguerre,
Gegenbauer or Jacobi) orthogonal polynomial of variable $z$ and $\lambda$ is a
parameter, are evaluated. A method we adopt in the present paper differs from
that used by Fr\"ohlich [Integral Transforms Spec. Funct. 2 (1994) 253] for the
Jacobi polynomials and by Koepf [Integral Transforms Spec. Funct. 5 (1997) 69]
for the generalized Laguerre and the Gegenbauer polynomials.
