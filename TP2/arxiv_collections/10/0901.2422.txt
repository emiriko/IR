In this paper we consider the linear second order partial differential
equation with non-constant coefficients; then by using the double convolution
product we produce new equations with polynomials coefficients and we classify
the new equations. It is shown that the classifications of hyperbolic and
elliptic new equations are similar to the original equations that is the
classification is invariant after finite double convolutions product.
