This work is focused on the solvability of initial-boundary value problems
for degenerate parabolic partial differential equations that arise in the
pricing of Asian options, and on the investigation of differential and certain
qualitative properties of solutions of such equations. The generalized
solvability for such models with degeneracy at the boundaries is proven by
employing solutions obtained from finite difference numerical schemes.
Furthermore, the regularity of such solutions is studied.
