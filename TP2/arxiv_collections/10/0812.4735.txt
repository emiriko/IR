We investigate the spatial quantum properties of the light emitted by a
perfectly spatially degenerate optical parametric oscillator (self-imaging
OPO). We show that this device produces local squeezing for areas bigger than a
coherence are that depends on the crystal length and pump width. Furthermore,
it generates local EPR beams in the far field. We show, calculating the
eigenmodes of the system, that it is highly multimode for realistic
experimental parameters.
