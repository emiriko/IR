We compare and contrast the low temperature magnetotransport properties of
ultra-thin, insulating, Be films with and without spin-orbit scattering (SOS).
Beryllium films have very little intrinsic SOS, but by "dusting" them with
sub-monolayer coverages of Au, one can introduce a well controlled SOS rate.
Pure Be films with sheet resistance R >R_Q exhibit a low-temperature negative
magnetoresistance (MR) that saturates to the quantum resistance R_Q = h/e^2.
This high-field quantum metal phase is believed to represent a new ground state
of the system. In contrast, the corresponding negative MR in Be/Au films is
greatly diminished, suggesting that, in the presence of strong SOS, the quantum
metal phase can only be reached at field scales well beyond those typically
available in a low temperature laboratory.
