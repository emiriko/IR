In Part I of this paper we have presented a simple model capable of
describing the localized failure of a massive structure. In this part, we
discuss the identification of the model parameters from two kinds of
experiments: a uniaxial tensile test and a three-point bending test. The former
is used only for illustration of material parameter response dependence, and we
focus mostly upon the latter, discussing the inverse optimization problem for
which the specimen is subjected to a heterogeneous stress field.
