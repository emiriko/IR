Terrestrial exoplanets are on the verge of joining the ranks of
astronomically accessible objects. Interpreting their observable
characteristics, and informing decisions on instrument design and use, will
hinge on the ability to model these planets successfully across a vast range of
configurations and climate forcings. A hierarchical approach that addresses
fundamental behaviors as well as more complex, specific, situations is crucial
to this endeavor and is presented here. Incorporating Earth-centric knowledge,
and continued cross-disciplinary work will be critical, but ultimately the
astrophysical study of terrestrial exoplanets must be encouraged to develop as
its own field.
