An article (J Trauma 29:10-18, 1989) cites unpublished wound ballistics data

detailed examples of distant injuries. (Bellamy RF, Zajtchuk R. The physics and
biophysics of wound ballistics. In: Zajtchuk R, ed. Textbook of Military
Medicine, Part I: Warfare, Weaponry, and the Casualty, Vol. 5, Conventional
Warfare: Ballistic, Blast, and Burn Injuries. Washington, DC: Office of the
Surgeon General, Department of the Army, United States of America; 1990:
