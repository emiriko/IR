An attempt is made to consider the difference between the proccesses of the
Bose-Einstein condensation of particles and quasiparticles. An equation for
particle number of the Bose-condensate as a function of the total number of
particles in the system is obtained. This equation is also written for the
caseof quasiparticles with taking into account their creation by pumping and
the existence ofequilibriumthermal excitations in the system. From the analysis
of both these equations the chemical potential of pumped quasiparticles and
their number in the condensate as a function of pumping intensity is found. It
is shown that for low energy quasiparticles the proccess of Bose-condensation
begins and proceeds at arbitrary temperatures high enough included.
