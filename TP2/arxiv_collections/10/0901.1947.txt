In this letter we derive an expression for the force acting on a small (still
macroscopic) particle in the field of the quantized electromagnetic radiation
in any arbitrary quantum state. This result unifies in one simple formula all
known expressions for the forces (i.e. van der Waals or frictional) acting on a
small particle.
