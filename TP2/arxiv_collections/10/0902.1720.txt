The mass differences and mixing angles of neutrinos can neither be explained
by R-Parity violating split supersymmetry nor by flavor blind quantum gravity
alone. It is shown that combining both effects leads, within the allowed
parameter range, to good agreement with the experimental results. The
atmospheric mass is generated by supersymmetry through mixing between neutrinos
and neutralinos, while the solar mass is generated by gravity through flavor
blind dimension five operators. Maximal atmospheric mixing forces the tangent
squared of the solar angle to be equal to 1/2. The scale of the quantum gravity
operator is predicted within a 5% error, implying that the reduced Planck scale
should lie around the GUT scale. In this way, the model is very predictive and
can be tested at future experiments.
