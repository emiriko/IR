An antiferromagnetic transition is observed in single crystal EuRh2As2 at a
high temperature T_N = 47 K compared to the ferromagnetic Weiss temperature
theta = 12 K. We show that this is, surprisingly, consistent with mean field
theory. A first-order field-induced magnetic transition is observed at T < T_N
with an unusual temperature dependence of the transition field. A dramatic
magnetic field-induced reduction of the electronic specific heat coefficient at
1.8-5.0 K by 38% at 9 T is observed. In addition, a strong positive
magnetoresistance and a large change in the Hall coefficient occur below 25 K.
Band structure calculations indicate that the Fermi energy lies on a steep edge
of a narrow peak in the density of states.
