We present a two-player communication task that can be solved by a protocol
of polylogarithmic cost in the simultaneous message passing model with
classical communication and shared entanglement, but requires exponentially
more communication in the classical interactive model.
  Our second result is a two-player nonlocality game with input length $n$ and
output of polylogarithmic length, that can be won with probability 1-o(1) by
players sharing polylogarithmic amount of entanglement. On the other hand, the
game is lost with probability $\Omega(1)$ by players without entanglement, even
if they are allowed to exchange up to k bits in interactive communication for
certain $k\in\Omega(n^{1/4})$.
  These two results give almost the strongest possible (and the strongest
known) indication of nonlocal properties of two-party entanglement.
