The main attention is given to discussion of the natural causes and
regularities of the Arctic bromine pollution. We make notice of marine
microbial organisms and their metabolism as a prime driving force for the
elemental biogeochemical cycles. One of the important conclusions of this study
is on similarity between ocean bromine concentrating as by-product of the
marine microbial activities and nitrogen fixation by soil bacteria. In both
cases, microbial organisms and their food webs maintain the sustainability of
the superficial environments throughout the geological ages of the biotic
Earth. Phenomenology of bromine explosion points on synchronization of the
biogeochemical processing upon the solar factor. Spatial-temporal extent and
statistical properties of the Arctic BrO cloud make the bromine explosion
phenomena an exceptionally valuable for modeling. In our analysis of of the
interannual (Solar Cycle 23) variability of the BrO cloud, we rely on on the
processed from GOME satellite data and on the ground observations.
Sustainability of the earth superficial environments is impossible without
ozone-oxygen transformations. Bromine pollution activate catalytic depletion of
ozone, which leads to the intensification of oxygen fluxes and atmosphere-ocean
exchange and to the stimulation of the seasonal production of the superficial
Northern Hemisphere's biota. The biotic bromine explosion illustrates the major
concepts of Gaia hypothesis and yields on the foundational principle of
multiple unity of the Earth's life and planetary operations.
