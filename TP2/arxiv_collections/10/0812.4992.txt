A large two-body scattering length leads to universal behavior in few-body
systems. In particular, the three-body system displays interesting features
such as exact discrete scale invariance in the bound state spectrum in the
limit of infinite scattering length. Here, I will discuss how an effective
field theory (EFT) can be used to study these features and how the finite range
of the underlying interaction impacts the bound state spectrum at first order
in the EFT expansion.
