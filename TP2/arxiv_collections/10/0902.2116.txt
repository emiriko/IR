Consider a coring with exact rational functor, and a finitely generated and
projective right comodule. We construct a functor (\emph{coinduction functor})
which is right adjoint to the hom-functor represented by this comodule. Using
the coinduction functor, we establish a bijective map between the set of
representative classes of torsion simple right comodules and the set of
representative classes of simple right modules over the endomorphism ring. A
detailed application to a group-graded modules is also given.
