We study colloidal particle dynamics of a model glass system using confocal
and fluorescence microscopy as the sample evolves from a hard-sphere glass to a
liquid with attractive interparticle interactions. The transition from
hard-sphere glass to attractive liquid is induced by short-range depletion
forces. The development of liquid-like structure is indicated by particle
dynamics. We identify particles which exhibit substantial motional events and
characterize the transition using the properties of these motional events. As
samples enter the attractive liquid region, particle speed during these
motional events increases by about one order of magnitude, and the particles
move more cooperatively. Interestingly, colloidal particles in the attractive
liquid phase do not exhibit significantly larger displacements than particles
in the hard-sphere glass.
