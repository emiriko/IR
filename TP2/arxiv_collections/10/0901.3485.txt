Within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) we systematically
investigate the bounds on the mass of the lightest neutralino. We allow for
non-universal gaugino masses and thus even consider massless neutralinos, while
assuming in general that R-parity is conserved. Our main focus are laboratory
constraints. We consider collider data, precision observables, and also rare
meson decays to very light neutralinos. We then discuss the astrophysical and
cosmological implications. We find that a massless neutralino is allowed by all
existing experimental data and astrophysical and cosmological observations.
