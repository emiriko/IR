MINOS is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that uses two
detectors separated by 734 km. The readout systems used for the two detectors
are different and have to be independently calibrated. To verify and make a
direct comparison of the calibrated response of the two readout systems, test
beam data were acquired using a smaller calibration detector. This detector was
simultaneously instrumented with both readout systems and exposed to the CERN
PS T7 test beam. Differences in the calibrated response of the two systems are
shown to arise from differences in response non-linearity, photomultiplier
crosstalk, and threshold effects at the few percent level. These differences
are reproduced by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to better than 1% and a
scheme that corrects for these differences by calibrating the MC to match the
data in each detector separately is presented. The overall difference in
calorimetric response between the two readout systems is shown to be consistent
with zero to a precision of 1.3% in data and 0.3% in MC with no significant
energy dependence.
