In this talk we report work on the matching of the next-to-leading
logarithmic approximation (NLLA) onto the fixed next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO) calculations for event shape distributions in electron-positron
annihilation. Furthermore we present preliminary results on the determination
of the strong coupling constant obtained using NLLA+NNLO predictions and ALEPH
data.
