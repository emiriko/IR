An importance of the detailed studies of the theoretical QCD predictions for
the decay width of Standard Model Higgs boson into bottom quarks, in the case
when $\rm{M_H\leq 2M_W}$, is emphasized.
  The effects of higher order perturbative QCD corrections up to order
$\alpha_s^4$-terms are considered. The resummations of the $\pi^2$ terms
resulting from analytical continuation, typical of Minkowskian quantities, is
undertaken for the $\Gamma(H\to\bar{b}b)$ decay width. The uncertainties in the
calculation of this decay width are analyzed.
