We present an analytical device model for a graphene bilayer field-effect
transistor (GBL-FET) with a graphene bilayer as a channel, and with back and
top gates. The model accounts for the dependences of the electron and hole
Fermi energies as well as energy gap in different sections of the channel on
the bias back-gate and top-gate voltages. Using this model, we calculate the dc
and ac source-drain currents and the transconductance of GBL-FETs with both
ballistic and collision dominated electron transport as functions of structural
parameters, the bias back-gate and top-gate voltages, and the signal frequency.
It is shown that there are two threshold voltages, $V_{th,1}$ and $V_{th,2}$,
so that the dc current versus the top-gate voltage relation markedly changes
depending on whether the section of the channel beneath the top gate (gated
section) is filled with electrons, depleted, or filled with holes. The electron
scattering leads to a decrease in the dc and ac currents and transconductances,
whereas it weakly affects the threshold frequency. As demonstrated, the
transient recharging of the gated section by holes can pronouncedly influence
the ac transconductance resulting in its nonmonotonic frequency dependence with
a maximum at fairly high frequencies.
