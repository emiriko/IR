We present a next-to-leading order (NLO) treatment of the production of a new
charged heavy vector boson, generically called W', at hadron colliders via the
Drell-Yan process. We fully consider the interference effects with the Standard
Model W boson and allow for arbitrary chiral couplings to quarks and leptons.
We present results at both leading order (LO) and NLO in QCD using the
MC@NLO/Herwig++ and POWHEG methods. We derive theoretical observation curves on
the mass-width plane for both the LO and NLO cases at different collider
luminosities. The event generator used, Wpnlo, is fully customisable and
publicly available.
