We briefly summarize our study on anisotropy of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic-Rays
(UHECRs), in which we define a statistics that measures the correlation between
UHECRs and Large Scale Structure (LSS). We also comment here on recently
published paper by Koers and Tinyakov that compared our statistics to improved
KS statistics.
