In this review, we first discuss the perspectives concerning a better
determination of the proton structure in terms of quarks and gluons at LHC
after describing the results coming from HERA and Tevatron. In a second part of
the review, we describe the diffractive phenomena at HERA and Tevatron and the
consequences for LHC.
