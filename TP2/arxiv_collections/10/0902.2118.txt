We study the transport properties of the Fano-Anderson model with a
Lorentzian-shaped density of states in one of the electronic reservoirs. We
explicitly show that the energy dependence of the density of states can cause
non-Markovian effects and that the non-Markovian master equation may fail if
these effects are strong. We evaluate the stationary current, the zero
frequency current noise and the occupation dynamics of the resonant level by
means of a quantum master equation approach within different approximation
schemes and compare the results to the exact solution obtained by scattering
theory and Green's functions.
