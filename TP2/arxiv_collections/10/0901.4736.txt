The low-temperature thermal properties of dielectric crystals are governed by
acoustic excitations with large wavelengths that are well described by plane
waves. This is the Debye model, which rests on the assumption that the medium
is an elastic continuum, holds true for acoustic wavelengths large on the
microscopic scale fixed by the interatomic spacing, and gradually breaks down
on approaching it. Glasses are characterized as well by universal
low-temperature thermal properties, that are however anomalous with respect to
those of the corresponding crystalline phases. Related universal anomalies also
appear in the low-frequency vibrational density of states and, despite of a
longstanding debate, still remain poorly understood. Using molecular dynamics
simulations of a model monatomic glass of extremely large size, we show that in
glasses the structural disorder undermines the Debye model in a subtle way: the
elastic continuum approximation for the acoustic excitations breaks down
abruptly on the mesoscopic, medium-range-order length-scale of about ten
interatomic spacings, where it still works well for the corresponding
crystalline systems. On this scale, the sound velocity shows a marked reduction
with respect to the macroscopic value. This turns out to be closely related to
the universal excess over the Debye model prediction found in glasses at
frequencies of ~1 THz in the vibrational density of states or at temperatures
of ~10 K in the specific heat.
