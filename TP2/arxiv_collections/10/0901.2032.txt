We study the charge conductivity in one-dimensional prototype models of
interacting particles, such as the Hubbard and the t-V spinless fermion model,
when coupled to some external baths injecting and extracting particles at the
boundaries. We show that, if these systems are driven far from equilibrium, a
negative differential conductivity regime can arise. The above electronic
models can be mapped into Heisenberg-like spin ladders coupled to two magnetic
baths, so that charge transport mechanisms are explained in terms of quantum
spin transport. The negative differential conductivity is due to oppositely
polarized ferromagnetic domains which arise at the edges of the chain, and
therefore inhibit spin transport: we propose a qualitative understanding of the
phenomenon by analyzing the localization of one-magnon excitations created at
the borders of a ferromagnetic region. We also show that negative differential
conductivity is stable against breaking of integrability. Numerical simulations
of non-equilibrium time evolution have been performed by employing a
Monte-Carlo wave function approach and a matrix product operator formalism.
