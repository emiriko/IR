The development of a dynamical model for investigating the nucleon resonances
using the reactions of meson production from \pi N, \gamma N, N(e,e'), and
N(\nu,{\it l}) reactions is reviewed. The results for the \Delta (1232) state
are summarized and discussed. The progress in investigating higher mass nucleon
resonances is reported.
