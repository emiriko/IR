We have constrained unparticle interactions with neutrinos and electrons
using available data on neutrino-electron elastic scattering and the four CERN
LEP experiments data on mono photon production. We have found that, for
neutrino-electron elastic scattering, the MUNU experiment gives better
constraints than previous reported limits in the region d>1.5. The results are
compared with the current astrophysical limits, pointing out the cases where
these limits may or may not apply. We also discuss the sensitivity of future
experiments to unparticle physics. In particular, we show that the measurement
of coherent reactor neutrino scattering off nuclei could provide a good
sensitivity to the couplings of unparticle interaction with neutrinos and
quarks. We also discuss the case of future neutrino-electron experiments as
well as the International Linear Collider.
