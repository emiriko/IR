Modern physics makes wide use of the equation for which only a potential
solution is sought. The probability that this equation has a nonpotential
solution is omitted from consideration automatically without any explanation.
In this paper, using the electron problem as an example, an exact nonpotential
solution linearly independent of the classical one is found. A solution with
minimum potential energy is chosen as a physically feasible solution. The force
acting on an electron with a nonpotential field in a homogeneous electric field
and the interaction energy of two electrons with a nonpotential field is
determined. The interaction energy depends on three angles responsible for
mutual orientation of the electrons. Taking into account a nonpotential
solution explains why there exist two types of neutrons: a neutron and an
antineutron, why annihilation of the antineutron - proton is possible whereas
that of the proton - neutron is impossible, why neutrons behave similar to
protons. All the above properties result from the nonpotential character of an
electric field.
