We theoretically demonstrate high Quality factor micropillar cavities with
record low mode volumes based on the TiO2/SiO2 material system. The proposed
cavities have Q/V three orders of magnitude larger than previously reported
ones. We show that our cavity embedded with diamond nanocrystal provides a
feasible platform for cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments in the strong
coupling limit.
