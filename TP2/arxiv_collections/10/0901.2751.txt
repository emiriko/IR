Pyro-Align is a multiple alignment program specifically designed for
pyrosequencing reads of huge number. Multiple sequence alignment is shown to be
NP-hard and heuristics are designed for approximate solutions. Multiple
sequence alignment of pyrosequenceing reads is complex mainly because of 2
factors. One being the huge number of reads, making the use of traditional
heuristics,that scale very poorly for large number, unsuitable. The second
reason is that the alignment cannot be performed arbitrarily, because the
position of the reads with respect to the original genome is important and has
to be taken into account.In this report we present a short description of the
multiple alignment system for pyrosequencing reads.
