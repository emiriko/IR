We analyze the theory and phenomenology of anomalous global chiral symmetries
in the presence of an extra dimension. We propose a simple extension of the
Standard Model in 5D whose signatures closely resemble those of supersymmetry
with gauge mediation, and we suggest a novel scalar dark matter candidate.
