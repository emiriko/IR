We study the possibility of ferromagnetism in metals. The metal is described
by two hybridized bands one of which includes Hubbard correlation whereas the
other is uncorrelated. We parametrize the ratio of the band widths and their
centers as well. The original Hamiltonian is transformed in an effective and
simpler one. Only one site retains the full correlation (U) while in the others
acts as an internal field, the self-energy, in the framework of an alloy
analogy approximation. This field, in turn, is self-consistently determined by
imposing the translational invariance of the problem. For several total
electronic occupation numbers (n_{total}) we compare the spin dependent free
energies with the corresponding paramagnetic ones. We present several results
pointing out the mechanism by which the self-consistency introduces a sort of
constraints, for given values of band width and band shift .
