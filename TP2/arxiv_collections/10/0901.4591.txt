The enormous increase in the usage of communication networks has made
protection against node and link failures essential in the deployment of
reliable networks. To prevent loss of data due to node failures, a network
protection strategy is proposed that aims to withstand such failures.
Particularly, a protection strategy against any single node failure is designed
for a given network with a set of $n$ disjoint paths between senders and
receivers. Network coding and reduced capacity are deployed in this strategy
without adding extra working paths to the readily available connection paths.
This strategy is based on protection against node failures as protection
against multiple link failures. In addition, the encoding and decoding
operational aspects of the premeditated protection strategy are demonstrated.
