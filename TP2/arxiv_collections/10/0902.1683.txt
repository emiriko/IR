We show that the fundamental seismic shear mode, observed as a quasi-periodic
oscillation in giant flares emitted by highly-magnetized neutron stars, is
particularly sensitive to the nuclear physics of the crust. The identification
of an oscillation at ~ 30 Hz as the fundamental crustal shear mode requires a
nuclear symmetry energy that depends very weakly on density near saturation. If
the nuclear symmetry energy varies more strongly with density, then lower
frequency oscillations, previously identified as torsional Alfven modes of the
fluid core, could instead be associated with the crust. If this is the case,
then future observations of giant flares should detect oscillations at around
18 Hz. An accurate measurement of the neutron skin thickness of lead will also
constrain the frequencies predicted by the model.
