Motivated by constructions in the representation theory of finite dimensional
algebras we generalize the notion of Artin-Schelter regular algebras of
dimension $n$ to algebras and categories to include Auslander algebras and a
graded analogue for infinite representation type. A generalized Artin-Schelter
regular algebra or a category of dimension $n$ is shown to have common
properties with the classical Artin-Schelter regular algebras. In particular,
when they admit a duality, then they satisfy Serre duality formulas and the
$\Ext$-category of nice sets of simple objects of maximal projective dimension
$n$ is a finite length Frobenius category.
