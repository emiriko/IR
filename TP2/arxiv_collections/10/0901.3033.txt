Based on the experimental data and estimations of the charged leptons and
quarks masses, a close power law with exponent 3/4 has been found, connecting
charged leptons masses and up quarks masses. A similar mass relation has been
suggested for the masses of neutral leptons and down quarks. The latter mass
relation and the results of the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments have
been used for prediction of neutrino masses. The obtained masses of electron
neutrino, muon neutrino and tau neutrino are 0.0003 eV, 0.003 eV and 0.04 eV,
respectively. These values are compatible with the recent experimental data and
support the normal hierarchy of neutrino masses.
