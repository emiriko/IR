The Standard Model of Particle Physics has been verified to unprecedented
precision in the last few decades. However there are still phenomena in nature
which cannot be explained, and as such new theories will be required. Since
terrestrial experiments are limited in both the energy and precision that can
be probed, new methods are required to search for signs of physics beyond the
Standard Model. In this dissertation, I demonstrate how these theories can be
probed by searching for remnants of their effects in the early Universe. In
particular I focus on three possible extensions of the Standard Model: the
addition of massive neutral particles as dark matter (through the use of
several minimal models of dark matter), the addition of charged massive
particles (through catalyzed Big Bang Nucleosynthesis), and the existence of
higher dimensions (through its effects on BBN and galactic positron
production). For each new model, I review the existing experimental bounds and
the potential for discovering new physics in the next generation of
experiments.
