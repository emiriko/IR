The saturation properties of neutron-rich matter are investigated in a
relativistic mean-field formalism using two accurately calibrated models: NL3
and FSUGold. The saturation properties - density, binding energy per nucleon,
and incompressibility coefficient - are calculated as a function of the
neutron-proton asymmetry alpha=(N-Z)/A to all orders in alpha. Good agreement
(at the 10% level or better) is found between these numerical calculations and
analytic expansions that are given in terms of a handful of bulk parameters
determined at saturation density. Using insights developed from the analytic
approach and a general expression for the incompressibility coefficient of
infinite neutron-rich matter, i.e., K0(alpha)=K0+Ktau*alpha^{2}+..., we
construct a Hybrid model with values for K0 and Ktau as suggested by recent
experimental findings. Whereas the Hybrid model provides a better description
of the measured distribution of isoscalar monopole strength in the Sn-isotopes
relative to both NL3 and FSUGold, it significantly underestimates the
distribution of strength in 208Pb. Thus, we conclude that the incompressibility
coefficient of neutron-rich matter remains an important open problem.
