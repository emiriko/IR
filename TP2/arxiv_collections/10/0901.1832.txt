There is a difference between the solar ionization concentration in the
ionosphere in the daytime and at night-time. At night the E-region ion
concentration peak is dramatically reduced due to chemical losses and the rapid
change in the vertical polarization electric field at the time around sunset,
which is due to the accelerating neutral wind dynamo and which produces a
corresponding change in the zonal electric field through curl-free
requirements. The result is the formation of a layer of high conductivity, at
the daytime-night-time interface. This phenomenon in the South Atlantic Anomaly
(SAA) area, provokes an increase in the precipitation of charge particles which
is well known and is commonly termed "sunset enhancement". In the following we
show five gamma ray burst (GRB) triggers observed by spacecraft GRB detectors
in temporal coincidence with muon enhancement observed at ground level by the
Tupi telescopes with two different orientations at $\sim 21$ UT (local sunset),
and located inside the SAA region. Of these GRB triggers analyzed here, one
from Swift, and two from Fermi are probably noise triggers, produced by
omni-directional particle precipitation, during the sunset enhancements.
