The logic which describes quantum robots is not orthodox quantum logic, but a
deductive calculus which reproduces the quantum tasks (computational processes,
and actions) taking into account quantum superposition and quantum
entanglement. A way toward the realization of intelligent quantum robots is to
adopt a quantum metalanguage to control quantum robots. A physical
implementation of a quantum metalanguage might be the use of coherent states in
brain signals.
