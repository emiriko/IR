By molecular modeling we demonstrate that the nematic long-range order
discovered in bent-core liquid crystal systems should reveal further spatially
homogeneous phases. Two of them are identified as a tetrahedratic nematic
($N_T$) phase with $D_{2d}$ symmetry and a chiral tetrahedratic nematic
($N_T^*$) phase with $D_2$ symmetry. These new phases were found for a lattice
model with quadrupolar and octupolar anisotropic interactions using Mean Field
theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The phase diagrams exhibit tetrahedratic
($T$), $N_T$ and $N_T^*$ phases, in addition to ordinary isotropic ($I$),
uniaxial nematic ($N_U$) and biaxial nematic ($N_B$) phases. To our knowledge,
this is the first molecular model with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in
non-layered systems.
