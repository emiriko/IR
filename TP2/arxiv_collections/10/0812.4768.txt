A dephasing model in the spirit of Buttiker's fictitious probe model where
infinite probes are distributed uniformly over the conductor is proposed. The
dephasing rate enters into the model as an adjustable parameter and to compute
the conductance. A one-dimensional delta function scatterer model is solved
numerically. We observe the dephasing effects on the calculated conductance.
