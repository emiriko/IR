The incompatibility between GR and QM is generally seen as a sufficient
motivation for the development of a theory of Quantum Gravity. If - so a
typical argumentation - QM gives a universally valid basis for the description
of all natural systems, then the gravitational field should have quantum
properties. Together with the arguments against semi-classical theories of
gravity, this leads to a strategy which takes a quantization of GR as the
natural avenue to Quantum Gravity. And a quantization of the gravitational
field would in some sense correspond to a quantization of geometry. Spacetime
would have quantum properties. But, this strategy will only be successful, if
gravity is a fundamental interaction. - What, if gravity is instead an
intrinsically classical phenomenon? Then, if QM is nevertheless fundamentally
valid, gravity can not be a fundamental interaction. An intrinsically classical
gravity in a quantum world would have to be an emergent, induced or residual,
macroscopic effect, caused by other interactions. The gravitational field (as
well as spacetime) would not have any quantum properties. A quantization of GR
would lead to artifacts without any relation to nature. The serious problems of
all approaches to Quantum Gravity that start from a direct quantization of GR
or try to capture the quantum properties of gravity in form of a 'graviton'
dynamics - together with the, meanwhile, rich spectrum of approaches to an
emergent gravity and/or spacetime - make this latter option more and more
interesting for the development of a theory of Quantum Gravity. The most
advanced emergent gravity (and spacetime) scenarios are of an
information-theoretical, quantum-computational type.
