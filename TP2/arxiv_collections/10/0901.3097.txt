We report VRI CCD observations of nine Cepheids in the South Polar (Sculptor)
Group spiral galaxy NGC 0247. Periods of these Cepheids range from 20 to 70
days. Over the past 20 years the very brightest Cepheid in our sample, NGC
0247:[MF09] C1, has decreased its period by 6%, faded by 0.8 mag in the V band,
and become bluer by 0.23 mag in (V-I). A multi-wavelength analysis of the
Cepheid data yields a true distance modulus of mod = 27.81 +/- 0.10 mag (3.36
+/- 0.16 Mpc) with a total line-of-sight reddening of E(V-I) = 0.07 +/-0.04
mag, after adopting an LMC true distance modulus of 18.5 mag and reddening of
E(B-V) = 0.10 mag. These results are in excellent agreement with other very
recently published (Cepheid and TRGB) distances to NGC 0247. Combining both
Cepheid datasets gives mod_o = 27.85 +/-0.09 mag (3.72 +/- 0.15 Mpc) with
E(V-I) = 0.11 +/- 0.03 mag.
