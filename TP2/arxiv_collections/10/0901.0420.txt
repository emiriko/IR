We present a study of the hard-core Bose-Hubbard model at zero temperature on
an infinite square lattice using the infinite Projected Entangled Pair State
algorithm [Jordan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 250602 (2008)]. Throughout the
whole phase diagram our values for the ground state energy, particle density
and condensate fraction accurately reproduce those previously obtained by other
methods. We also explore ground state entanglement, compute two-point
correlators and conduct a fidelity-based analysis of the phase diagram.
Furthermore, for illustrative purposes we simulate the response of the system
when a perturbation is suddenly added to the Hamiltonian.
