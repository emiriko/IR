In this work we study the entanglement of pure fourpartite of qubit states.
The analysis is realized through the comparison between two different
entanglement measures: the Groverian entanglement measure and the residual
entanglement measured with negativities. Furthemore, we discuss some
applications of four-way entangled fourpartite states.
