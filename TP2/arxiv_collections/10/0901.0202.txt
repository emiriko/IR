We present a method of modeling the radial velocity (RV) measurements which
can be useful in searching for planets hosted by chromospherically active
stars. We assume that the observed RV signal is induced by the reflex motion of
a star as well as by distortions of spectral line profiles, measured by the
Bisector Velocity Span (BVS). The RVs are fitted with a common planetary model
including RV correction term depending linearly on the BVS, which accounts for
the stellar activity. The coefficient of correlation is an additional free
parameter of the RV model. That approach differs from correcting the RVs before
or after fitting the "pure" planetary model. We test the method on simulated
data derived for single-planet systems. The results are compared with the
outcomes of algorithms found in the literature.
