We consider two different effective polymerization schemes applied to
D-dimensional, spherically symmetric black hole interiors. It is shown that
polymerization of the generalized area variable alone leads to a complete,
regular, single-horizon spacetime in which the classical singularity is
replaced by a bounce. The bounce radius is independent of rescalings of the
homogeneous internal coordinate, but does depend on the arbitrary fiducial cell
size. The model is therefore necessarily incomplete. It nonetheless has many
interesting features: After the bounce, the interior region asymptotes to an
infinitely expanding Kantowski-Sachs spacetime. If the solution is analytically
continued across the horizon, the black hole exterior exhibits asymptotically
vanishing quantum-corrections due to the polymerization. In all spacetime
dimensions except four, the fall-off is too slow to guarantee invariance under
Poincare transformations in the exterior asymptotic region. Hence the
four-dimensional solution stands out as the only example which satisfies the
criteria for asymptotic flatness. In this case it is possible to calculate the
quantum-corrected temperature and entropy. We also show that polymerization of
both phase space variables, the area and the conformal mode of the metric,
generically leads to a multiple horizon solution which is reminiscent of
polymerized mini-superspace models of spherically symmetric black holes in Loop
Quantum Gravity.
