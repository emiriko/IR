We develop and test a fast and accurate semi-analytical formula for
single-name default swaptions in the context of a shifted square root jump
diffusion (SSRJD) default intensity model. The model can be calibrated to the
CDS term structure and a few default swaptions, to price and hedge other credit
derivatives consistently. We show with numerical experiments that the model
implies plausible volatility smiles.
