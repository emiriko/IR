Predictions of the hadronic interaction model EPOS~1.61 as implemented in the
air shower simulation program CORSIKA are compared to observations with the
KASCADE experiment. The investigations reveal that the predictions of EPOS are
not compatible with KASCADE measurements. The discrepancies seen are most
likely due to use of a set of inelastic hadronic cross sections that are too
high.
