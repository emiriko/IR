Protein folding, peptide aggregation and crystallization, as well as
adsorption of molecules on soft or solid substrates have an essential feature
in common: In all these processes, structure formation is guided by a
collective, cooperative behavior of the molecular subunits lining up to build
chainlike macromolecules. Proteins experience conformational transitions
related to thermodynamic phase transitions. For chains of finite length, an
important difference of crossovers between conformational (pseudo)phases is,
however, that these transitions are typically rather smooth processes, i.e.,
thermodynamic activity is not necessarily signalized by strong entropic or
energetic fluctuations. Nonetheless, in order to understand generic properties
of molecular structure-formation processes, the analysis of mesoscopic models
from a statistical physics point of view enables first insights into the nature
of conformational transitions in small systems. Here, we review recent results
obtained by means of sophisticated generalized-ensemble computer simulations of
minimalistic coarse-grained models.
