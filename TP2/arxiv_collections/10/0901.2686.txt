Gapped phases of noninteracting fermions, with and without charge
conservation and time-reversal symmetry, are classified using Bott periodicity.
The symmetry and spatial dimension determines a general universality class,
which corresponds to one of the 2 types of complex and 8 types of real Clifford
algebras. The phases within a given class are further characterized by a
topological invariant, an element of some Abelian group that can be 0, Z, or
Z_2. The interface between two infinite phases with different topological
numbers must carry some gapless mode. Topological properties of finite systems
are described in terms of K-homology. This classification is robust with
respect to disorder, provided electron states near the Fermi energy are absent
or localized. In some cases (e.g., integer quantum Hall systems) the
K-theoretic classification is stable to interactions, but a counterexample is
also given.
