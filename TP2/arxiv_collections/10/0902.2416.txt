We construct a set of post-Newtonian reference frames for a comprehensive
study of the orbital dynamics and rotational motion of the Moon and Earth by
means of lunar laser ranging (LLR) with the precision of one millimeter. We
also derive the post-Newtonian coordinate transformations between the frames
and analyze the residual gauge freedom, which is used for removing spurious
post-Newtonian effects from the equations of motion of the solar system bodies.
