The in-medium modification of the scale dependence of the fragmentation
function in dense matter, brought about by higher twist corrections to the
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations, is
derived. A phenomenologically motivated resummation is outlined which
incorporates the next-to-leading twist single gluon emission kernel along with
the vacuum emission kernel and provides an in-medium virtuality evolution of
the final fragmentation function of a hard jet propagating through dense
matter. The concept of a fragmentation function is generalized to include a
dependence on distance traveled in the medium. Following this, numerical
implementations are carried out and compared to experimental results on the
single inclusive suppression observed in Deep-Inelastic scattering (DIS) off a
large nucleus.
