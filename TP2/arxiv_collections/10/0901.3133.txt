Supplementary information for the article "Intermode Dephasing in a
Superconducting Stripline Resonator" (arXiv:0901.3110). The supplementary
information is devoted to three main issues. In section I we describe the
fabrication process; in section II we present the derivation of the Hamiltonian
of the system and provide a more detailed discussion about the properties of
the microbridges; in section III the hysteretic response of the resonator and
the effect of heating are discussed.
