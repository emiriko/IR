The CP-violating phenomenology of the MSSM with Minimal Flavor Violation
(MFV) in the lepton sector is revisited. To this end, the most general
parametrizations of the slepton soft-breaking terms are constructed assuming a
seesaw mechanism of type I. After a critical reassessment of how the
CP-symmetry is broken within the MFV framework, all possible CP-violating
phases are introduced. From the strong hierarchy of their contributions to the
Electric Dipole Moments (EDMs), these phases are split into three classes:
flavor-blind, flavor-diagonal and flavor off-diagonal. In particular, the
phases from the neutrino sector belong to the last class; they start to
contribute only at the second order in the mass-insertion approximation and
have thus a negligible effect. It is then shown that to each class of phases
corresponds a unique largely dominant term in the MFV expansion. Numerically,
for a realistic range of MSSM and neutrino parameters, such that B(mu --> e
gamma) does not exceed its experimental bound, the three types of phases are
found to be allowed by the current bound on the electron EDM, though the next
generation of experiments should constrain tightly the flavor-blind phase.
Finally, we relax the MFV hypothesis and show how in the general MSSM, the MFV
operator basis can be used to judge of the naturality of the slepton
soft-breaking terms.
