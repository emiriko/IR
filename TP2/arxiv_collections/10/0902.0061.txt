In this paper we develop and refine our recent model of a one-dimensional
completed scattering, which gives an individual description of the transmission
and reflection subprocesses at all stages of scattering. We show that the
group, dwell and Larmor characteristic times, introduced in this model for the
subprocesses, are in a full agreement with special relativity and allow us to
solve the Hartman effect puzzle.
