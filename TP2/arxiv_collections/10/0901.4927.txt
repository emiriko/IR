Recent developments on the MicroMegas prototypes built by use of the bulk
technology with analog and digital readout electronics are presented. The main
test beam results of a stack of several MicroMegas prototypes fully comply with
the needs of a hadronic calorimeter for future particle physics experiments. A
technical solution for a large scale prototype is also introduced.
