Information on Lambda-7Li, Lambda-9Be, Lambda-10B, Lambda-11B, Lambda-12C,
Lambda-15N, and Lambda-16O from the Ge detector array Hyperball is interpreted
in terms of shell-model calculations that include both Lambda and Sigma
configurations with p-shell cores. It is shown that the data puts strong
constraints on the effective Lambda-N interaction.
