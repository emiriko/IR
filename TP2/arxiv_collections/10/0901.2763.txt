Large transverse single-spin asymmetries, A_{N}, have been observed in
forward hadron production at RHIC. STAR has reported precision measurements of
the x_{F}-p_{T} dependence of A_{N} for forward pi^0 production. Contrary to
expectation, the asymmetry does not fall with p_{T}. However, questions remain
about the trend at the lower end of the studied range, p_{T}~1 GeV/c. Analysis
of data from the 2008 RHIC run has extended the pi^0 data in the x_{F} > 0.4,
low p_{T} region. Preliminary results are reported.
