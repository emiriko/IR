When a plane electromagnetic wave in air falls on a flat dielectric boundary,
the dielectric body is pulled toward the air as predicted by Poynting a century
ago. According to Noether's theorem, the momentum in the direction parallel to
the boundary must be conserved among the incident, reflected and transmitted
waves. This uniquely determines the expression for the wave momentum in the
dielectric medium which agrees with the Minkowski form. The inward force
recently predicted and accompanied by Abraham's momentum are not consistent
with Fresnel's formulae and basic symmetry principles.
