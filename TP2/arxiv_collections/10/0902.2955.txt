We studied the energy levels of graphene based Andreev billiards consisting
of a superconductor region on top of a monolayer graphene sheet. For the case
of Andreev retro-reflection we show that the graphene based Andreev billiard
can be mapped to the normal metal-superconducting billiards with the same
geometry. We also derived a semiclassical quantization rule in graphene based
Andreev billiards. The exact and the semiclassically obtained spectrum agree
very well both for the case of Andreev retro-reflection and specular Andreev
reflection.
