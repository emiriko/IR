Since their advent, Parity Violating experiments have played a crucial role
in testing the standard model (SM) of electroweak interactions. In recent
years, these experiments have reached such a high degree of accuracy that they
might test for physics beyond the SM. When making high precision measurements,
a recurrent problem is how to properly include hadronic corrections. In this
study we consider possible hadronic effects that appear in such experiments.
These hadronic effects include, but are not limited to, sea quarks,
perturbative QCD, target mass and higher twist corrections.
