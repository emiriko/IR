We consider the self-energy and the self-force for scalar massive and
massless particles at rest in the wormhole space-time. We develop a general
approach to obtain the self-force and apply it to the two specific profiles of
the wormhole throat, namely, with singular and with smooth curvature. We found
that the self-force changes its sign at the point where nonminimal coupling
$\xi = 1/8$ (for massless case) and it tends to infinity for specific values of
$\xi$. It may be attractive as well repulsive depending on the profile of the
throat. For massless particle and minimal coupling case the electromagnetic
results are recovered.
