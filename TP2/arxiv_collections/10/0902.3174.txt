This thesis is based on observations performed at the Vacuum Tower Telescope
(Tenerife). We have used an infrared spectropolarimeter (TIP) and a Fabry-Perot
spectrometer (G-FPI) from years 2004 to 2006. We have applied several imaging
speckle reconstruction techniques, and compared them. We have studied
chromospheric dynamics inside the solar disc and at the limb using H\alpha with
very high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution. Keywords (see full
abstract for details): fibrils, surge, MHD waves, speckle, blind deconvolution,
Fabry-Perot, mini-flares, cloud model, spicules in Halpha, spicules continuing
on the disc) Using He I 10830 we studied the offlimb spicular spectral I
profiles with height over the limb. The analysis shows the variation of the
off-limb emission profiles as a function of the distance to the visible solar
limb. The intensity ratio of the multiplet (which is related to the optical
thickness and coronal irradiation) is studied and compared with standard
atmospheric models. We report observational properties from high-resolution
filtergrams in the H$\alpha$ spectral line taken with the G-FPI. We find that
spicules can reach heights of 8 Mm above the limb. We show that spicules
outside the limb continue as dark fibrils inside the disc.
