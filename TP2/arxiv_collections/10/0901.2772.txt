We report observation of reverse Doppler effect in a double negative acoustic
metamaterial. The metamaterial exhibited negative phase velocity and positive
group velocity. The dispersion relation is such that the wavelength
corresponding to higher frequency is longer. We observed that the frequency was
down-shifted for the approaching source, and up-shifted when the source
receded.
