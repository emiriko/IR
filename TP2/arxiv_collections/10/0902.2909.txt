The hodographs of magnetization of nonlinear nuclear magnetic resonance are
investigated in the conditions of resonance on the unshifted frequency. It is
shown that, depending on the value of amplitude of the variable field and value
of frequency shift, topologically different hodographs separated from each
other by separatrix are obtained.
