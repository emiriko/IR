Recent progress in numerical relativity now allows computation of the binary
black hole merger, whereas post-Newtonian and perturbative techniques can be
used to model the inspiral and ringdown phases. So far, most gravitational-wave
searches have made use of various post-Newtonian-inspired templates to search
for signals arising from the coalescence of compact binary objects. Ajith et al
have produced hybrid waveforms for non-spinning binary black-hole systems which
include the three stages of the coalescence process, and constructed from them
phenomenological templates which capture the features of these waveforms in a
parametrized form. As a first step towards extending the present inspiral
searches to higher-mass binary black-hole systems, we have used these
phenomenological waveforms in a search for numerically-simulated signals
injected into synthetic LIGO data as part of the NINJA project.
