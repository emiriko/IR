Using the Multislit Imaging Spectroscopy (MSIS) technique at the FORS2
spectrograph on VLT-UT1, we have identified 60 Intracluster Planetary Nebula
(ICPN) candidates associated with the Intracluster Light (ICL) in the central
region of the Hydra I cluster. Hydra I is a medium compact, relatively near
(~50 Mpc), rich cluster in the southern hemisphere. Here we describe the
criteria used to select emission sources and present the evidence for these PN
candidates to be associated with the ICL in the Hydra I cluster. We also show,
using the luminosity-specific planetary nebulae number, the alpha parameter,
that the expected number of PNs associated with the stellar population of the
central cD galaxy NGC 3311 in the cluster is close to the number of PNs
detected.
