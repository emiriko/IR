Nowadays the sector decomposition technique, which can isolate divergences
from parametric representations of integrals, becomes a quite useful tool for
numerical evaluations of the Feynman loop integrals. It is used to verify the
analytical results of multi-loop integrals in the Euclidean region, or in some
cases practically used in the physical region by combining with other methods
handling the threshold. In an intermediate stage of the sector decomposition
for the multi-loop integrals, one often has to handle enormously large
expressions containing tons of terms. The symbolic manipulation system FORM is
originally designed to treat such huge expressions and has a strong advantage
for it. In this talk, the implementation of the sector decomposition algorithm
on FORM is discussed. A number of concrete examples including cases of
multi-loop diagrams are also shown.
