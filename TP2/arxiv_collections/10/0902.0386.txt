Stellar feedback in galactic bulges plays an essential role in shaping the
evolution of galaxies. To quantify this role and facilitate comparisons with
X-ray observations, we conduct 3D hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive
mesh refinement code, FLASH, to investigate the physical properties of hot gas
inside a galactic bulge, similar to that of our Galaxy or M31. We assume that
the dynamical and thermal properties of the hot gas are dominated by mechanical
energy input from SNe, primarily Type Ia, and mass injection from evolved stars
as well as iron enrichment from SNe. We study the bulge-wide outflow as well as
the SN heating on scales down to ~4 pc. An embedding scheme that is devised to
plant individual SNR seeds, allows to examine, for the first time, the effect
of sporadic SNe on the density, temperature, and iron ejecta distribution of
the hot gas as well as the resultant X-ray morphology and spectrum. We find
that the SNe produce a bulge wind with highly filamentary density structures
and patchy ejecta. Compared with a 1D spherical wind model, the non-uniformity
of simulated gas density, temperature, and metallicity substantially alters the
spectral shape and increases the diffuse X-ray luminosity. The differential
emission measure as a function of temperature of the simulated gas exhibits a
log-normal distribution, with a peak value much lower than that of the
corresponding 1D model. The bulk of the X-ray emission comes from the
relatively low temperature and low abundance gas shells associated with SN
blastwaves. SN ejecta are not well mixed with the ambient medium, at least in
the bulge region. These results, at least partly, account for the apparent lack
of evidence for iron enrichment in the soft X-ray-emitting gas in galactic
bulges and intermediate-mass elliptical galaxies.[...]
