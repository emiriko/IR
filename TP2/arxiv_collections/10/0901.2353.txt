A recent investigation has led to the possibility of the existence of an
interesting region of the asymptotic quasinormal mode spectrum of
Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter black holes. In this asymptotic region, the real
part of quasinormal mode frequencies approaches infinity while the damping rate
approaches a finite value. These quasinormal mode frequencies were calculated
using an analytic technique based on the complex coordinate WKB method. In this
paper, we use a different analytic technique to calculate such quasinormal mode
frequencies. The results of this paper provide further support of the
possibility of the existence of these modes.
