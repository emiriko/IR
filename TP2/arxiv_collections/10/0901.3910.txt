Metabolic pathways describe chains of enzymatic reactions. Their modelling is
a key point to understand living systems. An enzymatic reaction is an
interaction between one or several metabolites (substrates) and an enzyme
(simple protein or enzymatic complex build of several subunits). In our
Mitochondria in Silico Project, MitoScop, we study the metabolism of the
mitochondria, an intra-cellular organelle. Many ordinary differential equation
models are available in the literature. They well fit experimental results on
flux values inside the metabolic pathways, but many parameters are di$\pm$cult
to transcribe with such models: localization of enzymes, rules about the
reactions scheduler, etc Moreover, a model of a significant part of
mitochondrial metabolism could become very complex and contain more than 50
equations. In this context, the multi-agents systems appear as an alternative
to model the metabolic pathways. Firstly, we have looked after membrane design.
The mitochondria is a particular case because the inner mitochondrial space, ie
matricial space, is delimited by two membranes: the inner and the outer one. In
addition to matricial enzymes, other enzymes are located inside the membranes
or in the inter-membrane space. Analysis of mitochondrial metabolism must take
into account this kind of architecture.
