The physics programme of the ILC requires polarimetry with yet unprecedented
precision. This note focusses on aspects of the upstream polarimeter as
described in the ILC Reference Design Report which are not compatible with the
extraordinary precision goals. In conclusion, recommendations for improving the
design are given.
