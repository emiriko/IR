A recently reported phase sensitive Brillouin light scattering technique is
improved by use of a magnetic modulator. This modulator is based on Brillouin
light scattering in a thin ferrite film. Using this magnetic modulator in time-
and space Brillouin light scattering measurements we have increased phase
contrast and excluded influence of optical inhomogeneities in the sample. We
also demonstrate that the quality of the resulting interference patterns can be
improved by data postprocessing using the simultaneously recorded information
about the reference light.
