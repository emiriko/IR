In this work we study a state which is a random mixture of a two qubit
subsystem of a $N$-qubit W state and GHZ state. We analyze several
possibilities like separability criterion (Peres-Horodecki criterion [14,15]),
non violation of Bell's inequality [6]($M(\rho)<1$)and teleportation fidelity
[1,2,3,4] ($(F_{max}>{2/3})$) for this state. We also obtain a relationship
between $N$ (number of qubits) and $p$ (the classical probability of random
mixture) for each of these possibilities. Finally we present a detailed
analysis of all these possibilities for $N=3,4,5$ qubit systems. We also report
that for N=3 and $p\in(.75,1]$, this entangled state can be used as a
teleportation channel without violating Bell's inequality.
