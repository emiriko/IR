We study a two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model at a zero temperature with
random local potentials in the presence of either uniform or binary disorder.
Many low-energy metastable configurations are found with virtually the same
energy as the ground state. These are characterized by the same blotchy pattern
of the, in principle, complex nonzero local order parameter as the ground
state. Yet, unlike the ground state, each island exhibits an overall random
independent phase. The different phases in different coherent islands could
provide a further explanation for the lack of coherence observed in experiments
on Bose glasses.
