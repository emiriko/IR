The X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on the Japanese/USA/UK {\it Hinode (Solar-B)}
spacecraft has detected emission from a quiescent active region core that is
consistent with nanoflare heating. The fluxes from 10 broadband X-ray filters
and filter combinations were used to constructed Differential Emission Measure
(DEM) curves. In addition to the expected active region peak at Log T =
6.3-6.5, we find a high-temperature component with significant emission measure
at Log T $>$ 7.0. This emission measure is weak compared to the main peak --
the DEM is down by almost three orders of magnitude -- which accounts of the
fact that it has not been observed with earlier instruments. It is also
consistent with spectra of quiescent active regions: no Fe XIX lines are
observed in a CHIANTI synthetic spectrum generated using the XRT DEM
distribution. The DEM result is successfully reproduced with a simple
two-component nanoflare model.
