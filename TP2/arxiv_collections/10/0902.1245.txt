We introduce a structure of an infinite-dimensional Frobenius manifold on a
subspace in the space of pairs of functions analytic inside/outside the unit
circle with simple poles at 0/infinity respectively. The dispersionless 2D Toda
equations are embedded into a bigger integrable hierarchy associated with this
Frobenius manifold.
