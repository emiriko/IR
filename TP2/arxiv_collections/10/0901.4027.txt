Accurate measurement of spatially variant noise in dynamic magnetic resonance
(MR) images acquired using parallel imaging methods is problematic. We propose
a new method based on the random matrix theory to accurately assess the noise
level. The method is validated using numerical simulation and in-vivo dynamic
cardiac MR images.
