This paper is dedicated to the identification of decameter-wave sources of
the UTR catalog within declination interval 30deg<delta<40deg. UTR sources are
cross-identified with CATS database catalogs within 40'x40' error boxes. The
sources are deblended using the data on the coordinates of the objects and the
behavior of their continuum radio spectra. The spectra of 876 sources are
derived and fitted by standard analytical functions. Of these sources, 221
objects have straight-line spectra with spectral indices alpha<-1.0. All
objects are catalogued and stored in the CATS database.
