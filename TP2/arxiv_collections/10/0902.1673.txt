We simulate the electron transmission through insulating Mylar (PET)
capillaries. We show that the mechanisms underlying the recently discovered
electron guiding are fundamentally different from those for ion guiding.
Quantum reflection and multiple near-forward scattering rather than the
self-organized charge-up are key to the transmission along the capillary axis
irrespective of the angle of incidence. We find surprisingly good agreement
with recent data. Our simulation suggests that electron guiding should also be
observable for metallic capillaries.
