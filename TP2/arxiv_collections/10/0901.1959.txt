At present, dwarf spheroidal galaxies satellites of the Milky Way may
represent the best astrophysical objects for dark matter (DM) searches with
gamma-ray telescopes. They present the highest mass-to-light ratios known in
the Universe. Furthermore, many of them are near enough from the Earth to be
able to yield high predicted DM annihilation fluxes that might be observed by
current gamma-ray instruments like MAGIC. The picture has become even better
with the recent discovery of new dwarfs. These new objects are expected to
yield even higher DM annihilation fluxes, since most of them are nearer than
the previously known dwarfs and are even more DM dominated systems. Here a
tentative list of the best candidates is given. The observational results
obtained with MAGIC from the Draco dwarf as well as the observation of other
dwarfs carried out by other Cherenkov telescopes are presented as well.
Finally, we discuss the detection prospects of such kind of objects in the
context of DM searches.
