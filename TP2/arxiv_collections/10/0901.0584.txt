We discuss the Monte Carlo method of simulating lattice field theories as a
means of studying the low-energy effective theory of graphene. We also report
on simulational results obtained using the Metropolis and Hybrid Monte Carlo
methods for the chiral condensate, which is the order parameter for the
semimetal-insulator transition in graphene, induced by the Coulomb interaction
between the massless electronic quasiparticles. The critical coupling and the
associated exponents of this transition are determined by means of the
logarithmic derivative of the chiral condensate and an equation-of-state
analysis. A thorough discussion of finite-size effects is given, along with
several tests of our calculational framework. These results strengthen the case
for an insulating phase in suspended graphene, and indicate that the
semimetal-insulator transition is likely to be of second order, though
exhibiting neither classical critical exponents, nor the predicted phenomenon
of Miransky scaling.
