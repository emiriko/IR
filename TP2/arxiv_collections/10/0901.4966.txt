We present a study of the achievable rates for classical information
transmission via a lossy bosonic channel with memory, using homodyne detection.
A comparison with the memoryless case shows that the presence of memory
enhances the bit rate if information is encoded in collective states, i.e.
states which are entangled over different uses of the channel.
