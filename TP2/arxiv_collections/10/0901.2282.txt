Fluctuation relations for the entropy production in non equilibrium
stationary states of Ising models are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations.
Systems in contact with heat baths at two different temperatures or subject to
external driving will be studied. In the first case, by considering different
kinetic rules and couplings with the baths, the behavior of the probability
distributions of the heat exchanged in a time $\tau$ with the thermostats, both
in the disordered and in the low temperature phase, are discussed. The
fluctuation relation is always verified in the large $\tau $ limit and
deviations from linear response theory are observed. Finite-$\tau$ corrections
are shown to obey a scaling behavior. In the other case the system is in
contact with a single heat bath but work is done by shearing it. Also for this
system the statistics collected for the mechanical work shows the validity of
the fluctuation relation and preasymptotic corrections behave analogously to
the case with two baths.
