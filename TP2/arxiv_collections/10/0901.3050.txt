High quality, high resolution X-ray spectra were obtained of Sco X-1 with the
Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on board the XMM-Newton satellite. The
spectrum around the Oxygen K-edge is searched for signatures indicative for
EXAFS. Analysis shows a clear indication for the existence of EXAFS with
photo-electron scattering distances in the absorbing medium in a range which
applies to many solids. When scattering of the photo-electron on Oxygen atoms
is assumed, the Oxygen to Oxygen atom distances found are 2.75 Angstrom. This
fits with distances as found in amorphous water-ice, although water ice is
thought to be an unlikely constituent of the diffuse interstellar clouds which
form the absorbing medium towards Sco X-1
