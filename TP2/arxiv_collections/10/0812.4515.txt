The model is constructed, some features of which comes from quantum thin dust
shells and is, in fact, an extension of the "no hair" property of classical
black hole on a quantum level. It appears that the proposed classical analog of
quantum black hole is heated, the temperature being exactly the Hawking's
temperature.
