The STAR collaboration has reported precision measurements of the transverse
single spin asymmetries for the production of the $\pi^0$ mesons from polarized
proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV. These measurements were obtained
using modular forward detectors. The Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS), covering
a region of $2.5 < \eta < 4.0$, and its engineering prototype, provide
increased acceptance, as needed for spin-dependent correlation studies that
could disentangle contributions to the forward \$pi^0$ asymmetries. We report
on the status of the analysis.
