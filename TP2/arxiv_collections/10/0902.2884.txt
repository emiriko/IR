In this work we investigate the complex Leibniz superalgebras with
characteristic sequence $(n_1,...,n_k|m)$ and nilindex n+m, where
$n=n_1+...+n_k,$ n and m (m is not equal to zero) are dimensions of even and
odd parts, respectively. Such superalgebras with condition n_1 > n-2 were
classified in \cite{FilSup}--\cite{C-G-O-Kh}. Here we prove that in the case
$n_1 < n-1$ the Leibniz superalgebras have nilindex less than $n+m.$ Thus, we
get the classification of Leibniz superalgebras with characteristic sequence
$(n_1, ...,n_k|m)$ and nilindex n+m.
