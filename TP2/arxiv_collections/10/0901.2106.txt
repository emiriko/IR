In his contribution to the Baker's Garden book, Faltings gives a family of
examples of irreducible divisors $D$ on $\Bbb P^2$ for which $\Bbb P^2\setminus
D$ has only finitely many integral points over any given localization of a
number ring away from finitely many places. He also notes that neither $\Bbb
P^2\setminus D$ nor the \'etale covers used in his proof embed into semiabelian
varieties, so his examples do not easily reduce to known results about such
subvarieties. In this note, we show how Faltings' results follow directly from
a theorem of Evertse and Ferretti; hence these examples can be explained by
noting that if one pulls back to a cover of $\Bbb P^2$ \'etale outside of $D$
and then adds components to the pull-back of $D$ then one can embed the
complement into a semiabelian variety and obtain useful diophantine
approximation results for the original divisor $D$.
