Despite some success in explaining the observed polarisation angle swing of
radio pulsars within the geometric rotating vector model, many deviations from
the expected S-like swing are observed. In this paper we provide a simple and
credible explanation of these variations based on a combination of the rotating
vector model, intrinsic orthogonally polarized propagation modes within the
pulsar magnetosphere and the effects of interstellar scattering. We use
simulations to explore the range of phenomena that may arise from this
combination, and briefly discuss the possibilities of determining the
parameters of scattering in an effort to understand the intrinsic pulsar
polarization.
