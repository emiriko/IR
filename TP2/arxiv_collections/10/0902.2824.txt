We present a geometric study of the radio and gamma-ray pulsar B1055-52 based
on recent observations at the Parkes radio telescope. We conclude that the
pulsar's magnetic axis is inclined at an angle of 75 degrees to its rotation
axis and that both its radio main pulse and interpulse are emitted at the same
height above their respective poles. This height is unlikely to be higher or
much lower than 700 km, a typical value for radio pulsars.
  It is argued that the radio interpulse arises from emission formed on open
fieldlines close to the magnetic axis which do not pass through the
magnetosphere's null (zero-charge) surface. However the main pulse emission
must originate from fieldlines lying well outside the polar cap boundary beyond
the null surface, and farther away from the magnetic axis than those of the
outergap region where the single gamma-ray peak is generated. This casts doubt
on the common assumption that all pulsars have closed, quiescent, corotating
regions stretching to the light cylinder.
