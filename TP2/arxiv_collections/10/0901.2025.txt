A framework for the investigation of disordered quantum systems in thermal
equilibrium is proposed. The approach is based on a dynamical model--which
consists of a combination of a double-bracket gradient flow and a uniform
Brownian fluctuation--that `equilibrates' the Hamiltonian into a canonical
distribution. The resulting equilibrium state is used to calculate quenched and
annealed averages of quantum observables.
