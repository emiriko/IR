We present the results of spectroscopic and morphological studies of the
galaxy UGC7388 with the 8.1-m Gemini North telescope. Judging by its observed
characteristics, UGC7388 is a giant late-type spiral galaxy seen almost
edge-on. The main body of the galaxy is surrounded by two faint (\mu(B) ~ 24
and \mu(B) ~ 25.5) extended (~20-30 kpc) loop-like structures. A large-scale
rotation of the brighter loop about the main galaxy has been detected. We
discuss the assumption that the tidal disruption of a relatively massive
companion is observed in the case of UGC7388. A detailed study and modeling of
the observed structure of this unique galaxy can give important information
about the influence of the absorption of massive companions on the galactic
disks and about the structure of the dark halo around UGC7388.
