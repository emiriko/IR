Electrical resistivities, Hall coefficients and thermoelectric powers have
been measured for polycrystalline samples of LaFe1-yCoyAsO1-xFx (x=0.11) with
various values of y. The results show that there exists clear distinction of
these transport behaviors between the superconducting and nonsuperconducting
metallic regions of y divided by the boundary value yc~0.05. We have found that
the behaviors in both regions are very similar to those of high-Tc Cu oxides in
the corresponding phases. If they reflect, as in the case of Cu oxides, effects
of strong magnetic fluctuations, the energy scale of the fluctuations is
considered to be smaller than that of the high Cu oxides by a factor of ~1/2.
Arguments on the electronic nature and superconducting symmetry are presented
on the basis of the observed small rate of the Tc suppression rate by the Co
doping.
