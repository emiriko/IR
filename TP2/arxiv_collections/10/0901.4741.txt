We report on studies of vertically interconnected electronics (3D) performed
by the Fermilab pixel group over the past two years. These studies include
exploration of interconnect technology, backside thinning and laser annealing,
the production of the first 3D chip for particle physics, the VIP, and plans
for a commercial two-tier 3D fabrication run.
