We present several recent results concerning the transition between quantum
and classical mechanics, in the situation where the underlying dynamical system
has an hyperbolic behaviour. The special role of invariant manifolds will be
emphasized, and the long time evolution will show how the quantum
non-determinism and the classical chaotic sensitivity to initial conditions can
be compared, and in a certain sense overlap.
