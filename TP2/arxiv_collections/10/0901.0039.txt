The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation perturbed by a multiplicative
space-dependent noise is considered for a ferromagnet filling a bounded
three-dimensional domain. We show the existence of weak martingale solutions
taking values in a sphere $\mathbb S^2$. The regularity of weak solutions is
also discussed. Some of the regularity results are new even for the
deterministic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.
