Four-terminal resistance measurements have been carried out on Zn nanowires
formed using electron-beam lithography. When driven resistive by current, these
wires re-enter the superconducting state upon application of small magnetic
fields. The data are qualitatively different from those of previous experiments
on superconducting nanowires, which revealed either negative magnetoresistance
near T_{c} or magnetic field enhanced critical currents. We suggest that our
observations are associated with the damping of phase slip processes by the
enhancement of dissipation by the quasiparticle conductance channel resulting
from the application of a magnetic field.
