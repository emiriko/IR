Inconsistency between rigid rotator and bound state models at arbitrary
number of colors, rigid rotator -- soft rotator dilemma and some other problems
of baryon spectroscopy are discussed in the framework of the chiral soliton
approach (CSA). Consequences of the comparison of CSA results with simple quark
models are considered and the $1/N_c$ expansion for the effective strange
antiquark mass is presented, as it follows from the CSA. Strong dependence of
the effective strange antiquark mass on the SU(3) multiplet is required to fit
the CSA predictions. The difference of `good' and `bad' diquark masses, which
is about 100 Mev, is in reasonable agreement with other estimates. Multibaryons
(hypernuclei) with strangeness are described and some states of interest are
predicted within CSA as well.
