A review of high-pressure studies on Fe-pnictide superconductors is given.
The pressure effects on the magnetic and superconducting transitions are
discussed for different classes of doped and undoped FeAs-compounds, ROFeAs (R
= rare earth), AeFe2As2 (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba), and AFeAs (A = Li, Na). Pressure
tends to decrease the magnetic transition temperature in the undoped or only
slightly doped compounds. The superconducting Tc increases with pressure for
underdoped FeAs-pnictides, remains approximately constant for optimal doping,
and decreases linearly in the overdoped range. The undoped LaOFeAs and AeFe2As2
become superconducting under pressure although nonhydrostatic pressure
conditions seem to play a role in CaFe2As2. The superconductivity in the
(undoped) AFeAs is explained as a chemical pressure effect due to the volume
contraction caused by the small ionic size of the A-elements. The binary FeSe
shows the largest pressure coefficient of Tc in the Se-deficient
superconducting phase.
