Various integrable geodesic flows on Lie groups are shown to arise by taking
moments of a geodesic Vlasov equation on the group of canonical
transformations. This was already known for both the one- and two-component
Camassa-Holm systems. The present paper extends our earlier work to recover
another integrable system of ODE's that was recently introduced by Bloch and
Iserles. Solutions of the Bloch-Iserles system are found to arise from the
Klimontovich solution of the geodesic Vlasov equation. These solutions are
shown to form one of the legs of a dual pair of momentum maps. The Lie-Poisson
structures for the dynamics of truncated moment hierarchies are also presented
in this context.
