Results are reported on the measurement of the atmospheric neutrino-induced
muon flux at a depth of 2 kilometers below the Earth's surface from 1229 days
of operation of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO). By measuring the flux
of through-going muons as a function of zenith angle, the SNO experiment can
distinguish between the oscillated and un-oscillated portion of the neutrino
flux. A total of 514 muon-like events are measured between $-1 \le
\cos{\theta}_{\rm zenith} \le 0.4$ in a total exposure of 2.30\times 10^{14}$
cm$^{2}$ s. The measured flux normalization is $1.22 \pm 0.09$ times the Bartol
three-dimensional flux prediction. This is the first measurement of the
neutrino-induced flux where neutrino oscillations are minimized. The zenith
distribution is consistent with previously measured atmospheric neutrino
oscillation parameters. The cosmic ray muon flux at SNO with zenith angle
$\cos{\theta}_{\rm zenith} > 0.4$ is measured to be $(3.31 \pm 0.01 {\rm
(stat.)} \pm 0.09 {\rm (sys.)}) \times 10^{-10}~\mu$/s/cm$^{2}$.
