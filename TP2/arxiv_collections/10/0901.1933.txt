We study the effects of interference on the quenching dynamics of a
one-dimensional spin 1/2 $XY$ model in the presence of a transverse field
($h(t)$) which varies sinusoidally with time as $h = h_0\cos{\omega t}$, with
$|t| \leq t_f = \pi/\omega$. We also consider the situation where the magnetic
field consists of an oscillatory as well as a linearly varying component, i.e.,
$h(t) = h_0\cos{\omega t} + t/\tau$. Our purpose is to estimate the defect
density and the local entropy density in the final state if the system is
initially prepared in its ground state. For a single crossing through the
quantum critical point with $h = h_0\cos{\omega t}$, the density of defects in
the final state is calculated by mapping the dynamics to an equivalent Landau
Zener problem by linearizing near the crossing point, and is found to vary as
$\sqrt{\omega}$ in the limit of small $\omega$. On the other hand, the local
entropy density is found to attain a maximum as a function of $\omega$ near a
characteristic scale $\omega_0$. Extending to the situation of multiple
crossings, we show that the non-trivial interference effects of certain
resonance modes solely contribute to the production of defects. Kink density as
well as the diagonal entropy density show oscillatory dependence on the number
of full cycles of oscillation. Finally, the inclusion of a linear term in the
transverse field on top of the oscillatory component, results to a kink density
which decreases continuously with $\tau$ and $\omega$. The entropy density
shows monotonous growth with both $\tau$ and $\omega$, in sharp contrast to the
situations studied earlier. We do also propose appropriate scaling relations
for the defect density in above situations and compare the results with the
numerical results obtained by integrating the Schrodinger equations.
