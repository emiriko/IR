We review the current status of Andreev reflection spectroscopy on the heavy
fermions, mostly focusing on the case of CeCoIn$_5$, a heavy-fermion
superconductor with a critical temperature of 2.3 K. This is a well-established
technique to investigate superconducting order parameters via measurements of
the differential conductance from nanoscale metallic junctions. Andreev
reflection is clearly observed in CeCoIn$_5$ as in other heavy-fermion
superconductors. The measured Andreev signal is highly reduced to the order of
maximum $\sim$ 13% compared to the theoretically predicted value (100%).
Analysis of the conductance spectra using the extended BTK model provides a
qualitative measure for the superconducting order parameter symmetry, which is
determined to be $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave in CeCoIn$_5$. A phenomenological model is
proposed employing a Fano interference effect between two conductance channels
in order to explain both the conductance asymmetry and the reduced Andreev
signal. This model appears plausible not only because it provides good fits to
the data but also because it is highly likely that the electrical conduction
occurs via two channels, one into the heavy electron liquid and the other into
the conduction electron continuum. Further experimental and theoretical
investigations will shed new light on the mechanism of how the coherent
heavy-electron liquid emerges out of the Kondo lattice, a prototypical strongly
correlated electron system. Unresolved issues and future directions are also
discussed.
