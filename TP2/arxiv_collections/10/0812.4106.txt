We consider a two-chain, spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder in
an external magnetic field H. The spin ladder is known to undergo second order
quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at two critical values, Hc1 and Hc2, of the
magnetic field. There are now known examples of strongly coupled (rung exchange
interaction much stronger than nearest-neighbour intrachain exchange
interaction) organic ladder compounds in which QPTs have been experimentally
observed. In this paper, we investigate whether well-known bipartite
entanglement meaures like one-site von Neumann entropy, two-site von Neumann
entropy and concurrence develop special features close to the quantum critical
points. As suggested by an earlier theorem, the first derivatives of the
measures with respect to magnetic field are expected to diverge as H tends to
Hc1 and Hc2. Based on numerical diagonalization data and a mapping of the
strongly-coupled ladder Hamiltonian onto the XXZ chain Hamiltonian, for which
several analytical results are known, we find that the derivatives of the
entanglement measures diverge as H tends to Hc2 but remain finite as H tend to
Hc1. The reason for this discrepancy is analysed. We further calculate two
recently proposed quantum information theoretic measures, the reduced fidelity
and reduced fidelity susceptibility, and show that these measures provide
appropriate signatures of the QPTs occuring at the critical points H=Hc1 and
H=Hc2.
