We simulated the creep motions of flux lines subject to randomly distributed
point-like pinning centers. It is found that at low temperatures, the pinning
barrier $U$ defined in the Arrhenius-type $v-F$ characteristics increases with
decreasing force $U(F) \propto F^{-\mu}$, as predicted by previous theories.
The exponent $\mu$ is evaluated as $0.28\pm 0.02 $ for the vortex glass and
$\mu\simeq 0.5\pm 0.02$ for the Bragg glass (BrG). The latter is in good
agreement with the prediction by the scaling theory and the
functional-renormalization-group theory on creep, while the former is a new
estimate. Within BrG, we find that the pinning barrier is suppressed when
temperature is lifted to approximately half of the melting temperature.
Characterizations of this new transition at equilibrium are also presented,
indicative of a phase transition associated with the replica-symmetry breaking.
