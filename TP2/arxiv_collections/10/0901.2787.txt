The normal state of the iron arsenides shows the poor metallic behavior mixed
with strong magnetic fluctuations. In particular, some FeAs-1111 and FeAs-122
compounds show the linear-T dependence of susceptibility above the spin-density
wave (SDW) transition and the logarithmic upturn of resistivity at low
temperatures. We suggest that this is due to the spin-flip scattering between
the charge carriers and the local moments in the undoped FeAs layer where Kondo
effect coexists with the SDW. This scenario is also accounted for the change of
the magnetoresistance from positive to negative in the Sr3Sc2O5Fe2As2 compound.
