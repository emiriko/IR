The recent years have seen the emergence of diseases which have spread very
quickly all around the world either through human travels like SARS or animal
migration like avian flu. Among the biggest challenges raised by infectious
emerging diseases, one is related to the constant mutation of the viruses which
turns them into continuously moving targets for drug and vaccine discovery.
Another challenge is related to the early detection and surveillance of the
diseases as new cases can appear just anywhere due to the globalization of
exchanges and the circulation of people and animals around the earth, as
recently demonstrated by the avian flu epidemics. For 3 years now, a
collaboration of teams in Europe and Asia has been exploring some innovative in
silico approaches to better tackle avian flu taking advantage of the very large
computing resources available on international grid infrastructures. Grids were
used to study the impact of mutations on the effectiveness of existing drugs
against H5N1 and to find potentially new leads active on mutated strains. Grids
allow also the integration of distributed data in a completely secured way. The
paper presents how we are currently exploring how to integrate the existing
data sources towards a global surveillance network for molecular epidemiology.
