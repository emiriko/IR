Quantum interrogation can be used as a basic resource for quantum
information. This paper presents its applications to entanglement creation and
to optical quantum computation. The starting point will be a photon to particle
quantum interrogation CZ gate, from which three families of optical CNOT gates
will be derived. These gates are nondestructive and can work with probabilities
arbitrarily close to 1. A possible experimental implementation with atomic
ensembles is also discussed.
