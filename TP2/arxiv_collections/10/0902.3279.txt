In this research, we derive a simple expression for the ratio of normal state
superconducting state of spin lattice relaxation rate of unconventional
superconductors from the BCS weak-coupling equation. The unconventional
superconductors we consider have three types of order parameters as d-wave, 3He
A-phase and p-wave 3-dimensional order parameter that had been done before by
Parker and Haas[7].After using some numerical approximations and some boundary
conditions, we can find the ratio of normal state to superconducting state of
spin lattice relaxation rate in power series of temperature dependent order
parameters and temperature. Our numerical calculations show the coherence peak
below critical temperature clearly that are consistent with Parker and Haas[7].
These results do not agree with the believed that the coherence peak is the
only property of s-wave superconductor. However from our calculation, we can
conclude that the unconventional superconductors can show the coherence peaks.
