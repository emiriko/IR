Given an asymptotically cylindrical special Lagrangian submanifold L in an
asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau 3-fold X, we determine conditions on a
decay rate gamma which make the moduli space of (local) special Lagrangian
deformations of L in X a smooth manifold and show that it has dimension equal
to the dimension of the image of H^1_{cs}(L,R) in H^1(L,R) under the natural
inclusion map.
