The Dybvig-Ingersoll-Ross (DIR) theorem states that, in arbitrage-free term
structure models, long-term yields and forward rates can never fall. We present
a refined version of the DIR theorem, where we identify the reciprocal of the
maturity date as the maximal order that long-term rates at earlier dates can
dominate long-term rates at later dates. The viability assumption imposed on
the market model is weaker than those appearing previously in the literature.
