We compare two theoretical approaches to the data analysis of the Cassini
relativity experiment based on the Doppler tracking and the time delay
technique that were published correspondingly by Kopeikin et al in Phys. Lett.
A 367, 276 (2007) and by Bertotti et al in Class. Quant. Grav. 25, 045013
(2008). Bertotti et al believed that they found a discrepancy with our paper
and claimed that our analysis was erroneous. The present paper elucidates,
however, that the discrepancy is illusory and does not exist. The two
techniques give the same result making it evident that the numerical value of
the PPN parameter 'gamma' measured in the Cassini experiment is indeed affected
by the orbital motion of the Sun around the barycenter of the solar system.
