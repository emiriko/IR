Solovay proved that there exists a computable upper bound f of the
prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity function K such that f (x) = K(x) for
infinitely many x. In this paper, we consider the class of computable functions
f such that K(x) <= f (x)+O(1) for all x and f (x) <= K(x) + O(1) for
infinitely many x, which we call Solovay functions. We show that Solovay
functions present interesting connections with randomness notions such as
Martin-L\"of randomness and K-triviality.
