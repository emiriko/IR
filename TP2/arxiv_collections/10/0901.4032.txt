When neglecting capillarity, two-phase incompressible flow in porous media is
modelled as a scalar nonlinear hyperbolic conservation law. A change in the
rock type results in a change of the flux function. Discretizing in
one-dimensional with a finite volume method, we investigate two numerical
fluxes, an extension of the Godunov flux and the upstream mobility flux, the
latter being widely used in hydrogeology and petroleum engineering. Then, in
the case of a changing rock type, one can give examples when the upstream
mobility flux does not give the right answer.
