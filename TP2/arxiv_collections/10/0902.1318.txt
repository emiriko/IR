Many studies investigated the application of statistical mechanics to damage
phenomena. However, so far the association of damage with statistical mechanics
is far from completely developed. One of the most successful approaches maps
the strength elements onto the spins of a lattice. This allows applying the
formalism extensively developed for spin systems to damage phenomena. To
improve the model the interactions of spins at the crack tips are introduced.
Further, statistical mechanics of the model is developed for different external
boundary constraints.
