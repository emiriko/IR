We show that the single emitter linewidth underlying a broadened ensemble
emission spectrum can be extracted from correlations among the stochastic
intensity fluctuations in the ensemble spectrum. Spectral correlations can be
observed at high temporal and spectral resolutions with a cross-correlated pair
of avalanche photodiodes placed at the outputs of a scanning Michelson
interferometer. As illustrated with simulations in conjunction with
Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy, our approach overcomes ensemble and
temporal inhomogeneous broadening to provide single emitter linewidths, even
for emitters under weak, continuous, broadband excitation.
