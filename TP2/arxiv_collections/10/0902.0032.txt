We present a model for the origin of gravity, dark energy and dark matter:
Dark energy and dark matter are residual pre-inflation false vacuum random zero
point energy (w=-1) of large-scale negative, and short-scale positive pressure,
respectively, corresponding to the "zero point" (incoherent) component of a
superfluid (supersolid) ground state. Gravity, in contrast, arises from the 2nd
order topological defects in the post-inflation virtual "condensate" (coherent)
component. We predict, as a consequence, that the LHC will never detect exotic
real on-mass-shell particles that can explain dark matter. We also point out
that the future holographic dark energy de Sitter horizon is a total absorber
(in the sense of retro-causal Wheeler-Feynman action-at-a-distance
electrodynamics) because it is an infinite redshift surface for static
detectors. Therefore, the advanced Hawking-Unruh thermal radiation from the
future de Sitter horizon is a candidate for the negative pressure dark vacuum
energy.
