We present uSR investigations on SmFeAsO_1-xF_x showing coexistence of
magnetic order and superconductivity only in a very narrow F-doping range. The
sharp crossover between the two types of order is similar to that observed in
LaFeAsO_1-xF_x, suggesting a common behavior for the 1111 pnictides. The
analysis of the muon asymmetry demonstrates that the coexistence must be
nanoscopic, i.e. the two phases must be finely interspersed over a typical
length-scale of few nm. In this regime both the magnetic and the
superconducting transition temperatures collapse to very low values. Our data
suggest a competition between the two order parameters
