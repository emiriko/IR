We present for the first time time-dependent density-matrix
renormalization-group simulations (t-DMRG) at finite temperatures. It is
demonstrated how a combination of finite-temperature t-DMRG and time-series
prediction allows for an easy and very accurate calculation of spectral
functions in one-dimensional quantum systems, irrespective of their statistics,
for arbitrary temperatures. This is illustrated with spin structure factors of
XX and XXX spin-1/2 chains. For the XX model we can compare against an exact
solution and for the XXX model (Heisenberg antiferromagnet) against a Bethe
Ansatz solution and quantum Monte Carlo data.
