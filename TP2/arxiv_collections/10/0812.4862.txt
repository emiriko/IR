We demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D) arrays of coupled quantum dots (QDs)
with six-fold degenerate p orbitals can display bistable states, suitable for
application in high-density memory device with low power consumption. Due to
the inter-dot coupling of $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals in these QD arrays, two
dimensional conduction bands can be formed in the x-y plane, while the $p_z$
orbitals remain localized in the x-y plane such that the inter-dot coupling
between them can be neglected. We model such systems by taking into account the
on-site repulsive interactions between electrons in $p_z$ orbitals and the
coupling of the localized $p_z$ orbitals with the 2D conduction bands formed by
$p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals. The Green's function method within an extended
Anderson model is used to calculate the tunneling current through the QDs. We
find that bistable tunneling current can exist for such systems due to the
interplay of the on-site Coulomb interactions (U) between the $p_z$ orbitals
and the delocalized nature of conduction band states derived from the
hybridization of $p_x$ / $p_y$ orbitals. This bistable current is not sensitive
to the detailed band structure of the two dimensional band, but depends
critically on the strength of $U$ and the ratio of the left and right tunneling
rates. The behavior of the electrical bistability can be sustained when the 2D
QD array reduces to a one-dimensional QD array, indicating the feasibility for
high-density packing of these bistable nanoscale structures.
