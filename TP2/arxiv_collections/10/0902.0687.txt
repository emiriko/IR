We study the behavior of the energy fluctuations in the stationary state of a
uniformly heated granular gas. The equation for the one-time two-particle
correlation function is derived and the hydrodynamic eigenvalues are
identified. Explicit predictions are subsequently worked out for energy
fluctuations. The results explain Monte Carlo numerical data reported in
previous studies (P. Visco et al, European Physical Journal B 51, 377 (2006)).
