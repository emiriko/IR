Total (atomic+nuclear) photoabsorption cross section of $^{52}Cr$ was for the
first time measured in the energy range of 8-70 MeV. Experimental data was
produced with small statistic and systematic errors. The results deviate from
calculations of atomic cross section at photon energies above 40 MeV.
Photonuclear cross section in the region of the E1 giant dipole resonance (GDR)
clearly exhibits three peaks at 18.9, 20.9 and 23.1 MeV. At higher energies,
the measured cross section hints a dip-peak structure at 40-48 MeV.
