We consider supernova SN1987A to find bounds on parameter of
noncommutativity, $\th_{\mu\nu}$. Right handed neutrino in the noncommutative
standard model, NCSM, can directly couple to the photon and the Z-gauge boson.
Therefore the observed flux of neutrinos from SN1987A can constrain the
strength of the new couplings in the NCSM. We obtain two bounds on the
NC-parameter, $\Lambda_{NC}=1/{\sqrt |\th|} $, with respect to escaping or
trapping of the right handed neutrinos inside the supernova which are
$\Lambda_{NC}\gtrsim 3.7 TeV$ or $\Lambda_{NC}\lesssim 1 TeV$, respectively.
The excluded region $1 TeV\lesssim\Lambda_{NC}\lesssim 3.7 TeV$ for the
NC-parameter is obtained for the first time. In fact $\Lambda_{NC}\lesssim 1
TeV$ is consistent with the existing bounds on $\Lambda_{NC}$ and raises our
hopes to find the NC-effects in the LHC or even in the LEP. Meanwhile
$\Lambda_{NC}\gtrsim 3.7 TeV$ is more stringent than the other bounds obtained
from LEP and LHC considerations. Furthermore, since NC-calculations are
perturbative and are correct only up to the energy scale of the NC-system
$\lesssim\Lambda_{NC} $, therefore these bounds which are obtained from the
energy scale considerably less than the energy scale of LEP and LHC are more
reliable.
