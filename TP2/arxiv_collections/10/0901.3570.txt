Modern pulsar surveys produce many millions of candidate pulsars, far more
than can be individually inspected. Traditional methods for filtering these
candidates, based upon the signal-to-noise ratio of the detection, cannot
easily distinguish between interference signals and pulsars. We have developed
a new method of scoring candidates using a series of heuristics which test for
pulsar-like properties of the signal. This significantly increases the
sensitivity to weak pulsars and pulsars with periods close to interference
signals. By applying this and other techniques for ranking candidates from a
previous processing of the Parkes Multi-beam Pulsar Survey, 28 previously
unknown pulsars have been discovered. These include an eccentric binary system
and a young pulsar which is spatially coincident with a known supernova
remnant.
