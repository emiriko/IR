We derive the effective action for superconducting fluctuations in a
four-band model for pnictides, discussing the emergence of a single critical
mode out of a dominant interband pairing mechanism. We then apply our model to
calculate the paraconductivity in two-dimensional and layered three-dimensional
systems, and compare our results with recent resistivity measurements in
SmFeAsOF
