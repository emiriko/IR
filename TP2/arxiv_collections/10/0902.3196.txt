In our understanding, a mind-map is an adaptive engine that basically works
incrementally on the fundament of existing transactional streams. Generally,
mind-maps consist of symbolic cells that are connected with each other and that
become either stronger or weaker depending on the transactional stream. Based
on the underlying biologic principle, these symbolic cells and their
connections as well may adaptively survive or die, forming different cell
agglomerates of arbitrary size. In this work, we intend to prove mind-maps'
eligibility following diverse application scenarios, for example being an
underlying management system to represent normal and abnormal traffic behaviour
in computer networks, supporting the detection of the user behaviour within
search engines, or being a hidden communication layer for natural language
interaction.
