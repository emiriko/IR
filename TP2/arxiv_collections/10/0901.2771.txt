We propose a transceiver architecture for automatic beamforming and
instantaneous setup of a multigigabit-per-second wireless link between two
millimeter wave radios. The retro-directive architecture eliminates necessity
of slow and complex digital algorithms required for searching and tracking the
directions of opposite end radios. Simulations predict <5 micro-seconds setup
time for a 2-Gbps bidirectional 60-GHz communication link between two 10-meters
apart radios. The radios have 4-element arrayed antennas, and use QPSK
modulation with 1.5 GHz analog bandwidth.
