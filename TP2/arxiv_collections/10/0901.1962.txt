In models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking due to strongly coupled
fourth-family quarks and leptons, their low-energy effective descriptions may
involve multiple composite Higgs fields, leading to a possibility that the
electroweak phase transition at finite temperature is first order due to the
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We examine the behavior of the electroweak phase
transition based on the effective renormalizable Yukawa theory which consists
of the fourth-family quarks and two SU(2)-doublet Higgs fields corresponding to
the bilinear operators of the fourth-family quarks with/without imposing the
compositeness condition. The strength of the first-order phase transition is
estimated by using the finite-temperature effective potential at one-loop with
the ring-improvement. In the Yukawa theory without the compositeness condition,
it is found that there is a parameter region where the first-order phase
transition is strong enough for the electroweak baryogenesis with the
experimentally acceptable Higgs boson and fourth-family quark masses. On the
other hand, when the compositeness condition is imposed, the phase transition
turns out to be weakly first order, or possibly second order, although the
result is rather sensitive to the details of the compositeness condition.
Combining with the result of the Yukawa theory without the compositeness
condition, it is argued that with the fourth-family quark masses in the range
of 330-480 GeV, corresponding to the compositeness scale in the range of
1.0-2.3 TeV, the four-fermion interaction among the fourth-family quarks does
not lead to the strongly first-order electroweak phase transition.
