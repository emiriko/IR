We analyze a ~70 ksec Chandra ACIS-I exposure of the globular cluster Omega
Centauri (NGC 5139). The ~17 amin x 17 amin field of view fully encompasses
three core radii and almost twice the half-mass radius. We detect 180 sources
to a limiting flux of ~4.3x10^-16 erg/cm^2/s (Lx = 1.2x10^30 erg/s at 4.9 kpc).
After accounting for the number of active galactic nuclei and possible
foreground stars, we estimate that 45-70 of the sources are cluster members.
Four of the X-ray sources have previously been identified as compact accreting
binaries in the cluster--three cataclysmic variables (CVs) and one quiescent
neutron star. Correlating the Chandra positions with known variable stars
yields eight matches, of which five are probable cluster members that are
likely to be binary stars with active coronae. Extrapolating these optical
identifications to the remaining unidentified X-ray source population, we
estimate that 20-35 of the sources are CVs and a similar number are active
binaries. This likely represents most of the CVs in the cluster, but only a
small fraction of all the active binaries. We place a 2-sigma upper limit of Lx
< 3x10^30 erg/s on the integrated luminosity of any additional faint,
unresolved population of sources in the core. We explore the significance of
these findings in the context of primordial vs. dynamical channels for CV
formation. The number of CVs per unit mass in Omega Cen is at least 2-3 times
lower than in the field, suggesting that primordial binaries that would
otherwise lead to CVs are being destroyed in the cluster environment.
