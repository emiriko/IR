Two-dimensional (2D) vector matter waves in the form of soliton-vortex and
vortex-vortex pairs are investigated for the case of attractive intracomponent
interaction in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates. Both attractive and
repulsive intercomponent interactions are considered. By means of a linear
stability analysis we show that soliton-vortex pairs can be stable in some
regions of parameters while vortex-vortex pairs turn out to be always unstable.
The results are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the 2D coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations.
