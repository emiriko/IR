We study a model of games that combines concurrency, imperfect information
and stochastic aspects. Those are finite states games in which, at each round,
the two players choose, simultaneously and independently, an action. Then a
successor state is chosen accordingly to some fixed probability distribution
depending on the previous state and on the pair of actions chosen by the
players. Imperfect information is modeled as follows: both players have an
equivalence relation over states and, instead of observing the exact state,
they only know to which equivalence class it belongs. Therefore, if two partial
plays are indistinguishable by some player, he should behave the same in both
of them. We consider reachability (does the play eventually visit a final
state?) and B\"uchi objective (does the play visit infinitely often a final
state?). Our main contribution is to prove that the following problem is
complete for 2-ExpTime: decide whether the first player has a strategy that
ensures her to almost-surely win against any possible strategy of her oponent.
We also characterise those strategies needed by the first player to
almost-surely win.
