In this paper, we investigate the impact in future megaton-scale water
Cherenkov detectors of identifying proton Cherenkov rings. We estimate the
expected event rates for detected neutral current and charged current
quasi-elastic neutrino interactions from atmospheric neutrinos in a
megaton-scale Super-Kamiokande-like detector with both 40% and 20%
photo-cathode coverage. With this sample we examine the prospects for measuring
the neutrino oscillation pattern, and searching for sterile neutrinos. We also
determine the size of selected charged current quasi-elastic samples in a
300-kton fiducial volume Super-Kamiokande-like detector from examples of both
conventional super-beams and beta-beams proposed in the literature. With these
samples, it is shown that full kinematic neutrino reconstruction using the
outgoing proton can improve the reconstructed energy resolution, and give good
neutrino versus anti-neutrino tagging capabilities, adding important
capabilities to water Cherenkov detectors in future projects. We determine the
beam parameters necessary to make use of this technique and present
distributions of neutrino and anti-neutrino selection efficiencies.
