In this paper, a class of combinatorial identities is proved. A method is
used which is based on the following rule: counting elements of a given set in
two ways and making equal the obtained results. This rule is known as "counting
in two ways". The principle of inclusion and exclusion is used for obtaining a
class of (0,1)-matrices.
