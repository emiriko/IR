We report results for $K/\pi$ fluctuations from Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV using the STAR detector at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Our results for $K/\pi$ fluctuations in
central collisions show little dependence on the incident energies studied and
are on the same order as results observed by NA49 at the Super Proton
Synchrotron in central Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 12.3 and 17.3 GeV.
We also report results for the collision centrality dependence of $K/\pi$
fluctuations as well as results for $K^{+}/\pi^{+}$, $K^{-}/\pi^{-}$,
$K^{+}/\pi^{-}$, and $K^{-}/\pi^{+}$ fluctuations. We observe that the $K/\pi$
fluctuations scale with the multiplicity density, $dN/d\eta$, rather than the
number of participating nucleons.
