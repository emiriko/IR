In the relativistic and the nonrelativistic theoretical treatment of moderate
and high-power laser-matter interaction, the generalized Bessel function occurs
naturally when a Schr\"odinger-Volkov and Dirac-Volkov solution is expanded
into plane waves. For the evaluation of cross sections of quantum
electrodynamic processes in a linearly polarized laser field, it is often
necessary to evaluate large arrays of generalized Bessel functions, of
arbitrary index but with fixed arguments. We show that the generalized Bessel
function can be evaluated, in a numerically stable way, by utilizing a
recurrence relation and a normalization condition only, without having to
compute any initial value. We demonstrate the utility of the method by
illustrating the quantum-classical correspondence of the Dirac-Volkov solutions
via numerical calculations.
