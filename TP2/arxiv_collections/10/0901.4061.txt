We report measurements of the longitudinal double spin asymmetry for
inclusive jet production using polarized p+p collisions at sqrt{s} = 200 GeV at
RHIC. Results from the 2005 and 2006 runs are presented. These results set
substantial new constraints on the polarized gluon distribution in the proton
over the kinematic range 0.02 < x< 0.3, when compared to next-to-leading order
global analyses of DIS data. The first measurement of the transverse
single-spin asymmetry for inclusive jets at mid-rapidity is also presented.
