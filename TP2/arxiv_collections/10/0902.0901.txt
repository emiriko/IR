This article presents a unique, large-scale and spatially explicit
microsimulation model that uses official anonymized register data collected
from all individuals living in Sweden. Individuals are connected to households
and workplaces and represent crucial links in the Swedish social contact
network. This enables significant policy experiments in the domain of epidemic
outbreaks. Development of the model started in 2004 at the Swedish Institute
for Infectious Disease Control (SMI) in Solna, Sweden with the goal of creating
a tool for testing the effects of intervention policies. These interventions
include mass vaccination, targeted vaccination, isolation and social
distancing. The model was initially designed for simulating smallpox outbreaks.
In 2006, it was modified to support simulations of pandemic influenza. All nine
millions members of the Swedish population are represented in the model. This
article is a technical description of the simulation model; the input data, the
simulation engine and the basic object types.
