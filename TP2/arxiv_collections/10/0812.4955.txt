We consider the quantum mechanical generalization of Crooks Fluctuation
Theorem and Jarzynski Equality for an open quantum system. The explicit
expression for microscopic work for an arbitrary prescribed protocol is
obtained, and the relation between quantum Crooks Fluctuation Theorem, quantum
Jarzynski Equality and their classical counterparts are clarified. Numerical
simulations based on a two-level toy model are used to demonstrate the validity
of the quantum version of the two theorems beyond linear response theory
regime.
