The phase-field crystal model is by now widely used in order to predict
crystal nucleation and growth. For colloidal solidification with completely
overdamped individual particle motion, we show that the phase-field crystal
dynamics can be derived from the microscopic Smoluchowski equation via
dynamical density functional theory. The different underlying approximations
are discussed. In particular, a variant of the phase-field crystal model is
proposed which involves less approximations than the standard phase-field
crystal model. We finally test the validity of these phase-field crystal models
against dynamical density functional theory. In particular, the velocities of a
linear crystal front from the undercooled melt are compared as a function of
the undercooling for a two-dimensional colloidal suspension of parallel
dipoles. Good agreement is only obtained by a drastic scaling of the free
energies in the phase-field crystal model in order to match the bulk freezing
transition point.
