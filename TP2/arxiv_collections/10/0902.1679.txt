Multilayers of hydrogenated ultrathin (3 nm) amorphous a-Si and a-Ge layers
prepared by sputtering have been studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to check the influence of annealing on
their structural stability. The annealed multilayers exhibit surface and bulk
degradation with formation of bumps and craters whose density and size increase
with increasing hydrogen content and/or annealing temperature and time. Bumps
are due to the formation of H2 bubbles in the multilayer. The craters are bumps
blown up very likely because of too high a gas pressure inside. The release of
H from its bonds to Si and Ge occurs within cavities very likely present in the
samples. The necessary energy is supplied by the heat treatment and by the
recombination of thermally generated carriers. Results by energy filtered TEM
on the interdiffusion of Si and Ge upon annealing are also presented.
