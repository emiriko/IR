We calculate, within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation, the local
density of states for different electron crystals in graphene subject to a
strong magnetic field. We investigate both the Wigner crystal and bubble
crystals with M_e electrons per lattice site. The total density of states
consists of several pronounced peaks, the number of which in the negative
energy range coincides with the number of electrons M_e per lattice site, as
for the case of electron-solid phases in the conventional two-dimensional
electron gas. Analyzing the local density of states at the peak energies, we
find particular scaling properties of the density patterns if one fixes the
ratio nu_N/M_e between the filling factor nu_N of the last partially filled
Landau level and the number of electrons per bubble. Although the total density
profile depends explicitly on M_e, the local density of states of the lowest
peaks turns out to be identical regardless the number of electrons M_e. Whereas
these electron-solid phases are reminiscent to those expected in the
conventional two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs heterostructures in the
quantum Hall regime, the local density of states and the scaling relations we
highlight in this paper may be, in graphene, directly measured by spectroscopic
means, such as e.g. scanning tunneling microscopy.
