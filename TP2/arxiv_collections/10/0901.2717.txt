We investigate the spatial asymptotics of decaying solutions of the Toda
hierarchy and show that the asymptotic behaviour is preserved by the time
evolution. In particular, we show that the leading asymptotic term is time
independent. Moreover, we establish infinite propagation speed for the Toda
lattice.
