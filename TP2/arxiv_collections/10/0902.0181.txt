This brief note speculates that the recently reported residual CMB signal
[Seiffert et al 2009] may originate within the Sun's heliosheath. A temperature
spectrum function is derived that has the same power law form as the fitted
function in Seiffert et al. In particular a spectral index of +2 is implied. An
optically thin radiating shell of thickness ~1AU could match the required 1K
deg power law amplitude. A possible mechanism for the heliosheath magnetic
fields is discussed based on Alfven's heliospheric current model with embedded
double layers as the energy source for the relativistic electrons.
