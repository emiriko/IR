We will outline novel approaches to derive model invariants for hidden Markov
and related models. These approaches are based on a theoretical framework that
arises from viewing random processes as elements of the vector space of string
functions. Theorems available from that framework then give rise to novel ideas
to obtain model invariants for hidden Markov and related models.
