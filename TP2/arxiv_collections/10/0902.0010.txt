It remains an elusive goal to achieve high performance single-walled carbon
nanotube (SWNTs) field effect transistors (FETs) comprised of only single
chirality SWNTs. Many separation mechanisms have been devised and various
degrees of separation demonstrated, yet it is still difficult to reach the goal
of total fractionation of a given nanotube mixture into its single chirality
components. Chromatography has been reported to separate small SWNTs (diameter
less than 0.9nm) according to their diameter, chirality and length. The
separation efficiency decreased with increasing tube diameter by using ssDNA
sequence d(GT)n (n=10-45). Here we report our result on the separation of
single chirality (10,5) SWNTs (diameter = 1.03nm) from HiPco tubes with ion
exchange chromatography. The separation efficiency was improved by using a new
DNA sequence (TTTA)3T which can recognize SWNTs with the specific chirality
(10,5). The chirality of the separated tubes was examined by optical
absorption, Raman, photoluminescence excitation/emission and electrical
transport measurement. All spectroscopic methods gave single peak of (10,5)
tubes. The purity was 99% according to the electrical measurement. The FETs
comprised of separated SWNTs in parallel gave Ion/Ioff ratio up to 106 owning
to the single chirality enriched (10,5) tubes. This is the first time that SWNT
FETs with single chirality SWNTs were achieved. The chromatography method has
the potential to separate even larger diameter semiconducting SWNTs from other
starting material for further improving the performance of the SWNT FETs.
