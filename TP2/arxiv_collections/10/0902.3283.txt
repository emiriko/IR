We add some comments to our old paper \cite{F-U} where the metric tensor was
introduced as the gauge theory of general coordinate transformation. This
formulation is more satisfactorily completed than the original one if it is
required to be valid for arbitrary n dimensional spacetime. That is, our
formulation asserts the presence of extra dimensions positively.
