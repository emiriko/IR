Since the seminal work from F. Cohen in the eighties, abstract virology has
seen the apparition of successive viral models, all based on Turing-equivalent
formalisms. But considering recent malware such as rootkits or k-ary codes,
these viral models only partially cover these evolved threats. The problem is
that Turing-equivalent models do not support interactive computations. New
models have thus appeared, offering support for these evolved malware, but
loosing the unified approach in the way. This article provides a basis for a
unified malware model founded on process algebras and in particular the
Join-Calculus. In terms of expressiveness, the new model supports the
fundamental definitions based on self-replication and adds support for
interactions, concurrency and non-termination allows the definition of more
complex behaviors. Evolved malware such as rootkits can now be thoroughly
modeled. In terms of detection and prevention, the fundamental results of
undecidability and isolation still hold. However the process-based model has
permitted to establish new results: identification of fragments from the
Join-Calculus where malware detection becomes decidable, formal definition of
the non-infection property, approximate solutions to restrict malware
propagation.
