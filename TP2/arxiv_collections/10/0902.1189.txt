The question whether or not the sum of two maximal monotone operators is
maximal monotone under Rockafellar's constraint qualification - that is,
whether or not "the sum theorem" is true - is the most famous open problem in
Monotone Operator Theory. In his 2008 monograph "From Hahn-Banach to
Monotonicity", Stephen Simons asked whether or not the sum theorem holds for
the special case of a maximal monotone linear operator and a normal cone
operator of a closed convex set provided that the interior of the set makes a
nonempty intersection with the domain of the linear operator.
  In this note, we provide an affirmative answer to Simons' question. In fact,
we show that the sum theorem is true for a maximal monotone linear relation and
a normal cone operator. The proof relies on Rockafellar's formula for the
Fenchel conjugate of the sum as well as some results featuring the Fitzpatrick
function.
