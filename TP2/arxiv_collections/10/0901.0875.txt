Momentum space three-body Faddeev-like equations are used to calculate
elastic, transfer and charge exchange reactions resulting from the scattering
of deuterons on 12C and 16O or protons on 13C and 17O; 12C and 16O are treated
as inert cores. All possible reactions are calculated in the framework of the
same model space. Comparison with previous calculations based on approximate
methods used in nuclear reaction theory is discussed.
