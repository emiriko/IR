(Note: this is a shortened version of the original "structured" (A&A format)
abstract.) The 12.81 micrometer [NeII] line has recently gained interest as a
potential tracer of gas in the tenuous surface layers of circumstellar disks.
The line has been detected using the Spitzer Space Telescope in many young
stars, yet these observations neiter spatially nor spectrally resolve the [NeII
emission, leaving the nature of the emission mechanism unclear. Both an origin
in an X-ray irradiated disk surface and an origin in strong, dissociative
shocks have been proposed.
  We have performed a high spatial and spectral resolution (0.4 arcsec,
R=30000) study of the T Tau triplet. This system contains three young stars
with disks, at least one strong X-ray source (T Tau N), and diffuse regions of
shocked gas surrounding the system on a scale of a few arcseconds.
  We find that the dominant component of [NeII] emission is centered on T Tau S
and has a spatial extent of approximately 1.1 arcseconds, which is much larger
than the disks in T Tau S. We detect spatially extended red-shifted emission NW
of the system and fainter blue-shifted emission to the SE, which we associate
with the N-S outflow from T Tau S. Only a small fraction of the [NeII] emission
appears to be directly related to the X-ray bright northern component. We
propose [NeII] emission in jets as a major factor causing the observed large
scatter in the X-ray luminosity vs. [NeII] luminosity relation. We argue that T
Tau S is the driving source of the T Tau "NW-blob"
