We have performed an experimental test under the conditions of which quantum
mechanics predicts a spatially-discontinuous single-particle transport. The
transport is beyond the relativistic paradigm of movement in Cartesian space
and therefore may well be nonlocal. Our test has demonstrated that such
transport does exist. This fact opens the door for realistic interpretation of
quantum mechanics insofar as the requirement of Lorentz invariance appears
inapplicable to any version of quantum theory. Moreover, as quantum mechanics
proposes a particle dynamics beyond the relativity, it automatically requires
an adequate "quantum" concept of spacetime, for which the relativistic concept
is only a limiting case. The quantum concept allows absolute simultaneity and
hence revives the notion of absolute time. It also goes beyond the relativistic
curvilinear Cartesian order of space to account for quantum phenomena such as
the discontinuity and the nonlocality in the spirit of Bohm's concept of the
implicate order.
