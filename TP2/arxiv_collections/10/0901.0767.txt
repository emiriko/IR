The solar tachocline is shown as hydrodynamically stable against
nonaxisymmetric disturbances if it is true that no cos^{4}\theta term exists in
its rotation law. We also show that the toroidal field of 200 Gauss amplitude
which produces the tachocline in the magnetic theory of Ruediger & Kitchatinov
(1997) is stable against nonaxisymmetric MHD disturbances -- but it becomes
unstable for rotation periods slightly slower than 25 days. The instability of
such weak fields lives from the high thermal diffusivity of stellar radiation
zones compared with the magnetic diffusivity. The growth times, however, result
as very long (of order of 10\^5 rotation times). With estimations of the
chemical mixing we find the maximal possible field amplitude to be ~500 Gauss
in order to explain the observed lithium abundance of the Sun. Dynamos with
such low field amplitudes should not be relevant for the solar activity cycle.
With nonlinear simulations of MHD Taylor-Couette flows it is shown that for the
rotation-dominated magnetic instability the resulting eddy viscosity is only of
the order of the molecular viscosity. The Schmidt number as the ratio of
viscosity and chemical diffusion grows to values of ~20. For the majority of
the stellar physics applications, the magnetic-dominated Tayler instability
will be quenched by the stellar rotation.
