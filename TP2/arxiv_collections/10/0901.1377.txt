We present an apparatus optimized for tracking swimming microorganisms in the
size range 10-1000 microns, in three dimensions (3D), far from surfaces, and
with negligible background convective fluid motion. CCD cameras attached to two
long working distance microscopes synchronously image the sample from two
perpendicular directions, with narrowband dark-field or bright-field
illumination chosen to avoid triggering a phototactic response. The images from
the two cameras can be combined to yield 3D tracks of the organism. Using
additional, highly directional broad-spectrum illumination with millisecond
timing control the phototactic trajectories in 3D of organisms ranging from
Chlamydomonas to Volvox can be studied in detail. Surface-mediated hydrodynamic
interactions can also be investigated without convective interference. Minimal
modifications to the apparatus allow for studies of chemotaxis and other taxes.
