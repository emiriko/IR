The flip operation on colored inner-triangle-free triangulations of a convex
polygon is studied. It is shown that the affine Weyl group $\widetilde{C}_n$
acts transitively on these triangulations by colored flips, and that the
resulting colored flip graph is closely related to a lower interval in the weak
order on $\widetilde{C}_n$. Lattice properties of this order are then applied
to compute the diameter.
