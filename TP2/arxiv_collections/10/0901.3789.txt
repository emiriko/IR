Selected topics in solar dynamo theory are being highlighted. The possible
relevance of the near-surface shear layer is discussed. The role of turbulent
downward pumping is mentioned in connection with earlier concerns that a
dynamo-generated magnetic field would be rapidly lost from the convection zone
by magnetic buoyancy. It is argued that shear-mediated small-scale magnetic
helicity fluxes are responsible for the success of some of the recent
large-scale dynamo simulations. These fluxes help in disposing of excess
small-scale magnetic helicity. This small-scale magnetic helicity, in turn, is
generated in response to the production of an overall tilt in each Parker loop.
Some preliminary calculations of this helicity flux are presented for a system
with uniform shear. In the Sun the effects of magnetic helicity fluxes may be
seen in coronal mass ejections shedding large amounts of magnetic helicity.
