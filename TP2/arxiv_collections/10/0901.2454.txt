An open issue in turbulence theory is related to the determination of the
exact evolution equation for the probability density associated to the relevant
(stochastic) fluid fields. Such an equation in the usual approaches to
turbulence reproduces, at most in an approximate sense, the correct fluid
equations. In this paper we present a statistical model which applies to an
incompressible, resistive and quasi-neutral magnetofluid. The approach is based
on the formulation of an inverse kinetic theory (IKT) for the full set of MHD
equations appropriate for an incompressible, viscous, quasi-neutral,
isentropic, isothermal and resistive magnetofluid. Basic feature of the new
approach is that it relies on first principles - including in particular the
exact validity of the fluid equations - and thus permits the determination of
the correct evolution equation for the probability density. Specific
application of the theory here considered concerns the case of statistically
homogeneous and stationary MHD turbulence.
