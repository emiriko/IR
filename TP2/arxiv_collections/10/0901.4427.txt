We study the Fermi surface of metallic, non-magnetic \textit{ortho}-II
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.5}$ using three different density-functional-based
band-structure techniques (GGA, GGA+U, PSIC). The calculated Fermi surface
exhibits no pockets in GGA+U and PSIC, a minor one in GGA. Upon shifting the
Fermi level in the vicinity of the calculated value, we instead observe several
pocket structures. We calculate their cross-sectional areas and cyclotron
masses. Overall, our calculations show no solid evidence of the existence of
electron-like --nor, in fact, of any-- Fermi surface pockets in this phase.
This suggests that the origin of the pockets should be sought for in other,
different phases.
