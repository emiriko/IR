Some fractional quantum Hall states observed in experiments may be described
by first-quantized wavefunctions with special clustering properties like the
Moore-Read Pfaffian for filling factor nu = 5/2. This wavefunction has been
constructed by constructing correlation functions of a two-dimensional
conformal field theory (CFT) involving a free boson and a Majorana fermion. By
considering other CFTs many other clustered states have been proposed as
candidate FQH states under appropriate circumstances. It is believed that the
underlying CFT should be unitary if one wants to describe an incompressible
i.e. gapped liquid state. We show that by changing the way one derives the
wavefunction from its parent CFT it is possible to obtain an incompressible
candidate state when starting from a non-unitary parent. The construction
mimics a global change of parameters in the phase space of the electron system.
We explicit our construction in the case of the so-called Gaffnian state (a
state for filling factor 2/5) and also for the Haldane-Rezayi state (a
spin-singlet state at filling 1/2).
