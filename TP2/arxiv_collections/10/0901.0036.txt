The ground and P-wave excited states of nnn, nns and ssn baryons are studied
in the framework of the Field Correlator Method using the running strong
coupling constant in the Coulomb-like part of the three-quark potential. The
running coupling is calculated up to two loops in the background perturbation
theory. The three-quark problem has been solved using the hyperspherical
functions method. The masses of the S- and P-wave baryons are presented. Our
approach reproduces and improves the previous results for the baryon masses
obtained for the freezing value of the coupling constant. The string correction
for the confinement potential of the orbitally excited baryons, which is the
leading contribution of the proper inertia of the rotating strings, is
estimated.
