We analyze the non-Markovian dynamics of a quantum system subject to
spontaneous collapse in space. After having proved, under suitable conditions,
the separation of the center-of-mass and relative motions, we focus our
analysis on the time evolution of the center of mass of an isolated system
(free particle case). We compute the explicit expression of the Green's
function, for a generic Gaussian noise, and analyze in detail the case of an
exponential correlation function. We study the time evolution of average
quantities, such as the mean position, momentum and energy. We eventually
specialize to the case of Gaussian wave functions, and prove that all basic
facts about collapse models, which are known to be true in the white noise
case, hold also in the more general case of non-Markovian dynamics.
