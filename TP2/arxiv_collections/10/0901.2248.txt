Radio sources of the RC catalog produced in 1980--1985 at RATAN-600 radio
telescope based on a deep survey of a sky strip centered on the declination of
the SS 433 source are optically identified in the region overlapping with FIRST
and SDSS surveys (about 132 square degrees). The NVSS catalog was used as the
reference catalog for refining the coordinates of the radio sources. The
morphology is found for about 75% of the objects of the sample and the ratio of
single, double and multicomponent radio sources is computed based on FIRST
radio maps. The 74, 365, 1400, and 4850 MHz data of the VLSS, TXS, NVSS, FIRST,
and GB6 catalogs are used to analyze the shape of the spectra.
