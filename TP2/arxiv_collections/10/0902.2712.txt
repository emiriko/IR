Transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions
describe the partonic structure of the nucleon in a three-dimensional momentum
space. They are subjects of flourishing theoretical and experimental activity.
They provide novel and intriguing information on hadronic structure, including
evidence of the presence of partonic orbital angular momentum.
