Understanding the dependence and interplay between architecture and function
in biological networks has great relevance to disease progression, biological
fabrication and biological systems in general. We propose methods to assess the
association of various microbe characteristics and phenotypes with the topology
of their networks. We adopt an automated approach to characterize metabolic
networks of 32 microbial species using 11 topological metrics from complex
networks. Clustering allows us to extract the indispensable, independent and
informative metrics. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we identify relevant
subgroups of these metrics and establish that they associate with microbial
phenotypes surprisingly well. This work can serve as a stepping stone to
cataloging biologically relevant topological properties of networks and towards
better modeling of phenotypes. The methods we use can also be applied to
networks from other disciplines.
