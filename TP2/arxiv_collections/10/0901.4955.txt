We have recently presented an investigation in full general relativity of the
dynamics and gravitational-wave emission from binary neutron stars which
inspiral and merge, producing a black hole surrounded by a torus (see
arXiv:0804.0594). We here discuss in more detail the convergence properties of
the results presented in arXiv:0804.0594 and, in particular, the deterioration
of the convergence rate at the merger and during the survival of the merged
object, when strong shocks are formed and turbulence develops. We also show
that physically reasonable and numerically convergent results obtained at
low-resolution suffer however from large truncation errors and hence are of
little physical use. We summarize our findings in an "error budget", which
includes the different sources of possible inaccuracies we have investigated
and provides a first quantitative assessment of the precision in the modelling
of compact fluid binaries.
