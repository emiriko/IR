We revisit the basic principle for lasing : Population inversion which is
nevertheless closely linked to the negative temperature state in
non-equilibrium thermodynamics. With the introduction of quantum degeneracies,
we also illustrate their relationship with the lasing via the tuning of
population inversion.
