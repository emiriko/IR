We present a measurement of the $B_s^0 - \bar B_s^0$ oscillation frequency,
$\Delta m_s$, using a combination of semi-leptonic and hadronic $B_s$ decay
candidates selected from data collected by the D0 Experiment at the Fermilab
Tevatron. We also present several results on CP violation, including an
improved measurement of the $B_s$ CP-violating phase from a flavor-tagged
analysis of $B_s^0 \to J/\psi + \phi$ decays.
