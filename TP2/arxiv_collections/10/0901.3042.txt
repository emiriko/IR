We give a mathematical structure on an arithmetic surface, that has algebraic
meanings over finite places and can estimate the canonical norm for a relative
differential form on the arithmetic surface. This will give a lower bound for
the canonical norm for a relative differential form on an arithmetic surface,
which proves a Height Inequality on the arithmetic surface.
