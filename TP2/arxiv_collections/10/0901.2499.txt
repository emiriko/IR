We report on the identification of the X/soft gamma-ray source AX
J183039-1002 detected with ASCA and INTEGRAL/IBIS. The source, which has an
observed 20-100 keV flux of about 8.6 x 10^-11 erg/cm^2/s, is inside a diffuse
radio supernova remnant (SNR) and is spatially coincident with a compact radio
source. We analyzed archival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations in order to
identify the ASCA/INTEGRAL source. A point-like Chandra X-ray object was found
to be positionally coincident with the compact radio source and within the
error circle of the ASCA and INTEGRAL sources. Although the association of a
compact radio/X-ray source with a radio supernova remnant could be indicative
of a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), the XMM-Newton X-ray spectrum is compatible with
an absorbed, Seyfert-2 like AGN, since it provides evidence for an iron
emission line of about 1 keV equivalent width; furthermore the X-ray source
spectrum is similar to that of other Compton thick AGN where the <2 keV data
are associated to a warm reflector and the >10 keV one to a cold reflector.
