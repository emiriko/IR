A maximum likelihood (ML) technique for detecting compact sources in images
of the x-ray sky is examined. Such images, in the relatively low exposure
regime accessible to present x-ray observatories, exhibit Poissonian noise at
background flux levels. A variety of source detection methods are compared via
Monte Carlo, and the ML detection method is shown to compare favourably with
the optimized-linear-filter (OLF) method when applied to a single image. Where
detection proceeds in parallel on several images made in different energy
bands, the ML method is shown to have some practical advantages which make it
superior to the OLF method. Some criticisms of ML are discussed. Finally, a
practical method of estimating the sensitivity of ML detection is presented,
and is shown to be also applicable to sliding-box source detection.
