We report on isofield magnetization curves obtained as a function of
temperature in two single crystals of $Ba_{1-x}K_xFe_2As_2$ with
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$=28K and 32.7 K. Results obtained
for fields above 20 kOe show a well defined rounding effect on the reversible
region extending 1-3 K above $T_c(H)$ masking the transition. This rounding
appears to be due to three-dimensional critical fluctuations, as the higher
field curves obey a well know scaling law for this type of critical
fluctuations. We also analysed the asymptotic behavior of $\sqrt M$vs.T curves
in the reversible region which probes the shape of the gap near $T_c(H)$.
Results of the analysis suggests that phase fluctuations are important in
$Ba_{1-x}K_xFe_2As_2$ which is consistent with nodes in the gap.
