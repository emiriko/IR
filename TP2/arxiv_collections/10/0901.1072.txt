A new concept of mutual pressure is introduced for potential functions on
both continuous and discrete compound spaces via discrete micro-states of
permutations, and its relations with the usual pressure and the mutual
information are established. This paper is a continuation of the paper of Hiai
and Petz in Banach Center Publications, Vol. 78.
