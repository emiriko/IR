We demonstrate theoretically a scheme for cluster state generation, based on
atomic ensembles and the dipole blockade mechanism. In the protocol, atomic
ensembles serve as single qubit systems. Therefore, we review single-qubit
operations on qubit defined as collective states of atomic ensemble. Our
entangling protocol requires nearly identical single-photon sources, one
ultra-cold ensemble per physical qubit, and regular photodetectors. The general
entangling procedure is presented, as well as a procedure that generates in a
single step Q-qubit GHZ states with success probability p_success ~ eta^{Q/2},
where eta is the combined detection and source efficiency. This is
significantly more efficient than any known robust probabilistic entangling
operation. GHZ states form the basic building block for universal cluster
states, a resource for the one-way quantum computer.
