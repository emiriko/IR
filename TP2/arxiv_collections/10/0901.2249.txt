The results of a theoretical investigation on the stopping power of ions
moving in a disordered two-dimensional degenerate electron gas are presented.
The stopping power for an ion is calculated employing linear response theory
using the dielectric function approach. The disorder, which leads to a damping
of plasmons and quasiparticles in the electron gas, is taken into account
through a relaxation time approximation in the linear response function. The
stopping power for an ion is calculated in both the low- and high-velocity
limits. In order to highlight the effects of damping we present a comparison of
our analytical and numerical results, in the case of point-like ions, obtained
for a non-zero damping with those for a vanishing damping. It is shown that the
equipartition sum rule first formulated by Lindhard and Winther for
three-dimensional degenerate electron gas does not necessarily hold in
two-dimensions. We have generalized this rule introducing an effective
dielectric function. In addition some new results for two-dimensional
interacting electron gas have been obtained. In this case the
exchange-correlation interactions of electrons are considered via
local-field-corrected dielectric function.
