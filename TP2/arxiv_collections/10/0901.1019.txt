Up to 90% of the chemical reactions during star formation occurs on ice
surfaces, probably including the formation of complex organics. Only the most
abundant ice species are however observed directly by infrared spectroscopy.
This study aims to develop an indirect observational method of ices based on
non-thermal ice desorption in the colder part of protostellar envelopes. For
that purpose the IRAM 30m telescope was employed to observe two molecules that
can be detected both in the gas and the ice, CH3 OH and HNCO, toward 4 low mass
embedded protostars. Their respective gas-phase column densities are determined
using rotational diagrams. The relationship between ice and gas phase
abundances is subsequently determined. The observed gas and ice abundances span
several orders of magnitude. Most of the CH3OH and HNCO gas along the lines of
sight is inferred to be quiescent from the measured line widths and the derived
excitation temperatures, and hence not affected by thermal desorption close to
the protostar or in outflow shocks. The measured gas to ice ratio of ~10-4
agrees well with model predictions for non-thermal desorption under cold
envelope conditions and there is a tentative correlation between ice and gas
phase abundances. This indicates that non-thermal desorption products can serve
as a signature of the ice composition. A larger sample is however necessary to
provide a conclusive proof of concept.
