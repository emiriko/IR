The electromagnetic transitions between ($J^{P}={3/2}^{+}$) and
($J^{P}={1/2}^{+}$) baryons are important decay modes to observe new hadronic
states experimentally. For the estimation of these transitions widths, we
employ a non-relativistic quark potential model description with color coulomb
plus linear confinement potential. Such a description has been employed to
compute the ground state masses and magnetic moments of the single heavy flavor
baryons. The magnetic moments of the baryons are obtained using the spin-flavor
structure of the constituting quark composition of the baryon. Here, we also
define an effective constituent mass of the quarks (ecqm) by taking into
account the binding effects of the quarks within the baryon. The radiative
transition widths are computed in terms of the magnetic moments of the baryon
and the photon energy. Our results are compared with other theoretical models.
