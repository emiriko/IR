We present a scheme of probabilistic dense coding via a quantum channel of
non-maximally entangled three-particle state. The quantum dense coding will be
succeeded with a certain probability if the sender introduces an auxiliary
particle and performs a collective unitary transformation. Furthermore, the
average information transmitted in this scheme is calculated.
