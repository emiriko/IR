We derive a formula for the thermal conductivity tensor of a ballistic phonon
Hall model. It is found that, although the diagonal elements of the
conductivity tensor diverge to infinite, the off-diagonal elements are
finite,antisymmetric, and odd in magnetic field. The off-diagonal elements are
non-zero only if the dynamic matrix of the phonon system breaks mirror
reflection symmetry. The results are obtained without perturbative assumptions
about the spin-phonon interactions.
