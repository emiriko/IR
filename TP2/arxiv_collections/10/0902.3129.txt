Gamma-ray binaries have been uncovered as a new class of Galactic objects in
the very high energy sky (> 100 GeV). The three systems known today have hard
X-ray spectra (photon index ~ 1.5), extended radio emission and a high
luminosity in gamma-rays. Recent monitoring campaigns of LSI +61 303 in X-rays
have confirmed variability in these systems and revealed a spectral hardening
with increasing flux. In a generic one-zone leptonic model, the cooling of
relativistic electrons accounts for the main spectral and temporal features
observed at high energy. Persistent hard X-ray emission is expected to extend
well beyond 10 keV. We explain how Simbol-X will constrain the existing models
in connection with Fermi Space Telescope measurements. Because of its
unprecedented sensitivity in hard X-rays, Simbol-X will also play a role in the
discovery of new gamma-ray binaries, giving new insights into the evolution of
compact binaries.
