We study an opto-electronic time-delay oscillator that displays high-speed
chaotic behavior with a flat, broad power spectrum. The chaotic state coexists
with a linearly-stable fixed point, which, when subjected to a finite-amplitude
perturbation, loses stability initially via a periodic train of ultrafast
pulses. We derive an approximate map that does an excellent job of capturing
the observed instability. The oscillator provides a simple device for
fundamental studies of time-delay dynamical systems and can be used as a
building block for ultra-wide-band sensor networks.
