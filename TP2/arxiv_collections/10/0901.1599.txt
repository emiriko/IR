A recent Monte Carlo simulation determined the potential of mean force
between two lysozyme molecules in various aqueous solutions [M. Lund et al.
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 258105 (2008)]. The study involved a combination of
explicit solvent and continuum model simulations and showed that there are
significant ion-specific protein-protein interactions due to hydrophobic
patches on the protein surfaces. In this paper we use the results of their
study to determine the phase diagram for lysozyme for aqueous solutions of NaCl
and NaI. Two of the three phase diagrams have a stable fluid-fluid critical
point, while the third has a slightly metastable critical point. This results
from a secondary extremum in the potential associated with a repulsive
interaction. This repulsive interaction reduces the effective range of the
attractive interaction and produces a metastable critical point. We compare the
results of one of these phase diagrams with that for a model that includes
ion-dispersion forces, but does not contain solvent structural effects.
