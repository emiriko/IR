Algebraic curves have a discrete analogue in finite graphs. Pursuing this
analogy we prove a Torelli theorem for graphs. Namely, we show that two graphs
have the same Albanese torus if and only if the graphs obtained from them by
contracting all separating edges are 2-isomorphic. In particular, the strong
Torelli theorem holds for 3-connected graphs. Next, using the correspondence
between compact tropical curves and metric graphs, we prove a tropical Torelli
theorem giving necessary and sufficient conditions for two tropical curves to
have the same principally polarized tropical Jacobian. Finally we describe some
natural posets associated to a graph and prove that they characterize its
Delaunay decomposition.
