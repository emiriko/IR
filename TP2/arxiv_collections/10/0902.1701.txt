We discuss the emission and transport of polarized radio-band synchrotron
radiation near the forward shocks of young shell-type supernova remnants, for
which X-ray data indicate a strong amplification of turbulent magnetic field.
Modeling the magnetic turbulence through the superposition of waves, we
calculate the degree of polarization and the magnetic polarization direction
which is at $90^\circ$ to the conventional electric polarization direction. We
find that isotropic strong turbulence will produce weakly polarized radio
emission even in the absence of internal Faraday rotation. If anisotropy is
imposed on the magnetic-field structure, the degree of polarization can be
significantly increased, provided internal Faraday rotation is inefficient.
Both for shock compression and a mixture with a homogeneous field, the increase
in polarization degree goes along with a fairly precise alignment of the
magnetic-polarization angle with the direction of the dominant magnetic-field
component, implying tangential magnetic polarization at the rims in the case of
shock compression. We compare our model with high-resolution radio polarimetry
data of Tycho's remnant. Using the absence of internal Faraday rotation we find
a soft limit for the amplitude of magnetic turbulence, $\delta B \lesssim 200\
{\rm \mu G}$. The data are compatible with a turbulent magnetic field
superimposed on a radial large-scale field of similar amplitude, $\delta
B\simeq B_0$. An alternative viable scenario involves anisotropic turbulence
with stronger amplitudes in the radial direction, as was observed in recent MHD
simulations of shocks propagating through a medium with significant density
fluctuations.
