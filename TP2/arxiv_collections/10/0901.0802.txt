We present new predictions for the total cross section of squark
pair-production at Tevatron and LHC through next-to-next-to-leading order
within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. The results are based on the
numerically dominant soft corrections. They are exact in all logarithmically
enhanced terms near threshold, include the Coulomb corrections at two loops and
exact scale dependence. We translate the increased total cross section at
next-to-next-to-leading order into improved exclusion limits for squark masses
and we investigate the scale dependence as well as the sensitivity on the
parton luminosity.
