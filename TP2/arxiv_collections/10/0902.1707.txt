We present the experimental demonstration of self-collimation (subdiffractive
propagation) of an ultrasonic beam inside a three-dimensional sonic crystal.
The crystal is formed by two crossed steel cylinders structures in a
woodpile-like geometry disposed in water. Measurements of the 3D field
distribution show that a narrow beam which diffractively spreads in the absence
of the sonic crystal is strongly collimated in propagation inside the crystal,
demonstrating the 3D self-collimation effect.
