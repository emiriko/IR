An integrable two-component analogue of the two-dimensional long wave-short
wave resonance interaction (2c-2d-LSRI) system is studied. Wronskian solutions
of 2c-2d-LSRI system are presented. A reduced case, which describes resonant
interaction between an interfacial wave and two surface wave packets in a two
layer fluid, is also discussed.
