In this letter we discuss a certain class of Hidden Valley models where the
dynamics in the hidden sector are close to a strongly coupled conformal fixed
point. We show that these models can explain the excess in cosmic ray muon
events with high muon multiplicities that has been reported from cosmic ray
studies with the ALEPH and DELPHI detectors. We further point out that these
models can also at least partially account for the excess in multi-muon events
that was found by the CDF experiment. Finally we discuss possible signatures of
these models at the LHC.
