We describe a simple formalism for generating classes of quantum circuits
that are classically efficiently simulatable and show that the efficient
simulation of Clifford circuits (Gottesman-Knill theorem) and of matchgate
circuits (Valiant's theorem) appear as two special cases. Viewing these
simulatable classes as subsets of the space of all quantum computations, we may
consider minimal extensions that suffice to regain full quantum computational
power, which provides an approach to exploring the efficacy of quantum over
classical computation.
