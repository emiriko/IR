We present a systematic study of the correlation-induced corrections to the
electronic band structure of zinc-blende BN. Our investigation employs an ab
initio wave-function-based local Hamiltonian formalism which offers a rigorous
approach to the calculation of the polarization and local charge redistribution
effects around an extra electron or hole placed into the conduction or valence
bands of semiconducting and insulating materials. Moreover, electron
correlations beyond relaxation and polarization can be readily incorporated.
The electron correlation treatment is performed on finite clusters. In
conducting our study, we make use of localized Wannier functions and embedding
potentials derived explicitly from prior periodic Hartree-Fock calculations.
The on-site and nearest-neighbor charge relaxation bring corrections of several
eV to the Hartree-Fock band gap. Additional corrections are caused by
long-range polarization effects. In contrast, the dispersion of the
Hartree-Fock bands is marginally affected by electron correlations. Our final
result for the fundamental gap of zinc-blende BN compares well with that
derived from soft x-ray experiments at the B and N K-edges.
