Differential 2.2um (K-band) luminosity functions are presented for a complete
sample of 1570 nearby Vgsr < 3000 km/s, where Vgsr is the velocity measured
with respect to the Galactic standard of rest), bright (K < 10 mag), galaxies
segregated by visible morphology. The K-band luminosity function for late-type
spirals follows a power law that rises towards low luminosities whereas the
K-band luminosity functions for ellipticals, lenticulars and bulge-dominated
spirals are peaked with a fall off at both high and low luminosities. However,
each morphological type (E, S0, S0/a-Sab, Sb-Sbc, Sc-Scd) contributes
approximately equally to the overall K-band luminosity density in the local
universe, and by inference, the stellar mass density as well.
