The Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) offer the unprecedented opportunity to observe
for the first time the blackholic energy extracted by the vacuum polarization
during the process of gravitational collapse to a black hole leading to the
formation of an electron-positron plasma. The uniqueness of the Kerr-Newman
black hole implies that very different processes originating from the
gravitational collapse a) of a single star in a binary system induced by the
companion, or b) of two neutron stars, or c) of a neutron star and a white
dwarf, do lead to the same structure for the observed GRB. The recent progress
of the numerical integration of the relativistic Boltzmann equations with
collision integrals including 2-body and 3-body interactions between the
particles offer a powerful conceptual tool in order to differentiate the
traditional "fireball" picture, an expanding hot cavity considered by Cavallo
and Rees, as opposed to the "fireshell" model, composed of an internally cold
shell of relativistically expanding electron-positron-baryon plasma. The
analysis of the fireshell naturally leads to a canonical GRB composed of a
proper-GRB and an extended afterglow. By recalling the three interpretational
paradigms for GRBs we show how the fireshell model leads to an understanding of
the GRB structure and to an alternative classification of short and long GRBs.
