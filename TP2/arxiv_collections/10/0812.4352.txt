We propose a multipole representation of the Fermi-Dirac function and the
Fermi operator, and use this representation to develop algorithms for
electronic structure analysis of metallic systems. The new algorithm is quite
simple and efficient. Its computational cost scales logarithmically with
$\beta\Delta\eps$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, and $\Delta \eps$
is the width of the spectrum of the discretized Hamiltonian matrix.
