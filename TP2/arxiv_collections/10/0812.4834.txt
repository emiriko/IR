Recently, a random current representation for transverse field Ising models
has been introduced in \cite{ILN}. This representation is a space-time version
of the classical random current representation exploited by Aizenman et. al.
%It is a space-time version of the classical random current representation
\cite{Ai82, ABF, AF}. In this paper we formulate and prove corresponding
space-time versions of the classical switching lemma and show how they generate
various correlation inequalities. In particular we prove exponential decay of
truncated two-point functions at positive magnetic fields in $\sfz$-direction
and address the issue of the sharpness of phase transition.
