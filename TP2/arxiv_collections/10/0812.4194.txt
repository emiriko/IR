The progress in the development of the new international Gerda (GErmanium
Detector Array) experiment is presented. Main purpose of the experiment is to
search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge. The experimental set up
is under construction in the underground laboratory of LNGS. Gerda will operate
with bare germanium semiconductor detectors (enriched in 76Ge) situated in
liquid argon. In the Phase I the existing enriched detectors from the previous
Heidelberg-Moscow and IGEX experiments are employed, in the Phase II the new
segmented detectors made from recently produced enriched material will be
added. Novel concepts for background suppression including detector
segmentation and anti-coincidence with LAr scintillation are developed.
