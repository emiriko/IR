We consider the problem of self-healing in peer-to-peer networks that are
under repeated attack by an omniscient adversary. We assume that, over a
sequence of rounds, an adversary either inserts a node with arbitrary
connections or deletes an arbitrary node from the network. The network responds
to each such change by quick "repairs," which consist of adding or deleting a
small number of edges.
  These repairs essentially preserve closeness of nodes after adversarial
deletions, without increasing node degrees by too much, in the following sense.
At any point in the algorithm, nodes $v$ and $w$ whose distance would have been
$\ell$ in the graph formed by considering only the adversarial insertions (not
the adversarial deletions), will be at distance at most $\ell \log n$ in the
actual graph, where $n$ is the total number of vertices seen so far. Similarly,
at any point, a node $v$ whose degree would have been $d$ in the graph with
adversarial insertions only, will have degree at most 3d in the actual graph.
Our algorithm is completely distributed and has low latency and bandwidth
requirements.
