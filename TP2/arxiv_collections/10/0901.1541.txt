The performance of jet finding using only charged tracks in CMS has been
investigated. Different jet algorithms have been applied to QCD di-jet events,
to hadronic tt multi-jet events and on Z+jets events. Results using jets made
with tracks only or calorimeter towers are compared for energy response,
angular resolution and jet matching to the leading partons. The jet
reconstruction performance in the presence of pile-up interactions is presented
for the Z+jets sample.
