The Golden ratio which appears in the geometry of a variety of creations in
Nature is found to arise right in the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom due to
the opposite charges of the electron and proton. The bond length of the
hydrogen molecule is the diagonal of a square on the Bohr radius and hence also
has two Golden sections, which form the cationic and anionic radii of hydrogen.
It is shown here that these radii account for the bond lengths of many hydrides
when added to the atomic and Golden ratio based ionic radii of many other
atoms.
