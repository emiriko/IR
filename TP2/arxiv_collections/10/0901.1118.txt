We investigate magnetized solar-like stellar winds by means of
self-consistent three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical
simulations. We analyze winds with different magnetic field intensities and
densities as to explore the dependence on the plasma-beta parameter. By solving
the fully ideal 3D MHD equations, we show that the plasma-beta parameter is the
crucial parameter in the configuration of the steady-state wind. Therefore,
there is a group of magnetized flows that would present the same terminal
velocity despite of its thermal and magnetic energy densities, as long as the
plasma-beta parameter is the same.
