Following its launch in June 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
(Fermi) began a sky survey in August. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on Fermi
in 3 months produced a deeper and better-resolved map of the gamma-ray sky than
any previous space mission. We present here initial results for energies above
100 MeV for the 205 most significant (statistical significance greater than
~10-sigma) gamma-ray sources in these data. These are the best-characterized
and best-localized point-like (i.e., spatially unresolved) gamma-ray sources in
the early-mission data.
