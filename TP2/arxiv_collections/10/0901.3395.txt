First we present and theoretically analyze the phenomenological physical
picture behind Vibration-Induced Conductivity Fluctuations. We identify the
relevant tensors characterizing the electromechanical response against the
vibrations for both longitudinal and transversal responses. We analyze the
conductivity response with acceleration type vibrations and a new scheme,
measurements with more advantageous compression type vibrations that are first
introduced here. Compression vibrations provide sideband spectral lines shifted
by the frequency of the vibration instead of its second harmonics; moreover the
application of this method is less problematic with loose electrodes.
Concerning geometry and electrodes, the large measurement errors in earlier
experiment indicated electrode effects which justify using four-electrode type
measurements. We propose and analyze new arrangements for the longitudinal and
transversal measurements with both compression vibration and acceleration
vibration for laboratory and field conditions.
