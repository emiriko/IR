A general method for constructing logarithmic modules in vertex operator
algebra theory is presented. By utilizing this approach, we give explicit
vertex operator construction of certain indecomposable and logarithmic modules
for the triplet vertex algebra W(p) and for other subalgebras of lattice vertex
algebras and their N=1 super extensions. We analyze in detail indecomposable
modules obtained in this way, giving further evidence for the conjectural
equivalence between the category of W(p)-modules and the category of modules
for the restricted quantum group $\bar{\mathcal{U}}_q(sl_2)$ at root of unity.
We also construct logarithmic representations for a certain affine vertex
operator algebra at admissible level realized in \cite{A-2005}. In this way we
prove the existence of the logarithmic representations predicted in \cite{G}.
Our approach enlightens related logarithmic intertwining operators among
indecomposable modules, which we also construct in the paper.
