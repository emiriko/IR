We study the use of squeezed light for qubit coherent control and compare it
with the coherent state control field case. We calculate the entanglement
between a short pulse of resonant squeezed light and a two-level atom in free
space and the resulting operation error. We find that the squeezing phase, the
phase of the light field and the atomic superposition phase, all determine
whether atom-pulse mode entanglement and the gate error are enhanced or
suppressed. However, when averaged over all possible qubit initial states, the
gate error would not decrease by a practicably useful amount and would in fact
increase in most cases. We discuss the possibility of measuring the increased
gate error as a signature of the enhancement of entanglement by squeezing.
