This paper presents electronic spectra of zigzag and armchair graphene
nanoribbons calculated within the tight-binding model for pi-electrons. Zigzag
and armchair nanoribbons of different edge geometries are considered, with
surface perturbation taken into account. The properties of surface states are
discussed on the basis of their classification into Tamm states and Shockley
states. In armchair nanoribbons surface states are shown to close the energy
gap at the Dirac point for certain edge geometries.
