For the symmetric simple exclusion process on an infinite line, we calculate
exactly the fluctuations of the integrated current $Q_t$ during time $t$
through the origin when, in the initial condition, the sites are occupied with
density $\rho_a$ on the negative axis and with density $\rho_b$ on the positive
axis. All the cumulants of $Q_t$ grow like $\sqrt{t}$. In the range where $Q_t
\sim \sqrt{t}$, the decay $\exp [-Q_t^3/t]$ of the distribution of $Q_t$ is
non-Gaussian. Our results are obtained using the Bethe ansatz and several
identities recently derived by Tracy and Widom for exclusion processes on the
infinite line.
