We study modifications to Weinberg-like sum rules in quasiconformal gauge
field theories. Beyond the two Weinberg sum rules and the oblique S parameter
we study the pion mass and the X parameter. Especially, we evaluate the pion
mass for walking technicolour theories, in particular also minimal walking
technicolour, and find contributions of the order of up to several hundred GeV.
