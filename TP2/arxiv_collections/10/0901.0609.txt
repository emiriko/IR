Gauge Higgs Unification in Warped Extra Dimensions provides an attractive
solution to the hierarchy problem. The extension of the Standard Model gauge
symmetry to $SO(5)xU(1)_X$ allows the incorporation of the custodial symmetry
$SU(2)_R$ plus a Higgs boson doublet with the right quantum numbers under the
gauge group. In the minimal model, the Higgs mass is in the range 110-150 GeV,
while a light Kaluza Klein (KK) excitation of the top quark appears in the
spectrum, providing agreement with precision electroweak measurements and a
possible test of the model at a high luminosity LHC. The extension of the model
to the lepton sector has several interesting features. We discuss the
conditions necessary to obtain realistic charged lepton and neutrino masses.
After the addition of an exchange symmetry in the bulk, we show that the odd
neutrino KK modes provide a realistic dark matter candidate, with a mass of the
order of 1 TeV, which will be probed by direct dark matter detection
experiments in the near future.
