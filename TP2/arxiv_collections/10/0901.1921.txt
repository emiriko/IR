We show that the maximal future development of asymptotically flat
spherically symmetric black hole initial data for a self-gravitating nonlinear
scalar field, also called a Higgs field, contains a connected, achronal
marginally trapped tube which is asymptotic to the event horizon of the black
hole, provided the initial data is sufficiently small and decays like
O(r^{-1/2}), and the potential function V is nonnegative with bounded second
derivative. This result can be loosely interpreted as a statement about the
stability of `nice' asymptotic behavior of marginally trapped tubes under
certain small perturbations of Schwarzschild.
