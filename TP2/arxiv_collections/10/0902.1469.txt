We report on diffraction-limited observations in the far-infrared and sub-
millimeter of the Cluster B region of Serpens (G3-G6 Cluster) and of the Herbig
Be star to the south, VV Ser. The observations were made with the Spitzer MIPS
instrument in fine-scale mode at 70um, in normal mapping mode at 160um (VV Ser
only), and the CSO SHARC-II camera at 350um (Cluster B only). We use these data
to define the spectral energy distributions of the tightly grouped members of
Cluster B, many of whose SEDs peak in the far-infrared. We compare our results
to those of the c2d survey of Serpens and to published models for the
far-infrared emission from VV Ser. We find that values of Lbol and Tbol
calculated with our new photometry show only modest changes from previous
values, and that most source SED classifications remain unchanged.
