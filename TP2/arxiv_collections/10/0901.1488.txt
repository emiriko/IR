We demonstrate the capability of continuous variable Gaussian states to
communicate multipartite quantum information. A quantum teamwork protocol is
presented according to which an arbitrary possibly entangled multimode state
can be faithfully teleported between two teams each comprising many cooperative
users. We prove that N-mode Gaussian weighted graph states exist for arbitrary
N, that enable unconditional quantum teamwork implementations for any
arrangement of the teams. These perfect continuous variable maximally
multipartite entangled resources are typical among pure Gaussian states and are
unaffected by the entanglement frustration occurring in multiqubit states.
