The Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) are the appropriate framework for
a universal description of the partonic structure of the nucleon. They
characterize the dynamics of quarks and gluons inside the nucleon and
consequently contain information about the spin of the nucleon. The current
experimental knowledge about GPDs is reviewed with the emphasis on the
determination of E^q(Q^2,x,xi,t), the least known and constrained GPD, of
particular importance in the nucleon spin puzzle. The perspectives of this
experimental program are also addressed.
