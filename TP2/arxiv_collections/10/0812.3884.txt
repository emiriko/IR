We present the results of the experimental investigation of the low -
frequency noise in bilayer graphene transistors. The back - gated devices were
fabricated using the electron beam lithography and evaporation. The charge
neutrality point for the fabricated transistors was around 10 V. The noise
spectra at frequencies above 10 - 100 Hz were of the 1/f - type with the
spectral density on the order of 10E-23 - 10E-22 A2/Hz at the frequency of 1
kHz. The deviation from the 1/f spectrum at the frequencies below 10 -100 Hz
indicates that the noise is of the carrier - number fluctuation origin due to
the carrier trapping by defects. The Hooge parameter of 10E-4 was extracted for
this type of devices. The gate dependence of the noise spectral density
suggests that the noise is dominated by the contributions from the ungated part
of the device channel and by the contacts. The obtained results are important
for graphene electronic applications.
