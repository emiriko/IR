Let $H$ be a finite dimensional hereditary algebra over an algebraically
closed field $k$ and $\mathscr{C}_{F^m}$ be the repetitive cluster category of
$H$ with $m\geq 1$. We investigate the properties of cluster tilting objects in
$\mathscr{C}_{F^m}$ and the structure of repetitive cluster-tilted algebras.
Moreover, we generalized Theorem 4.2 in \cite{bmrrt} (Buan A, Marsh R, Reiten
I. Cluster-tilted algebra. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 359(1)(2007), 323-332.) to
the situation of $\mathscr{C}_{F^m}$, and prove that the tilting graph
$\mathscr{K}_{\mathscr{C}_{F^m}}$ of $\mathscr{C}_{F^m}$ is connected.
