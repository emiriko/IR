Correlation inequalities are presented for ferromagnetic Potts models with
external field, using the random-cluster representation of Fortuin and
Kasteleyn, together with the FKG inequality. These results extend and simplify
earlier inequalities of Ganikhodjaev and Razak, and also of Schonmann, and
include GKS-type inequalities when the spin-space is taken as the set of $q$th
roots of unity.
