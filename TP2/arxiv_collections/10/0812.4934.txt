Reconstruction of shooting events occasionally requires testing of bullets at
velocities significantly below the typical muzzle velocity of cartridge arms.
Trajectory, drag, and terminal performance depend strongly on velocity, and
realistic results require accurately reconstructing the velocity. A method is
presented for testing bullets at reduced velocities by loading the bullet into
a sabot and firing from a muzzle loading rifle with a suitably reduced powder
charge. Powder charges can be safely reduced to any desirable level when
shooting saboted bullets from a muzzleloader; in contrast, cartridge arms can
only be safely operated within a narrow window of powder charges/muzzle
velocities. This technique is applicable to a wide range of both pistol and
rifle bullets at velocities from 700 ft/s to 2000 ft/s.
