In February 1997, the Japanese radio astronomy satellite HALCA was launched
to provide the space-bourne element for the VLBI Space Observatory Programme
(VSOP) mission. A significant fraction of the mission time was to be dedicated
to the VSOP Survey of bright compact Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at 5 GHz,
which was lead by ISAS. The VSOP Survey Sources are an unbiased dataset of 294
targets, of which 82% were successfully observed. These are now undergoing
statistical analysis to tease out the characteristics of typical AGN sources.
We present here the summary of the imaging and conclusions we have reached.
