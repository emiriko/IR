The relativistic Landau levels in the layered organic material
alpha-(BEDT-TTF)_2I_3 [BEDT-TTF=bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene] are
sensitive to the tilt of the Dirac cones, which, as in the case of graphene,
determine the low-energy electronic properties under appropriate pressure. We
show that an applied inplane electric field, which happens to be in competition
with the tilt of the cones, lifts the twofold valley degeneracy due to a
different level spacing. The scenario may be tested in infrared transmission
spectroscopy.
