The ability to detect fragments of deleted image files and to reconstruct
these image files from all available fragments on disk is a key activity in the
field of digital forensics. Although reconstruction of image files from the
file fragments on disk can be accomplished by simply comparing the content of
sectors on disk with the content of known files, this brute-force approach can
be time consuming. This paper presents results from research into the use of
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in detecting specific image file byte patterns
in disk clusters. Unique identifying pattern for each disk sector is compared
against patterns in known images. A pattern match indicates the potential
presence of an image and flags the disk sector for further in-depth examination
to confirm the match. The GPU-based implementation outperforms the software
implementation by a significant margin.
