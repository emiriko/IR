We discuss the prospects of searching for the neutral Higgs bosons of the
triplet model in central exclusive production at the LHC. A detailed Monte
Carlo analysis is presented for six benchmark scenarios for the Higgs boson,
$H_1^{0}$, these cover $m_{H_1^0}=$~120, 150 GeV and doublet-triplet mixing of
$c_H=$~0.2, 0.5 or 0.8. We find that, for appropriate values of $c_H$, an
excellent Higgs mass measurement is possible for the neutral Higgs in the
triplet model, and discuss how to distinguish the triplet model Higgs boson
from the Higgs boson of the Standard Model.
