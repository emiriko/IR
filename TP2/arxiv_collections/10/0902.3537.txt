We present the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS)
and Keck observations of HDE 245059, a young weak-lined T Tauri star (WTTS),
member of the pre-main sequence group in the Lambda Orionis Cluster. Our high
spatial resolution, near-infrared observations with Keck reveal that HDE 245059
a binary separated by 0.87". Based on this new information we have obtained an
estimate of the masses of the binary components; 3M_{sun} and 2.5M_{sun} for
the north and south components, respectively. We have estimated the age of the
system to be ~2-3 Myr. We detect both components of the binary in the zeroth
order Chandra image and in the grating spectra. Our fits to the spectrum of the
binary have shown that the emission is dominated by a plasma between 8 and 15
MK, a soft component at 4 MK and a hard component at 50 MK are also detected.
The value of the hydrogen column density was low, 8 x 10^{19} cm^{-2}, likely
due to the clearing of the inner region of the Lambda Orionis cloud. The
abundance pattern shows an inverse First Ionization Potential (FIP) effect for
all elements from O to Fe, the only exception being Ca. A 3-T model was fitted
to the individual zeroth order spectra using the abundances derived for the
binary. We have also obtained several lines fluxes from the grating spectra.
The fits to the triplets show no evidence of high densities. We conclude that
the X-ray properties of the weak-lined T Tau binary HDE 245059 are similar to
those generally observed in other weak-lined T Tau stars. Although its
accretion history may have been affected by the clearing of the interstellar
material around Lambda Ori, its coronal properties appears not to have been
strongly modified.
