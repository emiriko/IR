The See-Saw mechanism provides a nice way to explain why neutrino masses are
so much lighter than their charged lepton partners. It also provides a nice way
to explain baryon asymmetry in our universe via the leptogenesis mechanism. In
this talk we review leptogenesis and LHC physics in a See-Saw model proposed in
1989, now termed the Type III See-Saw model. In this model, $SU(2)_L$ triplet
leptons are introduced with the neutral particles of the triplets playing the
role of See-Saw. The triplet leptons have charged partners with standard model
gauge interactions resulting in many new features. The gauge interactions of
these particles make it easier for leptognesis with low masses, as low as a TeV
is possible. The gauge interactions also make the production and detection of
triplet leptons at LHC possible. The See-Saw mechanism and leptogenesis due to
Type III See-Saw may be tested at LHC.
