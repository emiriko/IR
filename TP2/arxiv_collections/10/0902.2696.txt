In this work the accelerated-decelerated transition in a primordial Universe
is investigated by using the dynamics of fermion fields within the context of
Einstein-Cartan theory, where apart from the curvature the space-time is also
described by a torsion field. The model analyzed here has only a fermion field
as the source of the gravitational field. The term associated with the spin of
the fermion field plays the role of the inflaton which contributes to an
accelerated regime whereas the one related to the fermion mass behaves as a
matter field and is the responsible for a decelerated regime. Hence, by taking
into account the spin of a massive fermion field it is possible to characterize
the transition from the accelerated to the decelerated periods of the
primordial Universe.
