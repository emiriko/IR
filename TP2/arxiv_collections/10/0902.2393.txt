The decays D(s)+- -> mu+- nu and D(s)+- -> tau+- nu have traditionally been
used to measure the D(s)+- meson decay constant f_D(s). Recent measurements at
CLEO-c and the B factories suggest a branching ratio for both decays somewhat
higher than the Standard Model prediction using f_D(s) from unquenched lattice
calculations. The charged Higgs boson (H+-) in the Two Higgs Doublet Model
(Type II) would also mediate these decays, but any sizeable contribution from
H+- can only suppress the branching ratios and consequently is now slightly
disfavoured. It is shown that constraints on the parameters tan(beta) and m_H+-
from such decays can be competitive with and complementary to analogous
constraints derived from the leptonic meson decays B+- -> tau+- nu_tau and K+-
-> mu+- nu_mu, especially if lattice calculations eventually prefer f_D(s) <
250 MeV.
