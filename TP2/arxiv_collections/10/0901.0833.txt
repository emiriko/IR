The very young open cluster (OC) NGC 2244 in the Rosette Nebula was studied
with field-star-decontaminated 2MASS photometry, which shows the main-sequence
(MS) stars and an abundant pre-MS (PMS) population. Fundamental and structural
parameters were derived with colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), stellar radial
density profiles (RDPs) and mass functions (MFs). Most previous studies centred
NGC 2244 close to the bright K0V star 12 Monocerotis, which is not a cluster
member. Instead, the near-IR RDP indicates a pronounced core near the O5 star
HD 46150. We derive an age within 1--6 Myr, an absorption $\aV=1.7\pm0.2$, a
distance from the Sun $\ds=1.6\pm0.2$ kpc ($\approx1.5$ kpc outside the Solar
circle), an MF slope $\chi=0.91\pm0.13$ and a total (MS+PMS) stellar mass of
$\sim625 \ms$. Its RDP is characterised by the core and cluster radii
$\rc\approx5.6\arcmin$ ($\approx2.6$ pc) and $\rl\approx10\arcmin$
($\approx4.7$ pc), respectively. Departure from dynamical equilibrium is
suggested by the abnormally large core radius and the marked central stellar
excess. We also investigate the elusive neighbouring OC NGC 2239, which is
low-mass ($m_{MS+PMS}\approx301 \ms$), young ($5\pm4$ Myr) rather absorbed
($\aV=3.4\pm0.2$), and located in the background of NGC 2244 at $\ds=3.9\pm0.4$
kpc. Its RDP follows a King-like function of $\rc\approx0.5\arcmin\approx0.5$
pc and $\rl\approx5.0\arcmin\approx5.6$ pc. The MF slope, $\chi=1.24\pm0.06$,
is essentially Salpeter's IMF. NGC 2244 is probably doomed to dissolution in a
few $10^7$ yr. Wide-field extractions and field-star decontamination increase
the stellar statistics and enhance both CMDs and RDPs, which is essential for
faint and bright star clusters.
