The literature on void superlattice formation observed under irradation of
metals and insulators is analyzed with a special attention to the
self-organization; a general scenario of this process is discussed. A simple
relation for the superlattice parameter as a function of the dose rate and
temperature is suggested, in a good agreement with existing experimental data.
Special attention is paid to analysis of the halogen gas void formation in an
electron-irradiated CaF2
