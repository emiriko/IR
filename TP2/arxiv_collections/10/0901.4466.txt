Plasmodium of \emph{Physarum polycephalum} is a single huge (visible by naked
eye) cell with myriad of nuclei. The plasmodium is a promising substrate for
non-classical, nature-inspired, computing devices. It is capable for
approximation of shortest path, computation of planar proximity graphs and
plane tessellations, primitive memory and decision-making. The unique
properties of the plasmodium make it an ideal candidate for a role of amorphous
biological robots with massive parallel information processing and distributed
inputs and outputs. We show that when adhered to light-weight object resting on
a water surface the plasmodium can propel the object by oscillating its
protoplasmic pseudopodia. In experimental laboratory conditions and
computational experiments we study phenomenology of the plasmodium-floater
system, and possible mechanisms of controlling motion of objects propelled by
on board plasmodium.
