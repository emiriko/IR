We present new XMM-Newton observations of the supernova remnant N120 in the
LMC, and numerical simulations on the evolution of this supernova remnant which
we compare with the X-ray observations. The supernova remnant N120, together
with several HII regions, forms a large nebular complex5D (also called N120)
whose shape resembles a semicircular ring. From the XMM-Newton data we generate
images and spectra of this remnant in the energy band between 0.2 to 2.0 keV.
The images show that the X-ray emission is brighter towards the east (i.e.,
towards the rim of the large nebular complex). The EPIC/MOS1 and MOS2 data
reveal a thermal spectrum in soft X-rays. 2D axisymmetric numerical simulations
with the Yguaz\'u-a code were carried out assuming that the remnant is
expanding into an inhomogeneous ISM with an exponential density gradient and
showing that thermal conduction effects are negligible. Simulated X-ray
emission maps were obtained from the numerical simulations in order to compare
them with the observations. We find good agreement between the XMM-Newton data,
previous optical kinematic data, and the numerical simulations; the simulations
reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity and surface brightness distribution. We
have also detected more extended diffuse X-ray emission probably due to the
N120 large HII complex or superbubble.
