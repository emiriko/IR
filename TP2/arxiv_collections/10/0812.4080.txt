We present an overview of recent STAR results on strangeness production in
p+p and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. In both Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions we
show the centrality dependencies of bulk yield and mid-$p_{T}$ spectrum
measurements with new comparisons to theory. The latest $v_{2}$ results for
strange particles are presented and prospects for strangeness production in the
low energy scan program will be outlined. Finally, we report new measurements
of strangeness fragmentation functions for jets in p+p collisions.
