The years 1998 to 2008 were very exciting years for cosmology. It was a
pleasure to accept this invitation to describe my contributions to the
development of our knowledge and understanding of the universe over the course
of the past decade. Here, I begin by describing some of my work on radio
galaxies as a modified standard yardstick and go on to describe
model-independent studies of the accelerating universe and the properties of
the dark energy. During the course of these studies, I came upon interesting
ways to study the spin and other properties of supermassive black holes, some
of which are briefly mentioned.
