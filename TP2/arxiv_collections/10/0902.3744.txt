Coherent states (CS) for non-Hermitian systems are introduced as eigenstates
of pseudo-Hermitian boson annihilation operators. The set of these CS includes
two subsets which form bi-normalized and bi-overcomplete system of states. The
subsets consist of eigenstates of two complementary lowering pseudo-Hermitian
boson operators. Explicit constructions are provided on the example of
one-parameter family of pseudo-boson ladder operators. The wave functions of
the eigenstates of the two complementary number operators, which form a
bi-orthonormal system of Fock states, are found to be proportional to new
polynomials, that are bi-orthogonal and can be regarded as a generalization of
standard Hermite polynomials.
