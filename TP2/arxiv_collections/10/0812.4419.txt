We suggest predictive scenarios for neutrino masses which provide a common
origin for CP violation in early universe cosmology and in neutrino
oscillations. Our setup is the seesaw mechanism in the context of MSSM with two
quasi-degenerate right-handed neutrinos, with baryon asymmetry generated via
resonant leptogenesis. Three different models are found with specific textures
in the Yukawa coupling matrices, each with a single phase which controls
leptogenesis and neutrino CP violation. One model leads to normal hierarchy of
light neutrino masses and the prediction tan theta_13 = sin theta_12
\sqrt{m_2/m_3}, resulting in a value of the reactor mixing angle theta_13 very
close to the current experimental lower limit. The other two models predict
inverted hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum with the sum rules sin^2 theta_12
= 1/2-tan theta_23 sin theta_ 13 cos delta and sin^2 theta_12 = 1/2+cot
theta_23 sin theta_13 cos delta respectively. We obtain a lower bound for the
phase |delta| in the normal hierarchical model, and a narrow range for |delta|
for the inverted hierarchical model from cosmology. In our scenario, the
mass-splitting between the quasi-degenerate right-handed neutrinos arise via
renormalization group flow, which provides a lower limit on the MSSM parameter
tan beta > 12. The right-handed neutrino masses can be as low as TeV, which
would avoid the gravitino problem generic to supersymmetric models.
