We consider the problem of optimization of an effective trapping potential in
a nanostructure with a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. The optimization is
performed to achieve certain target optical properties of the system. We
formulate and solve the optimization problem for a nanostructure that serves
either as a single molecule detector or as a "quantum disguise" for a single
molecule.
