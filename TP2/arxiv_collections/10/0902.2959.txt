We present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected by
the AGILE satellite during observations performed from July 9, 2007 to June 30,
2008. Catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data over
the entire time period. AGILE, launched in April 2007, is an ASI mission
devoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 MeV - 50 GeV energy range, with
simultaneous X-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 keV band. This catalog is
based on Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data for energies greater than 100
MeV. For the first AGILE catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with a
high-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within the
central zone of the instrument Field of View (radius of 40 degrees). This is a
significance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limited
sample due to the non-uniform first year AGILE sky coverage. The catalog
includes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidate
pulsars, 13 with Blazars (7 FSRQ, 4 BL Lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with HMXRBs, 2
with SNRs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.
