We consider corrections to nucleon correlation functions arising from times
that are far from the asymptotic limit. For such times, the single nucleon
state is contaminated by the pion-nucleon and pion-delta continuum. We use
heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory to derive the spectral representation
of the nucleon two-point function. Finite time corrections to the axial current
correlation function are also derived. Pion-nucleon excited state contributions
drive the axial correlator upward, while contributions from the interference of
pion-delta and pion-nucleon states drive the axial correlator downward. Our
results can be compared qualitatively to optimized nucleon correlators
calculated in lattice QCD, because the chiral corrections characterize only
low-energy excitations above the ground state. We show that improved nucleon
operators can lead to an underestimation of the nucleon axial charge.
