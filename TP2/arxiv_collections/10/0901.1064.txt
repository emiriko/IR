We describe a new sample of 226 GPS (GHz-Peaked Spectrum) source candidates
selected using simultaneous 1-22 GHz multi-frequency observations with the
RATAN-600 radio telescope. Sixty objects in our sample are identified as GPS
source candidates for the first time. The candidates were selected on the basis
of their broad-band radio spectra only. We discuss the spectral and variability
properties of selected objects of different optical classes.
