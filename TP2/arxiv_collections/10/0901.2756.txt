Single spin asymmetry (SSA) is a twist-3 observable in the collinear
factorization approach. We present a twist-3 single-spin-dependent cross
section formula for the pion production in pp-collision, p^\uparrow p\to\pi X,
relevant to RHIC experiment. In particular, we calculate the soft-fermion-pole
(SFP) contribution to the cross section from the quark-gluon correlation
functions. We show that its effect can be as large as the soft-gluon-pole (SGP)
contribution owing to the large SFP partonic hard cross section, even though
the derivative of the SFP function does not participate in the cross section.
