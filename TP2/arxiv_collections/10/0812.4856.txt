We consider a connection between the holographic dark energy density and the
kinetic k-essence energy density in a flat FRW universe. With the choice
$c\geq1$, the holographic dark energy can be described by a kinetic k-essence
scalar field in a certain way. In this paper we show this kinetic k-essential
description of the holographic dark energy with $c\geq1$ and reconstruct the
kinetic k-essence function F(X).
