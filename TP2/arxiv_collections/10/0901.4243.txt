We explore the possibility to discriminate between certain strongly-coupled
technicolor (TC) models and warped extra-dimensional models where the Standard
Model fields are propagating in the extra dimension. We consider a generic
QCD-like TC model with running coupling as well as two TC models with walking
dynamics. We argue that due to the different production mechanisms for the
lowest-lying composite tensor state in these TC theories compared to the first
Kaluza-Klein graviton mode of warped extra-dimensional case, it is possible to
distinguish between these models based on the angular analysis of the
reconstructed longitudinal Z bosons in the $pp \to ZZ \to $ four charged
leptons channel.
