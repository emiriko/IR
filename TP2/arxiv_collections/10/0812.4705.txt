In this contribution, we discuss a total cross-section model which can be
applied to both photon and purely hadronic processes. We find that the model
can reproduce photo-production cross-sections, as well as extrapolations of
gamma* p processes to gamma p using vector meson dominance models, with minimal
modifications from the proton case.
