The recent PAMELA and ATIC/Fermi/HESS experiments have observed an excess of
electrons and positrons, but not anti-protons, in the high energy cosmic rays.
To explain this result, we construct a decaying hidden dark matter model in
string theory compactification that incorporates the following two ingredients,
the hidden dark matter scenario in warped compactification and the
phenomenological proposal of hidden light particles that decay to the Standard
Model. In this model, on higher dimensional warped branes, various warped
Kaluza-Klein particles and the zero-mode of gauge field play roles of the
hidden dark matter or mediators to the Standard Model.
