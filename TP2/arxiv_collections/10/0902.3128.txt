The pure gravity Lagrangian can be written as the "square" of the pure
Yang-Mills Lagrangian to second order in coupling constants. This paper uses
this form of the gravity Lagrangian as a starting point to arrive at a compact
light-cone superspace Lagrangian for N=8 Supergravity to order $\kappa$^2.
