These lecture notes are intended to provide a simple overview of the physics
of geometrically frustrated magnets. The emphasis is on classical and
semiclassical treatments of the statistical mechanics and dynamics of
frustrated Heisenberg models, and on the ways in which the results provide an
understanding of some of the main observed properties of these systems.
