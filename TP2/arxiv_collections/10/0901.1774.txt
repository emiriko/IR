Vortex entry into (110) oriented YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ films has been
studied by tunneling into Andreev - Saint-James bound states, whose energy is
shifted by surface currents. At low temperatures, the characteristic field for
vortex entry has been found to increase up to values several times higher than
that of the Bean-Livingston entry field for conventional superconductors, in
agreement with recent theoretical predictions.
