I explore entanglement dynamics in a three qubit system comparing the ability
of entanglement witnesses to detect tri-partite entanglement to the phenomenon
of entanglement sudden death (ESD). Using a system subject to dephasing I
invoke entanglement witnesses to detect tri-partite GHZ and W-type entanglement
and compare the evolution of their detection capabilites with the evolution of
the negativity, bi-partite concurrence, and tri-partite negativity.
Interestingly, I find a state in which there is no concurrence or tri-partite
negativity but there is entanglement. Finally, I utilize a three qubit quantum
error correction (QEC) code to address how ESD affects the abilities of quantum
error correction.
