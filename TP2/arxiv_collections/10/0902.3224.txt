We study numerically the effects of loop quantum gravity motivated
corrections on massless scalar field collapse in Painlev\'e-Gullstrand
coordinates. Near criticality, the system exhibits Choptuik scaling with the
added features of a mass gap and a new scaling relationship dependant upon the
quantum length scale. The quantum corrected collapse exhibits a radiation-like
phase which resolves the singularity: the black hole consists of a compact
region of space-time bounded by a single, smooth trapping horizon. The
"evaporation" is not complete but leaves behind an outward moving remnant.
