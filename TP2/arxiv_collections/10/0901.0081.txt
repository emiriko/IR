The beta asymmetry parameter A for the pure Gamow-Teller decay of 114In is
reported. The low temperature nuclear orientation method was combined with a
GEANT4 based simulation code allowing for the first time to address in detail
the effects of scattering and of the magnetic field. The result, A = -0.994 +/-
0.010stat +/- 0.010syst, constitutes the most accurate value for the asymmetry
parameter of a nuclear beta transition to date. The value is in agreement with
the Standard Model prediction of A = -1 and provides new limits on tensor type
charged weak currents.
