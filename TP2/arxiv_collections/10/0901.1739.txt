We calculate the electronic and atomic structure of (MnO)n (n=1-4) using the
HF exchange, VWN, PBE and B3LYP exchange-correlation functionals. We also
perform diffusion Monte Carlo calculation to evaluate more accurate energies.
We ompare these results and discuss the accuracy of the exchange-correlation
functionals.
