This manual describes the public code 2HDMC which can be used to perform
calculations in a general, CP-conserving, two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). The
program features simple conversion between different parametrizations of the
2HDM potential, a flexible Yukawa sector specification with choices of
different Z_2-symmetries or more general couplings, a tree-level decay library
including all two-body - and some three-body - decay modes for the Higgs
bosons, and the possibility to calculate observables of interest for
constraining the 2HDM parameter space, as well as theoretical constraints from
positivity and unitarity.
