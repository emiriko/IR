Energy transfer to acoustic phonons is the dominant low-temperature cooling
channel of electrons in a crystal.For cold neutral graphene we find that the
weak cooling power of its acoustical modes relative to the heat capacity of the
system leads to a power law decay of the electronic temperature when far from
equilibrium. For heavily doped graphene a high electronic temperature is shown
to initially decrease linearly with time at a rate proportional to n^(3/2) with
n being the electronic density. We discuss the relative importance of optical
and acoustic phonons to cooling.
