We derive a form of spectral representations for all bosonic and fermionic
propagators in the real-time formulation of field theory at finite temperature
and chemical potential. Besides being simple and symmetrical between the
bosonic and the fermionic types, these representations depend explicitly on
analytic functions only. This last property allows a simple evaluation of loop
integrals in the energy variables over propagators in this form, even in
presence of chemical potentials, which is not possible over their conventional
form.
