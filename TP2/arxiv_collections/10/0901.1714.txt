Previously Liao and Shuryak [\textbf{Phys. Rev C (2008)}] have investigated
electrical flux tubes in monopole plasmas, where magnetic fields are
non-solenoidal in quark-QCD plasmas. In this paper slow dynamos in diffusive
plasma [{\textbf{Phys. Plasmas \textbf{15} (2008)}}] filaments (thin tubes) are
obtained in the case of monopole plasmas. In the absence of diffusion the
magnetic field decays in the Early Universe. The torsion is highly chaotic in
dissipative large scale dynamos in the presence of magnetic monopoles. The
magnetic field is given by the Heaviside step function in order to represent
the non-uniform stretching of the dynamo filament. These results are obtained
outside the junction condition. Stringent limits to the monopole flux were
found by Lewis et al [\textbf{Phys Rev D (2000)}] by using the dispute between
the dynamo action and monopole flux. Since magnetic monopoles flow dispute the
dynamo action, it seems reasonable that their presence leads to a slow dynamo
action in the best hypothesis or a decay of the magnetic field. Hindmarsh et al
have computed the magnetic energy decay in the early universe as
${E}_{M}\approx{t^{-0.5}}$, while in our slow dynamo case linearization of the
growth rate leads to a variation od magnetic energy of
${\delta}{E}_{M}\approx{t}$, due to the presence of magnetic monopoles. Da Rios
equations of vortex filaments are used to place constraints on the geometry of
monopole plasma filaments.
