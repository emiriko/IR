We discuss a stochastic approach for reconstructing the native structures of
proteins from the knowledge of the "effective connectivity", which is a
one-dimensional structural profile constructed as a linear combination of the
eigenvectors of the contact map of the target structure. The structural profile
is used to bias a search of the conformational space towards the target
structure in a Monte Carlo scheme operating on a C_alpha-chain of uniform,
finite thickness. Structure information thus enters the folding dynamics via
the effective connectivity, but the interaction is not restricted to pairs of
amino acids that form native contacts, resulting in a free energy landscape
which does not rely on the assumption of minimal frustration. Moreover,
effective connectivity vectors can be predicted more readily from the amino
acid sequence of proteins than the corresponding contact maps, thus suggesting
that the stochastic protocol presented here could be effectively combined with
other current methods for predicting native structures.
