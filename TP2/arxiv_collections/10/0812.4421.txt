From measurements of the current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) total specific
resistance (AR = area times resistance) of sputtered Pd/Ir multilayers, we
derive the interface specific resistance, 2AR(Pd/Ir) = 1.02 +/- 0.06 fOhmm^2,
for this metal pair with closely similar lattice parameters. Assuming a single
fcc crystal structure with the average lattice parameter, no-free-parameter
calculations, including only spd orbitals, give for perfect interfaces,
2AR(Pd/Ir)(Perf) = 1.21 +/-0.1 fOhmm^2, and for interfaces composed of two
monolayers of a random 50%-50% alloy, 2AR(Pd/Ir)(50/50) = 1.22 +/- 0.1 fOhmm^2.
Within mutual uncertainties, these values fall just outside the range of the
experimental value. Updating to add f-orbitals gives 2AR(Pd/Ir)(Perf) = 1.10
+/- 0.1 fOhmm^2 and 2AR(Pd/Ir)(50-50) = 1.13 +/- 0.1 fOhmm^2, values now
compatible with the experimental one. We also update, with f-orbitals,
calculations for other pairs
