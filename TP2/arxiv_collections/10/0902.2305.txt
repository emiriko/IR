We report on spectroscopy and time-of-flight measurements using an 18 keV
fast-pulsed photoelectron source of adjustable intensity, ranging from single
photoelectrons per pulse to 5 photoelectrons per microsecond at pulse
repetition rates of up to 10 kHz. Short pulses between 40 ns and 40
microseconds in length were produced by switching light emitting diodes with
central output wavelengths of 265 nm and 257 nm, in the deep ultraviolet (or
UV-C) regime, at kHz frequencies. Such photoelectron sources can be useful
calibration devices for testing the properties of high-resolution electrostatic
spectrometers, like the ones used in current neutrino mass searches.
