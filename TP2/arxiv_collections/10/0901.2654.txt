We report Raman measurements on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d single crystals which allow
us to quantitavely evaluate the doping dependence of the density of Cooper
pairs in the superconducting state. We show that the drastic loss of Cooper
pairs in the antinodal region as the doping level is reduced, is concomitant
with a deep alteration of the quasiparticles dynamic above Tc and consistent
with a pseudogap which competes with superconductivity. Our data also reveal
that the overall density of Cooper pairs evolves with doping, distinctly from
the superfluid density above the doping level pc=0.2.
