Recent analytical and computational advances in the theory of large-scale
dynamos are reviewed. The importance of the magnetic helicity constraint is
apparent even without invoking mean-field theory. The tau approximation yields
expressions that show how the magnetic helicity gets incorporated into
mean-field theory. The test-field method allows an accurate numerical
determination of turbulent transport coefficients in linear and nonlinear
regimes. Finally, some critical views on the solar dynamo are being offered and
targets for future research are highlighted.
