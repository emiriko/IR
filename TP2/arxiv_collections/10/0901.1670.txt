We investigate the recently proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence in the context
of heterotic string theory. The Kerr/CFT correspondence states that the
near-horizon states of an extremal four (or higher) dimensional black hole
could be identified with a certain chiral conformal field theory under the
conjecture that the central charges from the non-gravitational fields vanish.
The corresponding Virasoro algebra is generated by a class of diffeomorphisms
which preserves the appropriate boundary conditions on the near-horizon
geometry. To understand the chiral conformal field theory, we consider the
class of extremal Kerr-Sen black hole (that contains three non-gravitational
fields) as a class of solutions in the low energy limit (effective field
theory) of heterotic string theory. We derive the expression of the conserved
charges for the extremal Kerr-Sen solutions that contain dilaton, abelian gauge
filed and antisymmetric tensor filed. We confirm and extend the validity of the
conjecture (that the central charges from the non-gravitational fields vanish)
for theories including antisymmetric tensor fields. We combine the calculated
central charges with the expected form of the temperature using the Cardy
formula to obtain the entropy of the extremal black hole microscopically; in
agreement with the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the extremal black
hole.
