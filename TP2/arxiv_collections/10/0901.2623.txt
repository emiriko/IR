One-dimensional model for study of sub--femtosecond experiment with metal
surface is put forward. The important features of the system, such as the
pseudopotential for electron motion in the metal bulk, abrupt decrease of the
normal to the surface external electromagnetic field in the bulk, finite value
of the mean free path for electrons in the metal, and action on the ejected
electron by the (stationary) screened positive hole in the metal are included
in the model. The results obtained reveal dependence of the streaking effect on
the final energy of the ejected electron. Meanwhile, the dependence of the
streaking on the character of the initial state (localized or delocalized)
appears to be more pronounced. This result may provide an additional mechanism
for interpretation of the results of very recent experiment [Cavalieri
\emph{et.al}, NATURE \textbf{449} 1029-1032 2007 ].
