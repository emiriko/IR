We invent an ac-driven quantum motor consisting of two different, interacting
ultracold atoms placed into a ring-shaped optical lattice and submerged in a
pulsating magnetic field. While the first atom carries a current, the second
one serves as a quantum starter. For fixed zero-momentum initial conditions the
asymptotic carrier velocity converges to a unique non-zero value. We also
demonstrate that this quantum motor performs work against a constant load.
