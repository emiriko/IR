The performance of non-preemptive M/M/1 queueing system with two priority is
analyzed. By using complementary variable method to make vector Markov process
and analyzing the state-change equations of the queueing system, the generating
function of two kinds of customers'length distribution are derived under
non-preemptive priority .Through further discussion, the probability of the
server that it is working or free and average length of two kinds of customers
are also derived.
