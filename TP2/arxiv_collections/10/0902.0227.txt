We report repeated single-shot measurements of the two-electron spin state in
a GaAs double quantum dot. The readout scheme allows measurement with fidelity
above 90% with a 7 microsecond cycle time. Hyperfine-induced precession between
singlet and triplet states of the two-electron system are directly observed, as
nuclear Overhauser fields are quasi-static on the time scale of the measurement
cycle. Repeated measurements on millisecond to second time scales reveal
evolution of the nuclear environment.
