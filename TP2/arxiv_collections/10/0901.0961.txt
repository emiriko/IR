We examine phenomenon of electromagnetic transparency in semiconductor
superlattices (having various miniband dispersion laws) in the presence of
multi-frequency periodic and non-periodic electric fields. Effects of induced
transparency and spontaneous generation of static fields are discussed. We paid
a special attention on a self-induced electromagnetic transparency and its
correlation to dynamic electron localization. Processes and mechanisms of the
transparency formation, collapse, and stabilization in the presence of external
fields are studied. In particular, we present the numerical results of the time
evolution of the superlattice current in an external biharmonic field showing
main channels of transparency collapse and its partial stabilization in the
case of low electron density superlattices.
