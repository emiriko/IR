The atomic masses of 130Te and 130Xe have been obtained by measuring
cyclotron frequency ratios of pairs of triply-charged ions simultaneously
trapped in a Penning trap. The results with one standard deviation uncertainty
are M(130Te) = 129.906 222 744(16) u and M(130Xe) = 129.903 509 351(15) u.
Allowing for cancellation of systematic errors in the mass difference, the
double-beta-decay Q-value, required for searches for the neutrino-less
double-beta-decay of 130Te, is determined to be Qbb (130Te) = 2527.518(13) keV.
