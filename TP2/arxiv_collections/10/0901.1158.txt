A new method for automated detection of polar coronal holes is presented.
This method, called perimeter tracing, uses a series of 171, 195, and 304 \AA\
full disk images from the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on SOHO
over solar cycle 23 to measure the perimeter of polar coronal holes as they
appear on the limbs. Perimeter tracing minimizes line-of-sight obscurations
caused by the emitting plasma of the various wavelengths by taking measurements
at the solar limb. Perimeter tracing also allows for the polar rotation period
to emerge organically from the data as 33 days. We have called this the Harvey
rotation rate and count Harvey rotations starting 4 January 1900. From the
measured perimeter, we are then able to fit a curve to the data and derive an
area within the line of best fit. We observe the area of the northern polar
hole area in 1996, at the beginning of solar cycle 23, to be about 4.2% of the
total solar surface area and about 3.6% in 2007. The area of the southern polar
hole is observed to be about 4.0% in 1996 and about 3.4% in 2007. Thus, both
the north and south polar hole areas are no more than 15% smaller now than they
were at the beginning of cycle 23. This compares to the polar magnetic field
measured to be about 40% less now than it was a cycle ago.
