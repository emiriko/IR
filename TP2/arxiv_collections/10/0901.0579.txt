We propose a large-scale quantum computer architecture by stabilizing a
single large linear ion chain in a very simple trap geometry. By confining ions
in an anharmonic linear trap with nearly uniform spacing between ions, we show
that high-fidelity quantum gates can be realized in large linear ion crystals
under the Doppler temperature based on coupling to a near-continuum of
transverse motional modes with simple shaped laser pulses.
