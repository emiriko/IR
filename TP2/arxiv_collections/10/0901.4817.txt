I propose a quantum imaging method that can beat the Rayleigh-Abbe
diffraction limit and achieve de Broglie resolution without requiring a
multiphoton absorber as the detector. Using the same non-classical states of
light as those for quantum lithography, the proposed method requires only
intensity measurements, followed by image post-processing, to produce the same
complex image patterns as those in quantum lithography. The method is expected
to be experimentally realizable using current technology.
