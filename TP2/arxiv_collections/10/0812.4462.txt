Low frequency plasma oscillations in superconducting tubes are considered.
The emergence of two different dimensionality regimes of plasma oscillations in
tubes, exhibiting a crossover from one-dimensional to two-dimensional behavior,
depending on whether $k R\ll 1$ or $k R\gg 1$, where $k$ is the plasmon wave
vector and $R$ is the radius of the tube, is discussed. The Aharonov-Bohm
effect pertaining to plasma oscillations in superconducting tubes and rings,
resulting in an oscillatory behavior of the plasmon frequency as a function of
the magnetic flux, with a flux quantum period $hc/2e$ (analog of the
Little-Parks effect), is studied. The amplitude of the oscillations is
proportional to $(\xi/R)^2$, where $\xi$ is the superconducting coherence
length.
