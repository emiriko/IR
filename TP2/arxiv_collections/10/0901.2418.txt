A non-perturbative effective model is derived for the Higgs sector of the
standard model, described by a simple scalar theory. The renormalized couplings
are determined by the derivatives of the Gaussian Effective Potential that are
known to be the sum of infinite bubble graphs contributing to the vertex
functions. A good agreement has been found with strong coupling lattice
simulations when a comparison can be made.
