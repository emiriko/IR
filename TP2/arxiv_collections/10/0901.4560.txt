We describe length and time rescaling across the paraelectric to
ferroelectric phase transition in BaTiO$_3$. Small ferroelectric clusters are
unable to grow in the paraelectric phase and exist for a short period of time
only. The onset of the phase transition invokes a rescaling of both size and
time lenghts as necessary ingredients for ferroelectricity to come into
existence. The growing of ferroelectric domains involves correlated chains of
Ti-O dipoles, which causes domain wall rigidity and domain shape stability.
Ferroelectric nanodomains may host islands of opposite polarization
(antiferroelectric defects), which appear as an intrinsic feature of the
growing BaTiO$_3$ ferroelectric material
