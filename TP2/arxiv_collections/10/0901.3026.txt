Stochastic backgrounds or relic gravitons, if ever detected, will constitute
a prima facie evidence of physical processes taking place during the earliest
stages of the evolution of the plasma. The essentials of the stochastic
backgrounds of relic gravitons are hereby introduced and reviewed. The pivotal
observables customarily employed to infer the properties of the relic gravitons
are discussed both in the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm as well as in
neighboring contexts. The complementarity between experiments measuring the
polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (such as, for instance, WMAP,
Capmap, Quad, Cbi, just to mention a few) and wide band interferometers (e.g.
Virgo, Ligo, Geo, Tama) is emphasized. While the analysis of the microwave sky
strongly constrains the low-frequency tail of the relic graviton spectrum,
wide-band detectors are sensitive to much higher frequencies where the spectral
energy density depends chiefly upon the (poorly known) rate of
post-inflationary expansion.
