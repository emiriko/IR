We present the first time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT)
calculation on a light harvesting triad carotenoid-diaryl-porphyrin-C60.
Besides the numerical challenge that the ab initio study of the electronic
structure of such a large system presents, we show that TDDFT is able to
provide an accurate description of the excited state properties of the system.
In particular we calculate the photo-absorption spectrum of the supra-molecular
assembly, and we provide an interpretation of the photo-excitation mechanism in
terms of the properties of the component moieties. The spectrum is in good
agreement with experimental data, and provides useful insight on the
photo-induced charge transfer mechanism which characterizes the system.
