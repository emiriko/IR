We adapt and refine methods developed by Abramenko and
Devillers--K\"ohl--M\"uhlherr in order to establish the sphericity of the Phan
geometries of type B_n and C_n, and their generalizations. As an application we
determine the finiteness length of the unitary form of certain hyperbolic
Kac--Moody groups. We also reproduce the finiteness length of the unitary form
of the groups Sp_{2n}(GF(q^2)[t,t^{-1}]). Another application is the first
published proof of the Phan-type theorem of type F_4. Within the revision of
the classification of the finite simple groups this concludes the revision of
Phan's theorems and their extension to the non-simply laced diagrams. We also
reproduce the Phan-type theorems of types B_n and C_n.
