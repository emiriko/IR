In this paper, we construct eight infinite families of binary linear codes
associated with double cosets with respect to certain maximal parabolic
subgroup of the special orthogonal group $SO^-(2n,2^r)$. Then we obtain four
infinite families of recursive formulas for the power moments of Kloosterman
sums and four those of 2-dimensional Kloosterman sums in terms of the
frequencies of weights in the codes. This is done via Pless power moment
identity and by utilizing the explicit expressions of exponential sums over
those double cosets related to the evaluations of "Gauss sums" for the
orthogonal groups $O^-(2n,2^r)$
