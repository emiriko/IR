The Zipf power law and its connection with the inhomogeneity of the system is
investigated. We describe the statistical distributions of the domain masses in
the Potts model near the temperature-induced phase transition. We found that
the statistical distribution near the critical point is described by the power
law form with a long tail, while beyond the critical point the power law tail
is suppressed.
