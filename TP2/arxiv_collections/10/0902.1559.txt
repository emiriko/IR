The first three months of sky-survey operation with the Fermi Gamma Ray Space
Telescope (Fermi) Large Area Telescope (LAT) reveals 132 bright sources at
|b|>10 deg with test statistic greater than 100 (corresponding to about 10
sigma). Two methods, based on the CGRaBS, CRATES and BZCat catalogs, indicate
high-confidence associations of 106 of these sources with known AGNs. This
sample is referred to as the LAT Bright AGN Sample (LBAS). It contains two
radio galaxies, namely Centaurus A and NGC 1275, and 104 blazars consisting of
57 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 42 BL Lac objects, and 5 blazars with
uncertain classification. Four new blazars were discovered on the basis of the
LAT detections. Remarkably, the LBAS includes 10 high-energy peaked BL Lacs
(HBLs), sources which were so far hard to detect in the GeV range. Another 10
lower-confidence associations are found. Only thirty three of the sources, plus
two at |b|>10 deg, were previously detected with EGRET, probably due to the
variable nature of these sources. The analysis of the gamma-ray properties of
the LBAS sources reveals that the average GeV spectra of BL Lac objects are
significantly harder than the spectra of FSRQs. No significant correlation
between radio and peak gamma-ray fluxes is observed. Blazar log N - log S and
luminosity functions are constructed to investigate the evolution of the
different blazar classes, with positive evolution indicated for FSRQs but none
for BLLacs. The contribution of LAT-blazars to the total extragalactic
gamma-ray intensity is estimated.
