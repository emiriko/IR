Diamond nanocrystals containing NV color centers are positioned with
100-nanometer-scale accuracy in the near-field of a high-Q SiO2 microdisk
cavity using a fiber taper. The cavity modified nanocrystal photoluminescence
is studied, with Fano-like quantum interference features observed in the
far-field emission spectrum. A quantum optical model of the system is proposed,
from which the NV- zero phonon line coherent coupling rate to the microdisk is
estimated to be 28 MHz for a nearly optimally placed nanocrystal.
