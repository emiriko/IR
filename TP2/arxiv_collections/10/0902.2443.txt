We present new exact solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell system in static
spherically symmetric interior spacetimes. For a particular form of the
gravitational potentials and the electric field intensity, it is possible to
integrate the system in closed form. For specific parameter values it is
possible to find new exact models for the Einstein-Maxwell system in terms of
elementary functions. Our model includes a particular charged solution found
previously; this suggests that our generalised solution could be used to
describe a relativistic compact sphere. A physical analysis indicates that the
solutions describe realistic matter distributions.
