Solar analogues are fundamental targets for a better understanding of our Sun
and our Solar System. Usually, this research is limited to field stars, which
offer several advantages and limitations. In this work, we present the results
of a research of solar twins performed for the first time in a open cluster,
namely M67. Our analysis allowed us to find five solar twins and also to derive
a solar colour of (B-V)0=0.649+/-0.016 and a cluster distance modulus of
9.63+/-0.08. This study encourages us to apply the same method to other open
clusters, and to do further investigations for planet search in the solar twins
we find.
