We examine relation between neutrino oscillation parameters and prediction of
lepton flavor violation, in light of deviations from tri-bimaximal mixing. Our
study shows that upcoming experimental searches for lepton flavor violation
process can provide useful implications for neutrino mass spectrum and mixing
angles. With simple structure of heavy right-handed neutrino and supersymmetry
breaking sectors, the discovery of tau \to mu gamma decay determines neutrino
mass hierarchy if large (order 0.1) reactor angle is established.
