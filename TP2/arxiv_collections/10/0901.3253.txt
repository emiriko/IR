A systematic approach is presented to construct non-homogeneous two- and
three-qubit Bell-type inequalities. When projector-like terms are subtracted
from homogeneous two-qubit CHSH polynomial, non-homogeneous inequalities are
attained and the maximal quantum mechanical violation asymptotically equals a
constant with the subtracted terms becoming sufficiently large. In the case of
three-qubit system, it is found that most significant three-qubit inequalities
presented in literature can be recovered in our framework. We aslo discuss the
behavior of such inequalities in the loophole-free Bell test and obtain
corresponding thresholds of detection efficiency.
