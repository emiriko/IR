The relation between ab initio molecular dynamics formalism and the
electron-phonon interaction formalism [P.B. Allen and V. Heine, J. Phys. C 9,
2305 (1976)] is explored. The fundamental quantity obtained in the AIMD
formalism - total energy for any configuration - is also obtained from the
formalism (ES-DWF) that incorporates the role of Debye-Waller Factor in
electronic structure calculations. The two formalisms are exactly equivalent
and represent the direct and perturbation theory approaches to determine total
energy. This equivalence allows either formalism to be used depending on the
requirement - ES-DWF for a priori theoretical analysis and AIMD for ab initio
modeling of the effect of thermal vibrations. Combining the two formalisms
makes the ES-DWF formalism into an ab initio method and increases the range of
problems that can be modeled ab initio. It is also theoretically possible to
obtain self-consistent band structures from AIMD calculations. This study
clarifies the incorrect assumptions regarding the two formalisms that exist in
published literature. By combining the two formalisms and including self-energy
effects, more accurate results can be obtained, ab initio, within the adiabatic
approximation, than by using AIMD alone.
