The progress of the prostate-specific antigen after radical prostatectomy is
observed for a patient in order to extract information on the growth mode of
the tumor cells. An initial fast-growth mode goes over to a slower power-law
regime within two years of surgery. We argue that such studies may help
determine the appropriate time window for subsequent therapies in order to
increase the life expectancy of the patient.
