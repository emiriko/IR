The study of PopI and PopII indicators in galaxies has a profound impact on
our understanding of galaxy evolution. Their present (z=0) ratio suggests that
the star formation history of galaxies was primarily dictated by their global
mass. Since 1989 Luis Carrasco and I spent most of our sleepless nights
gathering H_alpha and near infrared surface photometry of galaxies in the local
Universe and focused most of our scientific career on these two indicators
trying to convince the community that the mass was the key parameter to their
evolution. We were unsuccessful, until in 2004 the Sloan team rediscovered this
phenomenon and named it "downsizing"
