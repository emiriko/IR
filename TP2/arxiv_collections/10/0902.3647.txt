Ionic transport in nanopores is a fundamentally and technologically important
problem in view of its occurrence in biological processes and its impact on
novel DNA sequencing applications. Using microscopic calculations, here we show
that ion transport may exhibit strong nonlinearities as a function of the pore
radius reminiscent of the conductance quantization steps as a function of the
transverse cross section of quantum point contacts. In the present case,
however, conductance steps originate from the break up of the hydration layers
that form around ions in aqueous solution. Once in the pore, the water
molecules form wavelike structures due to multiple scattering at the surface of
the pore walls and interference with the radial waves around the ion. We
discuss these effects as well as the conditions under which the step-like
features in the ionic conductance should be experimentally observable.
