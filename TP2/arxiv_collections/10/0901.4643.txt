This work presents a new Visual Basic 6.0 application for estimating the
fractal dimension of images, based on an optimized version of the box-counting
algorithm. Following the attempt to separate the real information from noise,
we considered also the family of all band-pass filters with the same band-width
(specified as parameter). The fractal dimension can be thus represented as a
function of the pixel color code. The program was used for the study of
paintings cracks, as an additional tool which can help the critic to decide if
an artistic work is original or not. In its second version, the application was
extended for working also with csv files and three-dimensional images.
