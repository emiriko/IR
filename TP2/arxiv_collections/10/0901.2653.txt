We show, using a simple model, how ordinary disorder can gap an extended-$s$
($A_{1g}$) symmetry superconducting state with nodes. The concommitant
crossover of thermodynamic properties, particularly the $T$-dependence of the
superfluid density, from pure power law behavior to an activated one is
exhibited. We discuss applications of this scenario to experiments on the
ferropnictide superconductors.
