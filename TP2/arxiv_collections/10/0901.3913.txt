Superconducting NbN wires have recently received attention as detectors for
visible and infrared photons. We present experiments in which we use a NbN wire
for high-efficiency (40 %) detection of single electrons with keV energy. We
use the beam of a scanning electron microscope as a focussed, stable, and
calibrated electron source. Scanning the beam over the surface of the wire
provides a map of the detection efficiency. This map shows features as small as
150 nm, revealing wire inhomogeneities. The intrinsic resolution of this
mapping method, superior to optical methods, provides the basis of a
characterization tool relevant for photon detectors.
