The maximum density still life problem (MDSLP) is a hard constraint
optimization problem based on Conway's game of life. It is a prime example of
weighted constrained optimization problem that has been recently tackled in the
constraint-programming community. Bucket elimination (BE) is a complete
technique commonly used to solve this kind of constraint satisfaction problem.
When the memory required to apply BE is too high, a heuristic method based on
it (denominated mini-buckets) can be used to calculate bounds for the optimal
solution. Nevertheless, the curse of dimensionality makes these techniques
unpractical for large size problems. In response to this situation, we present
a memetic algorithm for the MDSLP in which BE is used as a mechanism for
recombining solutions, providing the best possible child from the parental set.
Subsequently, a multi-level model in which this exact/metaheuristic hybrid is
further hybridized with branch-and-bound techniques and mini-buckets is
studied. Extensive experimental results analyze the performance of these models
and multi-parent recombination. The resulting algorithm consistently finds
optimal patterns for up to date solved instances in less time than current
approaches. Moreover, it is shown that this proposal provides new best known
solutions for very large instances.
