In this work, we present a mechanical example of an experimental realization
of a stability reversal between on-site and inter-site centered localized
modes. A corresponding realization of a vanishing of the Peierls-Nabarro
barrier allows for an experimentally observed enhanced mobility of the
localized modes near the reversal point. These features are supported by
detailed numerical computations of the stability and mobility of the discrete
breathers in this system of forced and damped coupled pendula. Furthermore,
additional exotic features of the relevant model, such as dark breathers are
briefly discussed.
