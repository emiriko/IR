We study the dynamics of entanglement in a two-qubit system interacting with
a squeezed thermal bath via a dissipative system-reservoir interaction with the
system and reservoir assumed to be in a separable initial state. The resulting
entanglement is studied by making use of a recently introduced measure of mixed
state entanglement via a probability density function which gives a statistical
and geometrical characterization of entanglement by exploring the entanglement
content in the various subspaces spanning the two-qubit Hilbert space. We also
make an application of the two-qubit dissipative dynamics to a simplified model
of quantum repeaters.
