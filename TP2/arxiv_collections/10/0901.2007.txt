A plasma focus device capable of operating at 0.2 pulses per second during
several minutes is used as a source of hard x-rays and fast neutrons. An
experimental demonstration of the use of the neutrons emissions for radiation
probing of hydrogenated substances is presented, showing a particular
application in detecting water concentrations differences in the proximity of
the device by elastic scattering. Moreover, the device produces ultrashort hard
x-rays pulses useful for introspective images of small objects, static or in
fast motion, suitable for the identification of internal submillimetric
defects. Clear images of metallic objects shielded by several millimeters iron
walls are shown.
