IceCube is a cubic-kilometer neutrino telescope under construction at the
geographic South Pole. Once completed it will comprise 4800 optical sensors
deployed on 80 vertical strings at depths in the ice between 1450 and 2450
meters. Part of the array is already operational and data was recorded in the
configurations with 9 (year 2006/2007), 22 (year 2007/2008) and 40-strings
(year 2008/2009) respectively. Here we report preliminary results on the search
for point-like neutrino sources using data collected with the first 22 strings
(IC-22).
