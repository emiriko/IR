Since September 2005, the Whipple 10m Gamma-ray Telescope has been operated
primarily as a blazar monitor. The five Northern Hemisphere blazars that have
already been detected at the Whipple Observatory, Markarian 421, H1426+428,
Markarian 501, 1ES 1959+650 and 1ES 2344+514, are monitored routinely each
night that they are visible. We report on the Markarian 421 observations taken
from November 2005 to June 2006 in the gamma-ray, X-ray, optical and radio
bands. During this time, Markarian 421 was found to be variable at all
wavelengths probed. Both the variability and the correlations among different
energy regimes are studied in detail here. A tentative correlation, with large
spread, was measured between the X-ray and gamma-ray bands, while no clear
correlation was evident among the other energy bands. In addition to this, the
well-sampled spectral energy distribution of Markarian 421 (1101+384) is
presented for three different activity levels. The observations of the other
blazar targets will be reported separately.
