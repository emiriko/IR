Epitaxially strained LaCoO3 (LCO) thin films were grown with different film
thickness, t, on (001) oriented (LaAlO3)0.3(SrAl0.5Ta0.5O3)0.7 (LSAT)
substrates. After initial pseudomorphic growth the films start to relieve their
strain partly by the formation of periodic nano-twins with twin planes
predominantly along the <100> direction. Nano-twinning occurs already at the
initial stage of growth, albeit in a more moderate way. Pseudomorphic grains,
on the other hand, still grow up to a thickness of at least several tenths of
nanometers. The twinning is attributed to the symmetry lowering of the
epitaxially strained pseudo-tetragonal structure towards the relaxed
rhombohedral structure of bulk LCO. However, the unit-cell volume of the
pseudo-tetragonal structure is found to be nearly constant over a very large
range of t. Only films with t > 130 nm show a significant relaxation of the
lattice parameters towards values comparable to those of bulk LCO.
