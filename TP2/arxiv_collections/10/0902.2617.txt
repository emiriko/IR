A topologically ordered material is characterized by a rare quantum
organization of electrons that evades the conventional spontaneously broken
symmetry based classification of condensed matter. Exotic spin transport
phenomena such as the dissipationless quantum spin Hall effect have been
speculated to originate from a novel topological order whose identification
requires a spin sensitive measurement, which does not exist to this date in any
system (neither in Hg(Cd)Te quantum wells nor in the topological insulator
BiSb). Using Mott polarimetry, we probe the spin degrees of freedom of these
quantum spin Hall states and demonstrate that topological quantum numbers are
uniquely determined from spin texture imaging measurements. Applying this
method to the Bi{1-x}Sb{x} series, we identify the origin of its novel order
and unusual chiral properties. These results taken together constitute the
first observation of surface electrons collectively carrying a geometrical
quantum (Berry's) phase and definite chirality (mirror Chern number, n_M =-1),
which are the key electronic properties for realizing topological computing
bits with intrinsic spin Hall-like topological phenomena. Our spin-resolved
results not only provides the first clear proof of a topological insulating
state in nature but also demonstrate the utility of spin-resolved ARPES
technique in measuring the quantum spin Hall phases of matter.
