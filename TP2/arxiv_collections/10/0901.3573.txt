We calculate the non-linear conductance of a quantum point contact using the
non-equilibrium Greens function technique within the Hartree approximation of
spinless electrons. We quantitative reproduce the 0.25-anomaly in the
differential conductance (i.e. the lowest plateau at 0.25-0.3*2e^2/h) as well
as an upward bending of higher conductance half-integer plateaus seen in the
experiments, and relate these features to the non-linear screening and pinning
effects.
