The aim of this paper is to study the vertical profile of small dust
particles in protoplanetary discs in which angular momentum transport is due to
MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability. We consider
particle sizes that range from approximately 1 micron up to a few
millimeters.We use a grid--based MHD code to perform global two-fluid
simulations of turbulent protoplanetary discs which contain dust grains of
various sizes. In quasi--steady state, the gravitational settling of dust
particles is balanced by turbulent diffusion. Simple and standard models of
this process fail to describe accurately the vertical profile of the dust
density. The disagreement is larger for small dust particles (of a few microns
in size), especially in the disc upper layers ($Z>3H$, where $H$ is the
scale-height). Here there can be orders of magnitude in the disagreement
between the simple model predictions and the simulation results. This is
because MHD turbulence is not homogeneous in accretion discs, since velocity
fluctuations increase significantly in the disc upper layer where a strongly
magnetized corona develops. We provide an alternative model that gives a better
fit to the simulations. In this model, dust particles are diffused away from
the midplane by MHD turbulence, but the diffusion coefficient varies vertically
and is everywhere proportional to the square of the local turbulent vertical
velocity fluctuations. The spatial distribution of dust particles can be used
to trace the properties of MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs, such as the
amplitude of the velocity fluctuations. In the future, detailed and direct
comparison between numerical simulations and observations should prove a useful
tool for constraining the properties of turbulence in protoplanetary discs.
