Gridded estimated rainfall intensity values at very high spatial and temporal
resolution levels are needed as main inputs for weather prediction models to
obtain accurate precipitation forecasts, and to verify the performance of
precipitation forecast models. These gridded rainfall fields are also the main
driver for hydrological models that forecast flash floods, and they are
essential for disaster prediction associated with heavy rain. Rainfall
information can be obtained from rain gages that provide relatively accurate
estimates of the actual rainfall values at point-referenced locations, but they
do not characterize well enough the spatial and temporal structure of the
rainfall fields. Doppler radar data offer better spatial and temporal coverage,
but Doppler radar measures effective radar reflectivity ($Ze$) rather than
rainfall rate ($R$). Thus, rainfall estimates from radar data suffer from
various uncertainties due to their measuring principle and the conversion from
$Ze$ to $R$. We introduce a framework to combine radar reflectivity and gage
data, by writing the different sources of rainfall information in terms of an
underlying unobservable spatial temporal process with the true rainfall values.
We use spatial logistic regression to model the probability of rain for both
sources of data in terms of the latent true rainfall process. We characterize
the different sources of bias and error in the gage and radar data and we
estimate the true rainfall intensity with its posterior predictive
distribution, conditioning on the observed data.
