Grammatic is a tool for grammar definition and manipulation aimed to improve
modularity and reuse of grammars and related development artifacts. It is
independent from parsing technology and any other details of target system
implementation. Grammatic provides a way for annotating grammars with arbitrary
metadata (like associativity attributes, semantic actions or anything else). It
might be used as a front-end for external tools like parser generators to make
their input grammars modular and reusable. This paper describes main principles
behind Grammatic and gives an overview of languages it provides and their
ability to separate concerns and define reusable modules. Also it presents
sketches of possible use cases for the tool.
