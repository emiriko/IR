We studied theoretically the optical properties of C$_{60}$ fullerene
microcrystals as a function of hydrostatic pressure with first-principles
many-body theories. Calculations of the electronic properties were done in the
GW approximation. We computed electronic excited states in the crystal by
diagonalizing the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Our results confirmed the
existence of bound excitons in the crystal. Both the electronic gap and optical
gap decrease continuously and non-linearly as pressure of up to 6 GPa is
applied. As a result, the absorption spectrum shows strong redshift. We also
obtained that "negative" pressure shows the opposite behavior: the gaps
increase and the optical spectrum shifts toward the blue end of the spectrum.
Negative pressure can be realized by adding cubane (C$_8$H$_8$) or other
molecules with similar size to the interstitials of the microcrystal. For the
moderate lattice distortions studied here, we found that the optical properties
of fullerene microcrystals with intercalated cubane are similar to the ones of
an expanded undoped microcrystal. Based on these findings, we propose doped C60
as active element in piezo-optical devices.
