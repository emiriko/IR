This paper presents an implementation of a markerless tracking technique
targeted to the Windows Mobile Pocket PC platform. The primary aim of this work
is to allow the development of standalone augmented reality applications for
handheld devices based on natural feature tracking. In order to achieve this
goal, a subset of two computer vision libraries was ported to the Pocket PC
platform. They were also adapted to use fixed point math, with the purpose of
improving the overall performance of the routines. The port of these libraries
opens up the possibility of having other computer vision tasks being executed
on mobile platforms. A model based tracking approach that relies on edge
information was adopted. Since it does not require a high processing power, it
is suitable for constrained devices such as handhelds. The OpenGL ES graphics
library was used to perform computer vision tasks, taking advantage of existing
graphics hardware acceleration. An augmented reality application was created
using the implemented technique and evaluations were done regarding tracking
performance and accuracy
