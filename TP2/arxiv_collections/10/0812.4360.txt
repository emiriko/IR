I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some
self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns
to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively
simpler and more beautiful. Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more
non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the
traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for
compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive
maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or
compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. It motivates
exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians,
yourself, and (since 1990) artificial systems.
