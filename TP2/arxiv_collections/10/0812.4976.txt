AdS/QCD is an extra-dimensional approach to modeling the light hadronic
resonances in QCD. AdS/QCD models are generally successful at reproducing
low-energy observables with around 10-20% accuracy, depending on the details of
the model. We discuss the motivation for these models, their intrinsic
limitations, and some recent results.
