Context: Secondary eclipse measurements of transiting extrasolar planets with
the Spitzer Space Telescope have yielded several direct detections of thermal
exoplanet light. Since Spitzer operates at wavelengths longward of 3.6 um,
arguably one of the most interesting parts of the planet spectrum (from 1 to 3
um) is inaccessible with this satellite. This region is at the peak of the
planet's spectral energy distribution and is also the regime where molecular
absorption bands can significantly influence the measured emission.
  Aims: So far, 2.2 um K-band secondary eclipse measurements, which are
possible from the ground, have not yet lead to secure detections. The aim of
this paper is to measure the secondary eclipse of the very hot Jupiter TrES-3b
in K-band, and in addition to observe its transit, to obtain an accurate planet
radius in the near infrared.
  Methods: We have used the William Herschell Telescope (WHT) to observe the
secondary eclipse, and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) to observe
the transit of TrES-3b. Both observations involved significant defocusing of
the telescope, aimed to produce high-cadence time series of several thousand
frames at high efficiency, with the starlight spread out over many pixels.
  Results: We detect the secondary eclipse of TrES-3b with a depth of
-0.241+-0.043% (~6 sigma). This corresponds to a day-side brightness
temperature of T_B(2.2um)= 2040+-185 K, which is consistent with current models
of the physical properties of this planet's upper atmosphere. The centre of the
eclipse seems slightly offset from phase phi=0.5 by Delta_phi=-0.0042+-0.0027,
which could indicate that the orbit of TrES-3b is non-circular [abridged].
