Pentagonal dodecahedral buckyball-like water clusters and arrays thereof are
shown from first-principles electronic-structure calculations to possess unique
terahertz vibrational modes in the 1-6 THz range, corresponding to
oxygen-oxygen-oxygen bending and twisting surface distortions of the clusters.
In their excited electronic states these water clusters constitute a form of
Rydberg matter. Applications to Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Cosmology are
described.
