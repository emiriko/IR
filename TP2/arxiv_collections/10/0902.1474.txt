In this contribution we study the Landau levels arising within the
relativistic quantum dynamics of a neutral particle which possesses a permanent
magnetic dipole moment interacting with an external electric field. We consider
the Aharonov-Casher coupling of magnetic dipole to the electric field to
investigate an an analog of Landau quantization in this system and solve the
Dirac equation for two different field configurations. The eigenfunctions and
eigenvalues of Hamiltonian in both cases are obtained.
