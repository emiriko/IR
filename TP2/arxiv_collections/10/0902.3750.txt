We reconsider the analysis done by Kazama and Yokoi in arXiv:0801.1561
(hep-th). We find that although the right vacuum of the theory is the one
associated to massless normal ordering (MNO), phase space normal ordering (PNO)
plays crucial role in the analysis in the following way. While defining the
quantum energy-momentum (EM) tensor one needs to take into account the field
redefinition relating the space-time field and the corresponding world-sheet
coupling. We argue that for a simple off-shell ansatz for the background this
field redefinition can be taken to be identity if the interaction term is
ordered according to PNO. This definition reproduces the correct physical
spectrum when the background is on-shell. We further show that the right way to
extract the effective equation of motion from the Virasoro anomaly is to first
order the anomaly terms according to PNO at a finite regularization parameter
$\eps$ and then take the $\eps \to 0$ limit. This prescription fixes an
ambiguity in taking the limit for certain bosonic and fermionic contributions
to the Virasoro anomaly and is the natural one to consider given the above
definition of the EM tensor.
