In this contribution, we suggest the approach that geometric concepts ought
to be defined in terms of physical operations involving quantum matter. In this
way it is expected that some (presumably nocive) idealizations lying deep
within the roots of the notion of spacetime might be excluded. In particular,
we consider that spacetime can be probed only with physical (and therefore
extended) particles, which can be effectively described by coordinates that
fail to commute by a term proportional to the spin of the particles.
