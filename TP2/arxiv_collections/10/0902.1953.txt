The surface stabilized MnO(100)-like monolayer, characterised by a regular
c(4x2) distribution of Mn vacancies, is studied by hybrid functionals and
discussed in the light of available scanning tunneling microscopy and
high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy data. We show that the use of
hybrid functionals is crucial to account for the intermingled nature of
magnetic ineractions, electron localization, structural distortions and surface
phonons. The proposed Pd(100) supported Mn3O4 structure is excellently
compatible with the experiments previously reported in literature.
