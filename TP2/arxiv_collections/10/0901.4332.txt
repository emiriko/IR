We revisit the WMAP dark matter constraints on Yukawa Unification in the
presence of massive neutrinos. The large neutrino mixing indicated by the data
modifies the predictions for the bottom quark mass, and enables Yukawa also for
large $\tan\beta$, and for positive $\mu$ that were previously disfavoured. As
a result, the allowed parameter space for neutralino dark matter also
increases, particularly for areas with resonant enhancement of the neutralino
relic density.
