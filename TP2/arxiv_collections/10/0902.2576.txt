The formation of planets is one of the major unsolved problems in modern
astrophysics. Planets are believed to form out of the material in circumstellar
disks known to exist around young stars, and which are a by-product of the star
formation process. Therefore, the physical conditions in these disks -
structure and composition as a function of stellocentric radius and vertical
height, density and temperature profiles of each component - represent the
initial conditions under which planets form. Clearly, a good understanding of
disk structure and its time evolution are crucial to understanding planet
formation, the evolution of young planetary systems (e.g. migration), and the
recently discovered, and unanticipated, diversity of planetary architectures.
However, the inner disk regions (interior to ~10 AU) most relevant in the
context of planet formation are very poorly known, primarily because of
observational challenges in spatially resolving this region. In this
contribution we discuss opportunities for the next decade from spectrally and
spatially resolved observations, and from direct imaging, using infrared long
baseline interferometry.
