We review recent development of solution-generating techniques for four and
five-dimensional Einstein equations coupled to vector and scalar fields. This
includes D=4 Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory with multiple vector fields,
D=5 Einstein-Maxwell gravity with the Chern-Simons term (minimal
five-dimensional supergravity), and some other models which attracted attention
in connection with black rings. The method is based on reduction to
three-dimensional gravity coupled sigma-models with symmetric target spaces.
Our recent results open a way to construct the general charged black rings in
five-dimensional supergravity possibly coupled to vector multiplets.
