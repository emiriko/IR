The cross section of the $\mu^+\mu^-$ pair production in $pp$-collisions at
the LHC is calculated with acount of the $Z'$ boson induced by the minimal four
color quark-lepton symmetry($MQLS$). The $\mu^+\mu^-$ invariant mass spectrum
with account of the $MQLS$ $Z'$ boson is analysed in dependence on the $Z'$
mass. The mass region for the $MQLS$ $Z'$ boson observable at the LHC is found
in dependence on the significance and on the integrated luminosity.
