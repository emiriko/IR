Macroscopic plasma polarization, which is created by gravitation and other
mass-acting (inertial) forces in massive astrophysical objects (MAO) is under
discussion. Non-ideality effect due to strong Coulomb interaction of charged
particles is introduced into consideration as a new source of such
polarization. Simplified situation of totally equilibrium isothermal star
without relativistic effects and influence of magnetic field is considered. The
study is based on density functional approach combined with local density
approximation. It leads to conditions of constancy for generalized (electro)
chemical potentials and/or conditions of equilibrium for the forces acting on
each charged specie. New non-ideality force appears in this consideration.
Hypothetical sequences of gravitational, inertial and non-ideality polarization
on thermo- and hydrodynamics of MAO are under discussion.
