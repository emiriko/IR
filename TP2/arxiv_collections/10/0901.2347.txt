The COSMOS survey is a multiwavelength survey aimed to study the evolution of
galaxies, AGN and the large scale structure. The XMM-COSMOS is a deep X-ray
survey over the full 2 deg2 of the COSMOS area. It consists of 55 XMM-Newton
pointings for a total exposure of ~1.5 Ms with an average vignetting corrected
depth of 40 ks across the field of view and a sky coverage of 2.13 deg2. We
present the catalogue of point-like X-ray sources detected with the EPIC CCD
cameras, the logN-logS relations and the X-ray colour-colour diagrams. The
analysis was performed in the 0.5-2 keV, 2-10 keV and 5-10 keV energy bands.
The completeness of the catalogue as well as logN-logS have been calibrated
using Monte Carlo simulations. The catalogs contains a total of 1887 unique
sources detected in at least one band. The survey, that shows unprecedented
homogeneity, has a flux limit of ~1.7x10-15 erg cm-2 s-1, ~9.3x10-15 erg cm-2
s-1 and ~1.3x10-14 erg cm-2 s-1 over 90% of the area (1.92 deg2) in the 0.5-2
keV, 2-10 keV and 5-10 keV energy band, respectively. Thanks to the rather
homogeneous exposure over a large area, the derived logN-logS relations are
very well determined over the flux range sampled by XMM-COSMOS. These relations
have been compared with XRB synthesis models, which reproduce the observations
with an agreement of ~10% in the 5-10 keV and 2-10 keV band, while in the 0.5-2
keV band the agreement is of the order of ~20%. The hard X-ray colors confirmed
that the majority of the extragalactic sources, in a bright subsample, are
actually Type I or Type II AGN. About 20% of the sources have X-ray luminosity
typical of AGN (L_X >1042 erg/s) although they do not show any clear signature
of nuclear activity in the optical spectrum.
