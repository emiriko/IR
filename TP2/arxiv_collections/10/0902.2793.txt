We report on the detection of a thermal-disk component from the stellar-mass
black hole binary XTE J1118+480 in the canonical low/hard state. The presence
of a thermal component with a temperature of approximately 0.21keV in the
Chandra spectra of XTE J1118+480 is found at more than the 14 sigma confidence
level. Based on this evidence we argue that the accretion disk in XTE J1118+480
is not truncated far from the central black hole in contrast with previous
claims.
