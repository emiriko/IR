We present a comprehensive review of the physics of hadron and jet production
at large transverse momentum in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.
Emphasis is put on experimental and theoretical "jet quenching" observables
that provide direct information on the (thermo)dynamical properties of hot and
dense QCD matter.
