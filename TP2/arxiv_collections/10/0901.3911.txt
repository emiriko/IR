Experiments will soon start taking data at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
with high expectations for discovery of new physics phenomena. Indeed, the
LHC's unprecedented center-of-mass energy will allow the experiments to probe
an energy regime where the standard model is known to break down. In this
article, the experiments' capability to observe new resonances in various
channels is reviewed.
