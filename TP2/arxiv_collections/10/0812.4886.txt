A new calibration technique using natural background light of sea water has
been recently developed for the ANTARES experiment. The method relies on
correlated coincidences produced in triplets of optical modules by Cherenkov
light of beta-particles originated from Potassium-40 decays. A simple but
powerful approach to atmospheric muon flux studies is currently being developed
based on similar ideas of coincidence analysis. This article presents the two
methods in certain detail and explains their role in the ANTARES experiment.
