We study coherent pion production in neutrino-nucleus scattering in the
energy region relevant to the recent neutrino oscillation experiments. Our
approach is based on the combined use of the Sato-Lee model and the Delta-hole
model. Our initial numerical results are compared with the recent data from K2K
and SciBooNE.
