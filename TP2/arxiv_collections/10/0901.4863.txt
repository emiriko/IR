In the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity, we study production processes of
new gauge bosons at the international linear collider (ILC). Through Monte
Carlo simulations of the production processes, we show that the heavy gauge
boson masses can be determined very accurately at the ILC for a representative
parameter point of the model. From the simulation result, we also discuss the
determination of other model parameters at the ILC.
