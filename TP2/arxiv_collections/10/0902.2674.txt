This paper investigates the existence of inseparable disjoint pairs of NP
languages and related strong hypotheses in computational complexity. Our main
theorem says that, if NP does not have measure 0 in EXP, then there exist
disjoint pairs of NP languages that are P-inseparable, in fact
TIME(2^(n^k))-inseparable. We also relate these conditions to strong hypotheses
concerning randomness and genericity of disjoint pairs.
