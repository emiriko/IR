Previous experiment on Fe/Cr/Fe(001) trilayers reported a surprising
observation that the interlayer exchange coupling could be enhanced drastically
by the bombardment of irradiation even at low fluences. We propose that it is
due to the resonant states in the spacer, made possible when the topography of
both interfaces is correlated and exhibits prominent Fourier components. A
systematic procedure is developed to handle the interface roughness and predict
on how to optimize the interlayer coupling. This method can be extended to
bridge the gap between theories and experiments in other heterojunctions.
