A simple relation is introduced for concurrence to describe how much the
entanglement of bipartite system is at least left if either (or both) subsystem
undergoes an arbitrary physical process. This provides a lower bound for
concurrence of mixed states (pure states are included) in contrast to the upper
bound given by Konrad et al [Nature Physics \textbf{4}, 99 (2008)]. Our results
are also suitable for a general high dimensional bipartite quantum systems.
