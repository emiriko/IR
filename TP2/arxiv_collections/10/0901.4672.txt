At ambient pressure CaFe2As2 has been found to undergo a first order phase
transition from a high temperature, tetragonal phase to a low temperature
orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic phase upon cooling through T ~ 170 K. With the
application of pressure this phase transition is rapidly suppressed and by ~
0.35 GPa it is replaced by a first order phase transition to a low temperature
collapsed tetragonal, non-magnetic phase. Further application of pressure leads
to an increase of the tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal phase transition
temperature, with it crossing room temperature by ~ 1.7 GPa. Given the
exceptionally large and anisotropic change in unit cell dimensions associated
with the collapsed tetragonal phase, the state of the pressure medium (liquid
or solid) at the transition temperature has profound effects on the low
temperature state of the sample. For He-gas cells the pressure is as close to
hydrostatic as possible and the transitions are sharp and the sample appears to
be single phase at low temperatures. For liquid media cells at temperatures
below media freezing, the CaFe2As2 transforms when it is encased by a frozen
media and enters into a low temperature multi-crystallographic-phase state,
leading to what appears to be a strain stabilized superconducting state at low
temperatures.
