The interiors of high mass compact (neutron) stars may contain deconfined
quark matter in a crystalline color superconducting (CCS) state. On a basis of
microscopic nuclear and quark matter equations of states we explore the
internal structure of such stars in general relativity. We find that their
stable sequence harbors CCS quark cores with masses M_core \le
(0.78-0.82)M_{sun} and radii R_core \le 7 km. The CCS quark matter can support
nonaxisymmetric deformations, because of its finite shear modulus, and can
generate gravitational radiation at twice the rotation frequency of the star.
Assuming that the CCS core is maximally strained we compute the maximal
quadrupole moment it can sustain. The characteristic strain of gravitational
wave emission $h_0$ predicted by our models are compared to the upper limits
obtained by the LIGO and GEO 600 detectors. The upper limits are consistent
with the breaking strain of CCS matter \sigma \le 10^{-4} and large pairing
gaps \Delta \sim 50 MeV, or, alternatively, with \sigma \sim 10^{-3} and small
pairing gaps \Delta \sim 15 MeV. An observationally determined value of the
characteristic strain h_0 can pin down the product \sigma\Delta^2. On the
theoretical side a better understanding of the breaking strain of CCS matter
will be needed to predict reliably the level of the deformation of CCS quark
core from first principles.
