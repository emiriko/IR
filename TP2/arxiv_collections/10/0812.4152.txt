In this paper we investigate the dynamics of solitons occurring in the
nonlinear Schroedinger equation when a parameter h->0. We prove that under
suitable assumptions, the the soliton approximately follows the dynamics of a
point particle, namely, the motion of its barycenter $q_h(t)$ satisfies the
equation $ddot{q}_h(t)+\nabla V(q_h(t))=H_h(t)$ where $\sup_{t\in R} |H_h(t)|
-> 0$ as h->0.
