We have grown epitaxial films a few atomic layers thick of iron oxides on
ruthenium. We characterize the growth by low energy electron microscopy. Using
selected area diffraction and intensity vs. voltage spectroscopy, we detect two
distinct phases which are assigned to wustite and magnetite. Spin polarized low
energy electron microscopy shows magnetic domain patterns in the magnetite
phase at room temperature.
