We revisited the scaling behavior of the transport properties of a quantum
dot system described by the spin-1/2 Anderson model using analytical methods.
In the low temperature limit we show that the conductance has a universal
behavior with universality between temperature and bias. We compare this result
with the empirical formula used to fit the experimental data for conductance in
the case of the equilibrium transport through a single channel quantum dot. In
the high temperature limit the conductance obtained from the Anderson model is
compared with previous results obtained from the Kondo model. The universal
behavior is present also in the high temperature limit. These results are in
good agreement with the Renormalization group calculations.
