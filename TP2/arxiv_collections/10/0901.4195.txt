We have calculated parity nonconserving 7s - 6d_{3/2} amplitude E_PNC in
223Ra+ using high-precision relativistic all-order method where all single and
double excitations of the Dirac-Fock wave functions are included to all orders
of perturbation theory. Detailed study of the uncertainty of the parity
nonconserving (PNC) amplitude is carried out; additional calculations are
performed to estimate some of the missing correlation corrections. A systematic
study of the parity conserving atomic properties, including the calculation of
the energies, transition matrix elements, lifetimes, hyperfine constants,
quadrupole moments of the 6d states, as well as dipole and quadrupole ground
state polarizabilities, is carried out. The results are compared with other
theoretical calculations and available experimental values.
