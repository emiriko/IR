In this article we consider sheaf quotients of affine superschemes by finite
supergroups that act on them freely. More precisely, if a finite supergroup $G$
acts on an affine superscheme $X$ freely, then the quotient $K$-sheaf
$\tilde{X/G}$ is again an affine superscheme $Y$, where $K[Y]\simeq K[X]^G$.
Besides, $K[X]$ is a finitely presented projective $K[X]^G$-module.
