We construct a supersymmetric quantum Hall liquid with a deformed
supersymmetry. One parameter is introduced in the supersymmetric Laughlin
wavefunction to realize the original Laughlin wavefunction and the Moore-Read
wavefunction in two extremal limits of the parameter. The introduced parameter
corresponds to the coherence factor in the BCS theory. It is pointed out that
the parameter-dependent supersymmetric Laughlin wavefunction enjoys a deformed
supersymmetry. Based on the deformed supersymmetry, we construct a
pseudo-potential Hamiltonian whose groundstate is exactly the
parameter-dependent supersymmetric Laughlin wavefunction. Though the SUSY
pseudo-potential Hamiltonian is parameter-dependent and non-Hermitian, its
eigenvalues are parameter-independent and real.
