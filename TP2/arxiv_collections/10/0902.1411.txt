We report the dielectric dispersion of the giant magnetocapacitance (GMC) in
multiferroic DyMnO$_{3}$ over a wide frequency range. The GMC is found to be
attributable not to the softened electromagnon but to the electric-field-driven
motion of multiferroic domain wall (DW). In contrast to conventional
ferroelectric DWs, the present multiferroic DW motion holds extremely high
relaxation rate of $\sim$$10^{7}$ s$^{-1}$ even at low temperatures. This
mobile nature as well as the model simulation suggests that the multiferroic DW
is not atomically thin as in ferroelectrics but thick, reflecting its magnetic
origin.
