We show that the gauge-invariant coupling suggested by Pascalutsa removes
non-pole terms from a spin-$\fth$ propagator only for a specific choice of free
parameter. For the general case the problem can be solved by including higher
order derivatives of spin-$\fth$ fields or by modifying the original coupling.
In the latter case the obtained Lagrangian depends on one free parameter
pointing to the freedom in choosing an 'off-shell' content of the theory.
However, the physical observables must not be affected by the 'off-shell'
contributions and should not depend on the free parameter of the Lagrangian.
