The Groth field is one of the sky regions that will be targeted by the OTELO
(OSIRIS Tunable Filter Emission Line Object) survey in the optical 820 nm and
920 nm atmospheric windows. This field has been observed by AEGIS
(All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey) covering the full
spectral range, from X-rays to radio waves. Chandra X-ray data with total
exposure time of 200ksec are analyzed and combined with optical broadband data
of the Groth field in order to study a set of structural parameters of the
X-ray emitters and its relation with X-ray properties. We processed the raw,
public X-ray data using the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations and
determined and analyzed different structural parameters in order to produce a
morphological classification of X-ray sources. Finally, we analyzed the angular
clustering of these sources using 2-point correlation functions. We present a
catalog of 340 X-ray emitters with optical counterpart. We obtained the number
counts and compared them with AEGIS data. Objects have been classified by
nuclear type using a diagnostic diagram relating X-ray-to-optical ratio (X/O)
to hardness ratio (HR). Also, we combined structural parameters with other
X-ray and optical properties, and found for the first time an anticorrelation
between the X/O ratio and the Abraham concentration index which might suggest
that early type galaxies have lower Eddington rates than those of late type
galaxies. A significant positive angular clustering was obtained from a
preliminary analysis of 4 subsamples of the X-ray sources catalog. The
clustering signal of the opticaly extended counterparts is similar to that of
strongly clustered populations like red and very red galaxies, suggesting that
the environment plays an important role in AGN phenomena.
