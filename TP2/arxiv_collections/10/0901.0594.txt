Carrier injection performed in oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O7(YBCO)
hetero-structure junctions exhibited tunable resistance that was entirely
different with behaviors of semiconductor devices. Tunable superconductivity in
YBCO junctions, increasing over 20 K in transition temperature, has achieved by
using electric processes. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that
intrinsic property of high TC superconductors superconductivity can be adjusted
as tunable functional parameters of devices. The fantastic phenomenon caused by
carrier injection was discussed based on a proposed charge carrier
self-trapping model and BCS theory.
