Based on the results from numerous astrophysics experiments, it is currently
believed that the majority of matter in the Universe is in some unknown form,
known as dark matter. In the past it has been common to model dark matter as a
massive particle with weak interactions - either from existing Standard Model
forces or from new forces - and often as past of a more complicated theory. In
this article, an alternative is presented in which dark matter is in the form
of a massive particle with no explicit interactions. It is demonstrated that,
in the presence of strongly warped extra dimensions the inherent gravitational
interactions of such a particle are sufficient to produce the observed
abundance of dark matter without violating existing experimental constraints.
