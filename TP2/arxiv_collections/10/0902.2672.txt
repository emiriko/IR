The energy-momentum tensor coming from one-parameter effective Yang- Mills
theory is here used to describe the matter-energy content of the homogeneous
and isotropic Friedmann cosmology in its early stages. The behavior of all
solutions is examined. Particularly, it is shown that only solutions
corresponding to an open model allow the universe to evolve into an accelerated
expansion. This result appears as a possible mechanism for an inflationary
phase produced by a vector field. Further, depending on the value of some
parameters characterizing the system, the resulting models are classified as
singular or nonsingular.
