The holographic dark energy (HDE) is now an interesting candidate of dark
energy, which has been studied extensively in the literature. In the derivation
of HDE, the black hole entropy plays an important role. In fact, the
entropy-area relation can be modified due to loop quantum gravity or other
reasons. With the modified entropy-area relation, we propose the so-called
``entropy-corrected holographic dark energy'' (ECHDE) in the present work. We
consider many aspects of ECHDE and find some interesting results. In addition,
we briefly consider the so-called ``entropy-corrected agegraphic dark energy''
(ECADE).
