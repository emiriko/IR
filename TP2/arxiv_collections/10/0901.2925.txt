We construct a Dark Matter (DM) annihilation module that can encompass the
predictions from a wide array of models built to explain the recently reported
PAMELA and ATIC/PPB-BETS excesses. We present a detailed analysis of the
injection spectrums for DM annihilation and quantitatively demonstrate effects
that have previously not been included from the particle physics perspective.
With this module we demonstrate the parameter space that can account for the
aforementioned excesses and be compatible with existing high energy gamma ray
and neutrino experiments. However, we find that it is relatively generic to
have some tension between the results of the HESS experiment and the
ATIC/PPB-BETS experiments within the context of annihilating DM. We discuss
ways to alleviate this tension and how upcoming experiments will be able to
differentiate amongst the various possible explanations of the purported
excesses.
