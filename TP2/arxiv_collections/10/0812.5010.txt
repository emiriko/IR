New classes composite vacuum wormhole solutions of Jordan-Brans-Dicke
gravitation is presented and analysed. It is shown that such solution holds for
both, a bridge between separated Schwarzschild and Brans Universes and for a
bridge connecting two Schwarzschild asymptotically flat regions joined by Brans
throat. We have also noticed that there are some new possible candidates for
wormhole spacetimes.
