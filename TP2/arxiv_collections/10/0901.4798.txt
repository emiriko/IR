This note proposes a method of space efficient secret sharing in which k
secrets are mapped into n shares (n>=k) of the same size. Since, n can be
chosen to be equal to k, the method is space efficient. This method may be
compared with conventional secret sharing schemes that divide a single secret
into n shares.
