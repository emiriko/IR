We describe recent work on the arithmetic properties of moduli spaces of
stable vector bundles and stable parabolic bundles on a curve over a global
field. In particular, we describe a connection between the period-index problem
for Brauer classes over the function field of the curve and the Hasse principle
for rational points on etale forms of such moduli spaces, refining classical
results of Artin and Tate. Submitted to proceedings of a Clay workshop on
vector bundles on curves in honor of Newstead.
