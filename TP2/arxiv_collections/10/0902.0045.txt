We use Monte Carlo simulations to obtain an improved lattice measurement of
the critical coupling constant [lambda / mu^2]_crit for the continuum (1 +
1)-dimensional (lambda / 4) phi^4 theory. We find that the critical coupling
constant depends logarithmically on the lattice coupling, resulting in a
continuum value of [lambda / mu^2]_crit = 10.8(1), in considerable disagreement
with the previously reported [lambda / mu^2]_crit = 10.26(8). Although this
logarithmic behavior was not observed in earlier lattice studies, it is
consistent with them, and expected analytically.
