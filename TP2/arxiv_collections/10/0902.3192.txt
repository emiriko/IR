We show, theoretically and experimentally, that a sheet formed by two
confocal lenticular arrays can flip one component of the local light-ray
direction. Ray-optically, such a sheet is equivalent to a Dove-prism sheet, an
example of a METATOY (metamaterial for light rays), a structure that changes
the direction of transmitted light rays in a way that cannot be performed
perfectly wave-optically.
