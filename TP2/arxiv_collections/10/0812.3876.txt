A comprehensive number of integrals emerging in one-loop computations in a
gauge perturbation theory on the lattice with Wilson fermions at $r=1$ is
computed using the Burgio--Caracciolo--Pelissetto algorithm and the FORM
package. An explicit analytical form of the recursion relations needed for such
computations is presented.
