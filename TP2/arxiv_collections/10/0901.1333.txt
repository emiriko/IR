Perturbative gadgets were originally introduced to generate effective k-local
interactions in the low-energy sector of a 2-local Hamiltonian. Extending this
idea, we present gadgets which are specifically suited for realizing
Hamiltonians exhibiting non-abelian anyonic excitations. At the core of our
construction is a perturbative analysis of a widely used hopping-term
Hamiltonian. We show that in the low-energy limit, this Hamiltonian can be
approximated by a certain ordered product of operators. In particular, this
provides a simplified realization of Kitaev's quantum double Hamiltonians.
