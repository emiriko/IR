It is shown that a putative evolution of the fundamental couplings of strong
and weak interactions via coupling to dark energy through a generalized
Bekenstein-type model may, for a linear model of variation, cause deviations on
the statistical nuclear decay Rutherford-Soddy law unless bounds are imposed on
the parameters of this variation. Existing bounds for the weak interaction
exclude any significant deviation. Bounds on the strong interaction are much
less stringent.
