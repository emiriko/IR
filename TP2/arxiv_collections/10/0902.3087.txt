We report on the first lattice calculation of light-cone distribution
amplitudes of the N*(1535) resonance, which are used to calculate the
transition form factors at large momentum transfers using light-cone sum rules.
In the region Q^2 > 2 GeV^2, where the light-cone expansion is expected to
converge, the results appear to be in good agreement with the experimental
data.
