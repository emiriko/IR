We analyze the stability of the Einstein static universe by considering
homogeneous perturbations in the context of f(G) modified Gauss-Bonnet theories
of gravity. By considering a generic form of f(G), the stability region of the
Einstein static universe is parameterized by the linear equation of state
parameter w=p/rho and the second derivative f"(G) of the Gauss-Bonnet term.
