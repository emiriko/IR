Dynamic synthesis of human movements raises the question of the selection of
a suitable performance criterion able to generate proper dynamic behaviors. Two
quite different criteria are likely to be appropriate candidates: the minimum
effort cost (or sthenic criterion) and the minimum energy cost. The paper is
aimed at clarifying the dynamic effects of these two fundamental criteria when
considering movements executed with liveliness as they are in gymnastic. It is
well known that the former cost generates movements with smooth dynamics. A
special attention is devoted to the latter. The optimal control theory shows
that minimizing the energy consumption results in actuating inputs of
bang-off-bang type producing momentum impulses. When achieving dynamic
synthesis, this criterion makes necessary to account for bounds set on driving
torques. Moreover, when dealing with one-sided contacts, as in floor
handstands, the unilaterality of contact forces must be explicitly accounted
for since it tends to be infringed by impulsive efforts. Numerical simulations
of these formal properties are carried out using a parametric optimization
technique, and considering the raising phase of floor handstands. It is shown
that the energetic criterion tends to generate movements which exhibit
similarities with their real counterpart performed by an expert gymnast.
Conversely, the sthenic criterion produces movements quite different. But, a
salient fact is that these ones proved to be easier to perform by young
beginners. As a result, they could help to coach novice gymnasts.
