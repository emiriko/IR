We summarize and extend our work on flux vacua attractors in generalized
compactifications. After reviewing the attractor equations for the heterotic
string on SU(3) structure manifolds, we study attractors for N=1 vacua in type
IIA/B on SU(3)xSU(3) structure spaces. In the case of vanishing RR flux, we
find attractor equations that encode Minkowski vacua only (and which correct a
previous normalization error). In addition to our previous considerations, here
we also discuss the case of nonzero RR flux and the possibility of attractors
for AdS vacua.
