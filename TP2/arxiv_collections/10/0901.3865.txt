Ten attempts to prove the Generalized Second Law of Thermodyanmics (GSL) are
described and critiqued. Each proof provides valuable insights which should be
useful for constructing future, more complete proofs. Rather than merely
summarizing previous research, this review offers new perspectives, and
strategies for overcoming limitations of the existing proofs. A long
introductory section addresses some choices that must be made in any
formulation the GSL: Should one use the Gibbs or the Boltzmann entropy? Should
one use the global or the apparent horizon? Is it necessary to assume any
entropy bounds? If the area has quantum fluctuations, should the GSL apply to
the average area? The definition and implications of the classical,
hydrodynamic, semiclassical and full quantum gravity regimes are also
discussed. A lack of agreement regarding how to define the "quasi-stationary"
regime is addressed by distinguishing it from the "quasi-steady" regime.
