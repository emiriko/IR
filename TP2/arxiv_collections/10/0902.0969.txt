We present the BMW-Chandra source catalogue derived from Chandra ACIS-I
observations (exposure time >10ks) public as of March 2003 by using a wavelet
detection algorithm (Lazzati et al. 1999; Campana et al. 1999). The catalogue
contains a total of 21325 sources, 16758 of which are serendipitous. Our sky
coverage in the soft band (0.5-2 keV, S/N =3) is ~8 deg^2 for F_X > 10^-13 erg
cm^-2 s-1, and ~2 deg^2 for F_X >10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1. The catalogue contains
information on positions, count rates (and errors) in three energy bands.
(total, 0.5-7 keV; soft, 0.5-2 keV; and hard, 2-7keV), and in four additional
energy bands, SB1 (0.5-1keV), SB2 (1-2 keV), HB1 (2-4 keV), and HB2 (4-7keV),
as well as information on the source extension, and cross-matches with the
FIRST, IRAS, 2MASS, and GSC-2 catalogues.
