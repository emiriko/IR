In this study, we introduced a probabilistic voter, regarding symbol
probabilities in decision process besides majority consensus. Conventional
majority voter is independent of functionality of redundant modules. In our
study, proposed probabilistic voter is designed corresponding to functionality
of the redundant module. We tested probabilistic voter for 3 and 5 redundant
modules with random transient errors inserted the wires and it was seen from
simulation results that Multi-Modular Redundancy (M-MR) with Probabilistic
Voting (PV) had been shown better availability performance than conventional
majority voter.
