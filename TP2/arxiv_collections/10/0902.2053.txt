In this work we investigate the origin of the parabolic relation between
skewness and kurtosis often encountered in the analysis of experimental
time-series. We argue that the numerical values of the coefficients of the
curve may provide informations about the specific physics of the system
studied, whereas the analytical curve per se is a fairly general consequence of
a few constraints expected to hold for most systems.
