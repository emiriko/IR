The density operators obtained by taking partial traces do not represent
proper mixtures of the subsystems of a compound physical system, but improper
mixtures, since the coefficients in the convex sums expressing them never bear
the ignorance interpretation. As a consequence, assigning states to these
subsystems is problematical in standard quantum mechanics (subentity problem).
Basing on the proposal provided in the SR interpretation of quantum mechanics,
where improper mixtures are considered as true nonpure states conceptually
distinct from proper mixtures, we show here that proper and improper mixtures
can be represented by different density operators in the quaternionic
formulation of quantum mechanics, hence they can be distinguished also from a
mathematical viewpoint. A simple example related to the quantum theory of
measurement is provided.
