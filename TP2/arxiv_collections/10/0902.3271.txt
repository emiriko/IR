Recently Arkani-Hamed, Finkbeiner, Slatyer and Weiner proposed a unified
explanation to the set of experimental and observational anomalies with
possible connections to Dark Matter (DM). A central role is played by GeV scale
"dark" gauge bosons exchanged by the weak scale DM. Motivated by this proposal,
we build an explicit model of DM in the context of Weak Scale Supersymmetry
(SUSY). We employ high-scale SUSY-breaking and invoke the Giudice-Masiero
mechanism to generate the weak scale DM masses. By sequestering the dark sector
from the SUSY-breaking "hidden" sector, it naturally acquires GeV scale soft
masses that help generate the dark gauge boson mass. The visible MSSM sector is
not fully sequestered and acquires gaugino-mediated soft terms at the weak
scale. This hierarchy of scales naturally leads to the Sommerfeld enhancement
of DM annihilations needed to account for the electron/positron excesses in the
PAMELA and ATIC experiments. The possibility of co-existing species of DM is
used to show how the INTEGRAL and DAMA anomalies can both be explained. We
study the cosmological constraints on the new stable or long-lived light
particles that appear in our models. We discuss the lepton-jet collider signals
suggested by Arkani-Hamed and Weiner, and find that they are not guaranteed in
our construction.
