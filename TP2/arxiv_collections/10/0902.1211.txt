In this letter we study the reaction e^{+}e^{-}\to\phi \pi^0 \eta with the
\pi^{0}\eta system in an isoscalar s-wave configuration. We use a formalism
recently developed for the study of e^{+}e^{-}\to\phi \pi\pi and
e^{+}e^{-}\to\phi K^{+}K^{-}. The obtained cross section is within the reach of
present e^{+}e^{-} machines. Measuring this channel would test the absence of
an isovector companion of the X(2175) as predicted by the three body approach
to this resonance.
