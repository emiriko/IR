Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), which may have been created in the early
Universe, are predicted to be detectable by their Hawking radiation. PBHs with
an initial mass of 5.0 * 10^14 g should be expiring today with a burst of high
energy particles. Evaporating PBHs in the solar neighborhood are candidate
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) progenitors. We propose spectral lag, which is the
temporal delay between the high energy photon pulse and the low energy photon
pulse, as a possible method to detect PBH evaporation events with the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope Observatory.
