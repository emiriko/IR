Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson showed that 2 $q$-hypergeometric series, going
back to Ramanujan, are related to real quadratic fields, which explains
interesting properties of their Fourier coefficients. There is also an
interesting relation of such series to automorphic forms. Here we construct
more such examples arising from interesting combinatorial statistics.
