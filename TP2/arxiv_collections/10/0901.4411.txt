When a source star is microlensed by one stellar component of a widely
separated binary stellar components, after finishing the lensing event, the
event induced by the other binary star can be additionally detected. In this
paper, we investigate whether the close/wide degeneracies in binary lensing
events can be resolved by detecting the additional centroid shift of the source
images induced by the secondary binary star in wide binary lensing events. From
this investigation, we find that if the source star passes close to the
Einstein ring of the secondary companion, the degeneracy can be easily resolved
by using future astrometric follow-up observations with high astrometric
precision. We determine the probability of detecting the additional centroid
shift in binary lensing events with high magnification. From this, we find that
the degeneracy of binary lensing events with a separation of $\lesssim 20.0$ AU
can be resolved with a significant efficiency. We also estimate the waiting
time for the detection of the additional centroid shift in wide binary lensing
events. We find that for typical Galactic lensing events with a separation of
$\lesssim 20.0$ AU, the additional centroid shift can be detected within 100
days, and thus the degeneracy of those events can be sufficiently broken within
a year.
