From an extensive calculation of static properties of a trapped Fermi
superfluid at zero temperature using a density-functional formulation, we
demonstrate a universal behavior of its observables, such as energy, chemical
potential, radius etc., over the crossover from the BCS limit to unitarity
leading to scaling over many orders of magnitude in fermion number. This
scaling allows to predict the static properties of the system, with a large
number ($\sim 10^5$) of fermions, over the crossover with an error of 1-2%,
from the knowledge of those for a small number ($\sim 10$) of fermions.
