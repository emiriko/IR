A data acquisition (DAQ) system is described which will be used for the next
generation of prototype calorimeters using particle flow algorithms for the
International Linear Collider (ILC). The design is sufficiently generic and
scalable such that it should have numerous applications either for ILC
detectors or elsewhere within high energy physics in general. The DAQ system
will be implemented using FPGAs and built using off-the-shelf components and
networking hardware with programmable FPGAs. The software for the DAQ system is
based on an existing framework, DOOCS, which is a server/client object-oriented
system. The design philosophy, current status of the project and its aims are
presented in this report.
