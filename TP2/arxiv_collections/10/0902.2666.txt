We report the successful fabrication of planar V/Cu/V mesoscopic Josephson
weak-links of different size, and the analysis of their low-temperature
behavior. The shorter junctions exhibit critical currents of several tens of
microA at 350 mK, while Josephson coupling persists up to ~2.7 K. Good
agreement is obtained by comparing the measured switching currents to a model
which holds in the diffusive regime. Our results demonstrate that V is an
excellent candidate for the implementation of superconducting nanodevices
operating at a few kelvins.
