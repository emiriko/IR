It is well known that in a generally covariant gravitational theory the
choice of spacetime scalars as coordinates yields phase-space observables (or
"invariants"). However their relation to the symmetry group of diffeomorphism
transformations has remained obscure. In a symmetry-inspired approach we
construct invariants out of canonically induced active gauge transformations.
These invariants may be intepreted as the full set of dynamical variables
evaluated in the intrinsic coordinate system. The functional invariants can
explicitly be written as a Taylor expansion in the coordinates of any observer,
and the coefficients have a physical and geometrical interpretation.
Surprisingly, all invariants can be obtained as limits of a family of canonical
transformations. This permits a short (again geometric) proof that all
invariants, including the lapse and shift, satisfy Poisson brackets that are
equal to the invariants of their corresponding Dirac brackets.
