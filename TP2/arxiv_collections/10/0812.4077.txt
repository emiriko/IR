Ultracold atoms loaded on optical lattices can provide unprecedented
experimental systems for the quantum simulations and manipulations of many
quantum phases and quantum phase transitions between these phases. However, so
far, how to detect these quantum phases and phase transitions effectively
remains an outstanding challenge. In this paper, we will develop a systematic
and unified theory of using the optical Bragg scattering, atomic Bragg
scattering or cavity QED to detect the ground state and the excitation spectrum
of many quantum phases of interacting bosons loaded in bipartite and frustrated
optical lattices.
  We show that the two photon Raman transition processes in the three detection
methods not only couple to the density order parameter, but also the {\sl
valence bond order} parameter due to the hopping of the bosons on the lattice.
This valence bond order coupling is very sensitive to any superfluid order or
any Valence bond (VB) order in the quantum phases to be probed. These quantum
phases include not only the well known superfluid and Mott insulating phases,
but also other important phases such as various kinds of charge density waves
(CDW), valence bond solids (VBS), CDW-VBS phases with both CDW and VBS orders
unique to frustrated lattices, and also various kinds of supersolids.
  The physical measurable quantities of the three experiments are the light
scattering cross sections, the atom scattered clouds and the cavity leaking
photons respectively. We analyze respectively the experimental conditions of
the three detection methods to probe these various quantum phases and their
corresponding excitation spectra. We also address the effects of a finite
temperature and a harmonic trap.
