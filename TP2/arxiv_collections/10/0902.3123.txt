We present the results of simulations of the ultra-high energy cosmic ray
(UHECR) propagation in the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). Different assumptions
on the large-scale GMF structure and/or primary particle lead to distinctly
different deflection patterns of the highest energy cosmic rays (CR). The GMF
modifies the exposure of an UHECR experiment to the extragalactic sky. We
estimated these effects for the Pierre Auger experiment. Further
forward-tracking studies under plausible UHECR sources scenarios will allow for
direct comparison with the observed correlation between the nearby active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and the highest energy Auger events.
