The recent crash demonstrated (once again) that the description of the
financial market by present financial mathematics cannot be considered as
totally satisfactory. We remind that nowadays financial mathematics is heavily
based on the use of random variables and stochastic processes which are
described by Kolmogorov's measure-theoretic model for probability ("classical
probabilistic model"). I speculate that the present financial crises is a sign
(a kind of experiment to test validity of classical probability theory at the
financial market) that the use of this model in finances should be either
totally rejected or at least completed. One of the best candidates for a new
probabilistic financial model is quantum probability or its generalizations, so
to say quantum-like (QL) models. Speculations that the financial market may be
nonclassical have been present in scientific literature for many years. The aim
of this note is to move from the domain of speculation to rigorous statistical
arguments in favor of probabilistic nonclassicality of the financial market. I
design a corresponding statistical test which is based on violation of the
formula of total probability (FTP). The latter is the basic in classical
probability and its violation would be a strong sign in favor of QL behavior at
the market.
