The direct imaging and characterization of Earth-like planets is among the
most sought-after prizes in contemporary astrophysics, however current optical
instrumentation delivers insufficient dynamic range to overcome the vast
contrast differential between the planet and its host star. New opportunities
are offered by coherent single mode fibers, whose technological development has
been motivated by the needs of the telecom industry in the near infrared. This
paper presents a new vision for an instrument using coherent waveguides to
remap the pupil geometry of the telescope. It would (i) inject the full pupil
of the telescope into an array of single mode fibers, (ii) rearrange the pupil
so fringes can be accurately measured, and (iii) permit image reconstruction so
that atmospheric blurring can be totally removed. Here we present a laboratory
experiment whose goal was to validate the theoretical concepts underpinning our
proposed method. We successfully confirmed that we can retrieve the image of a
simulated astrophysical object (in this case a binary star) though a pupil
remapping instrument using single mode fibers.
