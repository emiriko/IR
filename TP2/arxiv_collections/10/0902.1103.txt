This is the first exploration of the galaxy distribution function at
redshifts greater than about 0.1. Redshifts are based on the North and South
GOODS Catalogs. In each catalog we examine clustering in the two redshift bands
0.47 < z < 0.8 and 0.9 < z < 1.5. The mean redshifts of the samples in these
bands are about 0.6 and 1.1. Our main result is that at these redshifts the
galaxy spatial distribution function f_V(N) has the form predicted by
gravitational quasi-equilibrium dynamics for cosmological many-body systems.
This constrains related processes such as galaxy merging and the role of dark
matter in the range of these redshifts.
