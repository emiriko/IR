Some explosion models for Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), such as the
gravitationally confined detonation (GCD) or the double detonation
sub-Chandrasekhar (DDSC) models, rely on the spontaneous initiation of a
detonation in the degenerate C/O material of a white dwarf. The length scales
pertinent to the initiation of the detonation are notoriously unresolved in
multi-dimensional stellar simulations, prompting the use of results of 1D
simulations at higher resolution, such as the ones performed for this work, as
guidelines for deciding whether or not conditions reached in the higher
dimensional full star simulations successfully would lead to the onset of a
detonation. Spontaneous initiation relies on the existence of a suitable
gradient in self-ignition (induction) times of the fuel, which we set up with a
spatially localized non-uniformity of temperature -- a hot spot. We determine
the critical (smallest) sizes of such hot spots that still marginally result in
a detonation in white dwarf matter by integrating the reactive Euler equations
with the hydrodynamics code FLASH. We quantify the dependences of the critical
sizes of such hot spots on composition, background temperature, peak
temperature, geometry, and functional form of the temperature disturbance, many
of which were hitherto largely unexplored in the literature. We discuss the
implications of our results in the context of modeling of SNe Ia.
