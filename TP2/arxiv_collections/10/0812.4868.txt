We explore neutron skin predictions for $^{208}$Pb in relation to the
symmetry pressure in various microscopic models based on realistic
nucleon-nucleon potentials and either the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach
or the conventional Brueckner-Hartree-Fock framework implemented with
three-body forces. We also discuss the correlation between the neutron skin and
the radius of a fixed-mass neutron star.
