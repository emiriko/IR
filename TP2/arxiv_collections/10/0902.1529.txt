This series of lectures gives a pedagogical review of the subject of
cosmological inflation. I discuss Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology and the
horizon and flatness problems of the standard hot Big Bang, and introduce
inflation as a solution to those problems, focusing on the simple scenario of
inflation from a single scalar field. I discuss quantum modes in inflation and
the generation of primordial tensor and scalar fluctuations. Finally, I provide
comparison of inflationary models to the WMAP satellite measurement of the
Cosmic Microwave Background, and briefly discuss future directions for
inflationary physics. The majority of the lectures should be accessible to
advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students with only a background
in Special Relativity, although familiarity with General Relativity and quantum
field theory will be helpful for the more technical sections.
