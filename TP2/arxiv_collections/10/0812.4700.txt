Hepp and Speer sectors were successfully used in the sixties and seventies
for proving mathematical theorems on analytically or/and dimensionally
regularized and renormalized Feynman integrals at Euclidean external momenta.
We describe them within recently developed strategies of introducing iterative
sector decompositions. We show that Speer sectors are reproduced within one of
the existing strategies.
