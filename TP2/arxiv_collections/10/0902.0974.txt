We report the variation of ferromagnetic order in the pseudo-ternary
compounds URh_{1-x}Co_{x}Ge (0 \leq x \leq 1). Magnetization and transport data
taken on polycrystalline samples show that the Curie temperature T_{C}
gradually increases with increasing Co content from a value of 9.5 K for URhGe
to a maximum value of 20 K for x = 0.6 and then steadily decreases to 3 K for
UCoGe. The magnetic interaction strength varies smoothly across the series. For
all samples the electrical resistivity for T < T_{C} follows the behaviour \rho
= \rho_{0} + AT^2. The A coefficient is dominated by scattering at spin waves
and is strongly enhanced for x = 0 and 1.
