Surprisingly few solar coronal loops have been observed simultaneously with
TRACE and SOHO/CDS, and even fewer analyses of these loops have been conducted
and published. The SOHO Joint Observing Program 146 was designed in part to
provide the simultaneous observations required for in-depth temperature
analysis of active region loops and determine whether these loops are
isothermal or multithermal. The data analyzed in this paper were taken on 2003
January 17 of AR 10250. We used TRACE filter ratios, emission measure loci, and
two methods of differential emission measure analysis to examine the
temperature structure of three different loops. TRACE and CDS observations
agree that Loop 1 is isothermal with Log T $=$ 5.85, both along the line of
sight as well as along the length of the loop leg that is visible in the CDS
field of view. Loop 2 is hotter than Loop 1. It is multithermal along the line
of sight, with significant emission between 6.2 $<$ Log T $<$ 6.4, but the loop
apex region is out of the CDS field of view so it is not possible to determine
the temperature distribution as a function of loop height. Loop 3 also appears
to be multithermal, but a blended loop that is just barely resolved with CDS
may be adding cool emission to the Loop 3 intensities and complicating our
results. So, are coronal loops isothermal or multithermal? The answer appears
to be yes!
