We identify higher-charge configurations that satisfy Euler-Lagrange
equations for the (strong coupling limit of) Faddeev-Hopf model, by means of
adequate changes of the domain metric and a reduction technique based on
$\alpha$-Hopf construction. In the last case it is proved that the solutions
are local minima for the reduced energy and we identify among them those who
are global minima for the unreduced energy.
