Generalized Ray Theory (GRT) provides a simple description of MHD mode
transmission and conversion between magnetoacoustic fast and slow waves and is
directly applicable to solar active regions. Here it is tested in a simple
two-dimensional, isothermal, gravitationally-stratified model with inclined
magnetic field using previously published exact solutions and found to perform
very well.
