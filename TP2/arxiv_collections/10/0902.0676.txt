We report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the spin dynamics in
the layered hexagonal magnet 2H-AgNiO2 which has stacked triangular layers of
antiferromagnetically-coupled Ni2+ spins (S=1) ordered in a collinear
alternating stripe pattern. We observe a broad band of magnetic excitations
above a small gap of 1.8 meV and extending up to 7.5 meV, indicating strongly
dispersive excitations. The measured dispersions of the boundaries of the
powder-averaged spectrum can be quantitatively explained by a linear spin-wave
dispersion for triangular layers with antiferromagnetic nearest- and weak
next-nearest neighbor couplings, a strong easy-axis anisotropy and additional
weak inter-layer couplings. The resulting dispersion relation has global minima
not at magnetic Bragg wavevectors but at symmetry-related soft points and we
attribute this anomalous feature to the strong competition between the
easy-axis anisotropy and the frustrated antiferromagnetic couplings. We have
also calculated the quantum corrections to the dispersion relation to order 1/S
in spin-wave theory by extending the work of Chubukov and Jolicoeur [Phys. Rev.
B v46, 11137 (1992)] and find that the presence of easy-axis anisotropy
significantly reduces the quantum renormalizations predicted for the isotropic
model.
