We develop a subtractive renormalization scheme to evaluate the P-wave NN
scattering phase shifts using chiral effective theory potentials. This allows
us to consider arbitrarily high cutoffs in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation
(LSE). We employ NN potentials computed up to next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO) in chiral effective theory, using both dimensional regularization and
spectral-function regularization. Our results obtained from the subtracted
P-wave LSE show that renormalization of the NNLO potential can be achieved by
using the generalized NN scattering lengths as input--an alternative to fitting
the constant that multiplies the P-wave contact interaction in the chiral
effective theory NN force. However, in order to obtain a reasonable fit to the
NN data at NNLO the generalized scattering lengths must be varied away from the
values extracted from the so-called high-precision potentials. We investigate
how the generalized scattering lengths extracted from NN data using various
chiral potentials vary with the cutoff in the LSE. The cutoff-dependence of
these observables, as well as of the phase shifts at $T_{lab} \approx 100$ MeV,
suggests that for a chiral potential computed with dimensional regularization
the highest LSE cutoff it is sensible to adopt is approximately 1 GeV. Using
spectral-function regularization to compute the two-pion-exchange potentials
postpones the onset of cutoff dependence in these quantities, but does not
remove it.
