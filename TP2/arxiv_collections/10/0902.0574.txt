The statistics of the temperature anisotropies in the primordial cosmic
microwave background radiation field provide a wealth of information for
cosmology and for estimating cosmological parameters. An even more acute
inference should stem from the study of maps of the polarization state of the
CMB radiation. Measuring the extremely weak CMB polarization signal requires
very sensitive instruments. The full-sky maps of both temperature and
polarization anisotropies of the CMB to be delivered by the upcoming Planck
Surveyor satellite experiment are hence being awaited with excitement.
Multiscale methods, such as isotropic wavelets, steerable wavelets, or
curvelets, have been proposed in the past to analyze the CMB temperature map.
In this paper, we contribute to enlarging the set of available transforms for
polarized data on the sphere. We describe a set of new multiscale
decompositions for polarized data on the sphere, including decimated and
undecimated Q-U or E-B wavelet transforms and Q-U or E-B curvelets. The
proposed transforms are invertible and so allow for applications in data
restoration and denoising.
