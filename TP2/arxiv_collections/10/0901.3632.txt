We have recently developed a new method for adjusting weights to minimize
sidelobes in the spectral window. Here we show the results of applying this
method to published two-site velocity observations of three stars (alpha Cen A,
alpha Cen B and beta Hyi). Compared to our previous method of minimizing
sidelobes, which involved adjusting the weights on a night-by-night basis, we
find a significant improvement in frequency resolution. In the case of alpha
Cen A, this should allow the detection of extra oscillation modes in the data.
