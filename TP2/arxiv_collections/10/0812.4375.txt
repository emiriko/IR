The process of stop-chargino production at LHC has been calculated in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model at the complete electroweak one-loop
level, assuming a mSUGRA symmetry breaking scheme. Several properties of the
angular and invariant mass distributions of the basic bottom-gluon to
stop-chargino amplitudes have been derived. For a meaningful collection of
different benchmark points the overall electroweak one-loop effects are at most
of the order of a few percent. At the realistically expected LHC accuracy, the
main supersymmetric electroweak features of the process can be therefore
essentially derived in this theoretical scheme from the simple Born level
expressions.
