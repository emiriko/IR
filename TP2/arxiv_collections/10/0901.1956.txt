All the relativistic cosmological models of the universe, except Einstein's
static model, imply that the 3-space of the spacetime of the universe is also
expanding apart from the matter and the radiation in it. However, there is no
observational evidence of the expansion of the 3-space of the spacetime of the
universe. Actually, the 3-space of the spacetime of the universe might not be
expanding at all. Consequently, the conceptual foundation of the relativistic
cosmological models of the universe based on the general theory of relativity,
which in turn is based on Riemannian geometry, might be faulty and misleading.
