A generic procedure is proposed to construct many-body quantum Hamiltonians
with partial dynamical symmetry. It is based on a tensor decomposition of the
Hamiltonian and allows the construction of a hierarchy of interactions that
have selected classes of solvable states. The method is illustrated in the
SO(6) limit of the interacting boson model of atomic nuclei and applied to the
nucleus $^{196}$Pt.
