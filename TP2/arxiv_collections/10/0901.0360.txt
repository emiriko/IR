Filaments which form either between or around active regions (ARs) are called
intermediate filaments. In spite of various theoretical studies, the origin of
the chirality of filaments is still uncovered. We investigated how intermediate
filaments are related to their associated ARs, especially from the point of
view of magnetic helicity and the orientation of polarity inversion lines
(PILs). The chirality of filaments has been determined based on the
orientations of barbs observed in BBSO full-disk Halpha images taken during the
rising phase of solar cycle 23. The sign of magnetic helicity of ARs has been
determined using S/inverse-S shaped sigmoids from Yohkoh SXT images. As a
result, we have found a good correlation between the chirality of filaments and
the magnetic helicity sign of ARs. Among 45 filaments, 42 filaments have shown
the same sign as helicity sign of nearby ARs. It has been also confirmed that
the role of both the orientation and the relative direction of PILs to ARs in
determining the chirality of filaments is not significant, against a
theoretical prediction. These results suggest that the chirality of
intermediate filaments may originate from magnetic helicity of their associated
ARs.
