In the context of bilayer graphene we use the simple gauge model of Jackiw
and Pi to construct its numerical solutions in powers of the bias potential V
according to a general scheme due to Kravchenko. Next, using this numerical
solutions, we develop the Ermakov-Lewis approach for the same model. This leads
us to numerical calculations of the Lewis-Riesenfeld phases that could be of
forthcoming experimental interest for bilayer graphene. We also present a
generalization of the Ioffe-Korsch nonlinear Darboux transformation
