We obtain improved regularity of homeomorphic solutions of the reduced
Beltrami equation, as compared to the standard Beltrami equation. Such an
improvement is not possible in terms of Holder or Sobolev regularity; instead,
our results concern the generalized variation of restrictions to lines.
Specifically, we prove that the restriction to any line segment has finite
p-variation for all p>1 but not necessarily for p=1.
