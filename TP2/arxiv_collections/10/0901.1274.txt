The high resilience to de-coherence shown by a recently discovered
Macroscopic Quantum Superposition (MQS) generated by a quantum injected optical
parametric amplifier (QI-OPA) and involving a number of photons in excess of
5x10^4 motivates the present theoretical and numerical investigation. The
results are analyzed in comparison with the properties of the MQS based on
coherent states and NOON states, in the perspective of the comprehensive theory
of the subject by W.H.Zurek. In that perspective the concepts of "pointer
state", "einselection" are applied to the new scheme.
