We theoretically investigate the optical response of a one-dimensional array
of strongly nonlinear optical microcavities. When the optical nonlinearity is
much larger than both losses and inter-cavity tunnel coupling, the
non-equilibrium steady state of the system is reminiscent of a strongly
correlated Tonks-Girardeau gas of impenetrable bosons. Signatures of strong
correlations are identified in the absorption spectrum of the system, as well
as in the intensity correlations of the emitted light. Possible experimental
implementations in state-of-the-art solid-state devices are discussed.
