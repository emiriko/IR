Previous study of properties of the first-order phase transition in a set of
plasma mod-els with common feature - absence of individual correlations between
charges of opposite sign, was continued. Predicted discontinuities in
equilibrium non-uniform charge profiles have been calculated for the case of
electron distribution in atomic cell and some other similar situations. These
anomalies appear when some simple approximations are used and they may be
naturally interpreted in terms of discussed phase transition.
