Within the frame of cosmologies where Dark Energy (DE) is a self--interacting
scalar field, we allow for a CDM--DE coupling and non--zero neutrino masses,
simultaneously. In their 0--0 version, i.e. in the absence of coupling and
neutrino mass, these cosmologies provide an excellent fit to WMAP, SNIa and
deep galaxy sample spectra, at least as good as \LambdaCDM. When the new
degrees of freedom are open, we find that CDM--DE coupling and significant
neutrino masses (~0.1eV per \nu species) are at least as likely as the 0--0
option and, in some cases, even statistically favoured. Results are obtained by
using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach.
