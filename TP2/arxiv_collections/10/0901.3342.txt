We summarise recent progress in the understanding of the rotational evolution
of low-mass stars (here defined as solar mass down to the hydrogen burning
limit) both in terms of observations and modelling. Wide-field imaging surveys
on moderate-size telescopes can now efficiently derive rotation periods for
hundreds to thousands of open cluster members, providing unprecedented sample
sizes which are ripe for exploration. We summarise the available measurements,
and provide simple phenomenological and model-based interpretations of the
presently-available data, while highlighting regions of parameter space where
more observations are required, particularly at the lowest masses and ages >~
500 Myr.
