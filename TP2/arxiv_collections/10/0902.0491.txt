We discuss a model for the on-site matrix elements of the sp3d5s*
tight-binding hamiltonian of a strained diamond or zinc-blende crystal or
nanostructure. This model features on-site, off-diagonal couplings between the
s, p and d orbitals, and is able to reproduce the effects of arbitrary strains
on the band energies and effective masses in the full Brillouin zone. It
introduces only a few additional parameters and is free from any ambiguities
that might arise from the definition of the macroscopic strains as a function
of the atomic positions. We apply this model to silicon, germanium and their
alloys as an illustration. In particular, we make a detailed comparison of
tight-binding and ab initio data on strained Si, Ge and SiGe.
