We describe simply connected compact exceptional simple Lie groups in very
elementary way. We first construct all simply connected compact exceptional Lie
groups G concretely. Next, we find all involutive automorphisms of G, and
determine the group structures of the fixed points subgroup. They correspond to
the classification of all irreducible compact symmetric spaces of exceptional
type, and that they also correspond to classification of all non-compact
exceptionalsimple Lie groups. Finally, we determined the group structures of
the maximal subgroups of maximal rank. At any rate, we would like this book to
be used in mathematics and physics.
