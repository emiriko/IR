Current limit on the dark matter relic abundance may suggest that $|\mu|$
should be smaller than prediction in the minimal supergravity scenario (mSUGRA)
for moderate $m_0$ and $m_{1/2}$. The electroweak-ino parameter $M_1, M_2$ and
$|\mu|$ are then much closer to each other. This can be realized naturally in
the non-universal Higgs mass model (NUHM). Since the heaviest neutralino
($\tilde\chi^0_4$) and chargino ($\tilde\chi^\pm_2$) have significant gaugino
components, they may appear frequently in the left-handed squark decay and then
be detectable at the LHC. In such a case, we showed that the hierarchy of $M_1,
M_2$ and $|\mu|$ can be determined. In the light slepton mass scenario with
non-vanishing lepton-flavor violation (LFV) in the right-handed sector, NUHM
with small $|\mu|$ corresponds to region of parameter space where strong
cancellation among leading contributions to $Br(\mu\to e\gamma)$ can occur. We
showed that determination of electroweak-ino hierarchy plays a crucial role in
resolving cancellation point of $Br(\mu\to e\gamma)$ and determination of LFV
parameters. We also discussed test of the universality of the slepton masses at
the LHC and the implications to SUSY flavor models.
