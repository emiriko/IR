We present the results of a new magnetic field survey of Herbig Ae/Be and A
debris disk stars. They are used to determine whether magnetic field properties
in these stars are correlated with the mass-accretion rate, disk inclinations,
companion(s), Silicates, PAHs, or show a more general correlation with age and
X-ray emission as expected for the decay of a remnant dynamo.
