The discovery of events in time series can have important implications, such
as identifying microlensing events in astronomical surveys, or changes in a
patient's electrocardiogram. Current methods for identifying events require a
sliding window of a fixed size, which is not ideal for all applications and
could overlook important events. In this work, we develop probability models
for calculating the significance of an arbitrary-sized sliding window and use
these probabilities to find areas of significance. Because a brute force search
of all sliding windows and all window sizes would be computationally
intractable, we introduce a method for quickly approximating the results. We
apply our method to over 100,000 astronomical time series from the MACHO
survey, in which 56 different sections of the sky are considered, each with one
or more known events. Our method was able to recover 100% of these events in
the top 1% of the results, essentially pruning 99% of the data. Interestingly,
our method was able to identify events that do not pass traditional event
discovery procedures.
