In this photometric study of the stellar association LH 95 in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we focus on the pre-main Sequence (PMS) population in
order to construct, for the first time, the sub-solar initial mass function
(IMF) in the LMC. We use the deepest photometry ever performed in the LMC with
the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on-board the Hubble Space Telescope(HST).
We carry out a Monte Carlo technique to subtract the contribution of the
general field of LMC and we isolate the central region in the observed area of
the association. We study the mass function of its field-subtracted population.
For this purpose, we introduce a new set of evolutionary models, derived from
the calculations on the evolution of PMS stars by Siess et al. We use these
models with our observations of LH 95 to derive the IMF of the system, which is
reliably constructed down to 0.43 M_sun, the lowest mass ever observed within
reasonable completeness in the Magellanic Clouds. Consequently, its
construction offers an outstanding improvement in our understanding of the
low-mass star formation in the LMC. The system IMF of LH 95 shows a definite
change in its slope at 1 M_sun, where it becomes more shallow. In general, the
shape of this IMF agrees very well with the average Galactic IMF, down to the
sub-solar regime. As far as the slope of this system IMF is concerned, it is
found to be somewhat more shallow than the corresponding classical Galactic IMF
in the sub-solar regime, probably due to unresolved binarity, while for stars
with M>1M_sun it becomes slightly steeper. We do not find significant
differences in the shape of the overall IMF of LH 95 from that of each of the
three individual sub-clusters, suggesting that the IMF of LH 95 is not subject
to local variability.
