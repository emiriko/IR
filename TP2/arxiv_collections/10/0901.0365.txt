Terahertz time domain spectroscopy and rigorous simulations are used to probe
the coupling between a dark and a bright plasmonic eigenmode in a metamaterial
with broken symmetry. The metamaterial consists of two closely spaced split
ring resonators that have their gaps in non-identical positions within the
ring. For normal incidence and a fixed polarization both lowest order
eigenmodes of the split ring resonators can be excited; although one of them
has to be regarded as dark since coupling is prohibited because of symmetry
constraints. Emphasis in this work is put on a systematic evaluation of the
coupling effects depending on a spectral tuning of both resonances.
