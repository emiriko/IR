Electron-hole generation and recombination rates for intravalley and
intervalley phonon scattering in Graphene are presented. The transverse and the
longitudinal optical phonon modes ($E_{2g}$-modes) near the zone center
($\Gamma$-point) contribute to intravalley interband carrier scattering. At the
zone edge ($K(K')$-point), only the transverse optical phonon mode
($A'_{1}$-mode) contributes significantly to intervalley interband scattering
with recombination rates faster than those due to zone center phonons. The
calculated recombination times range from less than a picosecond to more than
hundreds of picoseconds and are strong functions of temperature and electron
and hole densities. The theoretical calculations agree well with experimental
measurements of the recombination rates of photoexcited carriers in graphene.
