It will be shown that the peaks in the (Lambda p) and (Lambda d) invariant
mass distributions, observed in recent FINUDA experiments and claimed to be
signals of deeply bound kaonic states, are naturally explained in terms of K-
absorption by two or three nucleons leaving the rest of the original nuclei as
spectator. For reactions on heavy nuclei, the subsequent interactions of the
particles produced in the primary absorption process with the residual nucleus
play an important role. Our analyses leads to the conclusion that at present
there is no experimental evidence of deeply bound K- state in nuclei. Although
the FINUDA experiments have been done for reasons which are not supported a
posteriori, some new physics can be extracted from the data.
