The timeon model recently proposed by Friedberg and Lee has a potential
problem of flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs) if the mass of the timeon
is small. In order to avoid, we introduce a small dimensionless parameter to
suppress FCNCs. Even in this case, we find that the timeon mass must be larger
than 151 GeV to satisfy all the constraints from processes involving FCNCs in
the quark sectors. We also extend the timeon model to the lepton sector and
examine the leptonic processes.
