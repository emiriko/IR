The charge and potential distributions for insulating particles approaching a
substrate with regular insulating structures are studied by particle-in-cell
numerical simulations. An elongated particle and substrate with elongated
structures are considered for flowing plasmas. The role of the relative
position of the particle and the substrate in their interactions is
investigated. It is also demonstrated that the interactions are modified by
photoemission due to directed UV light. The simulations are two dimensional
with ions and electrons treated as individual particles.
