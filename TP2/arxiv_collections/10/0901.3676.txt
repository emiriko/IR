The study of the evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation has been
controversial in the past years. The main difficulty is in determining the
required parameters for intermediate and high redshift galaxies.
  This work aims to identify the main problems of the study of the Tully-Fisher
relation at high redshift using optical emission lines, in order to draw
conclusions about the possible evolution of this relation in the B, R, and
I-bands.
  With this aim, the rotational velocities obtained from the widths of
different optical lines using DEEP2 spectra are compared. Morphology has been
determined via HST images, using and comparing different methodologies.
Instrumental magnitudes are then corrected for K and extinction and the
absolute magnitudes derived for the concordance cosmological model. Finally,
the optical Tully-Fisher relations in B, R, and I-bands at different redshifts
up to z = 1.3 are derived.
  Although most studies (this one included) find evidence of evolution, the
results are not conclusive enough, since the possible luminosity evolution is
within the scattering of the relation, and the evolution in slope is difficult
to determine because at high redshift only the brightest galaxies can be
measured. Nevertheless, our study shows a clear tendency, which is the same for
all bands studied, that favours a luminosity evolution where galaxies were
brighter in the past for the same rotation velocity. This result also implies
that the colour of the Tully-Fisher relation does not change with redshift,
supporting the collapse model versus the accretion model of disc galaxy
formation.
