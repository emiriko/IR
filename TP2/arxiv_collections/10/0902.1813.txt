Let phi: P^1 --> P^1 be a rational map defined over a field K. We construct
the moduli space M_d(N) parameterizing conjugacy classes of degree-d maps with
a point of formal period N and present an algebraic proof that M_2(N) is
geometrically irreducible for N>1. Restricting ourselves to maps phi of
arbitrary degree d >= 2 such that the composition h^{-1} phi h = phi for some
nontrivial h in PGL_2, we show that the moduli space parameterizing these maps
with a point of formal period N is geometrically reducible for infinitely many
N.
