Recent observations of the Vela pulsar have revealed a peculiar connection of
its emission in the soft X-ray and radio ranges. We suggest the model of the
radio pulse formation in the Vela pulsar, develop the theory of the radio
photon reprocessing to high energies and on this basis interpret the observed
X-ray - radio connection. The processes of spontaneous and induced scattering
of radio waves off the spiraling particles and their observational consequences
are examined. The particles are assumed to acquire relativistic gyration
energies due to resonant absorption of the radio emission in the outer
magnetosphere of a pulsar. The spectral and angular distributions of the
spontaneously scattered power are analyzed and compared with the
characteristics of the particle synchrotron emission. The consequences of
intensity transfer from the radio beam to the background in the course of
induced scattering are studied as well. It is demonstrated that the induced
scattering can account for the basic features of the Vela's radio profile and
its pulse-to-pulse fluctuations. In particular, it can explain a greater role
of the leading component and its earlier arrival in stronger pulses. The
studies of the radio photon reprocessing to high energies in application to the
Vela pulsar shows that the scattered and synchrotron spectra peak at 0.8 and
0.2 keV, respectively, with the corresponding luminosities of 10^{29} erg
s^{-1} and 10^{31} erg s^{-1}. Within the framework of our model, the observed
X-ray - radio connection is explained in terms of the interplay between the
processes of induced and spontaneous scattering of the radio pulse.
