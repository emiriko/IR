A graphene bilayer phototransistor (GBL-PT) is proposed and analyzed. The
GBL-PT under consideration has the structure of a field-effect transistor with
a GBL as the channel and the back and top gates. The positive bias of the back
gate results in the formation of conducting source and drain sections in the
channel, while the negatively biased top gate provides the potential barrier
which is controlled by the charge of the photogenerated holes. The features of
the GBL-PT operation are associated with the variations of both the potential
distribution and the energy gap in different sections of the channel when the
gate voltages and the charge in the barrier section change. Using the developed
GBL-PT device model, the spectral characteristics, dark current, responsivity
and detectivity are calculated as functions of the applied voltages, energy of
incident photons, intensity of electron and hole scattering, and geometrical
parameters. It is shown that the GBL-PT spectral characteristics are voltage
tuned. The GBL-PT performance as photodetector in the terahertz and infrared
photodetectors can markedly exceed the performance of other photodetectors.
