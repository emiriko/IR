The current generation of Imaging Atmospheric telescopes (IACTs) has
demonstrated the power of the technique in an energy range between ~100 GeV up
to several tens of TeV. At the high-energy end, these instruments are limited
by photon statistics. Future arrays of IACTs such as CTA or AGIS are planned to
push into the energy range beyond 100 TeV. Scientifically, this region is very
promising, providing a probe of particles up to the 'knee' in the cosmic ray
spectrum and access to an unexplored region in the spectra of nearby
extragalactic sources. We present first results from our simulation studies of
the high-energy part of a future IACT array and discuss the design parameters
of such an array.
