The major challenges to fabricate quantum processors and future nano solid
state devices are material modification techniques with nanometre resolution
and suppression of statistical fluctuations of dopants or qubit carriers. Based
on a segmented ion trap with mK laser cooled ions we have realized a
deterministic single ion source which could operate with a huge range of
sympathetically cooled ion species, isotopes or ionic molecules. We have
deterministically extracted a predetermined number of ions on demand and have
measured a longitudinal velocity uncertainty of 6.3m/s and a spatial beam
divergence of 0.6 mrad. We show in numerical simulations that if the ions are
cooled to the motional ground state (Heisenberg limit) nanometre spatial
resolution can be achieved.
