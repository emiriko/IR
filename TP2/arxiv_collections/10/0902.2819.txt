The effect of temperature controlled annealing on the confined valence
electron states in CdSe nanocrystal arrays, deposited as thin films, was
studied using two-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation
(2D-ACAR). A reduction in the intensity by ~35% was observed in a feature of
the positron annihilation spectrum upon removal of the pyridine capping
molecules above 200 degrees Celsius in a vacuum. This reduction is explained by
an increased electronic interaction of the valence orbitals of neighboring
nanocrystals, induced by the formation of inorganic interfaces. Partial
evaporation of the nanoporous CdSe layer and additional sintering into a
polycrystalline thin film was observed at a relatively low temperature of ~486
degrees Celsius.
