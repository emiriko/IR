We provide a pure algebraic version of the dynamical characterization of
Conrad's property. This approach allows dealing with general group actions on
totally ordered spaces. As an application, we give a new and somehow
constructive proof of a theorem first established by Linnell: an orderable
group having infinitely many orderings has uncountably many. This proof is
achieved by extending to uncountable orderable groups a result about orderings
which may be approximated by their conjugates. This last result is illustrated
by an example of an exotic ordering on the free group given in the Appendix.
