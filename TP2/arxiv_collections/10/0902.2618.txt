Constant flux atom deposition into a porous medium is shown to generate a
dense overlayer and a diffusion profile. Scaling analysis shows that the
overlayer acts as a dynamic control for atomic diffusion in the porous
substrate. This is modeled by generalizing the porous diffusion equation with a
time-dependent diffusion coefficient equivalent to a nonlinear rescaling of
time
