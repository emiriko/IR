Silicon nanoparticles are experimentally investigated as a potential
hyperpolarized, targetable MRI imaging agent. Nuclear T_1 times at room
temperature for a variety of Si nanoparticles are found to be remarkably long
(10^2 to 10^4 s) - roughly consistent with predictions of a core-shell
diffusion model - allowing them to be transported, administered and imaged on
practical time scales without significant loss of polarization. We also report
surface functionalization of Si nanoparticles, comparable to approaches used in
other biologically targeted nanoparticle systems.
