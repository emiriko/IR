We present a multipartite entanglement measure for $N$-qudit pure states,
using the norm of the correlation tensor which occurs in the Bloch
representation of the state. We compute this measure for important class of
$N$-qutrit pure states, namely general GHZ states. We prove that this measure
possesses almost all the properties expected of a good entanglement measure,
including monotonicity. Finally, we extend this measure to $N$-qudit mixed
states via convex roof construction and establish its various properties,
including its monotonicity.
