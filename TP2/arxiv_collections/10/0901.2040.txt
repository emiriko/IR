EDELWEISS is a direct dark matter search experiment situated in the low
radioactivity environment of the Modane Underground Laboratory. The experiment
uses Ge detectors at very low temperature in order to identify eventual rare
nuclear recoils induced by elastic scattering of WIMPs from our Galactic halo.
We present results of the commissioning of the second phase of the experiment,
involving more than 7 kg of Ge, that has been completed in 2007. We describe
two new types of detectors with active rejection of events due to surface
contamination. This active rejection is required in order to achieve the
physics goals of 10-8 pb cross-section measurement for the current phase.
