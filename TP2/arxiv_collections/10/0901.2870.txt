Complex dynamical systems are often modeled as networks, with nodes
representing dynamical units which interact through the network's links. Gene
regulatory networks, responsible for the production of proteins inside a cell,
are an example of system that can be described as a network of interacting
genes. The behavior of a complex dynamical system is characterized by
cooperativity of its units at various scales, leading to emergent dynamics
which is related to the system's function. Among the key problems concerning
complex systems is the issue of stability of their functioning, in relation to
different internal and external interaction parameters.
  In this Thesis we study two-dimensional chaotic maps coupled through
non-directed networks with different topologies. We use a non-symplectic
coupling which involves a time delay in the interaction among the maps. We test
the stability of network topologies through investigation of their collective
motion, done by analyzing the departures from chaotic nature of the isolated
units. The study is done on two network scales: (a) full-size networks (a
computer generated scalefree tree and a tree with addition of cliques); (b)
tree's characteristic sub-graph 4-star, as a tree's typical dynamical motif
which captures its topology in smallest possible number of nodes and is
suitable for time-delayed interaction. We study the dynamical relationship
between these two network structures, examining the emergence of cooperativity
on a large scale (trees) as a consequence of mesoscale dynamical patterns
exhibited by the 4-star. (FULL ABSTRACT INSIDE THE TEXT)
