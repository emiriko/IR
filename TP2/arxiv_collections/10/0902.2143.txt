We transferred the frequency of an ultra-stable laser over a 108 km urban
fiber link comprising 22 km of optical communications network fiber
simultaneously carrying Internet data traffic. The metrological signal and the
digital data signal are transferred on two different frequency channels in a
dense wavelength division multiplexing scheme. The metrological signal is
inserted into and extracted from the communications network by using
bidirectional off-the-shelf optical add-drop multiplexers. The link-induced
phase noise is measured and cancelled with round-trip technique using an
all-fiber-based interferometer. The compensated link shows an Allan deviation
of a few 10-16 at one second and below 10-19 at 10,000 seconds. This opens the
way to a wide dissemination of ultra stable optical clock signals between
distant laboratories via the Internet network.
