In this talk we discuss enveloping algebra based noncommutative gauge field
theory, constructed at the first order in noncommutative parameter theta, as an
effective, anomaly free theory, with one-loop renormalizable gauge sector.
Limits on the scale of noncommutativity parameter Lambda_NC, via related
phenomenology and associated experiments, are analyzed and a firm bound to the
scale of the noncommutativity is set around few TeV's.
