It is argued that the quantum correlations are not maximally nonlocal to make
it possible to control local outcomes from outside spacetime, and quantum
mechanics emerges from timeless nonlocality and biased local randomness. This
rules out a world described by NL (nonlocal) boxes. A new type of experiments
is suggested.
