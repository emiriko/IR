We study a model for the mass matrices of the leptons. We are ablte to relate
the mass eigenvalues of the charged leptons and of the neutrinos to the mxiing
angles and can predict the masses of the neutrinos. We find a normal hierarchy
-the masses are 0.004 eV, 0.01 eV and 0.05 eV. The atmospheric mixing angle is
given by the mass ratios of the charged leptons and of the neutrinos. We find
38 degrees, consistent with the experiments. The mixing element, connecting the
first neutrino with the electron, is found to be 0.05.
