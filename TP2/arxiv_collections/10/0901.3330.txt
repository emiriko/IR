`Zero-spin-photon hypothesis' as proposed in an earlier paper [1] states
that: `due to inevitable consequence of the second-law of thermodynamics and
spin-conservation, the `zero-spin-photon' is generated in pair-production
process (of elementary particles), which decays into neutrino and
antineutrino'. The zero-spin photon hypothesis explains [1] several riddles of
physics and universe. In the present paper, it is shown that `the zero-spin
photon hypothesis' when incorporated into the higer-order Feynman diagram (with
a closed-loop) could possibly solve the half-a-century-old and famous
`infinity-problem' of QED, and thus could avoid the need of the so called
`re-normalization' procedure.
