Calculation of the distribution of the average value of a Gaussian random
field in a finite domain is carried out for different cases. The results of the
calculation demonstrate a strong dependence of the width of the distribution on
the spatial correlations of the field. Comparison with the simulation results
for the distribution of the size of the cluster indicates that the distribution
of an average field could serve as a useful tool for the estimation of the
asymptotic behavior of the distribution of the size of the clusters for "deep"
clusters where value of the field on each site is much greater than the rms
disorder.
