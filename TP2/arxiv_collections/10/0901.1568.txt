We report on the observation of Fermi edge enhanced resonant tunneling
transport in a II-VI semiconductor heterostructure. The resonant transport
through a self assembled CdSe quantum dot survives up to 45 K and probes a
disordered two dimensional (2D) like emitter which dominates the magnetic field
dependence of the transport. An enhancement of the tunnel current through many
particle effects is clearly observable, even without an applied magnetic field.
Additional fine structure in the tunneling current suggests that while
conventional Fermi edge singularity theory successfull reproduces the general
features of the increased transmission, it is not adequate to describe all
details of the current enhancement.
