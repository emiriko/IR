Particle production in p+p and central Pb+Pb collisions at LHC is discussed
in the context of the statistical thermal model. For heavy-ion collisions,
predictions of various particle ratios are presented. The sensitivity of
several ratios on the temperature and the baryon chemical potential is studied
in detail, and some of them, which are particularly appropriate to determine
the chemical freeze-out point experimentally, are indicated. Considering
elementary interactions on the other hand, we focus on strangeness production
and its possible suppression. Extrapolating the thermal parameters to LHC
energy, we present predictions of the statistical model for particle yields in
p+p collisions. We quantify the strangeness suppression by the correlation
volume parameter and discuss its influence on particle production. We propose
observables that can provide deeper insight into the mechanism of strangeness
production and suppression at LHC.
