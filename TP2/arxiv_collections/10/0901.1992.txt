We study the correlations between quark-antiquark pairs in different quantum
number channels in a deconfined plasma by using an effective model of QCD.
Using the three flavour PNJL model, the finite temperature spectral functions
for different mesonic states are studied at zero and nonzero quark chemical
potentials. It is found that in the $\eta$ channel resonance structures survive
above the chiral transition temperature $\tc$, while the kaonic states seem to
get washed off just above $\tc$. The sensitivity of the structures to the
anomaly term are carefully investigated.
