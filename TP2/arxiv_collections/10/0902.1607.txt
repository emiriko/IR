We propose an application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for rapidity
distributions of individual events in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.
The test is particularly suitable to recognise non-statistical differences
between the events. Thus when applied to a narrow centrality class it could
indicate differences between events which would not be expected if all events
evolve according to the same scenario. In particular, as an example we assume
here a possible fragmentation of the fireball into smaller pieces at the
quark/hadron phase transition. Quantitative studies are performed with a Monte
Carlo model capable of simulating such a distribution of hadrons. We conclude
that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is a very powerful tool for the identification
of the fragmentation process.
