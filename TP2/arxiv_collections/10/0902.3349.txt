We present deep 1.4GHz Very Large Array (VLA) radio continuum observations of
two ~half square degree fields in the Coma cluster of galaxies. The two fields,
"Coma 1" and "Coma 3," correspond to the cluster core and southwest infall
region and were selected on account of abundant pre-existing multiwavelength
data. In their most sensitive regions the radio data reach 22 uJy rms per 4.4"
beam, sufficient to detect (at 5-sigma) Coma member galaxies with log(L) =
20.11 W/Hz. The full catalog of radio detections is presented herein and
consists of 1030 sources detected at >=5 sigma, 628 of which are within the
combined Coma 1 and Coma 3 area. We also provide optical identifications of the
radio sources using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The depth of
the radio observations allows us to detect AGN in cluster elliptical galaxies
with Mr < -20.5 (AB magnitudes), including radio detections for all cluster
ellipticals with Mr < -21.8. At fainter optical magnitudes (-20.5 < Mr <~ -19)
the radio sources are associated with star-forming galaxies with star formation
rates as low as 0.1 solar masses per year.
