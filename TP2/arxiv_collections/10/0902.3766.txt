The transverse electromagnetic waves propagating in a relativistic two-fluid
plasma influenced by the gravitational field of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de
Sitter black hole has been investigated exploiting 3+1 split of spacetime.
Reformulating the two-fluid equations, the set of simultaneous linear equations
for the perturbations have been derived. Using a local approximation, the
one-dimensional radial propagation of Alfv\'{e}n and high frequency
electromagnetic waves are investigated. The dispersion relation for these waves
is obtained and solved numerically for the wave number.
