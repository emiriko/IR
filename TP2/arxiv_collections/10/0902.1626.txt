We give a direct construction of the conformally invariant measure on
self-avoiding loops in Riemann surfaces (Werner measure) from chordal
$\text{SLE}_{8/3}$. We give a new proof of uniqueness of the measure and use
Schramm's formula to construct a measure on boundary bubbles encircling an
interior point. After establishing covariance properties for this bubble
measure, we apply these properties to obtain a measure on loops by integrating
measures on boundary bubbles. We calculate the distribution of the conformal
radius of boundary bubbles encircling an interior point and deduce from it
explicit upper and lower bounds for the loop measure.
