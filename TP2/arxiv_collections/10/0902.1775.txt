It is apparent to anyone who thinks about it that, to a large degree, the
basic concepts of Newtonian physics are quite intuitive, but quantum mechanics
is not. My purpose in this talk is to introduce you to a new, much more
intuitive way to understand how quantum mechanics works. I refer to this method
as a guided numerical approximation scheme and it is based upon a new look at
what the path integral tells us about states in Hilbert space. I begin with
simple exactly solvable models and show how to handle problems which cannot be
dealt with analytically, this includes the treatment of the evolution of a
Gaussian wave-packet in an anharmonic potential as well tunneling problems
(i.e., instanton effects)
