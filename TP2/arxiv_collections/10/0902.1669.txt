Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in a system when its Hamiltonian
possesses a certain symmetry, whereas the ground state wave functions do not
preserve it. This provides such a scenario that a bifurcation, which breaks the
symmetry, occurs when some control parameter crosses its critical value. It is
unveiled that the ground state fidelity per lattice site exhibits such a
bifurcation for quantum lattice systems undergoing quantum phase transitions.
The significance of this result lies in the fact that the ground state fidelity
per lattice site is \textit{universal}, in the sense that it is
model-independent, in contrast to (model-dependent) order parameters. This
fundamental quantity may be computed by exploiting the newly-developed tensor
network algorithms on infinite-size lattices. We illustrate the scheme in terms
of the quantum Ising model in a transverse magnetic field and the spin 1/2 XYX
model in an external magnetic field on an infinite-size lattice in one spatial
dimension.
