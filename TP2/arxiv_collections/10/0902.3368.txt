We consider classical string spectrum of R x CP^3, and construct a family of
solutions with residual SU(2) symmetry by the dressing method on SU(4)/U(3)
sigma model. All of them obey the square-root type dispersion relation, as is
expected from the su(2|2) symmetry. A single dyonic giant magnon is not found
in this approach.
