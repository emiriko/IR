By using a renormalized mean-field theory, we investigate the phase diagram
of $t$-$t'$-$J$-$J'$ model on two dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice which
are topologically equivalent to synthesized material $\mathrm{SrCu_2(BO_3)_2}$.
We find that the symmetry of superconductivity ground state depends on the
frustration amplitude $\eta=t'/t$ and doping concentration. For weak to
intermediate frustration, $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing symmetry is robust in a
large parameter region. Around the symmetric point $|\eta|=1$, d-wave,
$s$-s-wave pairing as well as staggered flux may serve as ground state by
varying the doping level. There is a first-order transition between these
distinct ground states. For larger frustration $|\eta|>1$, the ground state has
an $s$-s-wave symmetry for both hole and electron doping.
