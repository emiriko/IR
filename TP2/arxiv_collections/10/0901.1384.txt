We study the adiabatic quantum dynamics of an anisotropic spin-1 XY chain
across a second order quantum phase transition. The system is driven out of
equilibrium by performing a quench on the uniaxial single-spin anisotropy, that
is supposed to vary linearly in time. We show that, for sufficiently large
system sizes, the excess energy after the quench admits a non trivial scaling
behavior that is not predictable by standard Kibble-Zurek arguments for
isolated critical points or extended critical regions. This emerges from a
competing effect of many accessible low-lying excited states, inside the whole
continuous line of critical points.
