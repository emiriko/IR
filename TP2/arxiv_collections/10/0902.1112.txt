We perform a global fit to the structure function F_2 measured in
lepton-proton experiments at small values of Bjorken-x, x\le 0.01, for all
experimentally available values of Q^2, 0.045 GeV^2\le Q^2 \le 800 GeV^2. We
show that the recent improvements resulting from the inclusion of running
coupling corrections allow for a description of data in terms of non-linear QCD
evolution equations. In this approach F_2 is calculated within the dipole model
with all Bjorken-x dependence described by the running coupling
Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. Two different initial conditions for the evolution
are used, both yielding excellent fits to data with \chi^2/d.o.f.<1.1. Data for
the proton longitudinal structure function F_L, not included in the fits, are
also well described. We provide predictions for F_2 and F_L in the kinematical
regions of interest for future colliders and ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Our
analysis allows to perform a first principle extrapolation of the proton-dipole
scattering amplitude. A numerical implementation of our results down to
x=10^{-12} is released as a computer code for public use.
