We study the mechanisms and the limits of pumping vorticity into a spinor
condensate through manipulations of magnetic (B-) fields. We discover a
fundamental connection between the geometrical properties of the magnetic
fields and the quantized circulation of magnetically trapped atoms, a result
which generalizes several recent experimental and theoretical studies. The
optimal procedures are devised that are capable of continuously increasing or
decreasing a condensate's vorticity by repeating certain two step B-field
manipulation protocols. We carry out detailed numerical simulations that
support the claim that our protocols are highly efficient, stable, and robust
against small imperfections of all types. Our protocols can be implemented
experimentally within current technologies.
