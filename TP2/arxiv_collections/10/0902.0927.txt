We show that the vast majority of all pure states featuring a common
expectation value of some generic observable at a given time will yield very
similar expectation values of the same observable at any later time. This is
meant to apply to Schroedinger type dynamics in high dimensional Hilbert
spaces. As a consequence individual dynamics of expectation values are then
typically well described by the ensemble average. Our approach is based on the
Hilbert space average method. We support the analytical investigations with
numerics obtained by exact diagonalization of the full time-dependent
Schroedinger equation for some pertinent, abstract Hamiltonian model.
Furthermore, we discuss the implications on the applicability of projection
operator methods with respect to initial states, as well as on irreversibility
in general.
