Spectral singularities are spectral points that spoil the completeness of the
eigenfunctions of certain non-Hermitian Hamiltonian operators. We identify
spectral singularities of complex scattering potentials with the real energies
at which the reflection and transmission coefficients tend to infinity, i.e.,
they correspond to resonances having a zero width. We show that a wave guide
modeled using such a potential operates like a resonator at the frequencies of
spectral singularities. As a concrete example, we explore the spectral
singularities of an imaginary PT-symmetric barrier potential and demonstrate
the above resonance phenomenon for a certain electromagnetic wave guide.
