In this work we mimic the efficient propulsion mechanism of natural cilia by
magnetically actuating thin films in a cyclic but non-reciprocating manner. By
simultaneously solving the elasto-dynamic, magnetostatic and fluid mechanics
equations, we show that the amount of fluid propelled is proportional to the
area swept by the cilia. By using the intricate interplay between film
magnetization and applied field we are able to generate a pronounced asymmetry
and associated flow. We delineate the functional response of the system in
terms of three dimensionless parameters that capture the relative contribution
of elastic, inertial, viscous and magnetic forces.
