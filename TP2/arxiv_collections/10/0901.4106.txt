In this article it is shown that the fundamental equations of relativistic
Bohmian mechanics for multiple bosonic particles have a dual description in
terms of a classical theory of curved space-time. We further generalize the
results to interactions with an external electromagnetic field, which
corresponds to the minimally coupled Klein-Gordon equation.
