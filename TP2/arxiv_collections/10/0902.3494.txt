We study the nonperturbative dynamics of nonsupersymmetric asymptotically
free gauge theories with fermionic matter in distinct representations of the
SO(N) and Sp(2N) gauge groups. We use different analytic methods to unveil the
associated conformal windows for the relevant matter representations. We
propose a direct test for confronting and establishing the validity of the
analytic methods used to constrain the conformal windows. By comparing the
resulting windows for SU, Sp and SO a pleasing universal picture emerges.
