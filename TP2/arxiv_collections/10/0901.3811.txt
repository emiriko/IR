We report Cu-NMR/NQR and F-NMR studies on the multilayered high-T_c copper
oxides Ba_2Ca_{n-1}Cu_nO_{2n}F_2 with n=2,3,4, where n is the number of CuO_2
planes. It is revealed that bi-layered Ba_2CaCu_2O_4F_2 is an underdoped
superconductor with hole carriers, which are introduced into CuO_2 planes by an
unexpected deviation from the nominal content of apical fluorines. In a
previous paper, we proposed a self-doping mechanism as the origin of carrier
doping in n=3 and n=4; in the mechanism, electrons are transferred from the
inner CuO_2 plane (IP) to the outer one (OP). However, since it has been found
that the bi-layered compound is hole doped, we have reexamined the
superconducting and magnetic properties in n=3 and n=4 by Cu-NMR/NQR and F-NMR.
The extensive NMR studies have confirmed that the apical-fluorine compounds are
not self-doped but hole-doped, and that antiferromagnetism (AFM) and
superconductivity (SC) coexist in a single CuO_2 plane. In n=4, the AFM
ordering occurs at T_N = 80 K, well above T_c=55 K, where the respective AFM
moments are M_AFM=0.11 mu_B and 0.18 mu_B at the OP and the IP. In n=3, on the
other hand, the underdoped single IP exhibits a spontaneous moment M_AFM=0.12
mu_B at low temperatures and a peak in the nuclear-spin-lattice relaxation rate
1/T_1 of F at T_N=23 K, much lower than T_c = 76 K. We note that the increase
in the number of IPs from one to two leads to an increase in T_N due to
strengthening the interlayer coupling, although the doping levels for both
compounds are almost comparable. The present results strongly suggest that the
uniform mixing of AFM and SC is a general property inherent to a single CuO_2
plane in the underdoped regime for hole-doping.
