We examine various direct and indirect experimental constraints on the nearly
minimal supersymmetric standard model (nMSSM) and obtain the following
observations: (i) Current experiments stringently constrain the parameter
space, setting a range of 1-37 GeV for the lightest neutralino (LSP), 30-140
GeV (1-250 GeV) for the lightest CP-even (CP-odd) Higgs boson, and 1.5-10 for
\tan\beta; (ii) To account for the dark matter relic density, besides the
s-channel exchange of a Z-boson, the s-channel exchange of a light A_1 (the
lightest CP-odd Higgs boson) can also play an important role in LSP
annihilation. Compared with the Z-exchange annihilation channel, the A_1
exchange channel is more favored by muon g-2 data and allows much broader
regions for the parameters; (iii) In a large part of the allowed parameter
space the SM-like Higgs boson may dominantly decay to LSP pair or A_1 pair and
the conventional visible decays (e.g. into bottom quarks) are severely
suppressed.
