We analyze a structure of the singular Lagrangian $L$ with first and second
class constraints of an arbitrary stage. We show that there exist an equivalent
Lagrangian (called the extended Lagrangian $\tilde L$) that generates all the
original constraints on second stage of the Dirac-Bergmann procedure. The
extended Lagrangian is obtained in closed form through the initial one. The
formalism implies an extension of the original configuration space by auxiliary
variables. Some of them are identified with gauge fields supplying local
symmetries of $\tilde L$. As an application of the formalism, we found closed
expression for the gauge generators of $\tilde L$ through the first class
constraints. It turns out to be much more easy task as those for $L$. All the
first class constraints of $L$ turn out to be the gauge symmetry generators of
$\tilde L$. By this way, local symmetries of $L$ with higher order derivatives
of the local parameters decompose into a sum of the gauge symmetries of $\tilde
L$. It proves the Dirac conjecture in the Lagrangian framework.
