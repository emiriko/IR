Little Higgs scenario provides us a new solution for the hierarchy problem of
the Standard Model. The Littlest Higgs model with T-parity, which is one of
models in the scenario, solves the dark matter problem in our universe. In this
talk, we discuss how accurately the property of the dark matter is determined
at linear collides. We also mention how precisely does the thermal abundance of
the dark matter determined at the 500 GeV and 1 TeV collides, and compare the
results with those at the LHC.
