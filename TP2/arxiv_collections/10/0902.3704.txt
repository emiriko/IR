We investigate the origin of the X-ray emission in low-luminosity AGNs
(LLAGNs). Yuan & Cui (2005) predicted that the X-ray emission should originate
from jets rather than from an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) when
the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ of the source is below a critical value of
$L_{\rm X,crit} \approx 10^{-6}L_{\rm Edd}$. This prediction implies that the
X-ray spectrum in such sources should be fitted by jets rather than ADAFs.
Furthermore, below $L_{\rm X,crit}$ the correlation between radio ($L_{\rm R}$)
and X-ray ($L_{\rm X}$) luminosities and the black hole mass ($M$)--the
so-called fundamental plane of black hole activity--should deviate from the
general correlation obtained by Merloni, Heinz & Di Matteo (2003) and become
steeper. The Merloni et al. correlation is described by ${\rm log}L_{\rm R}
=0.6{\rm log}L_{\rm X}+0.78{\rm log}M+7.33$, while the predicted correlation is
${\rm log}L_{\rm R}=1.23{\rm log}L_{\rm X} +0.25{\rm log}M-13.45$. We collect
data from the literature to check the validity of these two expectations. We
find that among the 16 LLAGNs with good X-ray and radio spectra, 13 are
consistent with the Yuan & Cui prediction. For the 22 LLAGNs with $L_{\rm X} <
L_{\rm X,crit}$, the fundamental plane correlation is described by ${\rm
log}L_{\rm R}=1.22{\rm log}L_{\rm X}+0.23{\rm log}M-12.46 $, also in excellent
agreement with the prediction.
