In order to profit from the high granularity of the calorimeters proposed for
the ILC that are suitable for the Particle Flow Approach, specialised
clustering algorithms have to be developped. GARLIC is such an algorithm with
the goal to find and identify pointing photons in the electromagnetic
calorimeter. This would help to improve the energy resolution on the photon
contribution in jets.
