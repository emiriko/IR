We demonstrate the use of a multidimensional extension of the latent Markov
model to analyse data from studies with correlated binary responses in
developmental psychology. In particular, we consider an experiment based on a
battery of tests which was administered to pre-school children, at three time
periods, in order to measure their inhibitory control and attentional
flexibility abilities. Our model represents these abilities by two latent
traits which are associated to each state of a latent Markov chain. The
conditional distribution of the tests outcomes given the latent process depends
on these abilities through a multidimensional two-parameter logistic
parameterisation. We outline an EM algorithm to conduct likelihood inference on
the model parameters; we also focus on likelihood ratio testing of hypotheses
on the dimensionality of the model and on the transition matrices of the latent
process. Through the approach based on the proposed model, we find evidence
that supports that inhibitory control and attentional flexibility can be
conceptualised as distinct constructs. Furthermore, we outline developmental
aspects of participants' performance on these abilities based on inspection of
the estimated transition matrices.
