Reaction cross-sections are calculated using the Coulomb modified Glauber
model for deformed target nuclei. The deformed nuclear matter density of the
target is expanded into multipoles of order k = 0,2,4.The reaction
cross-sections between some spherical and deformed nuclei are studied at energy
range (10-1000 MeV/nucleon). The most significant effects in the intermediate
energy range are the Coulomb field and in-medium effect that modified the
trajectory of the incident beams. Introducing the deformation effect beside the
Coulomb field and in-medium effect improves the agreement with the experimental
data and two empirical parameterizations in the case of not finding
experimental data. Moreover it is indicated that the enhancement of the
reaction cross-sections is attributed with fixed orientation in deformed
nuclei.
