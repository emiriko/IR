Formation of stationary 3D wave patterns generated by a small point-like
impurity moving through a Bose-Einstein condensate with supersonic velocity is
studied. Asymptotic formulae for a stationary far-field density distribution
are obtained. Comparison with three-dimensional numerical simulations
demonstrates that these formulae are accurate enough already at distances from
the obstacle equal to a few wavelengths.
