We derive functional equations for the eigenvalues of the XXZ model subject
to anti-diagonal twisted boundary conditions by means of fusion of transfer
matrices and by Sklyanin's method of separation of variables. Our findings
coincide with those obtained using Baxter's method and are compared to the
recent solution of Galleas. As an application we study the finite size scaling
of the ground state energy of the model in the critical regime.
