We apply Bogoliubov compensation principle to the gauge electro-weak
interaction to demonstrate a spontaneous generation of anomalous three-boson
gauge invariant effective interaction. The non-trivial solution of compensation
equations uniquely defines values of parameters of the theory and the
form-factor of the anomalous interaction. The contribution of this interaction
to running EW coupling $\alpha_{ew}(p^2)$ gives its observable value
$\alpha_{ew}(M_W^2)=0.0374$ in satisfactory agreement to the experiment. The
anomalous three-boson interaction gives natural explanation of the well-known
discrepancy in muon $g-2$. The implications for EW studies at Tevatron and LHC
are briefly discussed.
