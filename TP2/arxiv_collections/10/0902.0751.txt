Biomarker discovery and gene ranking is a standard task in genomic high
throughput analysis. Typically, the ordering of markers is based on a
stabilized variant of the t-score, such as the moderated t or the SAM
statistic. However, these procedures ignore gene-gene correlations, which may
have a profound impact on the gene orderings and on the power of the subsequent
tests.
  We propose a simple procedure that adjusts gene-wise t-statistics to take
account of correlations among genes. The resulting correlation-adjusted
t-scores ("cat" scores) are derived from a predictive perspective, i.e. as a
score for variable selection to discriminate group membership in two-class
linear discriminant analysis. In the absence of correlation the cat score
reduces to the standard t-score. Moreover, using the cat score it is
straightforward to evaluate groups of features (i.e. gene sets). For
computation of the cat score from small sample data we propose a shrinkage
procedure. In a comparative study comprising six different synthetic and
empirical correlation structures we show that the cat score improves estimation
of gene orderings and leads to higher power for fixed true discovery rate, and
vice versa. Finally, we also illustrate the cat score by analyzing metabolomic
data.
  The shrinkage cat score is implemented in the R package "st" available from
