Monte Carlo event simulation with BFKL evolution is discussed. We report
current status of a Monte Carlo event generator ULYSSES with BFKL evolution
implemented. The ULYSSES, based on Pythia Monte Carlo generator, would help to
reveal BFKL effects at LHC energies. In particular, such an observable as dijet
K-factor can serve as a source of BFKL dynamics at the LHC, and it would also
help to search for new physics.
