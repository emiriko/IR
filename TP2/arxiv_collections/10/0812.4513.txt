We present a way of numerical gap estimation applicable for one-dimensional
infinite uniform quantum systems. Using the density matrix renormalization
group method for a non-uniform Hamiltonian, which has deformed interaction
strength of $j$-th bond proportional to $\cosh \lambda j$, the uniform
Hamiltonian is analyzed as a limit of $\lambda \to 0$. As a consequence of the
deformation, an excited quasi-particle is weakly bounded around the center of
the system, and kept away from the system boundary. Therefore, insensitivity of
an estimated excitation gap of the deformed system to the boundary allows us to
have the bulk excitation gap $\Delta(\lambda)$, and shift in $\Delta(\lambda)$
from $\Delta(0)$ is nearly linear in $\lambda$ when $\lambda \ll 1$. Efficiency
of this estimation is demonstrated through application to the S=1
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. Combining the above estimation and another
one obtained from the technique of convergence acceleration for finite-size
gaps estimated by numerical diagonalizations, we conclude that the Haldane gap
is in $[0.41047905,~0.41047931]$.
