The column density distribution of trapped OH$^-$ ions in a 22-pole ion trap
is measured for different trap parameters. The density is obtained from
position-dependent photodetachment rate measurements. Overall, agreement is
found with the effective potential of an ideal 22-pole. However, in addition we
observe 10 distinct minima in the trapping potential, which indicate a breaking
of the 22-fold symmetry. Numerical simulations show that a displacement of a
subset of the radiofrequency electrodes can serve as an explanation for this
symmetry breaking.
