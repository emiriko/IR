We calculate the cross section of the lightest Higgs boson pair production at
the Photon Linear Collider in the two Higgs doublet model. We focus on the
scenario in which the lightest Higgs boson has the standard model like
couplings to gauge bosons. We take into account the one-loop correction to the
$hhh$ coupling as well as additional one-loop diagrams due to charged bosons to
the $\gamma\gamma \to hh$ helicity amplitudes. We discuss the impact of these
corrections on the $hhh$ coupling measurement at the Photon Linear Collider.
