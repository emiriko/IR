We study the dipolar magnetic field configuration and present solutions of
Maxwell equations in the internal background spacetime of a a slowly rotating
gravastar. The shell of gravastar where magnetic field penetrated is modeled as
sphere consisting of perfect highly magnetized fluid with infinite
conductivity. Dipolar magnetic field of the gravastar is produced by a circular
current loop symmetrically placed at radius $a$ at the equatorial plane.
