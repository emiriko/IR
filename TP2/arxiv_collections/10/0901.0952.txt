In the many-worlds interpretations (MWIs) of Everett and others, if I am the
observer, there are several versions of me but no version is singled out as the
one corresponding to my perceptions. However, it can be shown that the
probability law implies one version must be singled out. Thus MWIs do not
provide a sufficient basis for probability. If we are to have an acceptable
description of the physical universe, MWIs must be supplemented by some
mechanism, such as hidden variables or collapse, that singles out one version
of the observer as the perceiving version.
