In this paper, we show the inclusion and the density of the Schwartz space in
Besov-Dunkl spaces and we prove an interpolation formula for these spaces by
the real method. We give another characterization for these spaces by
convolution. Finally, we establish further results concerning integrability of
the Dunkl transform of function in a suitable Besov-Dunkl space.
