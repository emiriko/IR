We study the LHC signal of a light gluino whose cascade decay is dominated by
channels involving top, and, sometimes, bottom quarks. This is a generic
signature for a number of supersymmetry breaking scenarios considered recently,
where the squarks are heavier than gauginos. Third generation final states
generically dominate since third generation squarks are typically somewhat
lighter in these models. At the LHC we demonstrate that early discovery is
possible due to the existence of multi-lepton multi-bottom final states which
have fairly low Standard Model background. We find that the best discovery
channel is 'same sign dilepton'. The relative decay branching ratios into tt,
tb and bb states carry important information about the underlying model.
Although reconstruction will yield evidence for the existence of top quarks in
the event, we demonstrate that identifying multiple top quarks suffers from low
efficiency and large combinatorial background, due to the large number of final
state particles. We propose a fitting method which takes advantage of excesses
in a large number of channels. We demonstrate such a method will allow us to
extract information about decay branching ratios with moderate integrated
luminosities. In addition, the method also gives an upper bound on the gluino
production cross section and an estimate of the gluino mass.
