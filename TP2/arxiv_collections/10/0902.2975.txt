We present a convenient notation for positive/negative-conditional equations.
The idea is to merge rules specifying the same function by using case-, if-,
match-, and let-expressions. Based on the presented macro-rule-construct,
positive/negative-conditional equational specifications can be written on a
higher level. A rewrite system translates the macro-rule-constructs into
positive/negative-conditional equations.
