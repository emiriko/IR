Using a macroscopic analysis, we show that time-dependent noncollinear spin
transport possesses a wavelike character. This leads to modifications of pure
spin-diffusion dynamics and allows one to extract a finite spin-signal
propagation velocity. We numerically study the dynamics of a pure spin current
pumped into a nonmagnetic layer for precession frequencies ranging from GHz to
THz.
