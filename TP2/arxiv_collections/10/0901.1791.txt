We discuss stochastic resonance-like effects in the context of coupled
quantum spin systems. We focus here on an information-theoretic approach and
analyze the steady state quantum correlations (entanglement) as well as the
global correlations in the system when subject to different forms of local
decoherence. In the presence of decay, it has been shown that the system
displays quantum correlations only when the noise strength is above a certain
threshold. We extend this result to the case of a Heisenberg XYZ exchange
interaction and revise and clarify the mechanisms underlying this behaviour. In
the presence of pure dephasing, we show that the system always remains
separable in the steady state. When both types of noise are present, we show
that the system can still exhibit entanglement for long times, provided that
the pure dephasing rate is not too large.
