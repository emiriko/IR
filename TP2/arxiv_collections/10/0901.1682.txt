In this thesis we study continuous variable systems, focusing on
optomechanical devices where a laser field interacts with a macroscopic
mechanical oscillator through radiation pressure. We consider the optimization
problem of quantum teleportation by means of Gaussian local operations and we
study the relation between the amount of entanglement shared by Alice and Bob
and the maximum fidelity they can reach for the teleportation of coherent
states. We also theoretically predict the possibility of creating a robust
entaglement between a mechanical mode of a Fabry-Perot mirror and the Stokes
sidband of the output field. We show that by driving two different optical
modes supported by the cavity, a stable steady state is reachable in which the
optomechanical entanglement is significantly improved.
