The nature of five-quadrant magnetic isotherms for is different from that for
in a single crystal of YNi2B2C, pointing towards an anisotropic behaviour of
the flux line lattice (FLL). For, a well defined peak effect (PE) and second
magnetization peak (SMP) can be observed and the loop is open prior to the PE.
However, for, the loop is closed and one can observe only the PE. We have
investigated the history dependence of magnetization hysteresis data for by
recording minor hysteresis loops. The observed history dependence in across
different anomalous regions are rationalized on the basis of
su-perheating/supercooling of the vortex matter across the first-order-like
phase transition and possible additional effects due to annealing of the
disordered vortex bundles to the underlying equilibrium state.
