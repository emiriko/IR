Binary collisions between charged particles in an external magnetic field are
considered in second-order perturbation theory, starting from the unperturbed
helical motion of the particles. The calculations are done with the help of an
improved binary collisions treatment which is valid for any strength of the
magnetic field, where the second-order energy and velocity transfers are
represented in Fourier space for arbitrary interaction potentials. The energy
transfer is explicitly calculated for a regularized and screened potential
which is both of finite range and non-singular at the origin, and which
involves as limiting cases the Debye (i.e., screened) and Coulomb potential.
Two distinct cases are considered in detail. (i) The collision of two identical
(e.g., electron-electron) particles; (ii) and the collision between a
magnetized electron and an uniformly moving heavy ion. The energy transfer
involves all harmonics of the electron cyclotron motion. The validity of the
perturbation treatment is evaluated by comparing with classical trajectory
Monte--Carlo calculations which also allows to investigate the strong
collisions with large energy and velocity transfer at low velocities. For large
initial velocities on the other hand, only small velocity transfers occur.
There the non-perturbative numerical classical trajectory Monte--Carlo results
agree excellently with the predictions of the perturbative treatment.
