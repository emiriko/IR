We show how to provide suitable gauge invariant prescriptions for the
classical spatial averages (resp. quantum expectation values) that are needed
in the evaluation of classical (resp. quantum) backreaction effects. We also
present examples illustrating how the use of gauge invariant prescriptions can
avoid interpretation problems and prevent misleading conclusions.
