In this paper, we compare the waveforms from the post-Newtonian (PN) approach
with the numerical simulations of generic black-hole binaries which have mass
ratio $q\sim0.8$, arbitrarily oriented spins with magnitudes $S_1/m_1^2\sim0.6$
and $S_2/m_2^2\sim0.4$, and orbit 9 times from an initial orbital separation of
$r\approx11M$ prior to merger. We observe a reasonably good agreement between
the PN and numerical waveforms, with an overlap of over 98% for the first six
cycles of the $(\ell=2,m=\pm2)$ mode and over 90% for the $(\ell=2,m=1)$ and
$(\ell=3,m=3)$ modes.
