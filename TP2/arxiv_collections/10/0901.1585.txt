The pentagram map is a projectively natural iteration defined on polygons,
and also on a generalized notion of a polygon which we call {\it twisted
polygons}. In this note we describe our recent work on the pentagram map, in
which we find a Poisson structure on the space of twisted polygons and show
that the pentagram map relative to this Poisson structure is completely
integrable in the sense of Arnold-Liouville. For certain families of twisted
polygons, such as those we call {\it universally convex}, we translate the
integrability into a statement about the quasi-periodic notion of the
pentagram-map orbits. We also explain how the continuous limit of the Pentagram
map is the classical Boissinesq equation, a completely integrable PDE.
