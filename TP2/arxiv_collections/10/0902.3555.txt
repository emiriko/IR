We investigate the relation between an applied potential and the
corresponding stationary state occupation for nonequilibrium and overdamped
diffusion processes. This relation typically becomes long ranged resulting in
global changes for the relative density when the potential is locally
perturbed, and inversely, we find that the potential needs to be wholly
rearranged for the purpose of creating a locally changed density. The direct
question, determining the density as a function of the potential, comes under
the response theory out of equilibrium. The inverse problem of determining the
potential that produces a given stationary distribution naturally arises in the
study of dynamical fluctuations. This link to the fluctuation theory results in
a variational characterization of the stationary density upon a given potential
and vice versa.
