We present analytic expressions describing generation of the entanglement in
collisions of initially uncorrelated quantum solitons. The results, obtained by
means of the Born's approximation (for fast solitons), are valid for both
integrable and non-integrable quasi-one-dimensional systems supporting soliton
states.
