A model where chiral boson is coupled to a background dilaton field is
considered to study the s-wave scattering of fermion by a back ground dilaton
black hole. It is found that the scattering process of chiral fermion does not
violate unitarity and information remains preserved. Faddevian anomaly plays a
crucial role on the information scenario.
