We consider a sequence of positive smooth critical points of the
Adams-Moser-Trudinger embedding of $H^m_0$ into Orlicz spaces. We study its
concentration-compactness behavior and show that if the sequence is not
precompact, then the liminf of the $H^m_0$-norms of the functions is greater
than or equal to a positive geometric constant.
