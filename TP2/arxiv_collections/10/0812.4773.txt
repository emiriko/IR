We propose an experiment allowing an observation of Zitterbewegung (ZB,
trembling motion) of electrons in graphene in the presence of a magnetic field.
In contrast to the existing theoretical work we make no assumptions concerning
shape of the electron wave packet. A femtosecond Gaussian laser pulse excites
electrons from the valence $n=-1$ Landau level into three other levels,
creating an oscillating electron wave packet with interband and intraband
frequencies. Oscillations of an average position of the packet are directly
related to the induced dipole moment and oscillations of the average packet's
acceleration determine emitted electric field. Both quantities can be measured
experimentally. A broadening of Landau levels is included to make the
description of ZB as realistic as possible. Criteria of realization of a ZB
experiment are discussed.
