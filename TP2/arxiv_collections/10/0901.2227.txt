The problem of \emph{statistical recognition} is considered, as it arises in
immunobiology, namely, the discrimination of foreign antigens against a
background of the body's own molecules. The precise mechanism of this
foreign-self-distinction, though one of the major tasks of the immune system,
continues to be a fundamental puzzle. Recent progress has been made by van den
Berg, Rand, and Burroughs (2001), who modelled the \emph{probabilistic} nature
of the interaction between the relevant cell types, namely, T-cells and
antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here, the stochasticity is due to the random
sample of antigens present on the surface of every APC, and to the random
receptor type that characterises individual T-cells. It has been shown
previously that this model, though highly idealised, is capable of reproducing
important aspects of the recognition phenomenon, and of explaining them on the
basis of stochastic rare events. These results were obtained with the help of a
refined large deviation theorem and were thus asymptotic in nature. Simulations
have, so far, been restricted to the straightforward simple sampling approach,
which does not allow for sample sizes large enough to address more detailed
questions. Building on the available large deviation results, we develop an
importance sampling technique that allows for a convenient exploration of the
relevant tail events by means of simulation. With its help, we investigate the
mechanism of statistical recognition in some depth. In particular, we
illustrate how a foreign antigen can stand out against the self background if
it is present in sufficiently many copies, although no \emph{a priori}
difference between self and nonself is built into the model.
