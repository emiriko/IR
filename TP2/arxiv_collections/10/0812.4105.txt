In this paper we consider elliptical random vectors X in R^d,d>1 with
stochastic representation A R U where R is a positive random radius independent
of the random vector U which is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere of R^d
and A is a given matrix. The main result of this paper is an asymptotic
expansion of the tail probability of the norm of X derived under the assumption
that R has distribution function is in the Gumbel or the Weibull max-domain of
attraction.
