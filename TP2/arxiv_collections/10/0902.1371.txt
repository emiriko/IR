Elementary excitations of the S=1/2 one-dimensional Heisenberg
antiferromagnet KCuGaF$_6$ with exchange constant $J/k_B$=103 K were
investigated by high-frequency ESR measurements combined with a pulsed high
magnetic field. When an external magnetic field H is applied in KCuGaF$_6$, a
staggered magnetic field h is induced perpendicular to H owing to the staggered
g tensor and the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction with an alternating D
vector. Consequently, KCuGaF$_6$ in a magnetic field is represented by the
quantum sine-Gordon (SG) model. We observed many resonance modes including a
soliton resonance, breathers, interbreather transitions and two-breather
excitation. Their resonance conditions are beautifully described by the quantum
SG field theory with one adjustable parameter $c_ s=h/H$. To investigate the
relationship between the Curie term due to the DM interaction and the
proportional coefficient $c_s$, magnetic susceptibility measurements were also
performed varying the external field direction.
