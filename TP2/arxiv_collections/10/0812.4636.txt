This paper concerns character sheaves of connected reductive algebraic groups
defined over non-Archimedean local fields and their relation with characters of
smooth representations. Although character sheaves were devised with characters
of representations of finite groups of Lie type in mind, character sheaves are
perfectly well defined for reductive algebraic groups over any algebraically
closed field. Nevertheless, the relation between character sheaves of an
algebraic group $G$ over an algebraic closure of a field $K$ and characters of
representations of $G(K)$ is well understood only when $K$ is a finite field
and when $K$ is the field of complex numbers. In this paper we consider the
case when $K$ is a non-Archimedean local field and explain how to match certain
character sheaves of a connected reductive algebraic group $G$ with virtual
representations of $G(K)$. In the final section of the paper we produce
examples of character sheaves of general linear groups and matching admissible
virtual representations.
