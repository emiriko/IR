We present the results of an optical search for supernova remnants (SNRs) in
the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2903. Interference filter images and spectral data
were taken in March 2005 with the f/7.7 1.5 m Russian Turkish Telescope
(RTT150) at TUBITAK National Observatory (TUG). Spectral data were obtained
with the 6 m BTA (Bolshoi Azimuthal Telescope, Russia). We used the SNR
identification criterion that consists of constructing the continuum-subtracted
H$\alpha$ and continuum-subtracted [SII]$\lambda$$\lambda$6716,6731 images and
their ratios. Five SNR candidates were identified in NGC 2903 with
[SII]/H$\alpha$ ratios ranging from 0.41 - 0.74 and H$\alpha$ intensities
ranging from 9.4$\times10^{-15}$ to 1.7$\times10^{-14}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. This work represents the first identification of SNRs by an optical
survey in NGC 2903. We present the spectrum of one of the bright candidates and
derive an [SII]/H$\alpha$ emission line ratio of 0.42 for this source. In
addition, the weak [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ emission line ratio in the
spectrum of this SNR indicates an old oxygen-deficient remnant with a low
propagation velocity.
