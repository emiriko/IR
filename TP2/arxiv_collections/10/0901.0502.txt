The crystal structure determines both the Fermi surface and pairing symmetry
of the superconducting metals. It is demonstrated in the framework of the
general phenomenological approach that this is of the primary importance for
the determination of the structure of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(FFLO) phase in the magnetic field. The FFLO modulation of the superconducting
order parameter may be revealed in the form of the higher Landau level states
or/and modulation along the magnetic field. The transition between different
FFLO states could occur with the temperature variation or with the magnetic
field rotation.
