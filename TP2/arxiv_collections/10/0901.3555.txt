We study the two-band effects on ultracold fermionic atoms in optical
lattices by means of dynamical mean-field theory. We find that at half-filling
the atomic-density-wave (ADW) state emerges owing to the two-band effects in
the attractive interaction region, while the antiferromagnetic state appears in
the repulsive interaction region. As the orbital splitting is increased, the
quantum phase transitions from the ADW state to the superfluid state and from
the antiferromagnetic state to the metallic state occur in respective regions.
Systematically changing the orbital splitting and the interaction, we obtain
the phase diagram at half-filling. The results are discussed using the
effective boson model derived for the strong attractive interaction.
