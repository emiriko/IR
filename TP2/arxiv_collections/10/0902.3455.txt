We present experimental investigations on the non-resonant dot-cavity
coupling of a single quantum dot inside a micro-pillar where the dot has been
resonantly excited in the s-shell, thereby avoiding the generation of
additional charges in the QD and its surrounding. As a direct proof of the pure
single dot-cavity system, strong photon anti-bunching is consistently observed
in the autocorrelation functions of the QD and the mode emission, as well as in
the cross-correlation function between the dot and mode signals. Strong Stokes
and anti-Stokes-like emission is observed for energetic QD-mode detunings of up
to ~100 times the QD linewidth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-resonant
dot-cavity coupling can be utilized to directly monitor and study relevant QD
s-shell properties like fine-structure splittings, emission saturation and
power broadening, as well as photon statistics with negligible background
contributions. Our results open a new perspective on the understanding and
implementation of dot-cavity systems for single-photon sources, single and
multiple quantum dot lasers, semiconductor cavity quantum electrodynamics, and
their implementation, e.g. in quantum information technology.
