I reconsider asymmetrically warped compactifications, in which time and space
have different warp factors. I call such compactifications time warps if the
bulk geometry has neither entropy nor temperature. I provide an example
starting from an asymptotically AdS_5 spacetime where the speed of light,
measured in a fixed coordinate system, is larger near the boundary than it is
deep in the interior. This example follows the general plan of earlier work on
superconducting black holes. To obtain a normalizable, four-dimensional
graviton, one can introduce a Planck brane whose action includes a wrong-sign
Einstein-Hilbert term. The equation of state of the Planck brane has w < -1,
which is a violation of the null energy condition. I show, in an almost
dimension-independent fashion, that such a violation must occur in a static
time warp geometry. Time warps of the type I describe provide an
extra-dimensional description of boost invariance as an emergent symmetry in
the infrared. High-energy violations of Lorentz symmetry, if confined to a
strongly coupled unparticle sector dual to the time warp geometry, might
manifest themselves through unusual kinematic constraints. As an example, I
explain how modifications of unparticle phase space would affect the decay of a
heavy particle into a light visible sector particle plus unparticle stuff.
