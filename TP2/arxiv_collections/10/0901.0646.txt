We report the results of a search for associated production of charginos and
neutralinos using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3
fb-1 collected with the D0 experiment during Run II of the Tevatron
proton-antiproton collider. Final states containing three charged leptons and
missing transverse energy are probed for a signal from supersymmetry with four
dedicated trilepton event selections. No evidence for a signal is observed, and
we set limits on the product of production cross section and leptonic branching
fraction. Within minimal supergravity, these limits translate into bounds on
m_0 and m_1/2 that are well beyond existing limits.
