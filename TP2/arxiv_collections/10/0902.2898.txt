[This cometary occultation observation from June 1983 remained to be formally
reported due to other preoccupations of the authors. It was presented in
seminars to colleagues at Ooty, Bangalore and elsewhere. We now write it up as
we have been asked about it by various colleagues at various times, and feel we
owe it to them to put it firmly on record.] We planned and observed with Ooty
Radio Telescope the occultation with Comet 1983e Sugano-Saigusa-Fujikawa of the
extragalactic radio source 2019+098 = 3C411. The results are presented formally
for the first time, along with a brief account of other cometary occultations
and general background of planning, execution and interpretation of such
observations which will be useful for other future observers. The occultation
occurred at 07:52 IST on 12th June 1983. It amounted to 25% peak to peak
fluctuation in the flux density of the radio source. The rough predicted
occultation time was 07:24 IST. We interpret the results after refining the
occultation time to allow for various effects.
