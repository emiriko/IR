Quantum transport for different models of isomer molecules attached to two
semi-infinite leads is studied on the basis of Green's function technique.
Electronic transport properties are significantly affected by (a) the relative
position of the atoms in these molecules and (b) the molecule-to-lead coupling
strength of these molecular bridge systems.
