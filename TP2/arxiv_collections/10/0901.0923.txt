Dark matter neutralinos in the constrained minimal supersymmetric model
(CMSSM) may account for the recent cosmic ray electron and positron
observations reported by the PAMELA and ATIC experiments either through self
annihilation or via decay. However, to achieve this, both scenarios require new
physics beyond the 'standard' CMSSM, and a unified explanation of the two
experiments suggests a neutralino mass of order 700 GeV - 2 TeV. A relatively
light neutralino with mass around 100 GeV (300 GeV) can accomodate the PAMELA
but not the ATIC observations based on a model of annihilating (decaying)
neutralinos. We study the implications of these scenarios for Higgs and
sparticle spectroscopy in the CMSSM and highlight some benchmark points. An
estimate of neutrino flux expected from the annihilating and decaying
neutralino scenarios is provided.
