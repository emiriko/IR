We present the results of a systematic test applying statistical thermal
model fits in a consistent way for different particle ratios, and different
system sizes using the various particle yields measured in the STAR experiment.
Comparison between central and peripheral Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions with data
from p+p collisions provides an interesting tool to verify the dependence with
the system size. We also present a study of the rapidity dependence of the
thermal fit parameters using available data from RHIC in the forward rapidity
regions and also using different parameterization for the rapidity distribution
of different particles.
