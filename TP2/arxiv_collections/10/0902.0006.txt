A long-range ``dark force'' has recently been proposed to mediate the dark
matter (DM) annihilation. If DM particles are copiously produced at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), the light dark force mediator will also be produced
through radiation. We demonstrate how and how precise we can utilize this fact
to measure the coupling constant of the dark force. The light mediator's mass
is measured from the ``lepton jet'' it decays to. In addition, the mass of the
DM particle is determined using the MT2 technique. Knowing these quantities is
critical for calculating the DM relic density.
