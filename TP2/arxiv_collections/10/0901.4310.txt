Starting with a spectator quark model developed for the nucleon (N) and the
Delta in the physical pion mass region, we extend the predictions of the
reaction gamma N -> Delta to the lattice QCD regime. The quark model includes S
and D waves in the quark-diquark wavefunctions. Within this framework it is the
D-wave part in the Delta wavefunction that generates nonzero valence
contributions for the quadrupole form factors of the transition. Those
contributions are however insufficient to explain the physical data, since the
pion cloud contributions dominate. To separate the two effects we apply the
model to the lattice regime in a region where the pion cloud effects are
negligible, and adjust the D-state parameters directly to the lattice data.
This process allows us to obtain a better determination of the D-state
contributions. Finally, by adding a simple parametrization of the pion cloud we
establish the connection between the experimental data and the lattice data.
