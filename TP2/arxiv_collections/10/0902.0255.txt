Meetings such as ADASS demonstrate that there is an enthusiasm for
communication within the astronomical software community. However, the amount
of information and experience that can flow around in the course of one,
relatively short, meeting is really quite limited. Ideally, these meetings
should be just a part of a much greater, continuous exchange of knowledge. In
practice, with some notable - but often short-lived - exceptions, we generally
fall short of that ideal. Keeping track of what is being used, where, and how
successfully, can be a challenge. A variety of new technologies such as those
roughly classed as 'Web 2.0' are now available, and getting information to flow
ought to be getting simpler, but somehow it seems harder to find the time to
keep that information current. This paper looks at some of the ways we
communicate, used to communicate, have failed to communicate, no longer
communicate, and perhaps could communicate better. It is presented in the hope
of stimulating additional discussion - and possibly even a little action -
aimed at improving the current situation.
