We construct a free field realization of the elliptic quantum algebra
$U_{q,p}(\hat{sl_N})$ for arbitrary level $k \neq 0,-N$. We study Drinfeld
current and the screening current associated with $U_{q,p}(\hat{sl_N})$ for
arbitrary level $k$. In the limit $p \to 0$ this realization becomes
$q$-Wakimoto realization for $U_q(\hat{sl_N})$.
