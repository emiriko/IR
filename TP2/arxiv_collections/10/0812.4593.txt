We theoretically study the effect of spiral-type charge frustration in a
quasi-one-dimensional molecular conductor (DI-DCNQI)2Ag. We clarify how the
spiral frustration in the interchain Coulomb repulsion is relieved and leads to
a self-organization of complex charge-lattice ordered chains, in agreement with
the recent synchrotron X-ray study [T. Kakiuchi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 98,
066402 (2007)]. In addition, we find that a keen competition between charge and
lattice degrees of freedom under the frustration gives rise to a characteristic
temperature within the ordered phase, below which a drastic growth of molecular
displacements occurs. Our results enlighten the relevance of the spiral
frustration and provide a possible reconciliation among puzzling experimental
data.
