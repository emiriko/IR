A wide-field imager in space could make remarkable progress in two very
different frontiers of astronomy: dark energy and extra-solar planets.
Embedding such an imager on a much larger and more complicated DE mission would
be a poor science-approach under any circumstances and is a prescription for
disaster in the present fiscal climate. The 2010 Decadal Committee must not
lead the lemming stampede that is driving toward a DE mega-mission, but should
stand clearly in its path.
