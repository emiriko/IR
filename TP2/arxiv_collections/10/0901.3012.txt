We introduce the notion of an ACP process algebra. The models of the axiom
system ACP are the origin of this notion. ACP process algebras have to do with
processes in which no data are involved. We also introduce the notion of a
meadow enriched ACP process algebra, which is a simple generalization of the
notion of an ACP process algebra to processes in which data are involved. In
meadow enriched ACP process algebras, the mathematical structure for data is a
meadow.
