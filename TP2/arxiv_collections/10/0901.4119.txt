We present VLT intermediate resolution spectroscopy of UY Vol, the optical
counterpart of the LMXB X-ray burster EXO 0748-676. By using Doppler tomography
we detect narrow components within the broad He II 4542 A, 4686 A and 5412 A
emission lines. The phase, velocity and narrowness of these lines are
consistent with their arising from the irradiated hemisphere of the donor star,
as has been observed in a number of LMXBs. Under this assumption we provide the
first dynamical constraints on the stellar masses in this system. In
particular, we measure K_2>K_em = 300 +/- 10 km/s. Using this value we derive 1
M_sun < M_1 < 2.4 M_sun and 0.11 < q < 0.28. We find M_1 > 1.5 M_sun for the
case of a main sequence companion star. Our results are consistent with the
presence of a massive neutron star as has been suggested by Ozel (2006),
although we cannot discard the canonical value of ~1.4 M_sun.
