Within a phenomenological quasiparticle model, the quark mass and temperature
dependence of the QCD equation of state is discussed and compared with lattice
QCD results. Different approximations for the quasiparticle dispersion
relations are employed, scaling properties of the equation of state with quark
mass and deconfinement temperature are investigated and a continuation to
asymptotically large temperatures is presented.
