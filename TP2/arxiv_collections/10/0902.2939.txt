We propose general guidelines in order to incorporate the geometrical
description of gravity in quantum field theory and address the problem of UV
divergences non-perturbatively. In our aproach, each virtual particle in a
Feynman graph should be described by a modified propagator and move in the
space-time generated by the other particles in the same graph according to
Einstein's (semiclassical) equations.
