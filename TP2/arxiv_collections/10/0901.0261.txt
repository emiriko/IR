Few years ago, Cho and Vilenkin have proposed that topological defects can
arise in symmetry breaking models without having degenerate vacua. These types
of defects are known as vacuumless defects. In the present work, the
gravitational field of a vacuumless global string and global monopole have been
investigated in the context of Lyra geometry. We find the metric of the
vacuumless global string and global monopole in the weak field approximations.
It has been shown that the vacuumless global string can have repulsive whereas
global monopole exerts attractive gravitational effects on a test particle. It
is dissimilar to the case studied in general relativity.
