It has been recently shown that the Bethe-Larkin formula for the energy
losses of fast heavy-ion projectiles in dense hydrogen plasmas is corrected by
the electron-ion correlations [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{101}, 075002 (2008)].
We report numerical estimates of this correction based on the values of
$g_{ei}(0)$ obtained by numerical simulations in [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{61},
3470 (2000)]. We also extend this result to the case of projectiles with
dicluster charge distribution. We show that the experimental visibility of the
electron-ion correlation correction is enhanced in the case of dicluster
projectiles with randomly orientated charge centers. Although we consider here
the hydrogen plasmas to make the effect physically more clear, the
generalization to multispecies plasmas is straightforward.
