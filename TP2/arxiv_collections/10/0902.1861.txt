The properties of the two-flavored Gross-Neveu model in the (1+1)-dimensional
spacetime are investigated in the presence of the isospin $\mu_I$ as well as
quark number $\mu$ chemical potentials both at zero and nonzero temperatures.
The consideration is performed in the limit $N_c\to\infty$, i.e. in the case
with an infinite number of colored quarks. In the plane of parameters
$\mu_I,\mu$ a rather rich phase structure is found, which contains phases with
and without pion condensation. Moreover, we have found a great variety of
one-quark excitations of these phases, including gapless and gapped
quasiparticles.
