We present a detailed analysis of all the algebraic conditions an arbitrary
4x4 symmetric matrix must satisfy in order to represent the correlation matrix
of a two-mode bosonic system. Then, we completely clarify when this arbitrary
matrix can represent the correlation matrix of a separable or entangled
Gaussian state. In this analysis, we introduce new and alternative sets of
conditions, which are expressed in terms of local symplectic invariants.
