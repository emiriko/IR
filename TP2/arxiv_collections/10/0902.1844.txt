The nuclear chosmochronometer suggested by Hayakawa et al. [Phys. Rev.C 77,
065802 (2008)] based on the 138La-138Ce-136Ce abundance ratio in presolar
grains would be affected by the existence of a hitherto unknown low-energy 1+
state in 138La. Results of a recent high-resolution study of the 138Ba(3He,t)
reaction under kinematics selectively populating 1+ states in 138La through
Gamow-Teller transitions provides strong evidence against the existence of such
a hypothetical state.
