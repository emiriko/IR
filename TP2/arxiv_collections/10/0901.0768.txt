We investigate the topological structure of the decimal expansions of the
three famous naturally occurring irrational numbers, $\pi$, $e$, and golden
ratio, by explicitly calculating the diversity of the pair distributions of the
ten digits ranging from 0 to 9. And we find that there is a universal two-phase
behavior, which collapses into a single curve with a power law phenomenon. We
further reveal that the two-phase behavior is closely related to general
aspects of phase transitions in physical systems. It is then numerically shown
that such characteristics originate from an intrinsic property of genuine
random distribution of the digits in decimal expansions. Thus, mathematical
irrational numbers are not so physically irrational as long as they have such
an intrinsic property.
