We study fundamental properties of the fractional, one-dimensional Weyl
operator $\hat{\mathcal{P}}^{\alpha}$ densely defined on the Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}=L^2({\mathbb R},dx)$ and determine the asymptotic behaviour of
both the free Green's function and its variation with respect to energy for
bound states. In the sequel we specify the Birman-Schwinger representation for
the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $K_{\alpha}\hat{\mathcal{P}}^{\alpha}-g|\hat{V}|$
and extract the finite-rank portion which is essential for the asymptotic
expansion of the ground state. Finally, we determine necessary and sufficient
conditions for there to be a bound state for small coupling constant $g$.
