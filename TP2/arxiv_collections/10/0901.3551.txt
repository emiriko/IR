We calculate the full transport counting statistics in a three-terminal
tunnel device with one superconducting source and two normal-metal or
ferromagnet drains. We obtain the transport probability distribution from
direct Andreev reflection, crossed Andreev reflection, and electron transfer
which reveals how these processes' statistics are determined by the device
conductances. The cross-correlation noise is a result of competing
contributions from crossed Andreev reflection and electron transfer, as well as
antibunching due to the Pauli exclusion principle. For spin-active tunnel
barriers that spin polarize the electron flow, crossed Andreev reflection and
electron transfer statistics exhibit different dependencies on the
magnetization configuration, and can be controlled by relative magnetization
directions and voltage bias.
