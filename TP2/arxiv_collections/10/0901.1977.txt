In \cite{jpsf} we constructed pairs of units $u,v$ in $\Z$-orders of a
quaternion algebra over $\Q (\sqrt{-d})$, $d \equiv 7 \pmod 8$ positive and
square free, such that $< u^ n,v^n>$ is free for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Here
we extend this result to any imaginary quadratic extension of $\ \mathbb{Q}$,
thus including matrix algebras. More precisely, we show that $< u^n,v^n> $ is a
free group for all $n\geq 1$ and $d>2$ and for $d=2$ and all $n\geq 2$. The
units we use arise from Pell's and Gauss' equations. A criterion for a pair of
homeomorphisms to generate a free semigroup is also established and used to
prove that two certain units generate a free semigroup but that, in this case,
the Ping-Pong Lemma can not be applied to show that the group they generate is
free.
