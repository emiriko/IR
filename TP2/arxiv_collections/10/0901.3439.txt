This article is provides an introduction to the quantum theory of optics in
nonlinear dielectric media. We begin with a short summary of the classical
theory of nonlinear optics, that is nonlinear optics done with classical
fields. We then discuss the canonical formalism for fields and its
quantization. This is applied to quantizing the electromagnetic field in free
space. The definition of a nonclassical state of the electromagnetic field is
presented, and several examples are examined. This is followed by a brief
introduction to entanglement in the context of field modes. The next task is
the quantization of the electromagnetic field in an inhomogeneous, linear
dielectric medium. Before going on to field quantization in nonlinear media, we
discuss a number of commonly employed phenomenological models for quantum
nonlinear optical processes. We then quantize the field in both nondispersive
and dispersive nonlinear media. Flaws in the most commonly used methods of
accomplishing this task are pointed out and discussed. Once the quantization
has been completed, it is used to study a multimode theory of parametric down
conversion and the propagation of quantum solitons.
