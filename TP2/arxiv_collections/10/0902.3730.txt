We present a combination of raising, explicit variable dependency
representation, the liberalized delta-rule, and preservation of solutions for
first-order deductive theorem proving. Our main motivation is to provide the
foundation for our work on inductive theorem proving, where the preservation of
solutions is indispensable.
