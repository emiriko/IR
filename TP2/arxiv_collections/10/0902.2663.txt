We propose a novel protocol for storage and retrieval of photon wave packets
in a $\Lambda$-type atomic medium. This protocol derives from spectral hole
burning and takes advantages of the specific properties of solid state systems
at low temperature, such as rare earth ion doped crystals. The signal pulse is
tuned to the center of the hole that has been burnt previously within the
inhomogeneously broadened absorption band. The group velocity is strongly
reduced, being proportional to the hole width. This way the optically carried
information and energy is carried over to the off-resonance optical dipoles.
Storage and retrieval are performed by conversion to and from ground state
Raman coherence by using brief $\pi$-pulses. The protocol exhibits some
resemblance with the well known electromagnetically induced transparency
process. It also presents distinctive features such as the absence of coupling
beam. In this paper we detail the various steps of the protocol, summarize the
critical parameters and theoretically examine the recovery efficiency.
