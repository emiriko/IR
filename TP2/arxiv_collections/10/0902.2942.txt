Proteins are the "work horses" in biological systems. In almost all functions
specific proteins are involved. They control molecular transport processes,
stabilize the cell structure, enzymatically catalyze chemical reactions; others
act as molecular motors in the complex machinery of molecular synthetization
processes. Due to their significance, misfolds and malfunctions of proteins
typically entail disastrous diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Therefore, the understanding of the trinity of
amino acid composition, geometric structure, and biological function is one of
the most essential challenges for the natural sciences. Here, we glance at
conformational transitions accompanying the structure formation in protein
folding processes.
