We consider unambiguous identification of coherent states of electromagnetic
field. In particular, we study possible generalizations of an optical setup
proposed in M. Sedl\'{a}k {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 76}, 022326 (2007).
We show how the unambiguous identification of coherent states can be performed
in a general case when multiple copies of unknown and the reference states are
available. We also investigate whether reference states after the measurement
can be "recovered" and further used for subsequent unambiguous identification
tasks. We show that in spite of the fact that the recovered reference states
are disturbed by measurements they can be repeatedly used for unambiguous
identifications. We analyze the role of various imperfections in preparation of
the unknown and the reference coherent states on the performance of our
unambiguous identification setup.
