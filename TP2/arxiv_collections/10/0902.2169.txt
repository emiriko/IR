We perform an ab initio shell-model calculation for ^{18}O in a restricted
no-core model space, microscopically deriving a two-body effective interaction
and introducing a minimal refinement of one-body energies in the spsd or spsdpf
model space. Low-lying energy levels, except for the experimental 0_{2}^{+} and
2_{3}^{+} states, are better described in the spsdpf space than in the spsd
space. The structure of low-lying energy levels is discussed with an emphasis
on many-particle many-hole states beyond the four-particle two-hole
configuration.
