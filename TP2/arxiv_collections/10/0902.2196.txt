Poker has become a popular pastime all over the world. At any given moment
one can find tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of players playing poker via
their computers on the major on-line gaming sites. Indeed, according to the
Vancouver, B.C. based pokerpulse.com estimates, more than 190 million US
dollars daily is bet in on-line poker rooms. But communication and computation
are changing as the relentless application of Moore's Law brings computation
and information into the quantum realm. The quantum theory of games concerns
the behavior of classical games when played in the coming quantum computing
environment or when played with quantum information. In almost all cases, the
"quantized" versions of these games afford many new strategic options to the
players.
  The study of so-called quantum games is quite new, arising from a seminal
paper of D. Meyer \cite{Meyer} published in Physics Review Letters in 1999. The
ensuing near decade has seen an explosion of contributions and controversy over
what exactly a quantized game really is and if there is indeed anything new for
game theory. With the settling of some of these controversies \cite{Bleiler},
it is now possible to fully analyze some of the basic endgame models from the
game theory of Poker and predict with confidence just how the optimal play of
Poker will change when played in the coming quantum computation environment.
The analysis here shows that for certain players, "entangled" poker will allow
results that outperform those available to players "in real life".
