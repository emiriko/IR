We develop a model for the reflection and transmission of plane waves by an
isotropic layer sandwiched between two uniaxial crystals of arbitrary
orientation. In the laboratory frame, reflection and transmission coefficients
corresponding to the principal polarization directions in each crystal are
given explicitly in terms of the c-axis and propagation directions. The
solution is found by first deriving explicit expressions for reflection and
transmission amplitude coefficients for waves propagating from an arbitrarily
oriented uniaxial anisotropic material into an isotropic material. By combining
these results with Lekner's (1991) earlier treatment of waves propagating from
isotropic media to anisotropic media and employing a matrix method we determine
a solution to the general form of the multiple reflection case. The example
system of a wetted interface between two ice crystals is used to contextualize
the results.
