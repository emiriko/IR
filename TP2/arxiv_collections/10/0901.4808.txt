We explain the spin segregation seen at Duke in a two-component gas of 6Li
[Du, Luo, Clancy and Thomas, Phys. Rev. Lett. 101,150401 (2008)] as a
mean-field effect describable via a collisionless Boltzmann equation. As seen
in experiments, we find that slight differences in the trapping potentials in
the two spin states drive small spin currents. Hartree-Fock type interactions
convert these currents into a redistribution of populations in energy space,
and consequently a long lived spin texture develops. We explore the interaction
strength dependence of these dynamics, finding close agreement with experiment.
