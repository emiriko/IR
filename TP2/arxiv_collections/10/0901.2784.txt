We consider quantum teleportation when the given entanglement channel is an
arbitrary multiparticle state. A general criterion is presented, which allows
one to judge if the channel can be used to teleport faithfully an arbitrary
quantum state of a given dimension. The general protocol proposed here is much
easier to implement experimentally than the others found in the literature.
