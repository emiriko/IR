The ferromagnetic nano-structures are recently of great interest for modern
investigations. A comparison of the experimental data and theoretical results
shows that the use of the standard molecular field approximation is
insufficient for the description of nano-structure properties. Therefore, we
use the effective field approach in order to show the usefulness of the Valenta
model generalized in this way. The agreement between experiment and theory is
then excellent. The magnetization profiles and the calculated Curie
temperatures are presented for the systems consisting of Ni and Co layers with
different configuration of the surfaces and interfaces including terraces and
wires. We have shown that the position in the system as well as the kind of
neighbouring layers and their mutual interactions can determine the shape of
magnetization profiles. The use of the Valenta model allows us to present all
dependences in the layer resolved mode.
