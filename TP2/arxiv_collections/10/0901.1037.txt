We evaluate exactly the statistical integral for an inhomogeneous
one-dimensional counterion-only Coulomb gas between two charged boundaries and
from this compute the effective interaction, or disjoining pressure, between
the bounding surfaces. Our exact results are compared with the limiting cases
of weak and strong coupling which are the same for 1D and 3D systems. For
systems with a large number of counterions it is found that the weak coupling
(mean-field) approximation for the disjoining pressure works perfectly and that
fluctuations around the mean-field in 1D are much smaller than in 3D. In the
case of few counterions it works less well and strong coupling approximation
performs much better as it takes into account properly the discreteness of the
counterion charges.
