In this paper we propose the CTS (Concious Tutoring System) technology, a
biologically plausible cognitive agent based on human brain functions.This
agent is capable of learning and remembering events and any related information
such as corresponding procedures, stimuli and their emotional valences. Our
proposed episodic memory and episodic learning mechanism are closer to the
current multiple-trace theory in neuroscience, because they are inspired by it
[5] contrary to other mechanisms that are incorporated in cognitive agents.
This is because in our model emotions play a role in the encoding and
remembering of events. This allows the agent to improve its behavior by
remembering previously selected behaviors which are influenced by its emotional
mechanism. Moreover, the architecture incorporates a realistic memory
consolidation process based on a data mining algorithm.
