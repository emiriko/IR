We develop an general formalism of single enzyme kinetics in two dimension
where substrates diffuse stochastically on a square lattice in presence of
disorder. The dynamics of the model could be decoupled effectively to two
stochastic processes, (a) the substrate arrives at the enzyme site in intervals
which fluctuates in time and (b) the enzymatic reaction takes place at that
site stochastically.
  We argue that distribution of arrival time is a two parameter function
specified by the substrate and the disorder densities, and that it correctly
reproduce the distribution of turnover time obtained from Monte-Carlo
simulations of single enzyme kinetics in two dimension, both in absence and
presence of disorder. The decoupled dynamics model is simple to implement and
generic enough to describe both normal and anomalous diffusion of substrates.
It also suggests that the diffusion of substrates in the single enzyme systems
could explain the different distributions of turnover time observed in recent
experiments.
