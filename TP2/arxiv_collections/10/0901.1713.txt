These lectures, given at the Cargese Summer school in 2008, provide an
introduction to dynamical supersymmetry breaking and gauge mediation, with
emphasis on the recent appreciation of the possible role of metastable
supersymmetry breaking, and the evolving understanding of General Gauge
Mediation. The underlying focus is on how supersymmetry might be realized at
the Large Hadron Collider.
