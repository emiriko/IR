We study biharmonic hypersurfaces in a generic Riemannian manifold. We first
derive an invariant equation for such hypersurfaces generalizing the biharmonic
hypersurface equation in space forms studied in \cite{Ji2}, \cite{CH},
\cite{CMO1}, \cite{CMO2}. We then apply the equation to show that the
generalized
  Chen's conjecture is true for totally umbilical biharmonic hypersurfaces in
an Einstein space, and construct a (2-parameter) family of conformally flat
metrics and a (4-parameter) family of multiply warped product metrics each of
which turns the foliation of an upper-half space of $\mathhbb{R}^m$ by parallel
hyperplanes into a foliation with each leave a proper biharmonic hypersurface.
We also characterize proper biharmonic vertical cylinders in $S^2\times
\mathbb{R}$ and $H^2\times \mathbb{R}$.
