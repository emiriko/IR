The South Pole is an optimal location for hosting astrophysical
observatories. The status of the construction of the IceCube Observatory and
some selected physics results will be discussed. Moreover prospects for
detection of Ultra-High Energy cosmogenic neutrinos and techniques that can
address this energy region will be considered.
