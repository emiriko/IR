Mass parameters for the relative and neck motions in fusion reactions of
symmetric systems $^{90}$Zr+$^{90}$Zr, $^{110}$Pd+$^{110}$Pd, and
$^{138}$Ba+$^{138}$Ba are studied by means of a microscopic transport model.
The shape of the nuclear system is determined by an equi-density surface
obtained from the density distribution of the system. The relative and neck
motions are then studied and the mass parameters for these two motions are
deduced. The mass parameter for the relative motion is around the reduced mass
when the reaction partners are at the separated configuration and increases
with decrease of the distance between two reaction partners after the touching
configuration. The mass parameter for the neck motion first decreases slightly
up to the touching configuration and then increases with the neck width, and
its magnitude is from less than tenth to several times more than the total mass
of the system. The mass parameters obtained from the microscopic transport
model are larger than the ones obtained from the hydrodynamic model and smaller
than those obtained from the linear response function theory. The mass
parameters for both motions depend on the reaction systems, but the one for the
relative motion depends on the incompressibility of the EoS more obviously than
that for neck motion.
