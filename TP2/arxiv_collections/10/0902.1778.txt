We explore the phase diagram of NJL-type models near the chiral critical
point allowing for phases with spatially inhomogeneous chiral condensates. In
the chiral limit it turns out that the region in the mean-field phase diagram
where those phases are energetically preferred very generically reaches out to
the chiral critical point. The preferred inhomogeneous ground state in this
vicinity possibly resembles a lattice of domain wall solitons. This raises the
question of their relevance for the phase diagram of QCD.
