We investigate the superconducting order parameter, the spectral and optical
properties in a stripe model with spin (charge) domain-derived scattering
potential $V_{s}$ ($V_{c}$). We show that the charge domain-derived scattering
is less effective than the spin scattering on the suppression of
superconductivity. For $V_{s}\gg V_{c}$, the spectral weight concentrates on
the ($\pi,0$) antinodal region, and a finite energy peak appears in the optical
conductivity with the disappearance of the Drude peak. But for $V_{s}\approx
V_{c}$, the spectral weight concentrates on the ($\pi/2,\pi/2$) nodal region,
and a residual Drude peak exists in the optical conductivity without the finite
energy peak. These results consistently account for the divergent observations
in the ARPES and optical conductivity experiments in several high-$T_c$
cuprates, and suggest that the "insulating" and "metallic" properties are
intrinsic to the stripe state, depending on the relative strength of the spin
and charge domain-derived scattering potentials.
