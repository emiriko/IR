We investigate the electronic properties of Ba[Fe(1-x)Co(x)]2As2 (x =0.02,
0.04) in the lightly electron-doped regime by 59Co and 75As NMR. We demonstrate
that Co doping significantly suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature to
the SDW state, T_{SDW}. Furthermore, ordered moments below T_{SDW} exhibit
large distribution. Strong spin fluctuations remain even below T_{SDW},
persisting all the way down to 4.2 K. We find no signature of additional
freezing of spin degrees of freedom unlike the case of the lightly hole-doped
stripe phase of the cuprates.
