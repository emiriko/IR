We obtain a new important basic result on splice-quotient singularities in an
elegant combinatorial-geometric way: every level of the divisorial filtration
of the ring of functions is generated by monomials of the defining coordinate
functions. The elegant way is the language of of line bundles based on Okuma's
description of the function ring of the universal abelian cover. As an easy
application, we obtain a new proof of the End Curve Theorem of Neumann and
Wahl.
