Simulated calorimeter performance in the SiD detector is examined. The
software calibration procedures are described, as well as the perfect pattern
recognition PFA reconstruction. Performance of the SiD calorimeters is
summarized with jet energy resolutions from calorimetry only, perfect pattern
recognition and the SiD PFA algorithm. Presented at LCWS08[1].
