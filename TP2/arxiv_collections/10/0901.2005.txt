We consider a two-dimensional conformal field theory which contains two kinds
of the bosonic degrees of freedom. Two linear dilaton fields enable us to study
a more general case. Various properties of the model such as OPEs, central
charge, conformal properties of the fields and associated algebras will be
studied.
