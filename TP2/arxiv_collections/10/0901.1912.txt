We report several recent updates from the BABAR Collaboration on the matrix
elements $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{ub}|$, and $|V_{td}|$ of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix, and the angles $\beta$ and
$\alpha$ of the unitarity triangle. Most results presented here are using the
full BABAR $\Upsilon(4S)$ data set.
