The phenomenon of coherence resonance (CR) is investigated in an unijunction
transistor relaxation oscillator (UJT-RO) and quantified by estimating the
normal variance (NV). Depending upon the measuring points two types of NV
curves have been obtained. We have observed that the degradations in coherency
at higher noise amplitudes in our system is probably the result of direct
interference of coherent oscillations and the stochastic perturbation.
Degradation of coherency may be minimal if this direct interference of noise
and coherent oscillations is eliminated.
