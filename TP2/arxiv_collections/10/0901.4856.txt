We report the frequency stabilization of an erbium-doped fiber
distributed-feedback laser using an all-fiber based Michelson interferometer of
large arm imbalance. The interferometer uses a 1 km SMF-28 optical fiber spool
and an acousto optic modulator allowing heterodyne detection. The frequency
noise power spectral density is reduced by more than 40 dB for Fourier
frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 10 kHz, corresponding to a level well below 1
Hz^2/Hz over the whole range. It reaches 10^{-2} Hz^2/Hz at 1 kHz. Between 40
Hz and 30 kHz, the frequency noise is shown to be comparable to the one
obtained by Pound-Drever-Hall locking to a high finesse Fabry-Perot cavity.
Locking to a fiber delay line could consequently represent a reliable, simple
and compact alternative to cavity stabilization for short term linewidth
reduction.
