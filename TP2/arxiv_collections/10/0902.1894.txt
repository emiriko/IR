A new classical, non singular solution with arbitrarily low energy is found
for SU(2) non abelian fields in the presence of a static charge. Physically it
means that a classical charge coupled to any SU(N) non abelian gauge field will
develop a pure gauge field, carrying no energy, that will completely screen it
- there are no visible classical non abelian charges.
