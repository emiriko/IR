Over the last years several experimental and theoretical studies of diffusion
kinetics on the nanoscale have shown that the time evolution differs from the
classical Fickian law (kc=0.5). However, all work was based on crystalline
samples or models, so far. In this letter, we report on the diffusion kinetics
of a thin amorphous-Si layer into amorphous-Ge to account for the rising
importance of amorphous materials in nanodevices. Employing surface sensitive
technics, the initial kc was found at 0.7+-0.1. Moreover, after some monolayers
of Si dissolved into the Ge, kc changes to the generally expected classical
Fickian law with kc=0.5.
