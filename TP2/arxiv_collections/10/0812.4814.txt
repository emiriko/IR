Nominalistic Logic (NL) is a new presentation of Paul Gilmore's Intensional
Type Theory (ITT) as a sequent calculus together with a succinct nominalization
axiom (N) that permits names of predicates as individuals in certain cases. The
logic has a flexible comprehension axiom, but no extensionality axiom and no
infinity axiom, although axiom N is the key to the derivation of Peano's
postulates for the natural numbers.
