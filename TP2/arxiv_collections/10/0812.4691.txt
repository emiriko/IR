We present a mesh refinement algorithm for detecting singularities of
time-dependent partial differential equations. The main idea behind the
algorithm is to treat the occurrence of singularities of time-dependent partial
differential equations as phase transitions. We show how the mesh refinement
algorithm can be used to calculate the blow-up rate as we approach the
singularity. This calculation can be done in three different ways: i) the
direct approach where one monitors the blowing-up quantity as it approaches the
singularity and uses the data to calculate the blow-up rate ; ii) the "phase
transition" approach (\`a la Wilson) where one treats the singularity as a
fixed point of the renormalization flow equation and proceeds to compute the
blow-up rate via an analysis in the vicinity of the fixed point and iii) the
"scaling" approach (\`a la Widom-Kadanoff) where one postulates the existence
of scaling laws for different quantities close to the singularity, computes the
associated exponents and then uses them to estimate the blow-up rate. Our
algorithm allows a unified presentation of these three approaches. The inviscid
Burgers equation and the supercritical Schrodinger equation are used as
instructive examples to illustrate the constructions.
