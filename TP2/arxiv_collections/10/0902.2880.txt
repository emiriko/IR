Observational evidence is presented for periodically variable irradiation of
secondary components. This results in strongly modulated mass outflow.
Superhumps are then due to enhanced dissipation of the kinetic energy of the
stream. Qualitative interpretation of superhump periods and their variations is
also presented.
