We examine bipartite and multipartite correlations within the construct of
unitary orbits. We show that the set of product states is a very small subset
of set of all possible states, while all unitary orbits contain classically
correlated states. Using this we give meaning to degeneration of quantum
correlations due to a unitary interactions, which we call coherent
correlations. The remaining classical correlations are called incoherent
correlations and quantified in terms of the distance of the joint probability
distributions to its marginals. Finally, we look at how entanglement looks in
this picture for the two-qubit case.
