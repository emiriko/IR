We propose a position detection scheme for a nanoelectromechanical resonator
based on the ratchet effect. This scheme has an advantage of being a dc
measurement. We consider a three-junction SQUID where a part of the
superconducting loop can perform mechanical motion. The response of the ratchet
to a dc current is sensitive to the position of the resonator and the effect
can be further enhanced by biasing the SQUID with an ac current. We discuss the
feasibility of the proposed scheme in existing experimental setups.
