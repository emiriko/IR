Atoms from an otherwise unconfined 87Rb condensate are shown to be suspended
against gravity using repeated reflections from a pulsed optical standing wave.
Reflection efficiency was optimized using a triple-pulse sequence that,
theoretically, provides accuracies better than 99.9%. Experimentally, up to 100
reflections are observed, leading to dynamical suspension for over 100 ms. The
velocity sensitivity of the reflections can be used to determine the local
gravitational acceleration. Further, a gravitationally sensitive atom
interferometer was implemented using the suspended atoms, with packet coherence
maintained for a similar time. These techniques could be useful for the precise
measurement of gravity when it is impractical to allow atoms to fall freely
over a large distance.
