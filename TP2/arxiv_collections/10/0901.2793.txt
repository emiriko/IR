We report experimental evidence and correction of defocus in full-field OCT
of biological samples due to mismatch of the refractive index of biological
tissues and water. Via a metric based on the image quality, we demonstrate that
we are able to compensate this index-induced defocus and to recover a sharp
image in depth.
