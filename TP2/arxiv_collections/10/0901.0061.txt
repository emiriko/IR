Electron spin relaxation in paramagnetic Ga(Mn)As quantum wells is studied
via the fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach where all the
scatterings, such as the electron-impurity, electron-phonon, electron-electron
Coulomb, electron-hole Coulomb, electron-hole exchange (the Bir-Aronov-Pikus
mechanism) and the $s$-$d$ exchange scatterings, are explicitly included. The
Elliot-Yafet mechanism is also incorporated. From this approach, we study the
spin relaxation in both $n$-type and $p$-type Ga(Mn)As quantum wells. For
$n$-type Ga(Mn)As quantum wells where most Mn ions take the interstitial
positions, we find that the spin relaxation is always dominated by the DP
mechanism in metallic region. Interestingly, the Mn concentration dependence of
the spin relaxation time is nonmonotonic and exhibits a peak. This behavior is
because that the momentum scattering and the inhomogeneous broadening have
different density dependences in the non-degenerate and degenerate regimes. For
$p$-type Ga(Mn)As quantum wells, we find that Mn concentration dependence of
the spin relaxation time is also nonmonotonic and shows a peak. Differently,
this behavior is because that the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering (or the
Bir-Aronov-Pikus) mechanism dominates the spin relaxation in the high Mn
concentration regime at low (or high) temperature, whereas the DP mechanism
determines the spin relaxation in the low Mn concentration regime. The
Elliot-Yafet mechanism also contributes the spin relaxation at intermediate
temperature. The spin relaxation time due to the DP mechanism increases with Mn
concentration due to motional narrowing, whereas those due to the spin-flip
mechanisms decrease with Mn concentration, which thus leads to the formation of
the peak.... (The remaining is omitted due to the space limit)
