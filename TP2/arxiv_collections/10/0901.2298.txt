In this paper we analyze some aspects of the "relativistic glider" proposed
by Gu\'eron and Mosna more in detail. In particular an explicit weak gravity
and low velocity expansion is presented, the influence of different initial
conditions are studied and the behavior of the glider over a longer integration
time is presented. Our results confirm that the system can be used as a glider,
but is not able to stop or even revert the fall of an object.
