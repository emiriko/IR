The density matrix of a qudit may be reconstructed with optimal efficiency if
the expectation values of a specific set of observables are known. In dimension
six, the required observables only exist if it is possible to identify six
mutually unbiased complex 6x6 Hadamard matrices. Prescribing a first Hadamard
matrix, we construct all others mutually unbiased to it, using algebraic
computations performed by a computer program. We repeat this calculation many
times, sampling all known complex Hadamard matrices, and we never find more
than two that are mutually unbiased. This result adds considerable support to
the conjecture that no seven mutually unbiased bases exist in dimension six.
