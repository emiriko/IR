We study the Higgs boson decays and production via gluon fusion at the LHC as
a probe of two typical littlest Higgs models which introduce a top quark
partner with different (even and odd) T-parity to cancel the Higgs mass
quadratic divergence contributed by the top quark. For each model we consider
two different choices for the down-type quark Yukawa couplings. We first
examine the branching ratios of the Higgs boson decays and then study the
production via gluon fusion followed by the decay into two photons or two weak
gauge bosons. We find that the predictions can be quite different for different
models or different choices of down-type quark Yukawa couplings and all these
predictions can sizably deviate from the SM predictions. So the Higgs boson
processes at the LHC can be a sensitive probe for these littlest Higgs models.
