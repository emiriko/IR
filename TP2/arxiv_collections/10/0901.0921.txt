We present in these proceedings some preliminary results we have obtained
studying the evolution of the specific star formation rate as a function of
surface mass density and Sersic indices at z<0.7. These results are based on
the consistent comparison of the properties of ~ 650 massive zCOSMOS galaxies
in a mass-complete sample at 0.5<z<0.7 with a mass-complete sample of ~ 21500
SDSS local galaxies.
