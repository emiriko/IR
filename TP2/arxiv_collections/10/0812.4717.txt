We investigate the dissipative dynamics of a quantum critical system in
contact with a thermal bath. In analogy with the standard protocol employed to
analyze aging, we study the response of a system to a sudden change of the bath
temperature. The specific example of the XY model in a transverse magnetic
field whose spins are locally coupled to a set of bosonic baths is considered.
The peculiar nature of the dynamics is encoded in the correlations developing
out of equilibrium. By means of a kinetic equation we analyze the spin-spin
correlations and block correlations. We identify some universal features in the
out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Two distinct regimes, characterized by different
time and length scales, emerge. During the initial transient the dynamics is
characterized by the same critical exponents as those of the equilibrium
quantum phase transition and resembles the dynamics of thermal phase
transitions. At long times equilibrium is reached through the propagation along
the chain of a thermal front in a manner similar to the classical Glauber
dynamics.
