A half-life of 2.2 $\pm$ 0.2 s has been deduced for the ground-state $\beta$
decay of $^{84}$Mo, more than 1$\sigma$ shorter than the previously adopted
value. $^{84}$Mo is an even-even N = Z nucleus lying on the proton dripline,
created during explosive hydrogen burning in Type I X-ray bursts in the rapid
proton capture ($rp$) process. The effect of the measured half-life on
$rp$-process reaction flow is explored. Implications on theoretical treatments
of nuclear deformation in $^{84}$Mo are also discussed.
