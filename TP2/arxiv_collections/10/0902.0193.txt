We investigate the asymptotic zero distribution of Heine-Stieltjes
polynomials - polynomial solutions of a second order differential equations
with complex polynomial coefficients. In the case when all zeros of the leading
coefficients are all real, zeros of the Heine-Stieltjes polynomials were
interpreted by Stieltjes as discrete distributions minimizing an energy
functional. In a general complex situation one deals instead with a critical
point of the energy. We introduce the notion of discrete and continuous
critical measures (saddle points of the weighted logarithmic energy on the
plane), and prove that a weak-* limit of a sequence of discrete critical
measures is a continuous critical measure. Thus, the limit zero distributions
of the Heine-Stieltjes polynomials are given by continuous critical measures.
We give a detailed description of such measures, showing their connections with
quadratic differentials. In doing that, we obtain some results on the global
structure of rational quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere that have
an independent interest.
