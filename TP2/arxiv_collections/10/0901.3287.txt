An {\it ab initio} relativistic band structure calculation of spin Hall
conductivity (SHC) ($\sigma_{xy}^z$) in Pd and Au metals has been performed. It
is found that at low temperatures, intrinsic SHCs for Pd and Au are,
respectively, $\sim 1400 (\hbar/e)(\Omega {\rm cm})^{-1}$ and $\sim 400
(\hbar/e)(\Omega {\rm cm})^{-1}$. The large SHC in Pd comes from the resonant
contribution from the spin-orbit splitting of the doubly degenerated 4$d$ bands
near the Fermi level at symmetry $\Gamma$ and X points, and the smaller SHC in
Au is due to the broad free electron like 6$s6p$-bands. However, as the
temperature increases, the SHC in Pd decreases monotonically and reduces to
$\sim 330 (\hbar/e)(\Omega {\rm cm})^{-1}$ at 300 K, while the SHC in Au
increases steadily and reaches $\sim 750 (\hbar/e)(\Omega {\rm cm})^{-1}$ at
room temperature. This indicates that the gigantic spin Hall effect
[$\sigma_{xy}^z \approx 10^5 (\hbar/e)(\Omega {\rm cm})^{-1}$] observed
recently in the Au/FePt system [T. Seki, {\it et al.}, Nature Materials {\bf
7}, 125 (2008)] is due to the extrinsic mechanisms such as the skew scattering
by the impurities in Au.
