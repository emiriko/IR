Using the point fusion procedure we obtain the new integrable systems from
the Elliptic Schlesinger system (ESS). These new systems have the pole orders
higher than one in the matrix of the Lax operator. Quadratic Poisson algebras
on the phase space of the new systems generalize the Sklyanin algebras and have
the graduated structure.
