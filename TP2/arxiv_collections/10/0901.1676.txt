The production of the lightest Higgs boson, $h^0$, in association with the
lightest stop, $\tilde{t}_{1}$, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model,
is an interesting channel, as its cross section can be higher than Higgs
production in association with top quarks. Furthermore, the
$\tilde{t}_{1}\tilde{t}^{*}_{1}h^{0}$ production rate is highly dependent on
various Supersymmetric parameters. The mass, mixings, couplings and production
cross sections relevant to the $\tilde{t}_{1}\tilde{t}^{*}_{1}h^{0}$ channel
have been studied in the past. Here, we complement these analyses by performing
a thorough decay study. We conclude that there is some scope for extracting
this channel at the Large Hadron Collider, for suitable combinations of the
Supersymmetric parameters, in several different decay channels of both the stop
quarks and Higgs boson, the most numerically promising being the signature
involving charm decays of the stops and bottom decay of the Higgs. This, in
fact, remains true in the Supergravity inspired Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model.
