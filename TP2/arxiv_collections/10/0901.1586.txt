The new symmetry axis of a well-behaved electromagnetic beam advanced in
paper Physical Review A 78, 063831 (2008) is not purely a mathematical concept.
The experimental result reported by Hosten and Kwiat in paper Science 319, 787
(2008) is shown to demonstrate the existence of this symmetry axis that is
neither perpendicular nor parallel to the propagation axis.
