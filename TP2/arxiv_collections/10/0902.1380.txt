We introduce the diamond-alpha exponential function on time scales. As
particular cases, one gets both delta and nabla exponential functions. A method
of solution of a homogenous linear dynamic diamond-alpha equation on a regular
time scale is investigated, and examples of diamond-alpha exponential functions
are presented.
