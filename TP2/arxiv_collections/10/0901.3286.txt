The magnetic properties of pure transition-like metals are discussed within
the single site approximation, to take into account the electron correlation.
The metal is described by two hybridized bands one of which includes the
Coulomb correlation. Our results indicate that ferromagnetism follows from
adequate values of the correlation and hybridization.
