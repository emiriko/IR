Quantum wave function engineering of dopant-based Si nano-structures reveals
new physics in the solid-state, and is expected to play a vital role in future
nanoelectronics. Central to any fundamental understanding or application is the
ability to accurately characterize the deformation of the electron wave
functions in these atom-based structures through electromagnetic field control.
We present a method for mapping the subtle changes that occur in the electron
wave function through the measurement of the hyperfine tensor probed by 29Si
impurities. Our results show that detecting the donor electron wave function
deformation is possible with resolution at the sub-Bohr radius level.
