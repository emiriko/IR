We calculate the rate of creation of double occupancies in a 3D
  Fermionic Mott insulator near half-filling by modulation of optical lattice
potential. At high temperatures, incoherent holes lead to a broad response
peaked at the Hubbard repulsion $U$. At low temperatures, antiferromagnetic
order leads to a coherent peak for the hole along with broad features
representing spin wave shake-off processes. This is manifested in the doublon
creation rate as a sharp absorption edge and oscillations as a function of
modulating frequency. Thus, modulation spectroscopy can be used as a probe of
antiferromagnetic order and nature of quasiparticle excitations in the system.
