Solutions of vacuum Einstein's field equations describing uniformly
accelerated particles or black holes belong to the class of boost-rotation
symmetric spacetimes. They are the only explicit solutions known which
represent moving finite objects. Their Newtonian limit is analyzed using the
Ehlers frame theory. Generic spacetimes with axial and boost symmetries are
first studied from the Newtonian perspective. The results are then illustrated
by specific examples such as C-metric, Bonnor-Swaminarayan solutions,
self-accelerating "dipole particles", and generalized boost-rotation symmetric
solutions describing freely falling particles in an external field. In contrast
to some previous discussions, our results are physically plausible in the sense
that the Newtonian limit corresponds to the fields of classical point masses
accelerated uniformly in classical mechanics. This corroborates the physical
significance of the boost-rotation symmetric spacetimes.
