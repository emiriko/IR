Quantum entanglement enables tasks not possible in classical physics. Many
quantum communication protocols require the distribution of entangled states
between distant parties. Here we experimentally demonstrate the successful
transmission of an entangled photon pair over a 144 km free-space link. The
received entangled states have excellent, noise-limited fidelity, even though
they are exposed to extreme attenuation dominated by turbulent atmospheric
effects. The total channel loss of 64 dB corresponds to the estimated
attenuation regime for a two-photon satellite quantum communication scenario.
We confirm that the received two-photon states are still highly entangled by
violating the CHSH inequality by more than 5 standard deviations. From a
fundamental point of view, our results show that the photons are virtually not
subject to decoherence during their 0.5 ms long flight through air, which is
encouraging for future world-wide quantum communication scenarios.
