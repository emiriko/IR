We present a new approximation scheme for the centrifugal term to obtain a
quasi-exact analytical bound state solutions within the framework of the
position-dependent effective mass radial Klein-Gordon equation with the scalar
and vector Hulth\'{e}n potentials in any arbitrary $D$ dimension and orbital
angular momentum quantum numbers $l.$ The Nikiforov-Uvarov (NU) method is used
in the calculations. The relativistic real energy levels and corresponding
eigenfunctions for the bound states with different screening parameters have
been given in a closed form. It is found that the solutions in the case of
constant mass and in the case of s-wave ($l=0$) are identical with the ones
obtained in literature.
