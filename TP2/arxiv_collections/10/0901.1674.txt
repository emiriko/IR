Rotating black holes can power the most extreme non-thermal transient
sources. They have a long-duration viscous time-scale of spin-down and produce
non-thermal emissions along their spin-axis, powered by a relativistic
capillary effect. We report on the discovery of exponential decay in BATSE
light curves of long GRBs by matched filtering, consistent with a viscous
time-scale, and identify UHECRs energies about the GZK threshold in linear
acceleration of ion contaminants along the black hole spin-axis, consistent
with black hole masses and lifetimes of FR II AGN. We explain the absence of
UHECRs from BL Lac objects due to UHECR emissions preferably at appreciable
angles away from the black hole spin-axis. Black hole spin may be key to
unification of GRBs and their host environments, and to AGN and their host
galaxies. Our model points to long duration bursts in radio from long GRBs
without supernovae and gravitational-waves from all long GRBs.
