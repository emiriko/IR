It is well known that there is a total cancellation of the
\emph{factorizable} IR divergences in unitary interacting field theories, such
as QED and quantum gravity. In this note we show that such a cancellation does
not happen in QED with background electric fields which can produce pairs.
There is no factorization of the IR divergences.
