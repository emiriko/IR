The process of cognition is analysed to adjust the set theory to physical
description. Postulates and basic definitions are revised. The specific sets of
predicates, called presets, corresponding to the physical objects identified by
an observer during cognition are introduced. Unlike sets, the presets are free
of logical or set-theoretical paradoxes and may be consistently used in
physical description. Schemes of cognition based on presets are considered.
Being different logical systems, the relativistic and quantum theories,
observations in modern cosmology cannot be consistently considered in one
`unified physical theory', but they are in frames of introduced schemes of
cognition.
