We investigate a self-organized swimmer at low Reynolds numbers. The
microscopic swimmer is composed of three spheres that are connected by two
identical active linker arms. Each linker arm contains molecular motors and
elastic elements and can oscillate spontaneously. We find that such a system
immersed in a viscous fluid can self-organize into a state of directed
swimming. The swimmer provides a simple system to study important aspects of
the swimming of micro-organisms.
