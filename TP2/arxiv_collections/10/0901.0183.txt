We introduce a stochastic lattice gas model including two particle species
and two parallel lanes. One lane with exclusion interaction and directed motion
and the other lane without exclusion and unbiased diffusion, mimicking a
micotubule filament and the surrounding solution. For a high binding affinity
to the filament, jam-like situations dominate the system's behaviour. The
fundamental process of position exchange of two particles is approximated. In
the case of a many-particle system, we were able to identify a regime in which
the system is rather homogenous presenting only small accumulations of
particles and a regime in which an important fraction of all particles
accumulates in the same cluster. Numerical data proposes that this cluster
formation will occur at all densities for large system sizes. Coupling of
several filaments leads to an enhanced cluster formation compared to the
uncoupled system, suggesting that efficient bidirectional transport on
one-dimensional filaments relies on long-ranged interactions and track
formation.
