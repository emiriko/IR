An experimental set-up for the measurement of the Casimir effect at
separations larger than a few microns is presented. The apparatus is based on a
mechanical resonator and uses a homodyne detection technique to sense the
Casimir force in the plane-parallel configuration. First measurements in the
3-10 micrometer range show an unexpected large force probably due to patch
effects.
