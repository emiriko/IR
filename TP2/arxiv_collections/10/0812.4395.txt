These notes summarize basic concepts underlying numerical relativity and in
particular the numerical modeling of black hole dynamics as a source of
gravitational waves. Main topics are the 3+1 decomposition of general
relativity, the concept of a well-posed initial value problem, the construction
of initial data for general relativity, trapped surfaces and gravitational
waves. Also, a brief summary is given of recent progress regarding the
numerical evolution of black hole binary systems.
