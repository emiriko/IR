Milgrom's Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) provides an efficient way to
summarize phenomenology of galaxies which does not lean on the notion of dark
matter; it has great predictive power. Here I briefly review MOND as well as
its implementation as a nonrelativistic modified gravity theory, AQUAL.
Gravitational lensing and cosmology call for a relativistic gravity theory
different from general relativity if dark matter is to be avoided. In recent
years such a theory, T$e$V$e$S, has emerged from the marriage of AQUAL with the
timelike vector field of Sanders. I discuss its structure and some of its
successes and shortcomings.
