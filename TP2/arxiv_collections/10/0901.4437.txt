We numerically study free expansion of a few Lieb-Liniger bosons, which are
initially in the ground state of an infinitely deep hard-wall trap. Numerical
calculation is carried out by employing a standard Fourier transform, as
follows from the Fermi-Bose transformation for a time-dependent Lieb-Liniger
gas. We study the evolution of the momentum distribution, the real-space
single-particle density, and the occupancies of natural orbitals. Our numerical
calculation allows us to explore the behavior of these observables in the
transient regime of the expansion, where they are non-trivially affected by the
particle interactions. We derive analytically (by using the stationary phase
approximation) the formula which connects the asymptotic shape of the momentum
distribution and the initial state. For sufficiently large times the momentum
distribution coincides (up to a simple scaling transformation) with the shape
of the real-space single-particle density (the expansion is asymptotically
ballistic). Our analytical and numerical results are in good agreement.
