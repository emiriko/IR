A method of using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) together with resolved
grazing incidence geometry for depth profiling atomic, electronic, chemical or
magnetic local structures in thin films is presented. The quantitative
deconvolution of thickness-dependent spectral features is performed by fully
considering both scattering and absorption formalisms. Surface oxidation and
local structural depth profiles in nanometric FePt films are determined,
exemplifying the application of the method.
