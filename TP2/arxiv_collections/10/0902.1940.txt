Computational ghost imaging has been demonstrated experimentally recently. In
this comment we wish to clarify the difference between pseudothermal ghost
imaging (PGI) and computational ghost imaging (CGI). In particular, to
emphasize the physics that arises from the difference in the type of sources
used. The experiment in [2] is not a PGI experiment but is a simulation of PGI.
If we consider CGI at the single photon level, it becomes clear that CGI relies
on two identical photons, one real and one simulated, to obtain an image.
