We consider two strongly hyperbolic Hamiltonian formulations of general
relativity and their numerical integration with a free and a partially
constrained symplectic integrator. In those formulations we use hyperbolic
drivers for the shift and in one case also for the densitized lapse. A system
where the densitized lapse is an external field allows to enforce the momentum
constraints in a holonomically constrained Hamiltonian system and to turn the
Hamilton constraint function from a weak to a strong invariant.
  These schemes are tested in a perturbed Minkowski and the Schwarzschild
space-time. In those examples we find advantages of the strongly hyperbolic
formulations over the ADM system presented in [arXiv:0807.0734]. Furthermore we
observe stabilizing effects of the partially constrained evolution in
Schwarzschild space-time as long as the momentum constraints are enforced.
