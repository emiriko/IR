The magnetic properties of transition-like metals are discussed within the
single site approximation, which is a picture to take into account electron
correlations. The metal is described by two hybridized bands one of which
includes Coulomb correlation. The presented results indicate that
ferromagnetism arises for adequate values of hybridization (V), correlation (U)
and occupation number($n_{\sigma}$). Some similarities with Dynamical
Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) are indicated.
