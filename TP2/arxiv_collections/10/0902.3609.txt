We discuss in detail how non-Markovian open system dynamics can be described
in terms of quantum jumps [J. Piilo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 180402
(2008)]. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to have a jump description
contained in the physical Hilbert space of the reduced system. The developed
non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) approach is a generalization of the Markovian
Monte Carlo Wave Function (MCWF) method into the non-Markovian regime. The
method conserves both the probabilities in the density matrix and the norms of
the state vectors exactly, and sheds new light on non-Markovian dynamics. The
dynamics of the pure state ensemble illustrates how local-in-time master
equation can describe memory effects and how the current state of the system
carries information on its earlier state. Our approach solves the problem of
negative jump probabilities of the Markovian MCWF method in the non-Markovian
regime by defining the corresponding jump process with positive probability.
The results demonstrate that in the theoretical description of non-Markovian
open systems, there occurs quantum jumps which recreate seemingly lost
superpositions due to the memory.
