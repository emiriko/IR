Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, ground state
properties of the spin-1 Heisenberg chain with exchange and single-ion
anisotropies in an external field are studied. Our findings confirm and refine
recent results by Sengupta and Batista, Physical Review Letters 99, 217205
(2007) (2007), on the same model applying Monte Carlo techniques. In
particular, we present evidence for two types of biconical (or supersolid) and
for two types of spin-flop (or superfluid) structures. Basic features of the
quantum phase diagram may be interpreted qualitatively in the framework of
classical spin models.
