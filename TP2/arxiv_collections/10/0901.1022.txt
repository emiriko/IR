We study lattices in non-positively curved metric spaces. Borel density is
established in that setting as well as a form of Mostow rigidity. A converse to
the flat torus theorem is provided. Geometric arithmeticity results are
obtained after a detour through superrigidity and arithmeticity of abstract
lattices. Residual finiteness of lattices is also studied. Riemannian symmetric
spaces are characterised amongst CAT(0) spaces admitting lattices in terms of
the existence of parabolic isometries.
