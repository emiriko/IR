We present two quantum information splitting schemes using respectively
tripartite GHZ and asymmetric W states as quantum channels. We show that, if
the secret state is chosen from a special ensemble and known to the sender
(Alice), then she can split and distribute it to the receivers Bob and Charlie
by performing only a single-qubit measurement and broadcasting an one-cbit
message. It is clear that no other schemes could possibly achieve the same goal
with simpler measurement and less classical communication. In comparison,
existing schemes work for arbitrary quantum states which need not be known to
Alice, however she is required to perform a two-qubit Bell measurement and
communicate a two-cbit message. Hence there is a trade off between flexibility
and measurement complexity plus classical resource. In situations where our
schemes are applicable, they will greatly reduce the measurement complexity and
at the same time cut the communication overhead by one half.
