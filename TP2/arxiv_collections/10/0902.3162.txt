Oxidation reaction of CO on a single platinum crystal is a reaction-diffusion
system that may exhibit bistable, excitable, and oscillatory behavior. We
studied the effect of a stochastic signal artificially introduced into the
system through the partial pressure of CO. First, the external signal is
employed as a turbulence suppression tool, and second, it modifies the
boundaries in the bistable transition between the CO and oxygen covered phases.
Experiments using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) together with
numerical simulations performed with the Krischer-Eiswirth-Ertl (KEE) model are
presented.
