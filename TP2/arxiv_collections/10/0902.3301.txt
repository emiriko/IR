Molecular motors are single macromolecules that generate forces at the
piconewton range and nanometer scale. They convert chemical energy into
mechanical work by moving along filamentous structures. In this paper, we study
the velocity of two-head molecular motors in the framework of a mechanochemical
network theory. The network model, a generalization of the recently work of
Liepelt and Lipowsky (PRL 98, 258102 (2007)), is based on the discrete
mechanochemical states of a molecular motor with multiple cycles. By
generalizing the mathematical method developed by Fisher and Kolomeisky for
single cycle motor (PNAS(2001) 98(14) P7748-7753), we are able to obtain an
explicit formula for the velocity of a molecular motor.
