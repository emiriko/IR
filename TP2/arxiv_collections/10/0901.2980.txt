The authors proposed and computationally analyzed nonvolatile static random
access memory (NV-SRAM) architecture using metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistor (MOSFET) type of spin-transistors referred to as
pseudo-spin-MOSFET (PS-MOSFET). PS-MOSFET is a new circuit approach to
reproduce the functions of spin-transistors, based on recently progressed
magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technology. The proposed NV-SRAM
cell can be simply configured by connecting two PS-MOSFETs to the storage nodes
of a standard SRAM cell. The logic information of the storage nodes can be
electrically stored into the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) of the PS-MOSFETs
by current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS), and the stored information
is automatically restored when the inverter loop circuit wakes up. In addition,
the proposed NV-SRAM cell has no influence on the performance of normal SRAM
operations. Low power dissipation and high degree of freedom of MTJ design are
also remarkable features for NV-SRAM using PS-MOSFETs.
