We present an algorithm for decomposing a symmetric tensor, of dimension n
and order d as a sum of rank-1 symmetric tensors, extending the algorithm of
Sylvester devised in 1886 for binary forms. We recall the correspondence
between the decomposition of a homogeneous polynomial in n variables of total
degree d as a sum of powers of linear forms (Waring's problem), incidence
properties on secant varieties of the Veronese Variety and the representation
of linear forms as a linear combination of evaluations at distinct points. Then
we reformulate Sylvester's approach from the dual point of view. Exploiting
this duality, we propose necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
of such a decomposition of a given rank, using the properties of Hankel (and
quasi-Hankel) matrices, derived from multivariate polynomials and normal form
computations. This leads to the resolution of polynomial equations of small
degree in non-generic cases. We propose a new algorithm for symmetric tensor
decomposition, based on this characterization and on linear algebra
computations with these Hankel matrices. The impact of this contribution is
two-fold. First it permits an efficient computation of the decomposition of any
tensor of sub-generic rank, as opposed to widely used iterative algorithms with
unproved global convergence (e.g. Alternate Least Squares or gradient
descents). Second, it gives tools for understanding uniqueness conditions, and
for detecting the rank.
