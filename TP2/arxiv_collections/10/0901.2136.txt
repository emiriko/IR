Supersymmetry has been studied for over three decades by physicists, its
superset even longer by mathematicians, and superspace has proven to be very
useful both conceptually and in facilitating computations. However, the (1)
necessary existence of superspace has been doubted, and its (2) properties and
(3) applications have not been understood in general. Herein, all doubt is
removed from the first of these: superspace must exist. Further study then
reveals a perhaps surprising size and algebro-geometric structure of this
extension of spacetime.
