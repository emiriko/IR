Transitions in an artificial atom, driven non-adiabatically through an
energy-level avoided crossing, can be controlled by carefully engineering the
driving protocol. We have driven a superconducting persistent-current qubit
with a large-amplitude, radio-frequency field. By applying a bi-harmonic
waveform generated by a digital source, we demonstrate a mapping between the
amplitude and phase of the harmonics produced at the source and those received
by the device. This allows us to image the actual waveform at the device. This
information is used to engineer a desired time dependence, as confirmed by
detailed comparison with simulation.
