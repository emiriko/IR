We investigate the large scale evolution of a relativistic magnetic
reconnection in an electron-positron pair plasma by a relativistic two-fluid
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. We introduce an inter-species friction force as
an effective resistivity to dissipate magnetic fields. We demonstrate that
magnetic reconnection successfully occurs in our two-fluid system, and that it
involves Petschek-type bifurcated current layers in later stage. We further
observe a quasi-steady evolution thanks to an open boundary condition, and find
that the Petschek-type structure is stable over the long time period.
Simulation results and theoretical analyses exhibit that the Petschek outflow
channel becomes narrower when the reconnection inflow contains more magnetic
energy, as previously claimed. Meanwhile, we find that the reconnection rate
goes up to ~1 in extreme cases, which is faster than previously thought. The
role of the resistivity, implications for reconnection models in the
magnetically dominated limit, and relevance to kinetic reconnection works are
discussed.
