We investigate the presence of Feshbach resonances in ultracold
alkali-dialkali reactive collisions. Quantum scattering calculations are
performed on a new Na_3 quartet potential energy surface. An analysis of
scattering features is performed through a systematic variation of the
nonadditive three-body interaction potential. Our results should provide useful
information for interpreting future atom-molecule collision experiments.
