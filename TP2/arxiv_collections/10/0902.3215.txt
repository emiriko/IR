We consider the Newtonian 5-body problem in the plane, where 4 bodies have
the same mass m, which is small compared to the mass M of the remaining body.
We consider the (normalized) relative equilibria in this system, and follow
them to the limit when m/M -> 0. In some cases two small bodies will coalesce
at the limit. We call the other equilibria the relative equilibria of four
separate identical satellites. We prove rigorously that there are only three
such equilibria, all already known after the numerical researches in [SaY]. Our
main contribution is to prove that any equilibrium configuration possesses a
symmetry, a statement indicated in [CLO2] as the missing key to proving that
there is no other equilibrium.
