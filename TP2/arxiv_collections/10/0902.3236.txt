We present the analysis of an unpublished VLA archive observation made at
1.49 GHz in 1989 toward the supernova remnant G1.9+0.3, the youngest such
Galactic object known. This observation agrees with the time evolution in
angular size previously reported. We derive an expansion rate of 0.46 +- 0.11 %
per year and an age of 220+45-70 yr for the remnant by comparing the 1985 and
1989 images.
