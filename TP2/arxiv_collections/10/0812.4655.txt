We characterize the breaking of analyticity with respect to the replica
number which occurs in random energy models via the complex zeros of the moment
of the partition function. We perturbatively evaluate the zeros in the vicinity
of the transition point based on an exact expression of the moment of the
partition function utilizing the steepest descent method, and examine an
asymptotic form of the locus of the zeros as the system size tends to infinity.
The incident angle of this locus indicates that analyticity breaking is
analogous to a phase transition of the second order. We also evaluate the
number of zeros utilizing the argument principle of complex analysis. The
actual number of zeros calculated numerically for systems of finite size agrees
fairly well with the analytical results.
