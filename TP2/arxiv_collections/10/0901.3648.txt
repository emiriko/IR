We report on double-differential inclusive cross-sections of the production
of secondary protons, deuterons, and charged pions and kaons, in the
interactions with a 5% nuclear interaction length thick stationary beryllium
target, of a +8.9 GeV/c proton and pion beam, and a -8.0 GeV/c pion beam.
Results are given for secondary particles with production angles between 20 and
125 degrees.
