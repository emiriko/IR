We study the low energy phenomena induced by the lightest charged Higgs in
the private Higgs (PH) model, in which each quark flavor is associated with a
Higgs doublet. We show that the couplings of the charged Higgs scalars to
fermions are fixed and the unknown parameters are only the masses and mixing
elements of the charged Higgs scalars. As the charged Higgs masses satisfy with
$M_b<M_{c}\ll M_{s} \ll M_{d,u}$, processes involving $B$-meson are expected to
be the ideal places to test the PH model. In particular, we explore the
constraints on the model from experimental data in $B$ physics, such as the
branching ratio (BR) and CP asymmetry (CPA) of $B\to X_s \ga$, $B_{d,s}-\bar
B_{d,s}$ mixings and the BR for $B\to K^* \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$. We illustrate
that the sign of the Wilson coefficient for $B\to X_s \ga$ can be different
from that in the standard model, while this flipped sign can be displayed by
the forward-backward asymmetry of $B\to V \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ with $V$ a vector
meson. We also demonstrate that $B_{d,s}-\bar B_{d,s}$ mixings and their
time-dependent CPAs are negligible small and the BR of $B\to K^* \ell^{+}
\ell^{-}$ can have a more strict bound than that of $B\to X_s \ga$.
