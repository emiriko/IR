We discuss the irreversible magnetic properties of self-flux grown
Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 single crystals for a wide range of concentrations covering
the whole phase diagram from the underdoped to the overdoped regime, x=0.038,
0.047, 0.058, 0.071, 0.074, 0.10, 0.106 and 0.118. Samples were characterized
by a magneto-optical method and show excellent spatial uniformity of the
superconducting state. The overall behavior closely follows classical Bean
model of the critical state. The field-dependent magnetization exhibits second
peak at a temperature and doping - dependent magnetic field, Hp. The evolution
of this fishtail feature with doping is discussed. Magnetic relaxation is
time-logarithmic and unusually fast. Similar to cuprates, there is an apparent
crossover from collective elastic to plastic flux creep above Hp. At high
fields, the field dependence of the relaxation rate becomes doping independent.
We discuss our results in the framework of the weak collective pinning and show
that vortex physics in iron-based pnictide crystals is much closer to high-Tc
cuprates than to conventional s-wave (including MgB2) superconductors.
