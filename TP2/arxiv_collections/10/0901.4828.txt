The Bel-Robinson tensor $B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ gives a positive definite
gravitational energy in the small sphere limit approximation. However, there is
an alternative tensor $V_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ which was proposed recently that
offers the same positivity as $B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ does. These two tensors
are a basis for expressions which have the desirable non-negative gravitational
energy in the small sphere region limit.
