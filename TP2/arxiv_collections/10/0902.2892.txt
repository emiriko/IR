There are strong evidence for powerful jets in the low/hard state of
black-hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). Here, we present a model in which electrons
are accelerated once at the base of the jet, and are cooled by synchrotron
emission and possible adiabatic energy losses. The accelerated electrons assume
a Maxwellian distribution at low energies and possible energetic power law
tail. These assumptions yield to a wealth of spectra, which we study in
details. We identify critical values of the magnetic field, and five transition
frequencies in the spectra. In particular, we show that: (I) the decay of the
magnetic field along the jet enables, for wide jets, production of flat radio
spectra without the need for electrons re-acceleration along the jet. (II) An
increase of the magnetic field above a critical value of ~10^5 G leads to a
sharp decrease in the flux at the radio band, while the flux at higher
frequencies saturates to a constant value. (III) For strong magnetic field, the
flux decays in the optical/UV band as F_nu ~ nu^{-1/2}, irrespective of the
electrons initial distribution. (IV) For B_0 ~ 10^4 G, the X-ray flux gradually
steepens. (V) With adiabatic energy losses, flat spectrum can be obtained only
at a limited frequency range, and under certain conditions (VI) For narrow
jets, r(x) ~ x^{alpha} with alpha < 1/2, flat radio spectrum cannot be
obtained. We provide full description of the spectrum in the different
scenarios, and show that our model is consistent with the key observed
properties of BHXRBs.
