Magnetisation and magnetoresistance measurements have been carried out on
superconducting Ba1-xKxFe2As2 samples with x=0.40 and 0.50. From low field
magnetization data carried out at different temperatures below TC, HC1 has been
extracted. The plot of HC1 versus temperature shows an anomalous increase at
low temperatures. From high field magnetization hysterisis measurements carried
out in fields up to 16 T at 4.2 K and 20 K, the critical current density has
been evaluated using the Bean critical state model. The JC determined from the
high field data is >104A/cm2 at 4.2 K and 5 T. The superconducting transitions
were also measured resistively in increasing applied magnetic fields up to 12
Tesla. From the variation of the TC onset with applied field, dHC2/dT at TC was
obtained to be -7.708 T/K and -5.57 T/K in the samples with x=0.40 and 0.50.
