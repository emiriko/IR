We present the X-ray observation of Vela shrapnel B with the XIS on board the
Suzaku satellite. The shrapnel is one of several ejecta fragment-like features
protruding beyond the primary blast wave shock front of the Vela supernova
remnant. The spectrum of shrapnel B is well-represented by a single-temperature
thin-thermal plasma in a non-equilibrium ionization state. The elemental
abundances of O, Ne, and Mg are found to be significantly higher than the solar
values, supporting that shrapnel B originates from supernova ejecta. The
abundances of O, Ne, and Mg relative to Fe are enhanced above their solar
values, while that of Si relative to Fe are at their solar values. This
abundance pattern is similar to that in shrapnel D, except that the
enhancements of the lighter elements are less prominent, suggesting more
extensive mixing with the interstellar medium (ISM) in shrapnel B. The
contribution of the ISM is considered to be larger at the trailing region,
because the absolute abundances of some elements there are depleted relative to
those at the shrapnel's head.
