30 years ago M. Kobayashi and T. Masakawa (won the Nobel Prize in physics
2008 for their famous t heory), gave a theory to explaining CP violation. This
theory predicted that large CP violation wou ld be observed in B mesons . In
the last 10 years, Both the B-factories (babar at Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, USA and Belle at KEK, Japan) have observed large CP violation as
predicted by th e KM mechanism. The ground breaking experimental results of
Flavor Oscillation and CP violation in B and D mesons are summarized and
compared with the Standard Model expectations.
