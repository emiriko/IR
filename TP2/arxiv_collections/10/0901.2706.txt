Electron quasiparticles are progressively weakened by correlations upon
approaching a continuos Mott metal insulator transition in a bulk solid. We
show that corresponding to the bulk weakening, a dead layer forms below the
surface of the solid, where quasiparticles are exponentially suppressed. The
surface dead layer depth is a bulk property, and diverges when the Mott
transition is approached. We describe this phenomenon in a Hubbard model within
a self-consistent Gutzwiller approximation. Photoemission data of Rodolakis et
al. in V2O3 appear to be in accord with this physical picture.
