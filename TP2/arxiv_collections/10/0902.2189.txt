The measurement of jet fragmentation functions in p+p collisions at 200 GeV
is of great interest because it provides a baseline to study jet quenching in
heavy-ion collisions. It is expected that jet quenching in nuclear matter
modifies the jet energy and multiplicity distributions, as well as the jet
hadrochemical composition. Therefore, a systematic study of the fragmentation
functions for charged hadrons and identified particles is a goal both in p+p
and Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Studying fragmentation functions for identified
particles is interesting in p+p by itself because it provides a test of NLO
calculations at RHIC energies. We present a systematic comparison of jet energy
spectra and fragment distributions using different jet-finding algorithms in
p+p collisions in STAR. Fragmentation functions of charged and neutral strange
particles are also reported for different jet energies.
