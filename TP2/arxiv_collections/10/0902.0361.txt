The IMAGES project aims at measuring the velocity fields of a representative
sample of 100 massive galaxies at z=0.4-0.75, selected in the CDFS, the CFRS
and the HDFS fields. It uses the world-unique mode of multiple integral field
units of FLAMES/ GIRAFFE at VLT. The resolved-kinematics data allow us to
sample the large scale motions at ~ few kpc scale for each galaxy. They have
been combined with the deepest HST/ACS, Spitzer (MIPS and IRAC) and VLT/FORS2
ever achieved observations. Most intermediate redshift galaxies show anomalous
velocity fields: 6 Gyrs ago, half of the present day spirals were out of
equilibrium and had peculiar morphologies. The wealth of the data in these
fields allow us to modelize the physical processes in each galaxy with an
accuracy almost similar to what is done in the local Universe. These detailed
analyses reveal the importance of merger processes, including their remnant
phases. Together with the large evolution of spiral properties, this points out
the importance of disk survival and strengthens the disk rebuilding scenario.
This suggests that the hierarchical scenario may apply to the elaboration of
disk galaxies as it does for ellipticals.
