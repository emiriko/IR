The role of external forces in systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion is
discussed on the basis of the describing Langevin equations. Since there exist
different possibilities to include the effect of an external field the concept
of {\it biasing} and {\it decoupled} external fields is introduced.
Complementary to the recently established Langevin equations for anomalous
diffusion in a time-dependent external force-field [{\it Magdziarz et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 210601 (2008)}] the Langevin formulation of
anomalous diffusion in a decoupled time-dependent force-field is derived.
