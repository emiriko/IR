We prove that every entangled state is useful as a resource for the problem
of minimum-error channel discrimination. More specifically, given a single copy
of an arbitrary bipartite entangled state, it holds that there is an instance
of a quantum channel discrimination task for which this state allows for a
correct discrimination with strictly higher probability than every separable
state.
