The necessary conditions of quasi-bound state formation of $\eta$-meson with
isotopes $^{3}$He, $^{4}$He have been found within the framework of optical
potential model. These conditions have been compared with the findings about
helium nucleus densities and with the available information about
$\eta$N-scattering length. Thus, we have conclude that within the framework of
discussed model $\eta-^{3}$He quasi-bound state formation is not possible, but
$\eta-^{4}$He quasi-bound state formation is possible with the great
probability.
