We propose a new class of photonic devices based on periodic stress fields in
silicon that enable second-order nonlinearity as well as quasi-phase matching.
Periodically-poled silicon (PePSi) adds the periodic poling capability to
silicon photonics, and allows the excellent crystal quality and advanced
manufacturing capabilities of silicon to be harnessed for devices based on
second-order nonlinear effects. As an example of the utility of the PePSi
technology, we present simulations showing that mid-wave infrared radiation can
be efficiently generated through difference frequency generation from
near-infrared with a conversion efficiency of 50%. This technology can also be
implemented with piezoelectric material, which offers the capability to
dynamically control the X(2) nonlinearity.
