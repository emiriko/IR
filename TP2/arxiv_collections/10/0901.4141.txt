It is generally believed that a point defect in graphene gives rise to an
impurity state at zero energy and causes a sharp peak in the local density of
states near the defect site. We revisit the defect problem in graphene and find
the general consensus incorrect. By both analytic and numeric methods, we show
that the contribution to the local density of states from the impurity state
vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Instead, the pronounced peak of the
zero-bias anomaly is a power-law singularity $1/|E|$ from infinite resonant
peaks in the low-energy regime induced by the defect. Our finding shows that
the peak shall be viewed as a collective phenomenon rather than a single
impurity state in previous studies.
