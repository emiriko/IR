We present an analysis of non-leptonic B decays in the minimally
flavour-violating MSSM with large tan(beta). We relate the Wilson coefficients
of the relevant hadronic scalar operators to leptonic observables, showing that
the present limits on the Bs->mu+ mu- and B+->tau nu_tau branching fractions
exclude any visible effect in hadronic decays. We study the transverse helicity
amplitudes of B->VV decays, which exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to the scalar
operators, showing that even though an order one modification relative to the
SM is not excluded in some of these amplitudes, they are too small to be
detected at B factories.
