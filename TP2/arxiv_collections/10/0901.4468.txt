The effect of hydrostatic pressure on the superconductivity in LiFeAs is
investigated up to 1.8 GPa. The superconducting transition temperature, T_c,
decreases linearly with pressure at a rate of 1.5 K/GPa. The negative pressure
coefficient of T_c and the high ambient pressure T_c indicate that LiFeAs is
the high-pressure analogue of the isoelectronic SrFe_2As_2 and BaFe_2As_2.
