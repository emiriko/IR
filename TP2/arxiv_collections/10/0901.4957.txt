This article describes an optimal method (conflation) to consolidate data
from different experiments, and illustrates the advantages of conflation by
graphical examples involving gaussian input distributions, and by a concrete
numerical example involving the values of lattice spacing of silicon crystals
used in determination of the current values of Planck's constant and the
Avogadro constant.
