Progress in the measurement of the ground state magnetic moments of mirror
nuclei at NSCL is presented. The systematic trend of the spin expectation value
$<s>$ and the linear behavior of $\gamma_p$ versus $\gamma_n$, both extracted
from the magnetic moments of mirror partners, are updated to include all
available data.
