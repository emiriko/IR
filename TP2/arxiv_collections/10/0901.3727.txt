In this paper, we study the thermodynamical properties of the (2+1)
dimensional black hole with a non-linear electrodynamics and with a negative
cosmological constant, using the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). This
approach shows that there is a minimum mass or remnant for the black hole,
corresponding to the minimum radius of the event horizon that has a size of the
order of the Planck scale. We also show that the heat capacity for this black
hole is always positive.
