A numerical model based on the finite-difference time-domain method is
developed to simulate fluctuations which accompany the dephasing of atomic
polarization and the decay of excited state's population. This model is based
on the Maxwell-Bloch equations with c-number stochastic noise terms. We
successfully apply our method to a numerical simulation of the atomic
superfluorescence process. This method opens the door to further studies of the
effects of stochastic noise on light-matter interaction and transient processes
in complex systems without prior knowledge of modes.
