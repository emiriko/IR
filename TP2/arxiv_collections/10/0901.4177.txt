Due to the weak spin-orbit interaction and the peculiar relativistic
dispersion in graphene, there are exciting proposals to build spin qubits in
graphene nanoribbons with armchair boundaries. However, the mutual interactions
between electrons are neglected in most studies so far and thus motivate us to
investigate the role of electronic correlations in armchair graphene nanoribbon
by both analytical and numerical methods. Here we show that the inclusion of
mutual repulsions leads to drastic changes and the ground state turns
ferromagnetic in a range of carrier concentrations. Our findings highlight the
crucial importance of the electron-electron interaction and its subtle
interplay with boundary topology in graphene nanoribbons. Furthermore, since
the ferromagnetic properties sensitively depends on the carrier concentration,
it can be manipulated at ease by electric gates. The resultant ferromagnetic
state with metallic conductivity is not only surprising from an academic
viewpoint, but also has potential applications in spintronics at nanoscale.
