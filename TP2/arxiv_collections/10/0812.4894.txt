We study the excitation dynamics of Rydberg atoms in a one-dimensional
lattice with periodic boundary conditions where the atomic Rydberg states are
resonantly excited from the electronic ground state. Our description of the
corresponding dynamics is numerically exact within the perfect blockade regime,
i.e. no two atoms in a given range can be excited. The time-evolution of the
mean Rydberg density, density-density correlations as well as entanglement
properties are analyzed in detail. We demonstrate that the short time dynamics
is universal and dominated by quantum phenomena, while for larger time the
characteristics of the lattice become important and the classical features
determine the dynamics. The results of the perfect blockade approach are
compared to the predictions of an effective Hamiltonian which includes the
interaction of two neighboring Rydberg atoms up to second order perturbation
theory.
