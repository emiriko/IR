Within the EUDET consortium a high resolution pixel beam telescope is being
developed. The telescope consists of up to six planes of monolithic active
pixel sensors. A flexible data acquisition environment is available for the
telescope and the system is equipped with all the required infrastructure.
Since the first installation of a demonstrator telescope in 2007, it has been
extensively tested and used by various detector R&D groups. The results of test
beam measurements are described here, demonstrating the telescope performance.
