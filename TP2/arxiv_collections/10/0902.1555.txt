We analyze intermediate degree p- and f-mode eigenfrequencies measured by
GONG and MDI/SOHO for a complete solar cycle to study their correlation with
solar activity. We demonstrate that the frequencies do vary linearly with the
activity, however the degree of correlation differs from phase to phase of the
cycle. During the rising and the declining phases, the mode frequencies are
strongly correlated with the activity proxies whereas during the low- and
high-activity periods, the frequencies have significantly lower correlation
with all the activity proxies considered here.
