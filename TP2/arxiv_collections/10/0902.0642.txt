Using calculations from first principles we have investigated the lattice
thermal conductivity of ideal mono- and bi-layer graphene sheets. Our results
demonstrate that the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both mono- and bi-layer
graphene is around 2200 W/mK at 300 K, a value close to the one observed
theoretically and experimentally in graphite basal plane, and at higher
temperatures it decreases with the expected 1/T dependence. The little
variation between mono- and bi-layer thermal conductivity suggests that
increasing the number of layers does not affect significantly the in-plane
thermal properties of these systems.
