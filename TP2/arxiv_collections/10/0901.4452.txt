We numerically show that very small magnetic flux can significantly shift the
metal-insulator transition point in a disordered electronic system. The shift
we observe for the 3d Anderson model obeys a power law as predicted by Larkin
and Khmel'nitskii (1981). We compute the exponent and find good agreement with
the prediction. However, the power law holds only for much smaller magnetic
fields than has been previously assumed, and is accompanied by a large
prefactor, leading to a surprising strong dependence of the transition point on
the applied magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that the critical
level-spacing distribution is identical in the presence and absence of a
magnetic field if hard-wall boundary conditions are applied. This result is
surprising since both cases belong to different universality classes and
different distributions have been reported for periodic boundary conditions.
