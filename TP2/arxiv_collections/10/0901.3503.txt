We describe the structure and composition of six major stellar streams in a
population of 20 574 local stars in the New Hipparcos Reduction with known
radial velocities. We find that, once fast moving stars are excluded, almost
all stars belong to one of these streams. The results of our investigation have
lead us to re-examine the hydrogen maps of the Milky Way, from which we
identify the possibility of a symmetric two-armed spiral with half the
conventionally accepted pitch angle. We describe a model of spiral arm motions
which matches the observed velocities and composition of the six major streams,
as well as the observed velocities of the Hyades and Praesepe clusters at the
extreme of the Hyades stream. We model stellar orbits as perturbed ellipses
aligned at a focus in coordinates rotating at the rate of precession of
apocentre. Stars join a spiral arm just before apocentre, follow the arm for
more than half an orbit, and leave the arm soon after pericentre. Spiral
pattern speed equals the mean rate of precession of apocentre. Spiral arms are
shown to be stable configurations of stellar orbits, up to the formation of a
bar and/or ring. Pitch angle is directly related to the distribution of orbital
eccentricities in a given spiral galaxy. We show how spiral galaxies can evolve
to form bars and rings. We show that orbits of gas clouds are stable only in
bisymmetric spirals. We conclude that spiral galaxies evolve toward grand
design two-armed spirals. We infer from the velocity distributions that the
Milky Way evolved into this form about 9 Gyrs ago.
