We construct explicitly two infinite families of genuine nonadditive 1-error
correcting quantum codes and prove that their coding subspaces are 50% larger
than those of the optimal stabilizer codes of the same parameters via the
linear programming bound. All these nonadditive codes can be characterized by a
stabilizer-like structure and thus their encoding circuits can be designed in a
straightforward manner.
