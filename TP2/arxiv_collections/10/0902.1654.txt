The non-equilibrium dynamic fluctuations of a stochastic version of the
Gray-Scott (GS) model are studied analytically in leading order in perturbation
theory by means of the dynamic renormalization group. There is an attracting
stable fixed point at one-loop order, and the asymptotic scaling of the
correlation functions is predicted for both spatial and temporally correlated
noise sources. New effective three-body reaction terms, not present in the
original GS model, are induced by the combined interplay of the fluctuations
and nonlinearities.
