We apply a recently proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence to extremal
supersymmetric five-dimensional charged spinning black holes, constructed by
Breckenridge, Myers, Peet and Vafa. By computing the central charge of the dual
CFT and Frolov-Thorne temperature, Cardy's formula succeeds in reproducing
Bekenstein-Hawking area law.
