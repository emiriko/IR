Red Dwarf (dM) stars are overwhelmingly the most numerous stars in our
Galaxy. These cool, faint and low mass stars make up more than 80% of all
stars. Also dM stars have extremely long life times (longer than 50-100 Gyr).
Determining the number of red dwarfs with planets and assessing planetary
habitability (a planet's potential to develop and sustain life) is critically
important because such studies would indicate how common life is in the
universe. Our program - "Living with a Red Dwarf" - addresses these questions
by investigating the long-term nuclear evolution and the coronal and
chromospheric properties of red dwarf stars with widely different ages (~50 Myr
-- 12 Gyr). One major focus of the program is to study the magnetic-dynamo
generated coronal and chromospheric X-ray--FUV/UV emissions and flare
properties of a sample of dM0--5 stars. Observations carried out by FUSE of a
number of young to old dM stars provide important data for understanding
transition region heating in these stars with deep convective zones as well as
providing measures of FUV irradiances. Also studied are the effects of
X-ray--FUV emissions on possible hosted planets and impacts of this radiation
on their habitability. Using these data we are constructing irradiance tables
(X-UV irradiances) that can be used to model the effects of XUV radiation on
planetary atmospheres and possible life on planetary surfaces. The initial
results of this program are discussed.
