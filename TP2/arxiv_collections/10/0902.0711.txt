Astrophysics = the star physics was beginning its development without a
supporting of measurement data, which could not be obtained then. Still
astrophysics exists without this support, although now astronomers collected a
lot of valuable information. This is the main difference of astrophysics from
all other branches of physics, for which foundations are measurement data. The
creation of the theory of stars, which is based on the astronomical
measurements data, is one of the main goals of modern astrophysics. Below the
principal elements of star physics based on data of astronomical measurements
are described.
  The theoretical description of a hot star interior is obtained. It explains
the distribution of stars over their masses, mass-radius-temperature and
mass-luminosity dependencies. The theory of the apsidal rotation of binary
stars and the spectrum of solar oscillation is considered. All theoretical
predictions are in a good agreement with the known measurement data, which
confirms the validity of this consideration.
