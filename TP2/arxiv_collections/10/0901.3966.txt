Three independent observational studies have now detected a narrow (\Delta z
~ 0.5) dip centred at z=3.2 in the otherwise smooth redshift evolution of the
Lya forest effective optical depth. This feature has previously been
interpreted as an indirect signature of rapid photo-heating in the IGM during
the epoch of HeII reionisation. We examine this interpretation using a
semi-analytic model of inhomogeneous HeII reionisation and high resolution
hydrodynamical simulations of the Lya forest. We instead find that a rapid
(\Delta z ~ 0.2) boost to the IGM temperature (\Delta T ~ 10^4 K) beginning at
z=3.4 produces a well understood and generic evolution in the Lya effective
optical depth, where a sudden reduction in the opacity is followed by a
gradual, monotonic recovery driven largely by adiabatic cooling in the low
density IGM. This behaviour is inconsistent with the narrow feature in the
observational data. If photo-heating during HeII reionisation is instead
extended over several redshift units, as recent theoretical studies suggest,
then the Lya opacity will evolve smoothly with redshift. We conclude that the
sharp dip observed in the Lya forest effective optical depth is instead most
likely due to a narrow peak in the hydrogen photo-ionisation rate around z=3.2,
and suggest that it may arise from the modulation of either reprocessed
radiation during HeII reionisation, or the opacity of Lyman limit systems.
