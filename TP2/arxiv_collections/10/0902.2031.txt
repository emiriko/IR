Subject to the neutrino experiments, the mixing matrix of ordinary neutrinos
can still have small violation from unitarity. We introduce a quasi-unitary
matrix to interpret this violation and propose a natural scheme to parameterize
it. A quasi-unitary factor $\Delta_{\rm QF}$ is defined to be measured in
neutrino oscillation experiments and our numerical results show that
improvement of experimental precision may help us figure out the secret of
neutrino mixing.
