The paper is concerned with spatial and time regularity of solutions to
linear stochastic evolution equation perturbed by L\'evy white noise "obtained
by subordination of a Gaussian white noise". Sufficient conditions for spatial
continuity are derived. It is also shown that solutions do not have in general
\cadlag modifications. General results are applied to equations with fractional
Laplacian. Applications to Burgers stochastic equations are considered as well.
