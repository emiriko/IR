The Magneli phase Ti4O7 exhibits two sharp jumps in resistivity with coupled
structural transitions as a function of temperature at Tc1=142 K and Tc2=154 K.
We have studied electronic structure changes across the two transitions using 7
eV laser, soft x-ray and hard x-ray (HX) photoemission spectroscopy (PES). Ti
2p-3d resonant PES and HX-PES show a clear metallic Fermi-edge and mixed
valency above Tc2. The low temperature phase below Tc1 shows a clear insulating
gap of 100 meV. The intermediate phase between Tc1 and Tc2 indicates a
pseudogap coexisting with remnant coherent states. HX-PES and complementary
calculations have confirmed the coherent screening in the strongly correlated
intermediate phase. The results suggest existence of a highly anomalous state
sandwiched between the mixed-valent Fermi liquid and charge ordered
Mott-insulating phase in Ti4O7.
