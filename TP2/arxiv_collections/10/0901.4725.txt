We present a new method for isothermal rigid body simulations using the
quaternion representation and Langevin dynamics. It can be combined with the
traditional Langevin or gradient (Brownian) dynamics for the translational
degrees of freedom to correctly sample the NVT distribution in a simulation of
rigid molecules. We propose simple, quasi-symplectic second-order numerical
integrators and test their performance on the TIP4P model of water. We also
investigate the optimal choice of thermostat parameters.
