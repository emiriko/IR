It is known that lipid membranes become permeable in their melting regime. In
microscopic conductance measurements on black lipid membranes one finds that
conduction takes place via quantized events closely resembling those reported
for protein ion channels. Here, we present data of ion currents through black
lipid membranes in the presence and absence of the anesthetics octanol and
ethanol, and compare them to a statistical thermodynamics model using
parameters that are obtained from experimental calorimetric data. The
conductance steps in pure lipid membrane suggest aqueous pores with the size of
approximately one lipid cross-section. We model the permeability by assuming
empty sites of the size of one lipid. We find that pore formation in the
melting transition regime is facilitated by the increase of the lateral
compressibility that expresses itself in the area fluctuations. Thus, pore
formation is related to critical opalescence in two dimensions. Anesthetics
alter the permeability by affecting the thermodynamic state of the membrane and
by shifting the heat capacity profiles.
