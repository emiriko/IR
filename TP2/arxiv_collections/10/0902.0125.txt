The theory of confinement and deconfinement is discussed as based on the
properties of the QCD vacuum. The latter are described by field correlators of
colour-electric and colour-magnetic fields in the vacuum, which can be
calculated analytically and on the lattice. As a result one obtains a
self-consistent theory of the confined region in the (mu,T) plane with
realistic hadron properties. At the boundary of the confining region, the
colour-electric confining correlator vanishes, and the remaining correlators
describe strong nonperturbative dynamics in the deconfined region with (weakly)
bound states. Resulting equation of state for mu=0, p(T), (epsilon-3P)/T are in
good agreement with lattice data. Phase transition occurs due to evaporation of
a part of the colour-electric gluon condensate, and the resulting critical
temperatures T_c(mu) for different n_f are in good correspondence with
available data.
