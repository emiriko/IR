This paper formalizes and proves correct a compilation scheme for
mutually-recursive definitions in call-by-value functional languages. This
scheme supports a wider range of recursive definitions than previous methods.
We formalize our technique as a translation scheme to a lambda-calculus
featuring in-place update of memory blocks, and prove the translation to be
correct.
