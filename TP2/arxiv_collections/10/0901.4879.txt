Transition rates in continuously driven steady states were derived in [Evans
R M L, 2005 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 38, 293] by demanding that no information
other than the microscopic laws of motion and the macroscopic observables of
the system be used to describe it. In addition to the mean energy at
equilibrium, and unlike them, these driven states have a finite throughput of
flux. This implies that the (nonequilibrium) reservoir, to which the system is
weakly coupled, is fully characterised by its mean energy and mean flux. While
we expect the resulting prescription for the rates in continuous and
discretised time versions of models of real systems to be equivalent, it is not
trivial to see this from the expression for the rates derived previously. We
demonstrate this equivalence for a model of activated processes solved
previously for continuous time, thus demonstrating consistency of theory.
