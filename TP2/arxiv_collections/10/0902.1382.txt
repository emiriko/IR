Based on the time-dependent Gutzwiller approximation we study the possibility
that the diagonal incommensurate spin scattering in strongly underdoped
lanthanum cuprates originates from antiferromagnetic domain walls (stripes).
Calculation of the dynamic spin response for stripes in the diagonal phase
yields the characteristic hour glass dispersion with the crossing of low energy
Goldstone and high-energy branches at a characteristic energy Ecross at the
antiferromagnetic wave-vector Q_{AF}. The high energy part is close to the
parent antiferromagnet. Our results suggest that inelastic neutron scattering
experiments on strongly underdoped lanthanum cuprates can be understood as due
to a mixture of bond centered and site centered stripe configurations with
substantial disorder.
