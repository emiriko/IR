We consider a simple market where a vendor offers multiple variants of a
certain product and preferences of both the vendor and potential buyers are
heterogeneous and possibly even antagonistic. Optimization of the joint benefit
of the vendor and the buyers turns the toy market into a combinatorial matching
problem. We compare the optimal solutions found with and without a matchmaker,
examine the resulting inequality between the market participants, and study the
impact of correlations on the system.
