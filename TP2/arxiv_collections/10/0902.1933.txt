Recent small angle neutron scattering suggests, that the spin structure in
the A-phase of MnSi is a so-called triple-$Q$ state, i.e., a superposition of
three helices under 120 degrees. Model calculations suggest that this structure
in fact is a lattice of so-called skyrmions, i.e., a lattice of topologically
stable knots in the spin structure. We report a distinct additional
contribution to the Hall effect in the temperature and magnetic field range of
the proposed skyrmion lattice, where such a contribution is neither seen nor
expected for a normal helical state. Our Hall effect measurements constitute a
direct observation of a topologically quantized Berry phase that identifies the
spin structure seen in neutron scattering as the proposed skyrmion lattice.
