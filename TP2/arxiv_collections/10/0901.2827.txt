A purely electrical sensing scheme is presented that determines the
concentration of macromolecules in solution by measuring the capacitance
between planar microelectrodes. Concentrations of DNA in the ng/mL range have
been used in samples of 1 microL volume. The method has been applied to the
characterisation of the dielectrophoretic response of DNA without the need for
any chemical modifications. The influence of electrical parameters like duty
cycle, voltage and frequency has been investigated. The results are in good
agreement with data from dielectrophoretic studies on fluorescently labelled
DNA. Extension of the method down to the single molecule level appears
feasible.
