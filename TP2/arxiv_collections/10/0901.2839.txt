The evidence presented earlier by several authors for the substantial disk
eccentricity in dwarf novae during their superoutbursts is shown to result
either from errors or from arbitrary, incorrect assumptions. In particular, the
evidence resulting from hot spot eclipses was based on the assumption that the
spot distances are identical with disk radii which is not always correct.
