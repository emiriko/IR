We investigate the signals of supersymmetry (SUSY) in a scenario where only
the third family squarks and sleptons can be produced at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), in addition to the gluino, charginos and neutralinos. The final
states in such cases are marked by a multiplicity of top and/or bottom quarks.
We study in particular, the case when the stop, sbottom and gluino masses are
near the TeV scale due to which, the final state t's and b's are very
energetic. We point out the difficulty in b-tagging and identifying energetic
tops and suggest several event selection criteria which allow the signals to
remain significantly above the standard model background. We show that such
scenarios with gluino mass up to 2 TeV can be successfully probed at the LHC.
Information on $\tan \beta$ can also be obtained by looking at associated Higgs
production in the cascades of accompanying neutralinos. We also show that a
combined analysis of event rates in the different channels and the effective
mass distribution allows one to differentiate this scenario from the one where
all three sfermion families are accessible.
