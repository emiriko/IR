We derive the fluctuational magnetization and the paraconductivity of
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductors in their normal state.
The FFLO superconducting fluctuations induce oscillations of the magnetization
between diamagnetism and unusual paramagnetism which originates from the
competition between paramagnetic and orbital effects. We also predict a strong
anisotropy of the paraconductivity when the FFLO transition is approached in
contrast with the case of a uniform BCS state. Finally building a
Ginzburg-Levanyuk argument, we demonstrate that these fluctuation effects can
be safely treated within the Gaussian approximation since the critical
fluctuations are proeminent only within an experimentally inaccessible
temperature interval.
