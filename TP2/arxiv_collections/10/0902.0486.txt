I discuss recent progress in the uncovering of the phase diagram of
non-supersymmetric gauge theories. The nature of the conformal window for
higher dimensional representations suggests a possible way to construct
realistic technicolor models. I then explicitly provide two such theories. One
of these models also has a natural cold Dark Matter candidate.
