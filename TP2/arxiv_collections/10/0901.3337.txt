We examine the current lower bound on the charged Higgs boson mass in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. By applying direct search constraints on
the neutral Higgs bosons and other supersymmetric states, as well as a number
of indirect constraints (b -> s gamma, B_s -> mu mu, B -> tau nu, B -> D tau
nu), we find that it is possible to push the charged Higgs boson mass as low as
140 GeV. We work in a completely low-energy approach with no assumptions about
scalar mass unification, examining two of the most popular limits for neutral
Higgs boson searches: the Max-Mixing and No-Mixing scenarios. While both
scenarios allow light charged Higgs bosons, they do so for completely different
ranges of tan(beta). In either case, one expects light top squarks to accompany
a light charged Higgs.
