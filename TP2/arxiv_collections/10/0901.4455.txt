A complete analytical reduction of general one-loop Feynman integrals with
five legs for tensors up to rank R=3 and six legs for tensors up to rank 4 is
reviewed. An elegant formalism with extensive use of signed minors was
developed for the cancellation of leading inverse Gram determinants.The
resulting compact formulae allow both for a study of analytical properties and
for efficient numerical programming. Here some special numerical examples are
presented.
