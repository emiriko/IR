Two-neutron correlation in the $^1S$ channel in quasi two-dimensional (2D)
neutron systems at zero temperature is studied by means of the BCS theory with
finite-range effective nuclear forces. The dineutron correlation in low density
neutron systems confined in an infinite slab is investigated in a simplified
model that neutron motion of one direction is frozen. When the slab is thin
enough, two neutrons form a tightly bound dineutron with a small size in the
quasi-2D system, and a Bose dineutron gas is found in low density limit. With
increase of Fermi momentum, the neutron system changes from the Bose-gas phase
to the superfluid Cooper pair phase. The density dependence of the neutron
pairing shows the BCS-BEC crossover phenomena at finite low-density region. In
the transition region, the size shrinking of neutron pair and enhancement of
pairing gap are found. The relation to dineutron correlation at surface of
neutron-rich nuclei is also discussed.
