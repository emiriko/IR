The DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation data, which may be interpreted
as a signal for the existence of weakly interacting dark matter (WIMPs) in our
galactic halo, are re-examined in light of new measurements of the local
velocity relative to the galactic halo. In the vicinity of the Sun, the
velocity of the Galactic disk has been estimated to be 250 km/s rather than 220
km/s. Our analysis is performed both with and without the channeling effect
included. The best fit regions to the DAMA data are shown to move to slightly
lower WIMP masses. Compatibility of DAMA data with null results from other
experiments (CDMS, XENON10, and CRESST I) is investigated given these new
velocities. A small region of spin-independent (elastic) scattering for 7-8 GeV
WIMP masses remains at 3$\sigma$. Spin-dependent scattering off of protons is
viable for 5-15 GeV WIMP masses for direct detection experiments (but has been
argued by others to be further constrained by Super-Kamiokande due to
annihilation in the Sun).
