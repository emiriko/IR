We discuss the production of gravity waves from the fragmentation of a
supersymmetric condensate in the early universe. Supersymmetry predicts the
existence of flat directions in the potential. At the end of inflation, the
scalar fields develop large time-dependent vacuum expectation values along
these flat directions. Under some general conditions, the scalar condensates
undergo a fragmentation into non-topological solitons, Q-balls. We study this
process numerically and confirm the recent analytical calculations showing that
it can produce gravity waves observable by Advanced Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA), and Big Bang Observer (BBO). The fragmentation can generate gravity
waves with an amplitude as large as Omega_{GW}~10^{-11} and with a peak
frequency ranging from mHz to 10 Hz, depending on the parameters. The discovery
of such a relic gravitational background radiation can open a new window on the
physics at the high scales, even if supersymmetry is broken well above the
electroweak scale.
