The low-energy spectrum of graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges (armchair
nanoribbons) is described as the superposition of two non-equivalent Dirac
points of graphene. In spite of the lack of well-separated two valley
structures, the single-channel transport subjected to long-ranged impurities is
nearly perfectly conducting, where the backward scattering matrix elements in
the lowest order vanish as a manifestation of internal phase structures of the
wavefunction. For multi-channel energy regime, however, the conventional
exponential decay of the averaged conductance occurs. Since the inter-valley
scattering is not completely absent, armchair nanoribbons can be classified
into orthogonal universality class irrespective of the range of impurities. The
nearly perfect single-channel conduction dominates the low-energy electronic
transport in rather narrow nanorribbons.
