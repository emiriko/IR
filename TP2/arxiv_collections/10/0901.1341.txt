Higher derivative field theories with interactions raise serious doubts about
their validity due to severe energy instabilities. In many cases the
implementation of a direct perturbation treatment to excise the dangerous
negative-energies from a higher derivative field theory may lead to violations
of Lorentz and other symmetries. In this work we study a perturbative
formulation for higher derivative field theories that allows the construction
of a low-energy effective field theory being a genuine perturbations over the
ordinary-derivative theory and having a positive-defined Hamiltonian. We show
that some discrete symmetries are recovered in the low-energy effective theory
when the perturbative method to reduce the negative-energy degrees of freedom
from the higher derivative theory is applied. In particular, we focus on the
higher derivative Maxwell-Chern-Simons model which is a Lorentz invariant and
parity-odd theory in 2+1 dimensions. The parity violation arises in the
effective action of QED$_3$ as a quantum correction from the massive fermionic
sector. We obtain the effective field theory which remains Lorentz invariant,
but parity invariant to the order considered in the perturbative expansion.
