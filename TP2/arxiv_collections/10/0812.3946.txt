Arc-annotated sequences are useful for representing structural information of
RNAs and have been extensively used for comparing RNA structures in both terms
of sequence and structural similarities. Among the many paradigms referring to
arc-annotated sequences and RNA structures comparison (see
\cite{IGMA_BliDenDul08} for more details), the most important one is the
general edit distance. The problem of computing an edit distance between two
non-crossing arc-annotated sequences was introduced in \cite{Evans99}. The
introduced model uses edit operations that involve either single letters or
pairs of letters (never considered separately) and is solvable in
polynomial-time \cite{ZhangShasha:1989}. To account for other possible RNA
structural evolutionary events, new edit operations, allowing to consider
either silmutaneously or separately letters of a pair were introduced in
\cite{jiangli}; unfortunately at the cost of computational tractability. It has
been proved that comparing two RNA secondary structures using a full set of
biologically relevant edit operations is {\sf\bf NP}-complete. Nevertheless, in
\cite{DBLP:conf/spire/GuignonCH05}, the authors have used a strong
combinatorial restriction in order to compare two RNA stem-loops with a full
set of biologically relevant edit operations; which have allowed them to design
a polynomial-time and space algorithm for comparing general secondary RNA
structures. In this paper we will prove theoretically that comparing two RNA
structures using a full set of biologically relevant edit operations cannot be
done without strong combinatorial restrictions.
