The finite-frequency optical properties of the underdoped cuprates, in both
the normal and superconducting state, display features which go beyond a Fermi
liquid and a BCS description. We provide an understanding of these properties
within a simplified analytical model, which has been evolved out of the Hubbard
model and ideas based on a resonating valence bond spin liquid. We find that:
1) in underdoped samples, the missing area integrals reveal a second energy
scale due to the pseudogap, not present at optimum or overdoping; 2) the real
part of the optical self-energy shows a large sharp peak, that emerges with the
opening of the pseudogap which exists within the superconducting state and
persists in the normal state; and 3) the amount of optical spectral weight
which is transferred to the condensate is greatly reduced by the presence of
the pseudogap as compared to the Fermi liquid case. These non-BCS features of
the superconducting state are in good qualitative agreement with a body of
experimental work on different cuprate systems and provide strong evidence from
optical conductivity that they are all a manifestation of the pseudogap energy
scale.
