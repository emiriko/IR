We demonstrate that a Finite Bath Fluctuation Theorem of the Crooks type
holds for systems that have been thermalized via weakly coupling it to a bath
with energy independent finite specific heat. We show that this theorem reduces
to the known canonical and microcanonical fluctuation theorems in the two
respective limiting cases of infinite and vanishing specific heat of the bath.
The result is elucidated by applying it to a 2D hard disk colliding elastically
with few other hard disks in a rectangular box with perfectly reflecting walls.
