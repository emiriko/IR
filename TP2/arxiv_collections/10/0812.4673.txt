This paper is devoted to weaken "classical" assumptions and give new
arguments to prove existence of sweeping process (associated to the proximal
normal cone of sets). Mainly we define the concept of a "directional
prox-regularity" and give assumptions about a Banach space to insure the
existence of such sweeping process (which permit to generalize the existing
results requiring a Hilbertian structure).
