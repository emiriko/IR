The cross section for inclusive multipion production in the pp->ppX reaction
was measured at COSY-ANKE at four beam energies, 0.8, 1.1, 1.4, and 2.0 GeV,
for low excitation energy in the final pp system, such that the diproton
quasi-particle is in the 1S0 state. At the three higher energies the missing
mass Mx spectra show a strong enhancement at low Mx, corresponding to an ABC
effect that moves steadily to larger values as the energy is increased. Despite
the missing-mass structure looking very different at 0.8 GeV, the variation
with Mx and beam energy are consistent with two-pion production being mediated
through the excitation of two Delta(1232) isobars, coupled to S-- and D--
states of the initial pp system.
