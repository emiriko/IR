The standard Grad-Shafranov equation for axisymmetric toroidal plasma
equilibrium is customary expressed in cylindrical coordinates with toroidal
contours, and through which benchmark equilibria are solved. An alternative
approach to cast the Grad-Shafranov equation in spherical coordinates is
presented. This equation, in spherical coordinates, is examined for toroidal
solutions to describe low $\beta$ Solovev and high $\beta$ plasma equilibria in
terms of elementary functions.
