Some new challenges for an experiment and observation, which are consequences
of the model of low-energy quantum gravity by the author, are considered here.
In particular, the property of asymptotic freedom of this model leads to the
unexpected consequence: if a black hole arises due to a collapse of a matter
with some characteristic mass of particles, its full mass should be restricted
from the bottom. For usual baryonic matter, this limit of mass is of the order
$10^{7}M_{\odot}$.
