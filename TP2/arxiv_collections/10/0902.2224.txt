The charging of spinning insulating objects by plasma and photoemission is
studied with the particle-in-cell method. Unidirectional photon flux, different
angular velocities of the object, and different plasma flow speeds are
considered. Photoemission can lead to a positive total charge and electric
dipole moment on the object. The spinning of the object redistributes the
surface charge. The total object charge oscillates in time with the period
matching the period of the object rotation. Plasma potential and density in the
vicinity of the object oscillate with the same frequency. The plasma is
rarefied close to a positively charged object, and the density wake diminishes
when the object is charged negatively. The time averaged charge depends on the
angular velocity of the object.
