A two-species spatially extended system of hosts and parasitoids is studied.
There are two distinct kinds of coexistence; one with populations distributed
homogeneously in space and another one with spatiotemporal patterns. In the
latter case, there are noise-sustained oscillations in the population
densities, whereas in the former one the densities are essentially constants in
time with small fluctuations. We introduce several metrics to characterize the
patterns and onset thereof. We also build a consistent sequence of corrections
to the mean-field equations using a posteriori knowledge from simulations.
These corrections both lead to better description of the dynamics and connect
the patterns to it. The analysis is readily applicable to realistic systems,
which we demonstrate by an example using an empirical metapopulation landscape.
