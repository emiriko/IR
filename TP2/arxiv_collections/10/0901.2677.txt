We propose a nonlinear self-consistent model of the turbulent non-resonant
particle acceleration in solar flares. We simulate temporal evolution of the
spectra of charged particles accelerated by strong long-wavelength MHD
turbulence taking into account back reaction of the accelerated particles on
the turbulence. The main finding is that the nonlinear coupling of accelerated
particles and MHD turbulence result in prominent evolution of the spectra of
accelerated particles, which can be either soft-hard-soft or soft-hard-harder
depending on the particle injection efficiency. Such evolution patterns are
widely observed in hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission from solar flares.
