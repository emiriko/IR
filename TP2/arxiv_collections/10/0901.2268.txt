Optical and X-ray observations are presented here of a newly reported X-ray
transient system in the Small Magellanic Cloud - SXP7.92. A detailed analysis
of the X-ray data reveal a coherent period of 7.9s. A search through earlier
X-ray observations of the SMC reveal a previously unknown earlier detection of
this system. Follow-up X-ray observations identified a new transient source
within the error circle of the previous observations. An optical counterpart,
AzV285, is proposed which reveals clear evidence for a 36.8d binary period.
