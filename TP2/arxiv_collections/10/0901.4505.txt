Let $G_0$ be a connected, simply connected real simple Lie group. Suppose
that $G_0$ has a compact Cartan subgroup $T_0$, so it has discrete series
representations. Relative to $T_0$ there is a distinguished positive root
system $\Delta^+$ for which there is a unique noncompact simple root $\nu$, the
"Borel -- de Siebenthal system". There is a lot of fascinating geometry
associated to the corresponding "Borel -- de Siebenthal discrete series"
representations of $G_0$. In this paper we explore some of those geometric
aspects and we work out the $K_0$--spectra of the Borel -- de Siebenthal
discrete series representations. This has already been carried out in detail
for the case where the associated symmetric space $G_0/K_0$ is of hermitian
type, i.e. where $\nu$ has coefficient 1 in the maximal root $\mu$, so we
assume that the group $G_0$ is not of hermitian type, in other words that $\nu$
has coefficient 2 in $\mu$. \medskip
  Several authors have studied the case where $G_0/K_0$ is a quaternionic
symmetric space and the inducing holomorphic vector bundle is a line bundle.
That is the case where $\mu$ is orthogonal to the compact simple roots and the
inducing representation is 1--dimensional.
