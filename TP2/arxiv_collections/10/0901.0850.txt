Ultra-compact, horizonless objects such as gravastars, boson stars, wormholes
and superspinars can mimick most of the properties of black holes. Here we show
that these "black hole mimickers" will most likely develop a strong ergoregion
instability when rapidly spinning. Instability timescales range between 10^-5 s
and 1 weeks depending on the object, its mass and its angular momentum. For a
wide range of parameters the instability is truly effective. This provides a
strong indication that astrophysical ultra-compact objects with large rotation
are black holes.
