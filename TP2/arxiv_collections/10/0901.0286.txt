IGM metal absorption lines observed in z>6 spectra offer the opportunity to
probe early feedback processes, the nature of enriching sources, and the
topology of reionization. We run high-resolution cosmological simulations
including galactic outflows to study the observability and physical properties
of 5 ions (C II, C IV, O I, Si II, Si IV) in absorption between z=8->5. We
apply three cases for ionization conditions: Fully neutral, fully reionized,
and a patchy model based on the flux from the nearest galaxy. We find that our
simulations broadly fit available z~5-6 IGM metal-line data, although all
observations cannot be accommodated with a single ionization condition.
Variations in O I absorbers among sight lines seen by Becker et al. (2006)
suggest significant neutral IGM patches down to z~6. Strong C IV absorbers at
z~6 may be the result of ionization by their parent galaxy. Our outflows have
typical speeds of ~200 km/s and mass loading factors of ~6. Such high mass
loading is critical for enriching the IGM to the observed levels while
curtailing star formation to match the observed z~6 rest-frame UV luminosity
function. The volume filling factor of metals increases during this epoch, but
only reaches ~1% for Z>10^(-3) Zsolar by z=5. C IV is an ideal tracer of IGM
metals at z~5-6, with dropping global ionization fractions to either higher or
lower redshifts. This results in a strongly increasing global Omega(C IV) from
z=8->5, in contrast to its relative constancy from z=5->2. Our simulations do
not support widespread early IGM enrichment from e.g. Pop III stars. High-z
absorbers arise from metals on their first outward journey from galaxies, at
distances less than 50 kpc. The galaxies responsible for early IGM enrichment
have typical M*=10^(7.0-8.5) Msolar.
