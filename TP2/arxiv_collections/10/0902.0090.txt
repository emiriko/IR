We obtain complete topological classification of states of nematic liquid
crystal in the geometry of periodic array of rectangular posts between two
parallel slabs, with tangent or normal boundary conditions. This classification
has applications in bi-stable pos-aligned liquid crystal display design and
have technological significance. Methods used in classification are those of
algebraic topology and go beyond relative homotopy groups.
