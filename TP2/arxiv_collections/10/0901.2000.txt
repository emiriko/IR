This paper reviews two different uses of the continuous wavelet transform for
modal identification purposes. The properties of the wavelet transform, mainly
energetic, allow to emphasize or filter the main information within measured
signals and thus facilitate the modal parameter identification especially when
mechanical systems exhibit modal coupling and/or relatively strong damping.
