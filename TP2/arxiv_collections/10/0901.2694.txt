New method of shaping quantum "particle - unparticle" vacuum excitations has
been proposed in the framework of unification of relativity and quantum theory.
Such unification is based solely on the notion of generalized coherent state
(GCS) of N-level system and the geometry of unitary group SU(N) acting in state
space $C^N$. Initially, neither contradictable notion of quantum particle, nor
space-time coordinates (that cannot be a priori attached to nothing) are used
in this construction. Quantum measurement of local dynamical variables (LDV)
leads to the emergence of 4D dynamical space-time (DST). Morphogenesis of the
"field shell" of GCS and its dynamics have been studied for N=2 in DST.
