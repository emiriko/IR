This paper surveys some results on Wick product and Wick renormalization. The
framework is the abstract Wiener space. Some known results on Wick product and
Wick renormalization in the white noise analysis framework are presented for
classical random variables. Some conditions are described for random variables
whose Wick product or whose renormalization are integrable random variables.
Relevant results on multiple Wiener integrals, second quantization operator,
Malliavin calculus and their relations with the Wick product and Wick
renormalization are also briefly presented. A useful tool for Wick product is
the $S$-transform which is also described without the introduction of
generalized random variables.
