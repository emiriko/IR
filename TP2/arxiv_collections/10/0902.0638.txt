We present the results of a submillimeter interferometric survey of
circumstellar disks in the Trapezium Cluster of Orion. We observed the 880
micron continuum emission from 55 disks using the Submillimeter Array, and
detected 28 disks above 3sigma significance with fluxes between 6-70 mJy and
rms noise between 0.7-5.3 mJy. Dust masses and upper limits are derived from
the submillimeter excess above free-free emission extrapolated from longer
wavelength observations. Above our completeness limit of 0.0084 solar masses,
the disk mass distribution is similar to that of Class II disks in
Taurus-Auriga and rho Ophiuchus but is truncated at 0.04 solar masses. We show
that the disk mass and radius distributions are consistent with the formation
of the Trapezium Cluster disks ~1 Myr ago and subsequent photoevaporation by
the ultraviolet radiation field from Theta-1 Ori C. The fraction of disks which
contain a minimum mass solar nebula within 60 AU radius is estimated to be
11-13% in both Taurus and the Trapezium Cluster, which suggests the potential
for forming Solar Systems is not compromised in this massive star forming
region.
