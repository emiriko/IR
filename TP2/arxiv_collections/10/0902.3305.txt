Spatially-resolved Raman spectra of individual pristine suspended carbon
nanotubes are observed under electrical heating. The Raman G+ and G- bands show
unequal temperature profiles. The preferential heating is more pronounced in
short nanotubes (2 um) than in long nanotubes (5 um). These results are
understood in terms of the decay and thermalization of non-equilibrium phonons,
revealing the mechanism of thermal transport in these devices. The measurements
also enable a direct estimate of thermal contact resistances and the spatial
variation of thermal conductivity.
