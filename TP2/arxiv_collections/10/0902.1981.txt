We investigate theoretically the shielding of the electromagnetic field
fluctuations by s-wave and d-wave superconductors within the framework of
macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. The spin flip lifetime is evaluated above
a niobium and a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) surface, and the
screening effect is studied as a function of the thickness of the
superconducting layer. Further, we study the different temperature dependence
of the atomic spin relaxation above the two superconductors.
