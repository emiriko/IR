We review statistical theories and numerical methods employed to consider the
sample size dependence of the failure strength distribution of disordered
materials. We first overview the analytical predictions of extreme value
statistics and fiber bundle models and discuss their limitations. Next, we
review energetic and geometric approaches to fracture size effects for
specimens with a flaw. Finally, we overview the numerical simulations of
lattice models and compare with theoretical models.
