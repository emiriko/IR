Using numerical simulations based on solving the general relativistic
hydrodynamic equations, we study the dynamics of a phase transition in the
dense core of isolated rotating neutron stars, triggered by the back bending
instability reached via angular momentum loss. In particular, we investigate
the dynamics of a migration from an unstable configuration into a stable one,
which leads to a mini-collapse of the neutron star and excites sizeable
pulsations in its bulk until it acquires a new stable equilibrium state. We
consider equations of state with softening at high densities, a simple analytic
one with a mixed hadron-quark phase in an intermediate pressure interval and
pure quark matter at very high densities, and a microphysical one that has a
first-order phase transition, originating from kaon condensation. Although the
marginally stable initial models are rigidly rotating, we observe that during
the collapse (albeit little) differential rotation is created. We analyze the
emission of gravitational radiation, which in some models is amplified by mode
resonance effects, and assess its prospective detectability by interferometric
detectors. We expect that the most favorable conditions for dynamic migration
exist in very young magnetars. We find that the damping of the post-migration
pulsations strongly depends on the character of the equation of state
softening. The damping of pulsations in the models with the microphysical
equation of state is caused by dissipation associated with matter flowing
through the density jump at the edge of the dense core. If at work, this
mechanism dominates over all other types of dissipation, like bulk viscosity in
the exotic-phase core, gravitational radiation damping, or numerical viscosity.
