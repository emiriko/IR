We study Einstein static universes in the context of generic f(R) models. It
is shown that Einstein static solutions exist for a wide variety of modified
gravity models sourced by a barotropic perfect fluid with equation of state
w=p/rho, but these solutions are always unstable to either homogeneous or
inhomogeneous perturbations. Our general results are in agreement with specific
models investigated in that past. We also discuss how our techniques can be
applied to other scenarios in f(R) gravity.
