We study the energy redistribution of interacting bosons in a ring-shaped
quantum trimer as the coupling strength between neighboring sites of the
corresponding Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian undergoes a sudden change dk. Our
analysis is based on a three-fold approach combining linear response theory
calculations as well as semiclassical and random matrix theory considerations.
The dk-borders of applicability of each of these methods are identified by
direct comparison with the exact quantum mechanical results. We find that while
the variance of the evolving quantum distribution shows a remarkable
quantum-classical correspondence (QCC) for all dk-values, other moments exhibit
this QCC only in the non-perturbative dk-regime.
