The MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab was designed to be a definitive test of
the LSND evidence for neutrino oscillations and has recently reported first
results of a search for electron-neutrino appearance in a muon-neutrino Booster
beam. No significant excess of events was observed at higher energies, but a
sizable excess of events was observed at lower energies. The lack of the excess
at higher energies allowed MiniBooNE to rule out simple two-neutrino
oscillations as an explanation of the LSND signal. However, the excess at lower
energies is presently unexplained.
  A new data set of neutrinos from the NuMI beam line measured with the
MiniBooNE detector at Fermilab has been analyzed. The measurement of NuMI
neutrino interactions in MiniBooNE provide a clear proof-of-principle of the
off-axis beam concept that is planned to be used by future neutrino experiments
such as T2K and NOvA. Moreover, it complements the first oscillation results
and will help to determine whether the lower-energy excess is due to background
or to new physics.
  New results from the re-analysis of low energy excess from the Booster beam
line and the results from measurements of neutrino interactions from NuMI beam
line are discussed. MiniBooNE observes an unexplained excess of $128.8 \pm 20.4
\pm 38.3$ electron-like events in the energy region $200 < E_{\nu} < 475$ MeV.
The NuMI data sample currently has a large systematic errors associated with
$\nu_{e}$ events, but shows an indication of an excess.
