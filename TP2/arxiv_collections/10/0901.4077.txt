The possibilities to tune the structure of solid like material resulting from
arrested spinodal decomposition is investigated using a system composed of
lysozyme, a globular protein, dispersed in a water solution as model system for
colloids with short range attraction. It is shown that the resulting arrested
spinodal decomposition is driven by the interplay between the early kinetics of
the spinodal decomposition and the dynamical arrest. The initial concentration,
the quench depth and speed from the fluid state to the arrested state enable to
tailor the mesh size of the solid network of the arrested spinodal
decomposition.
