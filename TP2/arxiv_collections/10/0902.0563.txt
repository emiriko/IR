A combination of the reduced $e^{\pm}p$ cross section, previously measured by
H1 and ZEUS, has been performed and leads to well constrained QCD fits of the
parton densities in the proton. These results, as well as the high-$Q^2$
neutral current deep inelastic scattering cross sections are presented. First
direct measurements of the longitudinal structure function $F_L$ are also
reported.
