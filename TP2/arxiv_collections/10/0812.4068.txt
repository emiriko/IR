We explore the pseudoscalar $\eta_b$ and the scalar $\chi_{b0}$ decays into
$\ell^+\ell^-$ to probe whether it is possible to probe the Higgs sectors
beyond that of the Standard Model. We, in particular, focus on the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model, and determine the effects of its Higgs bosons on
the aforementioned bottomonium decays into lepton pairs. We find that the
dileptonic branchings of the bottomonia can be sizeable for a relatively light
Higgs sector.
