The column group is a subgroup of the symmetric group on the elements of a
finite blackboard birack generated by the column permutations in the birack
matrix. We use subgroups of the column group associated to birack homomorphisms
to define an enhancement of the integral birack counting invariant and give
examples which show that the enhanced invariant is stronger than the unenhanced
invariant.
