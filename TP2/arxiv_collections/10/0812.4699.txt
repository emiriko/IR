A model-assisted semiparametric method of estimating finite population totals
is investigated to improve the precision of survey estimators by incorporating
multivariate auxiliary information. The proposed superpopulation model is a
single-index model which has proven to be a simple and efficient semiparametric
tool in multivariate regression. A class of estimators based on polynomial
spline regression is proposed. These estimators are robust against deviation
from single-index models. Under standard design conditions, the proposed
estimators are asymptotically design-unbiased, consistent and asymptotically
normal. An iterative optimization routine is provided that is sufficiently fast
for users to analyze large and complex survey data within seconds. The proposed
method has been applied to simulated datasets and MU281 dataset, which have
provided strong evidence that corroborates with the asymptotic theory.
