The $T$-adic exponential sum associated to a Laurent polynomial in one
variable is studied. An explicit arithmetic polygon is proved to be the generic
Newton polygon of the $C$-function of the T-adic exponential sum. It gives the
generic Newton polygon of $L$-functions of $p$-power order exponential sums.
