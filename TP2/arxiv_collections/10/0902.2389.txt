Spin pumping by a moving magnetization gives rise to an electric voltage over
a spin valve. Thermal fluctuations of the magnetization manifest themselves as
increased thermal voltage noise with absorption lines at the ferromagnetic
resonance frequency and/or zero frequency. The effect depends on the
magnetization configuration and can be of the same order of magnitude as the
Johnson-Nyquist thermal noise. Measuring colored voltage noise is an
alternative to ferromagnetic resonance experiments for nano-scale ferromagnetic
circuits.
