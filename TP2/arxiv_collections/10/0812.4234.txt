A method is presented using helicity cross sections for calculating
neutrino-nucleon interactions. The formalism is applied in the calculation of
the pion spectra produced by nu_mu and nu_tau beams. The masses of the charged
leptons are kept throughout the calculations. Cross sections are presented in
numerous figures where the contributions of the significant form factors are
also shown. The article describes the steps of the calculation and gives
details so that it can be reproduced and adapted to the kinematic conditions of
the experiments.
