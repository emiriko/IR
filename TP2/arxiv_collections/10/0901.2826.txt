The main object of our study is a four dimensional Lie algebra which
describes the symmetry properties of a nonlinear Black-Scholes model. This
model implements a feedback effect which is typical for an illiquid market. The
structure of the Lie algebra depends on one parameter, i.e. we have to do with
a one-parametric family of algebras. We provide a classification of these
algebras using Patera--Winternitz method. Optimal systems of one-, two- and
three- dimensional subalgebras are described for the family of symmetry
algebras of the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation. The optimal systems give us
the possibility to describe a complete set of invariant solutions to the
equation.
