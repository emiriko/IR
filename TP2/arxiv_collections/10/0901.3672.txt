Wind-blown sand, or 'saltation,' creates sand dunes, erodes geological
features, and could be a significant source of dust aerosols on Mars. Moreover,
the electrification of sand and dust in saltation, dust storms, and dust devils
could produce electric discharges and affect atmospheric chemistry. We present
the first calculations of electric fields in martian saltation, using a
numerical model of saltation that includes sand electrification, plasma
physics, and the adsorption of ions and electrons onto particulates. Our
results indicate that electric discharges do not occur in martian saltation.
Moreover, we find that the production of hydrogen peroxide and the dissociation
of methane by electric fields are less significant than previously thought.
Both these species are highly relevant to studies of past and present life on
Mars.
