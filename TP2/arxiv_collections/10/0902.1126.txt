A narrow peak in the pi+ pi- mass distribution was seen by the Rome-Syracuse
Collaboration in bar-p n --> 2 pi+ 3 pi- annihilation at rest 39 years ago. The
reanalysis of this peak finds a mass of 757.4 +- 2.6 MeV/c^2 and a width
slightly narrower than the experimental resolution. The evidence of the peak is
5.2 standard deviations. This state is generated in (12.4 +- 2.4)% of the bar-p
n --> 2 pi+ 3 pi- annihilations at rest. No spin analysis is possible with the
statistics of the experiment.
