We present a new version of the CompHEP program package, version 4.5. We
describe new options and techniques implemented in the version: interfaces to
ROOT and HERWIG, parallel calculations, generation of the XML-based header in
event files (HepML), full implementation of the Les Houches agreements (LHA I,
SUSY LHA, LHA PDF, Les Houches Event format), cascade matching for intermediate
scalar resonances, etc.
