The neoclassical calculation of the helicon wave theory contains a
fundamental flaw. Use is made of a proportional relationship between the
magnetic field and its curl to derive the Helmholtz equation describing helicon
wave propagation; however, by the fundamental theorem of Stokes, the curl of
the magnetic field must be perpendicular to that portion of the field
contributing to the local curl. Reexamination of the equations of motion
indicates that only electromagnetic waves propagate through a stationary region
of constant pressure in a fully ionized, neutral medium.
