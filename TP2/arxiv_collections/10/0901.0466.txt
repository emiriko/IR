We consider coordinate systems adapted to accelerated observers, construct a
generalised Rindler metric and then adopt a specific form of it to compute the
semiclassical Unruh temperature, using a WKB approximation within a Hamilton
Jacobi analysis in the tunneling picture. Corrections to this temperature are
next computed by going beyond the usual WKB approximation. A connection of the
corrected Unruh temperature with the Hawking temperature is established. This
connection is also explained through the method of Global Embedding Minkowski
Spacetime (GEMS).
