We provide an assessment of the state of the art in various issues related to
experimental measurements, phenomenological methods and theoretical results
relevant for the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and
their uncertainties, with the specific aim of providing benchmarks of different
existing approaches and results in view of their application to physics at the
LHC. We discuss higher order corrections, we review and compare different
approaches to small x resummation, and we assess the possible relevance of
parton saturation in the determination of PDFS at HERA and its possible study
in LHC processes. We provide various benchmarks of PDF fits, with the specific
aim of studying issues of error propagation, non-gaussian uncertainties, choice
of functional forms of PDFs, and combination of data from different experiments
and different processes. We study the impact of combined HERA (ZEUS-H1)
structure function data, their impact on PDF uncertainties, and their
implications for the computation of standard candle processes, and we review
the recent F_L determination at HERA. Finally, we compare and assess methods
for luminosity measurements at the LHC and the impact of PDFs on them.
