The cosmological constant induced by quantum fluctuation of the graviton on a
given background is considered as a tool for building a spectrum of different
geometries. In particular, we apply the method to the Schwarzschild background
with positive and negative mass parameter. In this way, we put on the same
level of comparison the related naked singularity (-M) and the positive mass
wormhole. We discuss how to extract information in the context of a f(R)
theory. We use the Wheeler-De Witt equation as a basic equation to perform such
an analysis regarded as a Sturm-Liouville problem . The application of the same
procedure used for the ordinary theory, namely f(R)=R, reveals that to this
approximation level, it is not possible to classify the Schwarzschild and its
naked partner into a geometry spectrum.
