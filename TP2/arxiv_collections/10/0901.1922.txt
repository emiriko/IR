We discuss the Lorentz model for dispersion and absorption of radiation in
dilute, linear and isotropic materials. Initially, with the purpose of making
the paper as self-contained as possible, we reproduce the usual calculations
concerning the interaction between the charged material oscillators and the
electric field of the incident radiation, obtaining the main behavior of the
reactive and dissipative electromagnetic properties of the materials.
Thereafter, we also include the magnetic contribution of the Lorentz force to
the equation of motion of the oscillators up to first order in $v/c$, which
leads to some interesting results, like the approximately linear dependence of
the refraction index with the radiation intensity and the appearance of a
second region of anomalous dispersion around half the natural frequencies of
the material.
