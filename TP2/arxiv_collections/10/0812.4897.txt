We find an interpretation of the complex of variational calculus in terms of
the Lie conformal algebra cohomology theory. This leads to a better
understanding of both theories. In particular, we give an explicit construction
of the Lie conformal algebra cohomology complex, and endow it with a structure
of a g-complex. On the other hand, we give an explicit construction of the
complex of variational calculus in terms of skew-symmetric poly-differential
operators.
