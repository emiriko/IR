We investigate the influence of vacuum polarization of quantum massive fields
on the scalar sector of quasinormal modes in spherically symmetric black holes.
We consider the evolution of a massless scalar field on the spacetime
corresponding to a charged semiclassical black hole, consisting of the quantum
corrected geometry of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole dressed by a quantum
massive scalar field in the large mass limit. Using a sixth order WKB approach
we find the shift in the quasinormal mode frequencies due to vacuum
polarization .
