Miminizing errors of the physical parameters of interest should be the
ultimate goal of any event selection optimization in high energy physics data
analysis involving parameter determination. Quick and reliable error estimation
is a crucial ingredient for realizing this goal. In this paper we derive a
formalism for direct evaluation of measurement errors using the signal
probability density function and large fully simulated signal and background
samples without need for data fitting and background modelling. We illustrate
the elegance of the formalism in the case of event selection optimization for
CP violation measurement in B decays. The implication of this formalism on
choosing event variables for data analysis is discussed.
