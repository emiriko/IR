Ab initio calculations in bcc iron show that a <111> screw dislocation
induces a short-range dilatation field in addition to the Volterra elastic
field. This core field is modeled in anisotropic elastic theory using force
dipoles. The elastic modeling thus better reproduces the atom displacements
observed in ab initio calculations. Including this core field in the
computation of the elastic energy allows deriving a core energy which converges
faster with the cell size, thus leading to a result which does not depend on
the geometry of the dislocation array used for the simulation.
