Nuclear spin polarization dynamics are measured in optically pumped
individual GaAs/AlGaAs interface quantum dots by detecting the time-dependence
of the Overhauser shift in photoluminescence (PL) spectra. Long nuclear
polarization decay times of ~ 1 minute have been found indicating inefficient
nuclear spin diffusion from the GaAs dot into the surrounding AlGaAs matrix in
externally applied magnetic field. A spin diffusion coefficient two orders
lower than that previously found in bulk GaAs is deduced.
