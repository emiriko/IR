We show that there is no algorithm deciding whether the maximal residually
free quotient of a given finitely presented group is finitely presentable or
not.
  Given a finitely generated subgroup G of a finite product of limit groups, we
discuss the possibility of finding an explicit set of defining equations (i.e.
of expressing G as the maximal residually free quotient of an explicit finitely
presented group).
