We perform an analysis of the way individual users navigate in the Web. We
focus primarily in the temporal patterns of they return to a given page. The
return probability as a function of time as well as the distribution of time
intervals between consecutive visits are measured and found to be independent
of the level of activity of single users. The results indicate a rich variety
of individual behaviors and seem to preclude the possibility of defining a
characteristic frequency for each user in his/her visits to a single site.
