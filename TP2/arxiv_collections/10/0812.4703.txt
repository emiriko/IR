A brief summary of the singularity resolution in loop quantum cosmology of
homogeneous isotropic models is presented. The article is addressed to
relativists who do not specialize in quantum gravity. For further details, and
answers to more technical asked questions, the reader is directed to the
original papers and to more comprehensive recent reviews.
  Dedicated to the memory of Basilis Xanthopoulos, a founder of this NEB series
of conferences.
