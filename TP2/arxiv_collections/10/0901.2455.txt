We have carried out a detailed experimental investigation of the static
properties of planar Josephson tunnel junctions in presence of a uniform
external magnetic field applied in an arbitrary orientation with respect to the
barrier plane. We considered annular junctions, as well as rectangular
junctions (having both overlap and cross-type geometries) with different
barrier aspect ratios. It is shown how most of the experimental findings in an
oblique field can be reproduced invoking the superposition principle to combine
the classical behavior of electrically small junctions in an in-plane field
together with the small junction behavior in a transverse field that we
recently published [R. Monaco et al., J. Appl. Phys. vol 104, 023906 (2008)].
We explore the implications of these results in supposing systematic errors in
previous experiments and in proposing new possible applications. We show that
the presence of a transverse field may have important consequences, which could
be either voluntarily exploited in applications or present an unwanted
perturbation.
