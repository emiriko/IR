Multi-instrument data sets of NOAA AR10938 on Jan. 16, 2007, (e.g.,
{\emph{Hinode}}, {\it{STEREO}}, {\it{GOES}}, {\it{MLSO}} and {\it{ISOON}}
H$\alpha$) are utilized to study the fine structure and evolution of a magnetic
loop system exhibiting multiple crossing threads, whose arrangement and
individual shapes are very suggestive of individual field lines in a flux rope.
The footpoints of the magnetic threads are closely rooted into pores and plage
areas. A C-class flare recorded by {\it{GOES}} at approximately 2:35 UT near
one of the footpoints of the multi-thread system (along with a wisp of loop
material shown by EUV data) led to the brightening of the magnetic structure
revealing its fine structure with several threads that indicate a high degree
of linking (suggesting a left-handed helical pattern as shown by the filament
structure formed later-on). EUV observations by {\emph{Hinode}}/EIS of hot
spectral lines at 2:46 UT show a complex structure of coronal loops. The same
features were observed about 20 minutes later in X-ray images from
{\emph{Hinode}}/XRT and about 30 minutes further in EUV images of
{\it{STEREO}}/SECCHI/EUVI with much better resolution. H$\alpha$ and 304 {\AA}
images revealed the presence of several filament fibrils in the same area. They
evolved a few hours later into a denser structure seemingly showing helical
structure, which persistently lasted for several days forming a segment of a
larger scale filament. The present observations provide an important indication
for a flux robe as a precursor of a solar filament.
