Chemical turbulent mixing induced by rotation can affect the internal
distribution of mu near the energy-generating core of main-sequence stars,
having an effect on the evolutionary tracks similar to that of overshooting.
However, this mixing also leads to a smoother chemical composition profile near
the edge of the convective core, which is reflected in the behaviour of the
buoyancy frequency and, therefore, in the frequencies of gravity modes. We show
that for rotational velocities typical of main-sequence B-type pulsating stars,
the signature of a rotationally induced mixing significantly perturbs the
spectrum of gravity modes and mixed modes, and can be distinguished from that
of overshooting. The cases of high-order gravity modes in Slowly Pulsating B
stars and of low-order g modes and mixed modes in beta Cephei stars are
discussed.
