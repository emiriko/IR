This paper deals with improvements to the contrast source inversion method
which is widely used in microwave tomography. First, the method is reviewed and
weaknesses of both the criterion form and the optimization strategy are
underlined. Then, two new algorithms are proposed. Both of them are based on
the same criterion, similar but more robust than the one used in contrast
source inversion. The first technique keeps the main characteristics of the
contrast source inversion optimization scheme but is based on a better
exploitation of the conjugate gradient algorithm. The second technique is based
on a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm and performs simultaneous
updates of sets of unknowns that are normally processed sequentially. Both
techniques are shown to be more efficient than original contrast source
inversion.
