We review recent developments in theoretical models for neutrino masses and
mixing. Emphases are given to models based on finite group family symmetries.
In particular, we describe one recent model based on SU(5), in which both the
tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing and realistic CKM matrix are generated. We also
discuss two models based on a non-anomalous U(1)_F family symmetry in which the
gauge anomalies are cancelled due to the presence of the right-handed
neutrinos. In one of these models, the seesaw scale can be as low as a TeV; in
the other model, which is based on SUSY SU(5), the U(1)_F symmetry forbids
Higgs-mediated proton decays.
