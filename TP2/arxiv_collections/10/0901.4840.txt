The expected performance of the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) in QCD and top quark measurements is discussed, with a focus on
the early data taking phase. Such processes are amongst the primary backgrounds
in the searches for new physics, and thus must be understood very well before
discoveries can be made. In addition, they serve as useful detector calibration
candles.
