A short historical review is made of charged particle production at high
energy proton synchrotrons and at pp and {p}p colliders. The review concerns
mainly low p_t processes, including diffraction processes, and fragmentation of
nuclei in nucleus-nucleus collisions. A short recollection is made of the first
studies of high p_t processes. Conclusions and perspectives follow.
