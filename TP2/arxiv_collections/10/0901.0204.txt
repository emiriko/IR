We perform a numerical analysis of Higgs-to-Higgs decays within a Type II
2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), highlighting several channels that cannot occur
in its Supersymmetric version, thereby allowing one to possibly distinguish
between these two scenarios. Our results are compliant with all available
experimental bounds from both direct and indirect Higgs searches and with
theoretical constraints from vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity.
