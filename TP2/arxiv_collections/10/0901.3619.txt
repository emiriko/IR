This article presents the formal semantics of a large subset of the C
language called Clight. Clight includes pointer arithmetic, "struct" and
"union" types, C loops and structured "switch" statements. Clight is the source
language of the CompCert verified compiler. The formal semantics of Clight is a
big-step operational semantics that observes both terminating and diverging
executions and produces traces of input/output events. The formal semantics of
Clight is mechanized using the Coq proof assistant. In addition to the
semantics of Clight, this article describes its integration in the CompCert
verified compiler and several ways by which the semantics was validated.
