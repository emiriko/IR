I present a brief summary of the main results on flavour physics beyond the
Standard Model that have been obtained in 2008 by my collaborators and myself
at the TUM. In particular I list main messages coming from our analyses of
flavour and CP-violating processes in Supersymmetry, the Littlest Higgs model
with T-Parity and a warped extra dimension model with custodial protection for
flavour violating $Z$ boson couplings.
