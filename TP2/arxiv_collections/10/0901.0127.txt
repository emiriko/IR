Two distinct types of magnetoresistance oscillations are observed in two
electronic Fabry-Perot interferometers of different sizes in the integer
quantum Hall regime. Measuring these oscillations as a function of magnetic
field and gate voltages, we observe three signatures that distinguish the two
types. The oscillations observed in a 2.0 square micron device are understood
to arise from the Coulomb blockade mechanism, and those observed in an 18
square micron device from the Aharonov-Bohm mechanism. This work clarifies,
provides ways to distinguish, and demonstrates control over, these distinct
physical origins of resistance oscillations seen in electronic Fabry-Perot
interferometers.
