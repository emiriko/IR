Using the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group
method, we numerically study the spin dynamics and transport in one-dimensional
spin-1/2 systems at zero temperature. Instead of computing transport
coefficients from linear response theory, we study the real-time evolution of
the magnetization starting from spatially inhomogeneous initial states. In
particular, we are able to analyze systems far away from equilibrium with this
set-up. By computing the time-dependence of the variance of the magnetization,
we can distinguish diffusive from ballistic regimes, depending on model
parameters. For the example of the anisotropic spin-1/2 chain and at half
filling, we find the expected ballistic behavior in the easy-plane phase, while
in the massive regime the dynamics of the magnetization is diffusive. Our
approach allows us to tune the deviation of the initial state from the ground
state and the qualitative behavior of the dynamics turns out to be valid even
for highly perturbed initial states in the case of easy-plane exchange
anisotropies. We further cover two examples of nonintegrable models, the
frustrated chain and the two-leg spin ladder, and we encounter diffusive
transport in all massive phases. In the former system, our results indicate
ballistic behavior in the critical phase. We discuss our findings in view of
experiments on quasi-one dimensional quantum magnets and we propose that the
study of the time-dependence of the spatial variance of particle densities
could be instrumental in the characterization of the expansion of ultracold
atoms in optical lattices as well.
