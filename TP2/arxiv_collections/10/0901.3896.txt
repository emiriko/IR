The role of the anti-bonding state in the electron correlations in Copper
Oxide HTSC is analyzed. Then the t-J Hamiltonian is used to establish the
formation of the charge stripes in underdoped oxides. It is proposed that these
stripes make up the boundaries between the two degenerate anti-ferromagnetic
(AFM) states, and that they are a key factor in switching between these states.
We also provide a theoretical expression for the charge driven AFM magnons that
have been observed by Neutron scattering experiments. Finally, the double
correlation theory is applied to the stripe phase of holes to result in the
superconductive gap and in the "pseudogap".
