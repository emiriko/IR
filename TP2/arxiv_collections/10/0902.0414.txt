It is widely accepted that quasars and other active galactic nuclei (AGN) are
powered by accretion of matter onto a central supermassive black hole. While
numerical simulations have demonstrated the importance of magnetic fields in
generating the turbulence believed necessary for accretion, so far they have
not produced the high mass accretion rates required to explain the most
powerful sources. We describe new global 3D simulations we are developing to
assess the importance of radiation and non-ideal MHD in generating magnetized
outflows that can enhance the overall rates of angular momentum transport and
mass accretion.
