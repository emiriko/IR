In a series of previous articles (see references) the author offered to cover
a city or other important large installations or subregions by a transparent
thin film supported by a small additional air overpressure under the form of an
AB Dome. The building of a gigantic inflatable AB Dome over an empty flat
surface is not difficult. However, if we want to cover a city, garden, forest
or other obstacle course we cannot easily deploy the thin film over building or
trees. In this article is suggested a new method which solves this problem. The
idea is to design a double film blanket filled by light gas (for example,
methane, hydrogen, or helium). Sections of this AB Blanket are lighter then air
and fly in atmosphere. They can be made on a flat area (serving as an assembly
area) and delivered by dirigible or helicopter to station at altitude over the
city. Here they connect to the already assembled AB Blanket subassemblies,
cover the city in an AB Dome and protect it from bad weather, chemical,
biological and radioactive fallout or particulates. After finish of dome
building the light gas can be changed by air.

sample computation.
