The well known refinement of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) called an
Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) is investigated in the quantum Prisoner's
Dilemma (PD) game that is played using an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen type setting.
Earlier results report that in this scheme the classical NE remains intact as
the unique solution of the quantum PD game. In contrast, we show here that
interestingly in this scheme a non-classical solution for the ESS emerges for
the quantum PD.
