The title refers to the area of research which studies infinite groups using
measure-theoretic tools, and studies the restrictions that group structure
imposes on ergodic theory of their actions. The paper is a survey of recent
developments focused on the notion of Measure Equivalence between groups, and
Orbit Equivalence between group actions. We discuss known invariants and
classification results (rigidity) in both areas.
