We report on the surprising recent discovery of strong FUV emissions in two
bright, nearby Classical Cepheids from analyses of FUSE archival observations
and one of our own approved observations just prior to the failure of the
satellite. Polaris and beta Dor are currently the only two Cepheids to have
been observed with FUSE, and beta Dor is the only one to have multiple spectra.
Both Cepheids show strong C III (977A, 1176A) and O VI (1032A, 1038A)
emissions, indicative of 50,000-500,000 K plasma, well above the photospheric
temperatures of the stars. More remarkably, beta Dor displays variability in
the FUV emission strengths which appears to be correlated to its 9.84-d
pulsation period. This phenomenon has never before been observed in Cepheids.
The FUV studies are presented along with our recent Chandra/XMM X-ray
observations of Polaris and beta Dor, in which X-ray detections were found for
both stars (as well as for the prototype Classical Cepheid, delta Cep). Further
X-ray observations have been proposed to unambiguously determine the origin and
nature of the observed high energy emissions from the targets, possibly arising
from warm winds, shocks, or pulsationally induced magnetic activity. The
initial results of this study are discussed.
