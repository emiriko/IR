We report on the first long (~32 ks) pointed XMM-Newton observation of the
supergiant fast X-ray transient IGRJ16479-4514.
  Results from the timing, spectral and spatial analysis of this observation
show that the X-ray source IGRJ16479-4514 underwent an episode of sudden
obscuration, possibly an X-ray eclipse by the supergiant companion. We also
found evidence for a soft X-ray extended halo around the source that is most
readily interpreted as due to scattering by dust along the line of sight to
IGRJ16479-4514.
