We discuss some properties of the central pi--meson carbon reactions at 40
GeV/c. While these results were obtained many years ago they have not been
explained completely. We attempt to interpret following: results regime change
on the behavior of some characteristics of the events as a function of the
centrality; anomaly peak on the angular distributions of the slow protons
emitted in these reactions; charge asymmetry on the pi--mesons production in
the back hemisphere in lcs.
  Understanding of the results could help to explain the new ones coming from
the modern central experiments at high and ultrarelativistic energies.
