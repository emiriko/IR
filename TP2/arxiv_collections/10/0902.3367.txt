High resolution spectra of 123 red giant stars in the globular cluster M13
and 64 red giant stars in M92 were obtained with Hectochelle at the MMT
telescope. Emission and line asymmetries in Halpha, and Ca K are identified,
characterizing motions in the extended atmospheres and seeking differences
attributable to metallicity in these clusters and M15. On the red giant branch,
emission in Halpha generally appears in stars with T_eff < 4500 K and log
L/L_sun > 2.75. Fainter stars showing emission are asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars or perhaps binary stars. The line-bisector for Halpha reveals the
onset of chromospheric expansion in stars more luminous than log L/L_sun ~ 2.5
in all clusters, and this outflow velocity increases with stellar luminosity.
However, the coolest giants in the metal-rich M13 show greatly reduced outflow
in Halpha most probably due to decreased T_eff and changing atmospheric
structure. The Ca K_3 outflow velocities are larger than shown by Halpha at the
same luminosity and signal accelerating outflows in the chromospheres. Stars
clearly on the AGB show faster chromospheric outflows in Halpha than RGB
objects. While the Halpha velocities on the RGB are similar for all
metallicities, the AGB stars in the metal-poor M15 and M92 have higher outflow
velocities than in the metal-rich M13. Comparison of these chromospheric line
profiles in the paired metal-poor clusters, M15 and M92 shows remarkable
similarities in the presence of emission and dynamical signatures, and does not
reveal a source of the `second-parameter' effect.
