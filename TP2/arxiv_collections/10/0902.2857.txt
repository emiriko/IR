Near-threshold production of charged boson pairs is considered within the
framework of the model of unstable particles with smeared mass. The results of
calculations are in good agreement with LEP II data and Monte-Carlo
simulations. Suggested approach significantly simplifies calculations with
respect to standard perturbative one.
