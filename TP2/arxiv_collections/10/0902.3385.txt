Long-term monitoring of the recently discovered X-ray transient, IGR
J17098-3628, by the All Sky Monitor on board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer,
has shown that it displays a long term (~163d) quasi-periodic modulation in the
data spanning its "active" state (i.e. approximately MJD 53450-54200).
Furthermore, this light-curve is not typical of "classical" soft X-ray
transients, in that J17098-3628 has remained active since its initial
discovery, and may be more akin to the pseudo-transient EXO0748-676, which is
now classified as a persistent Low Mass X-ray Binary. However, EXO0748-676
recently entered a more active phase (since approximately MJD 53050), since
when we find that it too displays a quasi-periodic modulation (~181d) in its
light-curve. This must be a "superorbital" modulation, as the orbital period of
EXO0748-676 is well established (3.8hrs), and hence we interpret both objects'
long periods as representing some intrinsic properties of the accretion disc
(such as coupled precessional and warping effects). By analogy, we therefore
suggest that IGR J17098-3628 is another member of this class of
pseudo-transient LMXBs and is likely to have a <1d orbital period.
