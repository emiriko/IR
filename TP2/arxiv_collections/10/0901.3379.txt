We define zonal polynomials of quaternion matrix argument and deduce some
important formulae of zonal polynomials and hypergeometric functions of
quaternion matrix argument. As an application, we give the distributions of the
largest and smallest eigenvalues of a quaternion central Wishart matrix
$W\sim\mathbb{Q}W(n,\Sigma)$, respectively.
