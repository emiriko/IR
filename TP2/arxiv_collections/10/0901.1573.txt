We consider motion of an overdamped Brownian particle in a washboard
potential exerted to a static tilting force. The bias yields directed net
particle motion, i.e. a current. It is demonstrated that with an additional
time-delayed feedback term the particle current can be reversed against the
direction of the bias. The control function induces a ratchet-like effect that
hinders further current reversals and thus the particle moves against the
direction of the static bias. Furthermore, varying the delay time allows also
to continuously depreciate and even stop the transport in the washboard
potential. We identify and characterize the underlying mechanism which applies
to current control in a wide temperature range.
