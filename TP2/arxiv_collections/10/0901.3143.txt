Astronomy and cosmology have embraced the internet. We routinely and
successfully use the internet as a repository for sharing code, publications
and information, and as a computational resource. However the interactive
nature of the web, for use as an alternative to downloading code has been
largely overlooked. In this article we will outline a simple framework in which
a cosmological code can be turned into an interactive web interface. This is
presented as a result of creating http://www.icosmo.org which is a front-end
for the open-source software iCosmo. We explain how an HTML page can be created
and how a cosmological code can be incorporated into a web environment using
CGI scripts. We outline how plots and downloadable text can be made, and
describe how help and documentation can be created. By using simple HTML and
CGI scripts a basic web interface for any cosmological code can be created
easily. We provide a worked example of the methods outlined, which can be used
as a simple template by any researcher who wants to share their work online.
