We present a study of active stellar forming regions in the environs of the
HII region Sh2-205. The analysis is based on data obtained from point source
catalogues and images extracted from 2MASS, MSX, and IRAS surveys.
Complementary data are taken from CO survey. The identification of primary
candidates to stellar formation activity is made following colour criteria and
the correlation with molecular gas emission.
  A number of stellar formation tracer candidates are projected on two
substructures of the HII region: SH148.83-0.67 and SH149.25-0.00. However, the
lack of molecular gas related to these structures casts doubts on the nature of
the sources. Additional infrared sources may be associated with the HI shell
centered at (l,b) = (149\degr 0\arcmin, -1\degr 30\arcmin).
  The most striking active area was found in connection to the HII region LBN
148.11-0.45, where stellar formation candidates are projected onto molecular
gas. The analytical model to the "collect and collapse" process shows that
stellar formation activity could have been triggered by the expansion of this
HII region.
