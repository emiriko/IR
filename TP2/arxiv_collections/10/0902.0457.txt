The photoevaporation of circumstellar disks is a powerful process in the disk
dissipation at the origin of the Orion proplyds. This Letter reports the first
detection of a photoevaporating disk in the final but long-lasting phase of its
evolution. The disk is associated to a low-mass T Tauri member of the sigma
Orionis Cluster. It is characterized by a very low (if any) accretion rate and
by a tenuous (Mloss ~ 10^{-9} Msun/yr) photoevaporation wind, which is
unambiguously detected in the optical spectrum of the object. The wind emits
strong forbidden lines of [SII] and [NII] because the low-mass star is close to
a powerful source of ionizing photons, the O9.5 star sigma Ori.
