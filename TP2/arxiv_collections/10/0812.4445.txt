In frameworks of scaling theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena
the structure of melt-crystallized polymers is discussed. The model constructed
follows drawing polymeric materials and dissipating the energy during the
transition from isotropic to oriented state. It is possible to estimate
temperatures of secondary relaxation transitions. The entropic parameters of
the model are: the space dimension; the number of components of an ordering
field; the polymerization degree. The Kuhn segment, the melting temperature and
the difference of energies of two rotating isomers can be regarded as energetic
parameters. The model enables to calculate a number of important structural and
dynamic physical values: the density ratio of crystalline to amorphous phase;
the thicknesses of crystalline and amorphous layers in an isotropic lamellar
material; the crystallinity degree; the fluctuation spacing due to
entanglements; the neck draw ratio; the draw ratio at break; the elastic
deformation connected with gosh-trans transitions; etc. This model is based on
the assumption that there are exist two Lifshitz points in such polymers. The
neck draw ratio characterizes an irreversible process during which the energy
dissipation is observed. It is the main difference from magnetic systems, for
example. The results obtained are in a good agreement with experimental data
including the results found for solution-crystallized polymers.
