The evidence is mounting that star formation necessarily involves planet
formation. We clearly have a vested interest in finding other Earths but a true
understanding of planet formation requires completing the census and mapping
planetary architecture in all its grandeur and diversity. Here, we show that a
2000-star survey undertaken with SIM Lite will uniquely probe planets around
B-A-F stars, bright and binary stars and white dwarfs. In addition, we show
that the high precision of SIM Lite allows us to gain unique insights into
planet formation via accurate measurements of mutual inclinations.
