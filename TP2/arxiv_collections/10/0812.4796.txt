A doubly CKM-suppressed amplitude in $B^0\to J/\psi K_S$ leads to corrections
in CP asymmetries $S = \sin 2\beta, C=0$, which may be enhanced by
long-distance rescattering. It has been suggested that this enhancement may
lead to several percent corrections. We calculate an upper bound of order
$10^{-3}$ on rescattering corrections using measured branching ratios for
charmless $|\Delta S|=1$ $B^0$ decays.
