We investigate the anisotropic triangular lattice that interpolates from
decoupled one-dimensional chains to the isotropic triangular lattice and has
been suggested to be relevant for various quasi-two-dimensional materials, such
as Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$ or $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, an organic material that
shows intriguing magnetic properties. We obtain an excellent accuracy by means
of a novel representation for the resonating valence bond wave function with
both singlet and triplet pairing. This approach allows us to establish that the
magnetic order is rapidly destroyed away from the pure triangular lattice and
incommensurate spin correlations are short range. A non-magnetic spin liquid
naturally emerges in a wide range of the phase diagram, with strong
one-dimensional character. The relevance of the triplet pairing for
$\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ is also discussed.
