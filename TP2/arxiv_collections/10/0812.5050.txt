Thermodynamic properties of dark energy are discussed assuming that dark
energy is described in terms of a selfinteracting complex scalar. We first show
that, under certain assumptions, selfinteracting complex scalar field theories
are equivalent to purely kinetic k-essence models. Then we analyze the themal
properties of k-essence and in particular we show that dark-energy in the
phantom regime does not necessarily yield negative entropy.
