We consider a general family of regularized Navier-Stokes and
Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models on n-dimensional smooth compact Riemannian
manifolds with or without boundary, with n greater than or equal to 2. This
family captures most of the specific regularized models that have been proposed
and analyzed in the literature, including the Navier-Stokes equations, the
Navier-Stokes-alpha model, the Leray-alpha model, the Modified Leray-alpha
model, the Simplified Bardina model, the Navier-Stokes-Voight model, the
Navier-Stokes-alpha-like models, and certain MHD models, in addition to
representing a larger 3-parameter family of models not previously analyzed. We
give a unified analysis of the entire three-parameter family using only
abstract mapping properties of the principle dissipation and smoothing
operators, and then use specific parameterizations to obtain the sharpest
results. We first establish existence and regularity results, and under
appropriate assumptions show uniqueness and stability. We then establish
results for singular perturbations, including the inviscid and alpha limits.
Next we show existence of a global attractor for the general model, and give
estimates for its dimension. We finish by establishing some results on
determining operators for subfamilies of dissipative and non-dissipative
models. In addition to establishing a number of results for all models in this
general family, the framework recovers most of the previous results on
existence, regularity, uniqueness, stability, attractor existence and
dimension, and determining operators for well-known members of this family.
