The description of the abundance and clustering of halos for non-Gaussian
initial conditions has recently received renewed interest, motivated by the
forthcoming large galaxy and cluster surveys, which can potentially yield
constraints of order unity on the non-Gaussianity parameter f_{NL}. We present
tests on N-body simulations of analytical formulae describing the halo
abundance and clustering for non-Gaussian initial conditions. We calibrate the
analytic non-Gaussian mass function of Matarrese et al.(2000) and LoVerde et
al.(2008) and the analytic description of clustering of halos for non-Gaussian
initial conditions on N-body simulations. We find excellent agreement between
the simulations and the analytic predictions if we make the corrections delta_c
--> delta_c X sqrt{q} and delta_c --> \delta_c X q where q ~ 0.75, in the
density threshold for gravitational collapse and in the non-Gaussian fractional
correction to the halo bias, respectively. We discuss the implications of this
correction on present and forecasted primordial non-Gaussianity constraints. We
confirm that the non-Gaussian halo bias offers a robust and highly competitive
test of primordial non-Gaussianity.
