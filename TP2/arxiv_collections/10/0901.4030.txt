We describe a classification of degree n complex coefficient polynomials with
respect to combinatorial patterns that arise from the two real algebraic curves
obtained as the zero sets for their real and imaginary part. In particular, we
work out explicitly this classification for degree 3 polynomials, and other
special families of polynomials. This work extends to the singular case similar
considerations of Martin, Savitt, and Singer for non-singular basketballs.
