We study the simplest mode-coupling equation which describes the time
correlation function of the spherical p-spin glass model. We formulate a
systematic perturbation theory near the mode-coupling transition point by
introducing multiple time scales. In this formulation, the invariance with
respect to the dilatation of time in a late stage yields an arbitrary constant
in a leading order expression of the solution. The value of this constant is
determined by a solvability condition associated with a linear singular
equation for perturbative corrections in the late stage. The solution thus
constructed provides exactly the alpha-relaxation time.
