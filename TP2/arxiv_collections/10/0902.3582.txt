An array of sixteen 1 cm^3 CdZnTe semiconductor detectors was operated at the
Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory (LNGS) to further investigate the feasibility
of double-beta decay searches with such devices. As one of the double-beta
decay experiments with the highest granularity the 4 x 4 array accumulated an
overall exposure of 18 kg days. The setup and performance of the array is
described. Half-life limits for various double-beta decay modes of Cd, Zn and
Te isotopes are obtained. No signal has been found, but several limits beyond
10^20 years have been performed. They are an order of magnitude better than
those obtained with this technology before and comparable to most other
experimental approaches for the isotopes under investigation. An improved limit
for the beta^+/EC decay of Te 120 is given.
