Measurements of the beta-decay properties of r-process nuclei below A=110
have been completed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, at
Michigan State University. Beta-decay half-lives for Y-105, Zr-106,107 and
Mo-111, along with beta-delayed neutron emission probabilities of Y-104,
Mo-109,110 and upper limits for Y-105, Zr-103,104,105,106,107 and Mo-108,111
have been measured for the first time. Studies on the basis of the quasi-random
phase approximation are used to analyze the ground-state deformation of these
nuclei.
