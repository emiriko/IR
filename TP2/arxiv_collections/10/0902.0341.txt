Entangled multi-qubit states may be generated through a dispersive collective
QND measurement of superconducting qubits coupled to a microwave transmission
line resonator. Using the quantum trajectory approach, we analyze the
stochastic measurement traces that would be observed in experiments. We
illustrate the synthesis of three-qubit W- and GHZ-states, and we analyze how
the fidelity and the entanglement evolve in time during the measurement. We
discuss the influence of decoherence and relaxation, as well as of imperfect
control over experimental parameters. We show that the desired states can be
generated on timescales much faster than the qubit decoherence rates.
