Recent combined analyses of the CMB and galaxy cluster data reveal
unexpectedly large and anisotropic peculiar velocity fields at large scales. We
study cosmic models with included vorticity, acceleration and total angular
momentum of the Universe in order to understand the phenomenon. The Zeldovich
model is used to mimic the low redshift evolution of the angular momentum.
Solving coupled evolution equations of the second kind for density-contrast in
corrected Ellis-Bruni covariant and gauge-invariant formalism one can properly
normalize and evaluate integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and peculiar velocity
field. The theoretical results compared to the observations favor a much larger
matter content of the Universe than that of the concordance model. Large-scale
flows appear anisotropic with dominant components placed in the plane
perpendicular to the axis of vorticity(rotation). The integrated Sachs-Wolfe
term has negative contribution to the CMB fluctuations for the negative
cosmological constant and it can explain the observed small power of the CMB TT
spectrum at large scales. The rate of the expansion of the Universe can be
substantially affected by the angular momentum if its magnitude is large
enough.
