We deposit droplets of nanorods dispersed in solvents on substrate surfaces
and let the solvent evaporate. We find that strong contact line pinning leads
to dense nanorod deposition inside coffee stain fringes, where we observe
large-scale lateral ordering of the nanorods with the long axis of the rods
oriented parallel to the contact line. We observe birefringence of these coffee
stain fringes by polarized microscopy and we find the direction of the
extraordinary refractive index parallel to the long axis of the nanorods.
