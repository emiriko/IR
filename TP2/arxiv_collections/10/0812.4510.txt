We study relation between T-duality and integrability. We develop the
Hamiltonian formalism for principal chiral model on general group manifold and
on its T-dual image. We calculate the Poisson bracket of Lax connections in
T-dual model and we show that they are non-local as opposite to the Poisson
brackets of Lax connection in original model. We demonstrate these calculations
on two specific examples: Sigma model on S(2) and sigma model on AdS(2).
