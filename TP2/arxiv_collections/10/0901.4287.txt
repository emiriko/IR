In this paper, the possibility of using fully stripped ions that can decay
through bound beta decay to complement electron capture long baseline neutrino
oscillation experiments is qualitatively analysed. The disadvantages of such a
source are discussed through consideration of the technological challenges
faced and the energy resolution required from the detector. It is concluded
that ions that bound beta decay cannot be used as a source of mono-energetic
anti-neutrinos in a realistic long baseline CP-even neutrino beam.
