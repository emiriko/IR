Space densities and birthrates of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) are highly
uncertain. A large range of formation rates has been derived by different
studies, which has led to contradicting ideas for the final evolutionary phases
of low and intermediate mass stars. We started a project to deduce a birthrate
using a sample of PNe within 2kpc. The central stars will be identified in the
PNe fields by their photometric colours and then used to establish improved
distance estimates. To facilitate this we have created grids of photometric
colours which are used to constrain stellar parameters. Our study has
concentrated on PNe in SDSS and the INT Photometric Halpha Survey (IPHAS) so
far. IPHAS is a nearly complete northern galactic plane survey in Halpha, r'
and i' bands. Many previously unknown PNe have been discovered with IPHAS. We
investigate implications of a more complete local sample on PN birthrate
estimates.
