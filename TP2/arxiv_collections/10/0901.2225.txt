Generation of a quasi-stationary flow of the superfluid helium normal part in
the presence of intense first- and second-sound waves is studied. Relevant
equations are obtained. The contribution to the process of energy dissipation
at the shock front layer and of fluid viscosity is analysed in detail for the
case of a second-sound wave. An estimate concerning possible experimental
observation of the process is made.
