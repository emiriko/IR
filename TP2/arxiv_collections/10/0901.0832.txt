Noise is a result of stochastic processes that originate from quantum or
classical sources. Higher-order cumulants of the probability distribution
underlying the stochastic events are believed to contain details that
characterize the correlations within a given noise source and its interaction
with the environment, but they are often difficult to measure. Here we report
measurements of the transient cumulants <<n^m>> of the number n of passed
charges to very high orders (up to m=15) for electron transport through a
quantum dot. For large m, the cumulants display striking oscillations as
functions of measurement time with magnitudes that grow factorially with m.
Using mathematical properties of high-order derivatives in the complex plane we
show that the oscillations of the cumulants in fact constitute a universal
phenomenon, appearing as functions of almost any parameter, including time in
the transient regime. These ubiquitous oscillations and the factorial growth
are system-independent and our theory provides a unified interpretation of
previous theoretical studies of high-order cumulants as well as our new
experimental data.
