Recent research has shown that distinct physical regions in the Venusian
induced magnetosphere are recognizable from the variations of strength of the
magnetic field and its wave/fluctuation activity. In this paper the statistical
properties of magnetic fluctuations are investigated in the Venusian
magnetosheath and wake regions. The main goal is to identify the characteristic
scaling features of fluctuations along Venus Express (VEX) trajectory and to
understand the specific circumstances of the occurrence of different types of
scalings. For the latter task we also use the results of measurements from the
previous missions to Venus. Our main result is that the changing character of
physical interactions between the solar wind and the planetary obstacle is
leading to different types of spectral scaling in the near-Venusian space.
Noisy fluctuations are observed in the magnetosheath, wavy structures near the
terminator and in the nightside near-planet wake. Multi-scale turbulence is
observed at the magnetosheath boundary layer and near the quasi-parallel bow
shock. Magnetosheath boundary layer turbulence is associated with an average
magnetic field which is nearly aligned with the Sun-Venus line. Noisy magnetic
fluctuations are well described with the Gaussian statistics. Both
magnetosheath boundary layer and near shock turbulence statistics exhibit
non-Gaussian features and intermittency over small spatio-temporal scales. The
occurrence of turbulence near magnetosheath boundaries can be responsible for
the local heating of plasma observed by previous missions.
