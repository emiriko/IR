Proximity effect systems in superconducting films can be modeled by a
one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. Several systems are studied using
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. It is observed that the two boundary
conditions have a dramatic effect on the lowest eigenstate allowed in these
systems, and points to unusual behavior for solutions of Schr\"odinger's
equation in certain potential wells and proximity effect systems.
