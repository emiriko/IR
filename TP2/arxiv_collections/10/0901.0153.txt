We investigate classical scattering off a harmonically oscillating target in
two spatial dimensions. The shape of the scatterer is assumed to have a
boundary which is locally convex at any point and does not support the presence
of any periodic orbits in the corresponding dynamics. As a simple example we
consider the scattering of a beam of non-interacting particles off a circular
hard scatterer. The performed analysis is focused on experimentally accessible
quantities, characterizing the system, like the differential cross sections in
the outgoing angle and velocity. Despite the absence of periodic orbits and
their manifolds in the dynamics, we show that the cross sections acquire rich
and multiple structure when the velocity of the particles in the beam becomes
of the same order of magnitude as the maximum velocity of the oscillating
target. The underlying dynamical pattern is uniquely determined by the phase of
the first collision between the beam particles and the scatterer and possesses
a universal profile, dictated by the manifolds of the parabolic orbits, which
can be understood both qualitatively as well as quantitatively in terms of
scattering off a hard wall. We discuss also the inverse problem concerning the
possibility to extract properties of the oscillating target from the
differential cross sections.
