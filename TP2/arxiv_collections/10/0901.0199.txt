Motivated by the gluon-chain model of flux tube formation, we compute and
diagonalize the transfer matrix in lattice SU(2) gauge theory for states
containing heavy static quark-antiquark sources, with separations up to one
fermi. The elements of the transfer matrix are calculated by variational Monte
Carlo methods, in a basis of states obtained by acting on the vacuum state with
zero, one, and two-gluon operators in Coulomb gauge. The color Coulomb
potential is obtained from the zero gluon to zero gluon element of the transfer
matrix, and it is well-known that while this potential is asymptotically
linear, it has a slope which is two to three times larger than the standard
asymptotic string tension. We show that the addition of one and two gluon
states results in a potential which is still linear, but the disagreement with
the standard asymptotic string tension is reduced to 38% at the largest lattice
coupling we have studied.
