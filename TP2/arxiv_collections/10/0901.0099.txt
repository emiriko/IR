A detailed analysis of the classical nonlinear dynamics of a single driven
square potential barrier with harmonically oscillating position is performed.
The system exhibits dynamical trapping which is associated with the existence
of a stable island in phase space. Due to the unstable periodic orbits of the
KAM-structure, the driven barrier is a chaotic scatterer and shows stickiness
of scattering trajectories in the vicinity of the stable island. The
transmission function of a suitably prepared ensemble yields results which are
very similar to tunneling resonances in the quantum mechanical regime. However,
the origin of these resonances is different in the classical regime.
