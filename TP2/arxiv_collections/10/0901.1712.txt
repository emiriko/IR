We analyse aspects of symmetry breaking for Moyal spacetimes within a
quantisation scheme which preserves the twisted Poincar\'e symmetry. Towards
this purpose, we develop the LSZ approach for Moyal spacetimes. The latter
gives a formula for scattering amplitudes on these spacetimes which can be
obtained from the corresponding ones on the commutative spacetime. This formula
applies in the presence of spontaneous breakdown of symmetries as well.We also
derive Goldstone's theorem on Moyal spacetime. The formalism developed here can
be directly applied to the twisted standard model.
