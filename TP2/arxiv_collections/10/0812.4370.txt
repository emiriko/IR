The entropic form $S_q$ is, for any $q \neq 1$, {\it nonadditive}. Indeed,
for two probabilistically independent subsystems, it satisfies
$S_q(A+B)/k=[S_q(A)/k]+[S_q(B)/k]+(1-q)[S_q(A)/k][S_q(B)/k] \ne
S_q(A)/k+S_q(B)/k$. This form will turn out to be {\it extensive} for an
important class of nonlocal correlations, if $q$ is set equal to a special
value different from unity, noted $q_{ent}$ (where $ent$ stands for $entropy$).
In other words, for such systems, we verify that $S_{q_{ent}}(N) \propto N
(N>>1)$, thus legitimating the use of the classical thermodynamical relations.
Standard systems, for which $S_{BG}$ is extensive, obviously correspond to
$q_{ent}=1$. Quite complex systems exist in the sense that, for them, no value
of $q$ exists such that $S_q$ is extensive. Such systems are out of the present
scope: they might need forms of entropy different from $S_q$, or perhaps --
more plainly -- they are just not susceptible at all for some sort of
thermostatistical approach. Consistently with the results associated with
$S_q$, the $q$-generalizations of the Central Limit Theorem and of its extended
L\'evy-Gnedenko form have been achieved. These recent theorems could of course
be the cause of the ubiquity of $q$-exponentials, $q$-Gaussians and related
mathematical forms in natural, artificial and social systems. All of the above,
as well as presently available experimental, observational and computational
confirmations -- in high energy physics and elsewhere --, are briefly reviewed.
Finally, we address a confusion which is quite common in the literature, namely
referring to distinct physical mechanisms {\it versus} distinct regimes of a
single physical mechanism.
