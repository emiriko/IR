Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based time-scale and multi-fractal
analyses have been carried out on the anode glow related nonlinear floating
potential fluctuations in a hollow cathode glow discharge plasma. CWT has been
used to obtain the contour and ridge plots. Scale shift (or inversely frequency
shift) which is a typical nonlinear behaviour, has been detected from the
undulating contours. From the ridge plots, we have identified the presence of
nonlinearity and degree of chaoticity. Using the wavelet transform modulus
maxima technique we have obtained the multi-fractal spectrum for the
fluctuations at different discharge voltages and the spectrum was observed to
become a monofractal for periodic signals. These multi-fractal spectra were
also used to estimate different quantities like the correlation and fractal
dimension, degree of multi-fractality and complexity parameters. These
estimations have been found to be consistent with the nonlinear time series
analysis.
