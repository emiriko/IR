Energy positions of pure magnetic transitions in Mossbauer Spectroscopy are
calculated using non-extensive approach. It is observed that these new
calculated energy positions so obtained, may have strong overlap with those
energy positions obtained from combined effect of magnetic and quadrupole
interactions using standard statistical physics.
