We show that growing neutrino models, in which the growing neutrino mass
stops the dynamical evolution of a dark energy scalar field, lead to a
substantial neutrino clustering on the scales of superclusters. Nonlinear
neutrino lumps form at redshift z ~ 1 and could partially drag the clustering
of dark matter. If observed, large scale non-linear structures could be an
indication for a new attractive force stronger than gravity and mediated by the
'cosmon' dark energy scalar field.
