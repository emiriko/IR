Random matrix theory (RMT) is based on two assumptions: (1) matrix-element
independence, and (2) base invariance. Most of the proposed generalizations
keep the first assumption and violate the second. Recently, several authors
presented other versions of the theory that keep base invariance on the expense
of allowing correlations between matrix elements. This is achieved by starting
from non-extensive entropies rather than the standard Shannon entropy, or
following the basic prescription of the recently suggested concept of
superstatistics. We review these generalizations of RMT and illustrate their
value by calculating the nearest-neighbor-spacing distributions and comparing
the results of calculation with experiments and numerical-experiments on
systems in transition from order to chaos.
