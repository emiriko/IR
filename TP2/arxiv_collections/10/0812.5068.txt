We extend our recent work with K. Zumbrun on long-time stability of
multi-dimensional noncharacteristic viscous boundary layers of a class of
symmetrizable hyperbolic-parabolic systems. Our main improvements are (i) to
establish the stability for a larger class of systems in dimensions $d\ge 2$,
yielding the result for certain magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) layers; (ii) to drop
a technical assumption on the so--called glancing set which was required in
previous works. We also provide a different proof of low-frequency estimates by
employing the method of Kreiss' symmetrizers, replacing the one relying on
detailed derivation of pointwise bounds on the resolvent kernel.
