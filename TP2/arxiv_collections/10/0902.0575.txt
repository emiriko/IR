We discuss twisted covariance over the noncommutative spacetime algebra
generated by the relations [q_theta^mu,q_theta^nu]=i theta^{mu nu}, where the
matrix theta is treated as fixed (not a tensor), and we refrain from using the
asymptotic Moyal expansion of the twists. We show that the tensor nature of
theta is only hidden in the formalism: in particular if theta fulfils the DFR
conditions, the twisted Lorentz covariant model of the flat quantum spacetime
may be equivalently described in terms of the DFR model, if we agree to discard
a huge non invariant set of localisation states; it is only this last step
which, if taken as a basic assumption, severely breaks the relativity
principle. We also will show that the above mentioned, relativity breaking, ad
hoc rejection of localisation states is an independent, unnecessary assumption,
as far as some popular approaches to quantum field theory on the quantum
Minkowski spacetime are concerned. The above should raise some concerns about
speculations on possible observable consequences of arbitrary choices of theta
in arbitrarily selected privileged frames.
