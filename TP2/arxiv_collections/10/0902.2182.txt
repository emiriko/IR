For systems in an externally controllable time-dependent potential, the
optimal protocol minimizes the mean work spent in a finite-time transition
between given initial and final values of a control parameter. For an initially
thermalized ensemble, we consider both Hamiltonian evolution for classical
systems and Schr\"odinger evolution for quantum systems. In both cases, we show
that for harmonic potentials, the optimal work is given by the adiabatic work
even in the limit of short transition times. This result is counter-intuitive
because the adiabatic work is substantially smaller than the work for an
instantaneous jump. We also perform numerical calculations of the optimal
protocol for Hamiltonian dynamics in an anharmonic quartic potential. For a
two-level spin system, we give examples where the adiabatic work can be reached
in either a finite or an arbitrarily short transition time depending on the
allowed parameter space.
