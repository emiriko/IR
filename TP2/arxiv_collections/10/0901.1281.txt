We investigate the scattering cross section of aligned dipolar molecules in
low-temperature gases. Over a wide range of collision energies relevant to
contemporary experiments, the cross section declines in inverse proportion to
the collision speed, and is given nearly exactly by a simple semiclassical
formula. At yet lower energies, the cross section becomes independent of
energy, and is reproduced within the Born approximation to within corrections
due to the s-wave scattering length. While these behaviors are universal for
all polar molecules, nevertheless interesting deviations from universality are
expected to occur in the intermediate energy range.
