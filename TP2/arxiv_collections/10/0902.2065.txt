We investigate the problem of wealth distribution from the viewpoint of asset
exchange. Robust nature of Pareto's law across economies, ideologies and
nations suggests that this could be an outcome of trading strategies. However,
the simple asset exchange models fail to reproduce this feature. A yardsale(YS)
model in which amount put on the bet is a fraction of minimum of the two
players leads to condensation of wealth in hands of some agent while theft and
fraud(TF) model in which the amount to be exchanged is a fraction of loser's
wealth leads to an exponential distribution of wealth. We show that if we allow
few agents to follow a different model than others, {\it i.e.} there are some
agents following TF model while rest follow YS model, it leads to distribution
with power law tails. Similar effect is observed when one carries out
transactions for a fraction of one's wealth using TF model and for the rest YS
model is used. We also observe a power law tail in wealth distribution if we
allow the agents to follow either of the models with some probability.
