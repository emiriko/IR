In this article, we propose an automatic process to build multi-lingual
lexico-semantic resources. The goal of these resources is to browse
semantically textual information contained in texts of different languages.
This method uses a mathematical model called Atlas s\'emantiques in order to
represent the different senses of each word. It uses the linguistic relations
between words to create graphs that are projected into a semantic space. These
projections constitute semantic maps that denote the sense trends of each given
word. This model is fed with syntactic relations between words extracted from a
corpus. Therefore, the lexico-semantic resource produced describes all the
words and all their meanings observed in the corpus. The sense trends are
expressed by syntactic contexts, typical for a given meaning. The link between
each sense trend and the utterances used to build the sense trend are also
stored in an index. Thus all the instances of a word in a particular sense are
linked and can be browsed easily. And by using several corpora of different
languages, several resources are built that correspond with each other through
languages. It makes it possible to browse information through languages thanks
to syntactic contexts translations (even if some of them are partial).
