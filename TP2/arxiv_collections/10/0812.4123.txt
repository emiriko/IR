As the concentration of intrinsic defects becomes sufficiently high in
O-deficient ZnO, interactions between defects lead to a significant reduction
in their formation energies. We show that the formation of both O-vacancies and
Zn-interstitials becomes significantly enhanced by a strong attractive
interaction between them, making these defects an important source of n-type
conductivity in ZnO.
