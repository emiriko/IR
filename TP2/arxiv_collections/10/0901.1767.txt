We characterize the flickering observed in the optical lightcurve of the
Intermediate Polar system V709 Cas by determining its position in the
alpha-Sigma as in the Fritz and Bruch (1998) classification scheme. Sigma
represents the strength of flickering at a given timescale, while alpha
describes the energy distribution of the flickering at different time scales.
Here alpha is independently obtained with both the wavelets and the Hurst R/S
analysis. The flickering shows self-similarity in the time scale ranging from
tens of minutes down to 10 seconds with stochastic persistent memory in time.
alpha and Sigma appear anticorrelated. In the alpha-Sigma diagram V709 Cas
falls in the region of magnetic systems. Since V709 Cas shows the spin period
of the magnetic WD only in the X-ray but not in the optical, we conclude that
this method can be used to characterize CV subtypes especially when their
classification is uncertain.
