We study the UV properties of Type I AGN from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey that
have been selected to show unusually soft X-ray continua. We examine a sample
of 54 Seyfert 1 galaxies with detections in both Near-UV and Far-UV bands of
the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite. Our sample is systematically
fainter in the UV than galaxies studied in similar work by previous authors. We
look for correlations between their UV and X-ray properties as well as
correlations of these properties with either black hole mass or Eddington
ratio. The shape of the Big Blue Bump(BBB) in the GALEX regime does not appear
to correlate with its strength relative to the power law continuum, which
conflicts with results reported by previous authors. The strength of the BBB is
correlated with the shape of the X-ray continuum, in agreement with previous
work, but the slope of the correlation is different than previously reported.
The properties of the accretion disks of Type I AGN in the GALEX regime are
relatively independent of black hole mass and Eddington ratio. We compare our
measurements to the predictions of alternative theories for the origin of the
soft excess, but we are unable to distinguish between Comptonization of BBB
photons by a hot plasma and absorption in relativistic winds as the most likely
origins for the soft X-ray excess.
