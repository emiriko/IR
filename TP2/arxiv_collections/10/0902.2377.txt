We show that backward-forward elliptic anisotropy correlation provides an
experimentally accessible observable which distinguishes between collective and
non-collective contributions to the observed elliptic anisotropy $v_2$ in
relativistic heavy ion collisions. The measurement of this observable will
reveal the momentum scale at which collective expansion seizes and where the
elliptic anisotropy is dominated by (semi)-hard processes.
