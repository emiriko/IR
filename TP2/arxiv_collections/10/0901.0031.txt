We have analyzed 866 RXTE observations of the 2006-2007 outburst of the
accreting neutron star XTE J1701-462, during which the source evolves from
super-Eddington luminosities to quiescence. The X-ray color evolution first
resembles the Cyg X-2 subgroup of Z sources, with frequent excursions on the
horizontal and normal branches (HB/NB). The source then decays and evolves to
the Sco X-1 subgroup, with increasing focus on the flaring branch (FB) and the
lower vertex of the "Z". Finally, the FB subsides, and the source transforms
into an atoll source, with the lower vertex evolving to the atoll soft state.
Spectral analyses suggest that the atoll stage is characterized by a constant
inner disk radius, while the Z stages exhibit a luminosity-dependent expansion
of the inner disk, which we interpret as effects related to the local Eddington
limit. Contrary to the view that the mass accretion rate ($\dot{m}$) changes
along the Z, we find that changes in $\dot{m}$ are instead responsible for the
secular evolution of the Z and the subclasses. Motion along the Z branches
appears to be caused by three different mechanisms that may operate at roughly
constant $\dot{m}$. For the Sco X-1-like Z stage, we find that the FB is an
instability track that proceeds off the lower vertex when the inner disk radius
shrinks from the value set by the X-ray luminosity toward the value measured
for the atoll soft state. Excursions up the NB occur when the apparent size of
the boundary layer increases while the disk exhibits little change. The HB is
associated with Comptonization of the disk emission. The Z branches for the Cyg
X-2-like stage are more complicated, and their origin is unclear. Finally, our
spectral results lead us to hypothesize that the lower and upper Z vertices
correspond to a standard thin disk and a slim disk, respectively.
