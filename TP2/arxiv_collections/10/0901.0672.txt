We discuss the role of the geometrical phase in predissociation dynamics of
vibrational states near a conical intersection of two electronic potential
surfaces of a D_{3h} molecule. For quantitative description of the
predissociation driven by the coupling near a conical intersection, we
developed a method for calculating lifetimes and positions of vibrational
predissociated states (Feshbach resonances) for X_3 molecule. The method takes
into account the two coupled three-body potential energy surfaces, which are
degenerate at the intersection. As an example, we apply the method to obtain
lifetimes and positions of resonances of predissociated vibrational levels of
the 2^2 A' electronic state of the H_3 molecule. The three-body recombination
rate coefficient for the H+H+H -> H_2+H process is estimated.
