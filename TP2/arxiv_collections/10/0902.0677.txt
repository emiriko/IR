The alpha-decay half-lives and the alpha-capture cross-sections are evaluated
in the framework of unified model for alpha-decay and alpha-capture. In the
framework of this model the alpha-decay and alpha-capture are considered as
penetration of the alpha-particle through the potential barrier formed by
nuclear, Coulomb and centrifugal interactions between alpha-particle and
nucleus. The spins and the parities of parent and daughter nuclei as well as
the quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations of daughter nuclei are taken into
account for evaluation of the alpha-decay half-lives. The alpha-decay
half-lives for 344 nuclei and the alpha-capture cross-sections of 40Ca, 44Ca,
59Co, 208Pb and 209Bi agree well with the experimental data. The evaluated
alpha-decay half-lives within the range 10^{-9} <T_{1/2} < 10^38 s for 1246
alpha-emitters are tabulated.
