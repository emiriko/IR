In the context of current and future microwave surveys mainly dedicated to
the accurate mapping of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), mm and sub-mm
emissions from Solar System will represent a potential source of contamination
as well as an opportunity for new Solar System studies. In particular, the
forthcoming ESA Planck mission will be able to observe the point-like thermal
emission from planets and some large asteroids as well as the diffused Zodiacal
Light Emission (ZLE). After a brief introduction to the field, we focus on the
identification of Solar System discrete objects in the Planck time ordered
data.
