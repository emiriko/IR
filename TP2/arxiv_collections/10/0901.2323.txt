We revisit the question of nature of odd-frequency superconductors, first
proposed by Berezinskii in 1974. \cite{berezinskii1974} We start with the
notion that order parameter of odd-frequency superconductors can be thought of
as a time derivative of the odd-time pairing operator. It leads to the notion
of the composite boson condensate.\cite{abrahams1995} To elucidate the nature
of broken symmetry state in odd-frequency superconductors, we consider a wave
function that properly captures the coherent condensate of composite charge
$2e$ bosons in an odd-frequency superconductor. We consider the Hamiltonian
which describes the equal-time composite boson condensation as proposed earlier
in Phys. Rev. B $\textbf{52}$, 1271 (1995). We propose a BCS-like wave function
that describes a composite condensate comprised of a spin-0 Cooper pair and a
spin-1 magnon excitation. We derive the quasiparticle dispersion, the
self-consistent equation for the order parameter and the density of states. We
show that the coherent wave function approach recovers all the known
proposerties of odd-frequency superconductors: the quasi-particle excitations
are gapless and the superconducting transition requires a critical coupling.
