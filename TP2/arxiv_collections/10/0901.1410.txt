The ground state of the Hubbard model is studied within the constrained
Hilbert space where no order parameter exists. The self-energy of electrons is
decomposed into the single-site and multisite self-energies. The calculation of
the single-site self-energy is mapped to a problem of self-consistently
determining and solving the Anderson model. When an electron reservoir is
explicitly considered, it is proved that the single-site self-energy is that of
a normal Fermi liquid even if the multisite self-energy is anomalous. Thus, the
ground state is a normal Fermi liquid in the supreme single-site approximation
(S^3A). In the strong-coupling regime, the Fermi liquid is stabilized by the
Kondo effect in the S^3A and is further stabilized by the Fock-type term of the
superexchange interaction or the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) mechanism beyond
the S^3A. The stabilized Fermi liquid is frustrated as much as an RVB spin
liquid in the Heisenberg model. It is a relevant unperturbed state that can be
used to study a normal or anomalous Fermi liquid and an ordered state in the
whole Hilbert space by Kondo lattice theory. Even if higher-order multisite
terms than the Fock-type term are considered, the ground state cannot be a Mott
insulator. It can be merely a gapless semiconductor even if the multisite
self-energy is so anomalous that it is divergent at the chemical potential. A
Mott insulator is only possible as a high temperature phase.
