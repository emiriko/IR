Three-body correlations for the ground-state decay of the lightest two-proton
emitter $^{6}$Be are studied both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical
studies are performed in a three-body hyperspherical-harmonics cluster model.
In the experimental studies, the ground state of $^{6}$Be was formed following
the $\alpha$ decay of a $^{10}$C beam inelastically excited through
interactions with Be and C targets. Excellent agreement between theory and
experiment is obtained demonstrating the existence of complicated correlation
patterns which can elucidate the structure of $^{6}$Be and, possibly, of the
A=6 isobar.
