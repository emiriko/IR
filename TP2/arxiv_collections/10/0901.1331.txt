We investigate magnetic excitations in the spin-ladder compound
Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ using high-resolution Cu $L_3$-edge Resonant
Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS). Our findings demonstrate that RIXS couples
to collective spin excitations from a quantum spin-liquid ground state. In
contrast to Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS), the RIXS cross section changes
only moderately over the entire Brillouin Zone (BZ), revealing a high
sensitivity also at small momentum transfers. The two-triplon energy gap is
found to be $100\pm 30$ meV. Our results are supported by calculations within
an effective Hubbard model for a finite-size cluster.
