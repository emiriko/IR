We discuss the supersymmetric CP problem that arises when the sfermion soft
mass universality is modified. We place the 3rd generation SU(5) ten-plet
sfermion masses in the weak scale in view of the naturalness. The other
sfermion masses are assumed to be universal and a TeV scale in order to weaken
the flavor changing neutral current processes and electric dipole moment (EDM)
constraints. However this modification generically induces too large up quark
chromo-EDM (CEDM) via the weak scale stop loop. In order to suppress this CEDM,
we propose certain type of flavor structure where the parameters of the
up-(s)quark sector are real whereas those of the down-(s)quark and the charged
(s)lepton sectors are complex at the GUT scale. It is shown that, in this set
up, up quark CEDM can be suppressed within the range where the current and
future experiments have their sensitivity. We briefly illustrate the simple
realization of these particular forms of the modified sfermion universality
with real up-(s)quark sector by spontaneous CP violation in E$_6$ SUSY GUT with
SU(2) flavor symmetry.
