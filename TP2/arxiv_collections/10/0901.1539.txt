We study connected Wightman functions of $N$ conserved currents, each of
which is formed from a scalar field and has even spin $l_{i}$. The UV
divergence of this vertex function is regularized by the analytic continuation
in the space dimension $D\longrightarrow D-\epsilon$. We evaluate the residue
of $\epsilon ^{-1}$ only, which is a local interaction Lagrangian density and
gauge invariant in linear
