We update our understanding of nonlinear Schrodinger equations motivated
through information theory. In particular we show that a $q-$deformation of the
basic nonlinear equation leads to a perturbative increase in the energy of a
system, thus favouring the simplest $q=1$ case. Furthermore the energy
minimisation criterion is shown to be equivalent, at leading order, to an
uncertainty maximisation argument. The special value $\eta =1/4$ for the
interpolation parameter, where leading order energy shifts vanish, implies the
preservation of existing supersymmetry in nonlinearised supersymmetric quantum
mechanics. Physically, $\eta$ might be encoding relativistic effects.
