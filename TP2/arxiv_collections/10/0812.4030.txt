We provide a representation for the scaling limit of the d=2 critical Ising
magnetization field as a (conformal) random field using SLE (Schramm-Loewner
Evolution) clusters and associated renormalized area measures. The renormalized
areas are from the scaling limit of the critical FK (Fortuin-Kasteleyn)
clusters and the random field is a convergent sum of the area measures with
random signs. Extensions to off-critical scaling limits, to d=3 and to Potts
models are also considered.
