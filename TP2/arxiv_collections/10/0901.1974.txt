The work presented in this paper essentially focuses at providing a
scientific theory to explain the growth of information bearing molecules (size
and information contents) without the need of any enzymatic system. It infers
the footprints of molecular evolution in the cell interior for a property
common to all life forms. It is deducted that molecular crowding is a vital
cellular trait common to the all types of cells (primitive or highly evolved).
It is argued that this trait is pervasive and must have been incorporated at
some stage as a common vital feature of life. If this feature has central
importance it must have been part of the pre-biotic information growth of
information bearing molecules. The thermodynamic consequences of molecular
crowding on the growth of RNA (50-100bp long) in the absence of enzyme system
were calculated.
