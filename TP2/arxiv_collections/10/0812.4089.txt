Strongly coupled semi-direct gauge mediation models of supersymmetry breaking
through massive mediators with standard model charges are investigated by means
of composite degrees of freedom. Sizable mediation is realized to generate the
standard model gaugino masses for a small mediator mass without breaking the
standard model symmetries.
