In this article we prove the property of unique continuation (also known for
C^\infty functions as quasianalyticity) for solutions of the differential
inequality |\Delta u| \leq |Vu| for V from a wide class of potentials
(including L^{d/2,\infty}_{\loc}(R^d) class) and u in a space of solutions Y_V
containing all eigenfunctions of the corresponding self-adjoint Schr\"odinger
operator.
  Motivating question: is it true that for potentials V, for which self-adjoint
Schr\"odinger operator is well defined, the property of unique continuation
holds?
