The main task of an introductory laboratory course is to foster students'
manual, conceptual and statistical ability to investigate physical phenomena.
Needing very simple apparatus, pendulum experiments are an ideal starting point
in our first-year laboratory course because they are rich in both physical
content and data processing. These experiments allow many variations, e.g.
pendulum bobs can have different shapes, threads can be tied to a hook at their
edge or pass through their centre of mass, they can be hanged as simple or
bifilar pendulums. In these many variations, they emphasize the difference
between theory and practice in the passage from an idealized scheme to a real
experimental asset, which becomes evident, for example, when the pendulum bob
cannot be considered an idealized point mass. Moreover, they require careful
observation of details such as the type of thread used and its rigidity or the
bob initial slant, which leads to different behaviors. Their mathematical
models require a wide range of fundamental topics in experimental data
analysis: arithmetic and weighted mean, standard deviation, central limit
theorem application, data distribution, and the significant difference between
theory and practice. Setting the mass-spring experiment immediately after the
pendulum highlights the question of resonance, revises the gap between theory
and practice in another context, and provides another occasion to practice
further techniques in data analysis.
