We derive a unique continuation theorem for the vacuum Einstein equations.
Our method of proof utilizes Carleman estimates (most importantly one obtained
recently by Ionescu and Klainerman), but also relies strongly on certain
geometric gauge constructions which make it possible to address this problem
via such estimates. We indicate how our method can be used more broadly to
derive unique continuation for Einstein's equations from Carleman estimates for
the wave operator.
