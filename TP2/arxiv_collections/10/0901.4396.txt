We give an overview of the experimental measurements and the theoretical
understanding of the branching fractions and CP-violating asymmetries of
charmless B-meson decays. Most experimetal results are from the BABAR and Belle
experiments during the past decade. The global features of these experimental
results are typically well described by the QCD-motivated theories such as QCD
factorization, pQCD and soft-collinear effective theory. The agreement between
theory and experiment is generally satisfactory, though there remain some
unsolved puzzles that pose a great challenge to both theorists and
experimentalists.
