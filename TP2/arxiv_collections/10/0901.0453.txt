Recently, charge radii and ground-state electromagnetic moments of Li and Be
isotopes were measured precisely. We have performed large-scale ab initio
no-core shell model calculations for these isotopes using high-precision
nucleon-nucleon potentials. The isotopic trends of our computed charge radii
and quadrupole and magnetic-dipole moments are in good agreement with
experimental results with the exception of the 11Li charge radius. The magnetic
moments are in particular well described, whereas the absolute magnitudes of
the quadrupole moments are about 10% too small. The small magnitude of the 6Li
quadrupole moment is reproduced, and with the CD-Bonn NN potential, also its
correct sign.
