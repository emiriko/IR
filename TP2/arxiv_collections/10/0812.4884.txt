The effect of fractal clusters on magnetic and transport properties of
percolative superconductors is studied. The superconductor contains percolative
superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters of a normal
phase. It is found that normal phase clusters have essential fractal features.
The fractal dimension of the boundary of normal phase clusters is estimated.
The current-voltage characteristics of superconductors containing fractal
clusters are obtained. It is found that the fractality of the cluster boundary
intensifies pinning. This feature permits to enhance the current-carrying
capability of the superconductors.
