We show the existence of an isolated soliton excitation over the topological
ground state configuration in chiral helimagnet with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moryia
exchange and the strong easy-plane anisotropy. The magnetic field perpendicular
to the helical axis stabilizes the kink crystal state which plays a role of
"topological protectorate" for the traveling soliton with a definite
handedness. To find new soliton solution, we use the B\"{a}cklund
transformation technique. It is pointed out that the traveling soliton carries
the magnon density and a magnetic solition transport may be realized.
