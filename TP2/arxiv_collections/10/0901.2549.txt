We demonstrate an optical bottle beam trap created by interfering two
fundamental Gaussian beams with different waists. The beams are derived from a
single laser source using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer whose arms have unequal
magnifications. Destructive interference of the two beams from the Mach-Zehnder
leads to a three dimensional intensity null at the mutual focus of the beams.
We demonstrate trapping of cold Cesium atoms in a blue detuned bottle beam
trap.
