We study systems with a continuous phase transition that tune their
parameters to maximize a quantity that diverges solely at a unique critical
point. Varying the size of these systems with dynamically adjusting parameters,
the same finite-size scaling is observed as in systems where all relevant
parameters are fixed at their critical values. This scheme is studied using a
self-tuning variant of the Ising model. It is contrasted with a scheme where
systems approach criticality through a target value for the order parameter
that vanishes with increasing system size. In the former scheme, the universal
exponents are observed in naive finite-size scaling studies, whereas in the
latter they are not.
