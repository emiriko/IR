Relying on the magnetic dipole model of the pulsar, we use the extension of
the work of Haxton-Ruffini [31] for single charges by DePaolis-Ingrosso-Qadir
[32] for an obliquely rotating magnetic dipole, to incorporate the effect of
the gravitational mass. So, by using the numerical and analytical solutions of
the differential equation for the radiation, we construct the energy spectra
for different masses of the dipole-NS. These spectra show that, in relatively
low angular momentum l, the effect of the gravitational mass is very
significant in suppressing the relativistic enhancement factor, which had been
found [27, 28, 32], by two to three orders of magnitude, as the mass changes
from 0.5 solar mass to 3 solar masses. It is an indication that most of the
angular momentum of the NS is retained as rotational kinetic energy instead of
being radiated as an electromagnetic energy. Also, the suppressing in radiation
energy is more or less independent of the angular momentum, and the high
rotational velocity. We also found that electromagnetic energy is proportional
to square of sin(inclination angle the obliquity) which is similar to the
classical behavior. However, in the very high angular momentum, the whole
radiation suppresses and the effect of mass is neglected. It indicates that the
(special) relativistic enhancement expected is lost to the (general)
relativistic increase of angular momentum after incorporating the effect of
mass.
