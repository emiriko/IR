We analyze the static and spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of
Einstein field equations inspired by the non commutative geometry. In the
framework of the non commutative geometry this solution is interpreted as a
mini black hole which has the Schwarzschild geometry outside the event horizon,
but whose standard central singularity is replaced by a self-gravitating
droplet. The energy-momentum tensor of the droplet is of the anisotropic fluid
obeying a nonlocal equation of state. The radius of the droplet is finite and
the pressure, which gives rise to the hydrostatic equilibrium, is positive
definite in the interior.
