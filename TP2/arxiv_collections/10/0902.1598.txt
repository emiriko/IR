An extension of the RINAR(1) process for modelling discrete-time dependent
counting processes is considered. The model RINAR(p) investigated here is a
direct and natural extension of the real AR(p) model. Compared to classical
INAR(p) models based on the thinning operator, the new models have several
advantages: simple innovation structure ; autoregressive coefficients with
arbitrary signs ; possible negative values for time series ; possible negative
values for the autocorrelation function. The conditions for the stationarity
and ergodicity, of the RINAR(p) model, are given. For parameter estimation, we
consider the least squares estimator and we prove its consistency under
suitable identifiability condition. Simulation experiments as well as analysis
of real data sets are carried out to assess the performance of the model.
