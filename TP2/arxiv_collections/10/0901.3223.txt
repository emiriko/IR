We reveal and observe experimentally significant modifications undertaken by
discrete solitons in waveguide lattices upon the continuous transformation of
the lattice structure from one-dimensional to two-dimensional. Light evolution
and soliton excitation in arrays with a gradually increasing number of rows are
investigated, yielding solitons with an effective reduced dimensionality
residing at the edge and in the bulk of the lattice.
