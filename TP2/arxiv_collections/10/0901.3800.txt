We report on the spin textures produced by cooling unmagnetized $^{87}$Rb F=1
spinor gases into the regime of quantum degeneracy. At low temperatures,
magnetized textures form that break translational symmetry and display
short-range periodic magnetic order characterized by one- or two-dimensional
spatial modulations with wavelengths much smaller than the extent of the
quasi-two-dimensional degenerate gas. Spin textures produced upon cooling spin
mixtures with a non-zero initial magnetic quadrupole moment also show
ferromagnetic order that, at low temperature, coexists with the spatially
modulated structure.
