We report on the temperature dependence of microwave-induced resistance
oscillations in high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems. We find that
the oscillation amplitude decays exponentially with increasing temperature, as
$\exp(-\alpha T^2)$, where $\alpha$ scales with the inverse magnetic field.
This observation indicates that the temperature dependence originates primarily
from the modification of the single particle lifetime, which we attribute to
electron-electron interaction effects.
