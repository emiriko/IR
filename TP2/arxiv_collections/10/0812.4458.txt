A measurement of the $\bjet$ production cross section is presented for events
containing a $Z$ boson produced in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$
TeV, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb$^{-1}$
collected by the CDF II detector at the Tevatron. $Z$ bosons are selected in
the electron and muon decay modes. Jets are considered with transverse energy
$E_T>20$ GeV and pseudorapidity $|\eta|<1.5$ and are identified as $\bjets$
using a secondary vertex algorithm. The ratio of the integrated $Z+\bjet$ cross
section to the inclusive $Z$ production cross section is measured to be $3.32
\pm 0.53 {\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.42 {\rm (syst.)}\times 10^{-3}$. This ratio is
also measured differentially in jet $E_T$, jet $\eta$, $Z$-boson transverse
momentum, number of jets, and number of $\bjets$. The predictions from leading
order Monte Carlo generators and next-to-leading-order QCD calculations are
found to be consistent with the measurements within experimental and
theoretical uncertainties.
