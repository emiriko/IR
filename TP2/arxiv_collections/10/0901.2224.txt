We describe a new approach to data modeling, called the concept-oriented
model (COM), and a novel concept-oriented query language (COQL). The model is
based on three principles: duality principle postulates that any element is a
couple consisting of one identity and one entity, inclusion principle
postulates that any element has a super-element, and order principle assumes
that any element has a number of greater elements within a partially ordered
set. Concept-oriented query language is based on a new data modeling construct,
called concept, inclusion relation between concepts, and concept partial
ordering in which greater concepts are represented by their field types. It is
demonstrated how COM and COQL can be used to solve three general data modeling
tasks: logical navigation, multidimensional analysis and inference. Logical
navigation is based on two operations of projection and de-projection.
Multidimensional analysis uses product operation for producing a cube from
level concepts chosen along the chosen dimension paths. Inference is defined as
a two-step procedure where input constraints are first propagated downwards
using de-projection and then the constrained result is propagated upwards using
projection.
