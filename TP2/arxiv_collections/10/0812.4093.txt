In this paper, we shall show that a polarized algebraic manifold is K-stable
if the polarization class admits a Kaehler metric of constant scalar curvature.
This generalizes the results of Chen-Tian, Donaldson and Stoppa. (Parts of the
arguments are based on a forthcoming paper "A stronger concept of K-stability."
