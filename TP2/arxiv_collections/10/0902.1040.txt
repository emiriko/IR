This paper presents a generalization of the "weighted least-squares" (WLS),
named "weighted pairing least-squares" (WPLS), which uses a rectangular weight
matrix and is suitable for data alignment problems. Two fast solving methods,
suitable for solving full rank systems as well as rank deficient systems, are
studied. Computational experiments clearly show that the best method, in terms
of speed, accuracy, and numerical stability, is based on a special {1, 2,
3}-inverse, whose computation reduces to a very simple generalization of the
usual "Cholesky factorization-backward substitution" method for solving linear
systems.
