This paper presents a recursive secret sharing technique that distributes k-1
secrets of length b each into n shares such that each share is effectively of
length (n/(k-1))*b and any k pieces suffice for reconstructing all the k-1
secrets. Since n/(k-1) is near the optimal factor of n/k, and can be chosen to
be close to 1, the proposed technique is space efficient. Furthermore, each
share is information theoretically secure, i.e. it does not depend on any
unproven assumption of computational intractability. Such a recursive technique
has potential applications in secure and reliable storage of information on the
Web and in sensor networks.
