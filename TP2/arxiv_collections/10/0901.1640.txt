Sound synthesis can be developed using physics-based modelling of the musical
instruments. These methods need the description of the various parts of sound
production mechanism, in particular a model of the acoustic resonator that have
to be simple enough due to the real-time constraint. However, in the case of
the clarinet, the bore is quite not a cylindrical tube. An implementation of a
resonator including a open-tone holes lattice is presented in this paper.
