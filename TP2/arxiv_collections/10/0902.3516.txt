The ionization energy theory is used to calculate the evolution of the
resistivity and specific heat curves with respect to different doping elements
in the recently discovered superconducting Pnictide materials. Subsequently,
the electron-conduction mechanism in the Pnictides above the structural
transition temperature is explained unambiguously, which is also consistent
with other strongly correlated matter, such as cuprates, manganites, titanates
and magnetic semiconductors. Therefore, the superconductivity is not uniquely
corresponds to the electronic properties above the structural transition
temperature. Detailed prediction are given on these compounds for various
doping elements, namely, La(Sm,Ce,Ba,Sr,Ca)FeAsO(F,Cl,Br) and
Ba(Sr,Ca,K,Rb,Cs)Fe(2)As(2).
