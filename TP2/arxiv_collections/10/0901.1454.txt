The space, on which quantum field operators are given, is constructed in any
theory, in which the usual product between test functions is substituted by the
$\star$-product (the Moyal-type product). The important example of such a
theory is noncommutative quantum field theory (NC QFT). This construction is
the key point in the derivation of the Wightman reconstruction theorem.
