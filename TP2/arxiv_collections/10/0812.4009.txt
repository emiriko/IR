The Graph Automata have been the paradigm in the expression of utilizing
Graphs as a language. Matrix Graph grammars \cite{Pedro} are an algebratization
of graph rewriting systems. Here we present the dual of this formalizm which
some extensions which we term Graph Field Automata The advantage to this
approach is a framework for expressing machines that can use Matrix Graph
Grammars.
