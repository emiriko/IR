The dynamics of linear stochastic growth equations on growing substrates is
studied. The substrate is assumed to grow in time following the power law
$t^\gamma$, where the growth index $\gamma$ is an arbitrary positive number.
Two different regimes are clearly identified: for small $\gamma$ the interface
becomes correlated, and the dynamics is dominated by diffusion; for large
$\gamma$ the interface stays uncorrelated, and the dynamics is dominated by
dilution. In this second regime, for short time intervals and spatial scales
the critical exponents corresponding to the non-growing substrate situation are
recovered. For long time differences or large spatial scales the situation is
different. Large spatial scales show the uncorrelated character of the growing
interface. Long time intervals are studied by means of the auto-correlation and
persistence exponents. It becomes apparent that dilution is the mechanism by
which correlations are propagated in this second case.
