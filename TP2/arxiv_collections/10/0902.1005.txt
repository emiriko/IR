We study the limiting behavior of a singularly perturbed
Schr\"odinger-Poisson system describing a 3-dimensional electron gas strongly
confined in the vicinity of a plane $(x,y)$ and subject to a strong uniform
magnetic field in the plane of the gas. The coupled effects of the confinement
and of the magnetic field induce fast oscillations in time that need to be
averaged out. We obtain at the limit a system of 2-dimensional Schr\"odinger
equations in the plane $(x,y)$, coupled through an effective selfconsistent
electrical potential. In the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, the
electron mass is modified by the field, as the result of an averaging of the
cyclotron motion. The main tools of the analysis are the adaptation of the
second order long-time averaging theory of ODEs to our PDEs context, and the
use of a Sobolev scale adapted to the confinement operator.
