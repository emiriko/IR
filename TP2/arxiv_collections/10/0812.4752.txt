This article describes two acoustic methods to measure bullet velocity with
an accuracy of 1% or better. In one method, a microphone is placed within 0.1 m
of the gun muzzle and a bullet is fired at a steel target 45 m away. The
bullet's flight time is the recorded time between the muzzle blast and sound of
hitting the target minus the time for the sound to return from the target to
the microphone. In the other method, the microphone is placed equidistant from
both the gun muzzle and the steel target 91 m away. The time of flight is the
recorded time between the muzzle blast and the sound of the bullet hitting the
target. In both cases, the average bullet velocity is simply the flight
distance divided by the flight time.
