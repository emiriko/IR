In the Israel-Stewart's theory of dissipative hydrodynamics, with a lattice
based equation of state, where the confinement-deconfinement transition is a
cross-over at $T_{co}$=196 MeV, we have analysed the STAR data on $\phi$ meson
production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV. From a simultaneous fit
to $\phi$ mesons multiplicity, mean $p_T$ and integrated $v_2$, we obtain a
phenomenological estimate of QGP viscosity, $\eta/s =0.15 \pm 0.05 \pm 0.03$,
the first error is due to the experimental uncertainty in STAR measurements,
the second reflects the uncertainties in initial and final conditions of the
fluid. A host of STAR data, e.g. $\phi$ multiplicity, integrated $v_2$, mean
$p_T$, $p_T$ spectra ($p_T <$3 GeV), in central Au+Au collisions, are
consistent with the estimate of viscosity.
