The Faddeev random phase approximation (FRPA) method is applied to calculate
the ground state and ionization energies of simple atoms. First ionization
energies agree with the experiment at the level of ~10 mH or less. Calculations
with similar accuracy are expected to provide information required for
developing the proposed quasiparticle-DFT method.
