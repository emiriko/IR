Within the realm of contact potentials, the key structures intrinsic of
nonperturbative renormalization of $T$-matrices are unraveled using rigorous
solutions and an inverse form of algebraic Lippmann-schwinger equation. The
intrinsic mismatches between effective field theory power counting and
nonperturbative divergence structures are shown for the first time to preclude
the conventional counterterm algorithm from working in the renormalization of
EFT for $NN$ scattering in nonperturbative regimes.
