We derive radial mass profiles of four strong lensing selected clusters which
show prominent giant arcs (Abell 1703, SDSS J1446+3032, SDSS J1531+3414, and
SDSS J2111-0115), by combining detailed strong lens modeling with weak lensing
shear measured from deep Subaru Suprime-cam images. Weak lensing signals are
detected at high significance for all four clusters, whose redshifts range from
z=0.28 to 0.64. We demonstrate that adding strong lensing information with
known arc redshifts significantly improves constraints on the mass density
profile, compared to those obtained from weak lensing alone. While the mass
profiles are well fitted by the universal form predicted in N-body simulations
of the LCDM model, all four clusters appear to be slightly more centrally
concentrated (the concentration parameters c_vir \sim 8) than theoretical
predictions, even after accounting for the bias toward higher concentrations
inherent in lensing selected samples. Our results are consistent with previous
studies which similarly detected a concentration excess, and increases the
total number of clusters studied with the combined strong and weak lensing
technique to ten. Combining our sample with previous work, we find that
clusters with larger Einstein radii are more anomalously concentrated. We also
present a detailed model of the lensing cluster A1703 with constraints from
multiple image families, and find the dark matter inner density profile to be
cuspy with the slope consistent with -1, in agreement with expectations.
