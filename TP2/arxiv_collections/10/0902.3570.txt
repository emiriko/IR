We perform a quark model calculation of the quarkonia $b\overline{b}$ and
$c\overline{c}$ spectra using smooth and sudden string breaking potentials. The
screening parameter is scale dependent and can be related to an effective
running gluon mass that has a finite infrared fixed point. A temperature
dependence for the screening mass is motivated by lattice QCD simulations at
finite temperature. Qualitatively different results are obtained for quarkonia
properties close to a critical value of the deconfining temperature when a
smooth or a sudden string breaking potential is used. In particular, with a
sudden string breaking potential quarkonia radii remain almost independent of
the temperature up to the critical point, only well above the critical point
the radii increase significantly. Such a behavior will impact the phenomenology
of quarkonia interactions in medium, in particular for scattering dissociation
processes.
