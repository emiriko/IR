The environmental impact of metal complexes such as organotin(IV) compounds
is of increasing concern. Genotoxic effects of organotin(IV) compounds (0.01
microg/ml, 0.1 microg/ml or 1.0 microg/ml) were measured using the alkaline
single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay to measure DNA single-strand
breaks (SSBs) and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay to determine
micronucleus formation. Biochemical-cell signatures were also ascertained using
attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.
In the comet assay, organotin(IV) carboxylates induced significantly-elevated
levels of DNA SSBs. Elevated micronucleus-forming activities were also
observed. Following interrogation using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, infrared spectra
in the biomolecular range (900 cm-1 - 1800 cm-1) derived from orga...
