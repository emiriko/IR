The three-gluon and ghost-gluon vertices of Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory
are investigated in the low momentum regime. Due to ghost dominance in the
infrared we can use the known power law behavior for the propagators to
determine analytically the complete momentum dependence of the dressing
functions. Besides a uniform, i. e. all momenta going to zero, divergence, we
find additional singularities, if one momentum alone goes to zero, while the
other two remain constant. At these asymmetric points we can extract additional
infrared exponents, which corroborate previous results and expand the known
fixed point solution of Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory, where the uniform
infrared exponents for all vertex functions are known. Calculations in two and
three dimensions yield qualitatively similar results.
