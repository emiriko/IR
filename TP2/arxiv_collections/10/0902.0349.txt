We describe an analogue of the notion of a perverse sheaf in the setting of
the derived category of coherent sheaves on an algebraic stack. Under strong
additional assumptions the construction of coherent "intersection cohomology"
complexes works. This paper supersedes the preprint arXiv:math/0005152 by the
second author.
