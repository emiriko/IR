Recently, a framework was established to systematically construct novel
universal resource states for measurement-based quantum computation using
techniques involving finitely correlated states. With these methods, universal
states were found which are in certain ways much less entangled than the
original cluster state model, and it was hence believed that with this approach
many of the extremal entanglement features of the cluster states could be
relaxed. The new resources were constructed as "computationally universal"
states--i.e. they allow one to efficiently reproduce the classical output of
each quantum computation--whereas the cluster states are universal in a
stronger sense since they are "universal state preparators". Here we show that
the new resources are universal state preparators after all, and must therefore
exhibit a whole class of extremal entanglement features, similar to the cluster
states.
