In this work, a new ansatz is introduced to make the calculations of the
metric operator in Pseudo-Hermitian field theory simpler. The idea is to assume
that the metric operator is not only a functional of the field operators $\phi$
and its conjugate field $\pi$ but also on the field gradient $\nabla\phi$.
Rather than the locality of the metric operator obtained, the ansatz enables
one to calculate the metric operator just once for all dimensions of the
space-time. We calculated the metric operator of the $i\phi^{3}$ scalar field
theory up to first order in the coupling. The higher orders can be conjectured
from their corresponding operators in the quantum mechanical case available in
the literature. We assert that, the calculations existing in literature for the
metric operator in field theory are cumbersome and are done case by case
concerning the dimension of space-time in which the theory is investigated.
Moreover, while the resulted metric operator in this work is local, the
existing calculations for the metric operator leads to a non-local one. Indeed,
we expect that the new results introduced in this work will greatly lead to the
progress of the studies in Pseudo-Hermitian field theories where there exist a
lack of such kind of studies in the literature. In fact, with the aid of this
work a rigorous study of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Higgs mechanism can be
reached.
