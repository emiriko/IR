In this paper we develop representation theory of the two fold central
extension of SL(2) over the field of 2-adic numbers. As a consequence, we
obtain a local Shimura correspondence between the two fold central extension of
SL(2) and the linear group PGL(2), which we show to be compatible with the
global Shimura correspondence at p=2.
