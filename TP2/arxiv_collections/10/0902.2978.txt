Assuming a schematic form of the nucleon effective mass as a function of
nuclear excitation energy and mass, we provide a simple explanation for
understanding the experimentally observed mass dependence of the nuclear
caloric curve. It is observed that the excitation energy at which the caloric
curve enters into a plateau region, could be sensitive to the nuclear mass
evolution of the effective nucleon mass.
