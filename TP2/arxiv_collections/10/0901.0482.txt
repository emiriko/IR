Since 2004, observations of Saturn's F ring have revealed that the ring's
core is surrounded by structures with radial scales of hundreds of kilometers,
called "spirals" and "jets". Gravitational scattering by nearby moons was
suggested as a potential production mechanism; however, it remained doubtful
because a population of Prometheus-mass moons is needed and, obviously, such a
population does not exist in the F ring region. We investigate here another
mechanism: dissipative physical collisions of kilometer-size moonlets (or
clumps) with the F-ring core. We show that it is a viable and efficient
mechanism for producing spirals and jets, provided that massive moonlets are
embedded in the F-ring core and that they are impacted by loose clumps orbiting
in the F ring region, which could be consistent with recent data from ISS, VIMS
and UVIS. We show also that coefficients of restitution as low as ~0.1 are
needed to reproduce the radial extent of spirals and jets, suggesting that
collisions are very dissipative in the F ring region. In conclusion, spirals
and jets would be the direct manifestation the ongoing collisional activity of
the F ring region.
