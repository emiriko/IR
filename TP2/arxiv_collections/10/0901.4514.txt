Pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) stars oscillate in short-period p-modes or
long-period g-modes. HS0702+6043 (DW Lyn) is one of a few objects to show
characteristics of both types and is hence classified as hybrid pulsator. It is
one of our targets in the EXOTIME program to search for planetary companions
around extreme horizontal branch objects. In addition to the standard exercise
in asteroseismology to probe the instantaneous inner structure of a star,
measured changes in the pulsation frequencies as derived from an O-C diagram
can be compared to theoretical evolutionary timescales. Based on the
photometric data available so far, we are able to derive a high-resolution
frequency spectrum and to report on our efforts to construct a multi-season O-C
diagram. Additionally, we have gathered time-resolved spectroscopic data in
order to constrain stellar parameters and to derive mode parameters as well as
radial and rotational velocities.
