After a brief theoretical introduction of the warped extra-dimensional model
with custodial protection the results of arXiv:0809.1073 [hep-ph] are
presented. In this work we analyze the impact of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gauge boson
modes on Delta F=2 observables, for the first time considering the full
operator basis and including NLO renormalization group running. It is pointed
out that the dominant contribution in the B-system does not come from the KK
gluon, but that contributions from KK excitations of the weak gauge bosons are
competitive. In a numerical analysis we assess the amount of fine-tuning
necessary for obtaining realistic values for quark masses and mixings and at
the same time realistic values for epsilon_K, the measure for CP violation in K
meson mixing. We are able to show that a mass of the lightest KK gauge boson of
2-3 TeV, and hence in the reach of the LHC, is still possible for moderate
fine-tuning. These results enable us to make predictions for not yet measured
Delta F=2 observables, such as S_\psi\phi and A_s^SL, which can differ
significantly from their SM values.
