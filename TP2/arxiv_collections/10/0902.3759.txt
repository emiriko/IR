We describe the experimental method and consecutive steps of the analysis of
the pp-->pp eta prime reaction measured by means of the COSY-11 detection
setup. The conducted investigation aim at the determination of the total width
of the eta prime meson directly from its mass distribution. The preliminary
results show that the statistical error is in the order of ~10 keV.
