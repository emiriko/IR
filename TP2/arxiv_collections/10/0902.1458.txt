The NOAO NEWFIRM Pipeline produces instrumentally calibrated data products
and data quality measurements from all exposures taken with the NOAO Extremely
Wide-Field Infrared Imager (NEWFIRM) at the KPNO Mayall 4-meter telescope. We
describe the distributed nature of the NEWFIRM Pipeline, the calibration data
that are applied, the data quality metadata that are derived, and the data
products that are delivered by the NEWFIRM Pipeline.
