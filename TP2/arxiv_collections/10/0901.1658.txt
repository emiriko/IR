The spatial distributions of the most recently discovered ultra faint dwarf
satellites around the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy are compared to the
previously reported discs-of-satellites (DoS) of their host galaxies. In our
investigation we pay special attention to the selection bias introduced due to
the limited sky coverage of SDSS. We find that the new Milky Way satellite
galaxies follow closely the DoS defined by the more luminous dwarfs, thereby
further emphasizing the statistical significance of this feature in the
Galactic halo. We also notice a deficit of satellite galaxies with
Galactocentric distances larger than 100 kpc that are away from the
disc-of-satellites of the Milky Way. In the case of Andromeda, we obtain
similar results, naturally complementing our previous finding and strengthening
the notion that the discs-of-satellites are optical manifestations of a
phase-space correlation of satellite galaxies.
