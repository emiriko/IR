Astronomic line mapping with single-pixel instruments is usually performed in
an on-the-fly (OTF) or a raster-mapping mode depending on the capabilities of
the telescope and the instrument. The observing efficiency can be increased by
combining several source-point integrations with a common reference
measurement. This is implemented at many telescopes, but a thorough
investigation of the optimum calibration of the modes and the best way of
performing these observations is still lacking.
  We use knowledge of the instrumental stability obtained by an Allan variance
measurement to derive a mathematical formalism for optimizing the setup of
mapping observations. Special attention has to be paid to minimizing of the
impact of correlated noise introduced by the common OFF integrations and to the
correction of instrumental drifts. Both aspects can be covered using a
calibration scheme that interpolates between two OFF measurements and an
appropriate OFF integration time.
  The total uncertainty of the calibrated data consisting of radiometric noise
and drift noise can be minimized by adjusting the source integration time and
the number of data points observed between two OFF measurements. It turns out
that OTF observations are very robust. They provide a low relative noise, even
if their setup deviates considerably from the optimum. Fast data readouts are
often essential to minimize the drift contributions. In particular, continuum
measurements may be easily spoiled by instrumental drifts. The main drawback of
the described mapping modes is the limited use of the measured data at
different spatial or spectroscopic resolutions obtained by additional
rebinning.
