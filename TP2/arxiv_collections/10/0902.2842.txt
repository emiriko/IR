From the combinatorial characterizations of the right, left, and two-sided
Kazhdan-Lusztig cells of the symmetric group, 'RSK bases' are constructed for
certain quotients by two-sided ideals of the group ring and the Hecke algebra.
Applications to invariant theory, over various base rings, of the general
linear group and representation theory of the symmetric group are discussed.
