Josephson current in superconductor/insulator/superconductor junction is
studied theoretically. It is well known that when the zero-energy resonance
state exists both side of superconducting interface, the behaver of the
temperature dependence of the critical Josephson current is striking
enhancement at low temperature. On the other hand it is reported that if
$d+is$-wave exists at the interface, Josephson current is suppressed at low
temperature. In this paper, we discuss the existence of the imaginary part of
the pair potential at the interface and remarkable suppresses of dc Josephson
current on d-wave superconductor 110-junction.
