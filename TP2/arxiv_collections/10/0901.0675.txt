Alpha-particle (quartet) condensation in homogeneous spin-isospin symmetric
nuclear matter is investigated. The usual Thouless criterion for the critical
temperature is extended to the quartet case. The in-medium four-body problem is
strongly simplified by the use of a momentum projected mean field ansatz for
the quartet. The self-consistent single particle wave functions are shown and
discussed for various values of the density at the critical temperature.
