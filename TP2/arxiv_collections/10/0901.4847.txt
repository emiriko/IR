A summary of the results of several recent studies of charm mixing is
presented. A number of different methods were used, including the measurement
of lifetime ratios for final states of different CP, time dependence of
wrong-sign hadronic decays, fits to time-dependent Dalitz plots, and searches
for wrong-sign semi-leptonic decays. Taken together, they suggest mixing is of
order 1%. The status of searches for indirect CP violation is also reported.
