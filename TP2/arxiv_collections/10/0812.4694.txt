The dynamics of brane-like extended objects in spacetimes with torsion is
derived from the conservation equations of stress-energy and spin tensors. Thus
obtained world-sheet equations are applied to macroscopic test membranes made
of spinning matter. Specifically, we consider membranes with maximally
symmetric distribution of stress-energy and spin. These are characterized by
two constants only: the tension and spin magnitude. By solving the world-sheet
equations, we discover a similarity between such membranes in Riemann-Cartan
backgrounds, and string theory membranes in low-energy string backgrounds. In
the second part of the paper, we apply this result to cylindrical membranes
wrapped around the extra compact dimension of a $(D+1)$-dimensional spacetime.
In the narrow membrane limit, we discover how effective macroscopic strings
couple to torsion. An observed similarity with the string sigma model is noted.
