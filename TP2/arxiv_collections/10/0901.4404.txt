Prime-based ordering which is proved to be admissible, is the encoding of
indeterminates in power-products with prime numbers and ordering them by using
the natural number order. Using Eiffel, four versions of Buchberger's improved
algorithm for obtaining Groebner Bases have been developed: two total degree
versions, representing power products as strings and the other two as integers
based on prime-based ordering. The versions are further distinguished by
implementing coefficients as 64-bit integers and as multiple-precision
integers. By using primebased power product coding, iterative or recursive
operations on power products are replaced with integer operations. It is found
that on a series of example polynomial sets, significant reductions in
computation time of 30% or more are almost always obtained.
