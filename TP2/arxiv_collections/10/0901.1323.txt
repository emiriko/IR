Measuring metallicity in the nuclear regions of AGNs is difficult because
only a few lines are observed and ionization correction becomes a major
problem. Nitrogen to carbon ratio has been widely used as an indicator for
metallicity, but precise measurements have been lacking. We made such
measurements for the first time using a wide baseline of ionization states with
observations from FUSE, HST and Chandra. OVI observations with FUSE were
crucial in this effort. We measured super-solar metallicities in two AGNs and
found that N/C does not scale with metallicity. This suggests that chemical
enrichment scenario in nuclear regions of galaxies may be different from
traditional models of metal enrichment.
