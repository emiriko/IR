In this brief report, apart from the usual approach, we discriminate among
models in the class of \textbf{$SU(4)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}$} electro-weak gauge
models by just setting the versors in the method of the exactly solving gauge
models with high symmetries. We prove that the method itself naturally predicts
the correct assingment of the electric charge spectrum along with the relation
between the gauge couplings of the groups involved therein for each particular
model in this class.
