Normal state spin dynamics of the recently discovered iron-pnictide
superconductors is discussed by calculating spin structure factor S(q, omega)
in an itinerant five-band model within RPA approximation. Due to the
characteristic Fermi surface structure of iron-pnictide, column like response
is found at (pi, 0) in extended Brillouin zone in the undoped case, which is
consistent with the recent neutron scattering experiment. This indicates that
the localized spin model is not necessary to explain the spin dynamics of this
system. Furthermore, we show that the temperature dependence of inelastic
neutron scattering intensity can be well reproduced in the itinerant model. We
also study NMR 1/T_1T in the same footing calculation and show that the
itinerant model can capture the magnetic property of iron-pnictide
superconductors.
