Let $A$ be an additive basis of order $h$ and $X$ be a finite nonempty subset
of $A$ such that the set $A \setminus X$ is still a basis. In this article, we
give several upper bounds for the order of $A \setminus X$ in function of the
order $h$ of $A$ and some parameters related to $X$ and $A$. If the parameter
in question is the cardinality of $X$, Nathanson and Nash already obtained some
of such upper bounds, which can be seen as polynomials in $h$ with degree $(|X|
+ 1)$. Here, by taking instead of the cardinality of $X$ the parameter defined
by $d := \frac{\diam(X)}{\gcd\{x - y | x, y \in X\}}$, we show that the order
of $A \setminus X$ is bounded above by $(\frac{h (h + 3)}{2} + d \frac{h (h -
1) (h + 4)}{6})$. As a consequence, we deduce that if $X$ is an arithmetic
progression of length $\geq 3$, then the upper bounds of Nathanson and Nash are
considerably improved. Further, by considering more complex parameters related
to both $X$ and $A$, we get upper bounds which are polynomials in $h$ with
degree only 2.
