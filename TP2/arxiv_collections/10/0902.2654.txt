We consider modulation space and spaces of Schatten-von Neumann symbols where
corresponding pseudo-differential operators map one Hilbert space to another.
We prove H\"older-Young and Young type results for such spaces under dilated
convolutions and multiplications. We also prove continuity properties for such
spaces under the twisted convolution, and the Weyl product. These results lead
to continuity properties for twisted convolutions on Lebesgue spaces, e.{}g.
$L^p_{(\omega)}$ is a twisted convolution algebra when $1\le p\le 2$ and
appropriate weight $\omega$.
