Parton distributions in the virtual photon target are investigated in
perturbative QCD up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). In the case
$\Lambda^2 \ll P^2 \ll Q^2$, where $-Q^2$ ($-P^2$) is the mass squared of the
probe (target) photon, parton distributions can be predicted completely up to
the NNLO, but they are factorisation-scheme-dependent. We analyse parton
distributions in two different factorisation schemes, namely $\bar{\rm MS}$ and
${\rm DIS}_{\gamma}$ schemes, and discuss their scheme dependence. We show that
the factorisation-scheme dependence is characterised by the large-$x$
behaviours of quark distributions. Gluon distribution is predicted to be very
small in absolute value except in the small-$x$ region.
