We consider a linear polymer chain in a disordered environment modeled by
percolation clusters on a square lattice. The disordered environment is meant
to roughly represent molecular crowding as seen in cells. The model may be
viewed as the simplest representation of biopolymers in a cell. We show the
existence of intermediate states during stretching arising as a consequence of
molecular crowding. In the constant distance ensemble the force-extension
curves exhibit oscillations. We observe the emergence of two or more peaks in
the probability distribution curves signaling the coexistence of different
states and indicating that the transition is discontinuous unlike what is
observed in the absence of molecular crowding.
