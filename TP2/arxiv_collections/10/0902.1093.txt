We have experimentally measured the distribution of the second-harmonic
intensity that is generated inside a highly-scattering slab of porous gallium
phosphide. Two complementary techniques for determining the distribution are
used. First, the spatial distribution of second-harmonic light intensity at the
side of a cleaved slab has been recorded. Second, the total second-harmonic
radiation at each side of the slab has been measured for several samples at
various wavelengths. By combining these measurements with a diffusion model for
second-harmonic generation that incorporates extrapolated boundary conditions,
we present a consistent picture of the distribution of the second-harmonic
intensity inside the slab. We find that the ratio $\ell_{2\omega}/L_c$ of the
mean free path at the second-harmonic frequency to the coherence length, which
was suggested by some earlier calculations, cannot describe the second-harmonic
yield in our samples. For describing the total second-harmonic yield, our
experiments show that the scattering parameter at the fundamental frequency
$\k_{1\omega}\ell_{1\omega}$ is the most relevant parameter in our type of
samples.
