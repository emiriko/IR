We present near-infrared H2, radio CO, and thermal infrared observations of
the nearby massive star-forming region Cepheus A (Cep A). From H2 bow shocks
arranged along four distinct jet axes, we infer that the massive protostellar
source HW2 drives a pulsed, precessing jet that has changed its orientation by
about 45 degrees in roughly 104 years. The current HW2 radio jet represents the
most recent event in this time series of eruptions. This scenario is consistent
with the recent discovery of a disk around HW2, perpendicular to the current
jet orientation, and with the presence of companions at projected distances
comparable to the disk radius. We propose that the Cep A system formed by the
disk-assisted capture of a sibling star by HW2. We present a numerical model of
a 15 M_sun star with a circumstellar disk, orbited by a companion in an
inclined, eccentric orbit. Close passages of the companion through or near the
disk result in periods of enhanced accretion and mass loss, as well as forced
precession of the disk and associated orientation changes in the jet. The
observations reveal a second powerful outflow that emerges from radio source
HW3c or HW3d. This flow is associated with blueshifted CO emission and a faint
H2 bow shock to the east, and with HH 168 to the west. A collision between the
flows from HW2 and HW3c/d may be responsible for X-ray and radio continuum
emission in Cep A West.
