Almost all early-type stars show Discrete Absorption Components (DACs) in
their ultraviolet spectral lines. These can be attributed to Co-rotating
Interaction Regions (CIRs): large-scale spiral-shaped structures that sweep
through the stellar wind. We used the Zeus hydrodynamical code to model the
CIRs. In the model, the CIRs are caused by "spots" on the stellar surface.
Through the radiative acceleration these spots create fast streams in the
stellar wind material. Where the fast and slow streams collide, a CIR is
formed. By varying the parameters of the spots, we quantitatively fit the
observed DACs in HD 64760. An important result from our work is that the spots
do not rotate with the same velocity as the stellar surface. The fact that the
cause of the CIRs is not fixed on the surface eliminates many potential
explanations. The only remaining explanation is that the CIRs are due to the
interference pattern of a number of non-radial pulsations.
