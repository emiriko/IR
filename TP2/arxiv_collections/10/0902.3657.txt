We extend the definition of "spectral dimension" (usually defined for fractal
and lattice geometries) to theories on smooth spacetimes with anisotropic
scaling. We show that in quantum gravity dominated by a Lifshitz point with
dynamical critical exponent z in D+1 spacetime dimensions, the spectral
dimension of spacetime is equal to d_s=1+D/z. In the case of gravity in 3+1
dimensions presented in arXiv:0901.3775, which is dominated by z=3 in the UV
and flows to z=1 in the IR, the spectral dimension of spacetime flows from
d_s=4 at large scales, to d_s=2 at short distances. Remarkably, this is the
qualitative behavior of d_s found numerically by Ambjorn, Jurkiewicz and Loll
in their causal dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity.
