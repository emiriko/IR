An experimental setup is proposed for the precise measurement of the quantum
states of ultracold neutrons bound in the earth's gravitational field. The
experiment utilizes a CCD-based pixel sensor and magnification system to
observe the fine structure of the neutron distribution. In this work, we
analyzed the sensor's deposited energy measurement capability and found that
its spatial resolution was 5.3 um. A magnifying power of two orders of
magnitude was realized by using a cylindrical rod as a convex mirror.
