The Bohm's quantum potential, introduced in 1952, and the quantum force in
superconductor, introduced in 2001, allow to describe non-local force-free
momentum transfer observed in the Ahronov-Bohm effects. Comparison of the
Ahronov-Bohm effects in the two-slit interference experiment and in
superconductor ring reveals fundamental difference between the Schrodinger wave
function and the wave function describing macroscopic quantum phenomena. The
Ginzburg-Landau wave function describing the superconductivity phenomenon can
not collapse and an additional postulate, which was implied first by L.D.
Landau, must be used for the description of macroscopic quantum phenomena. It
is note that quantum principles and postulates should not be universal till the
quantum formalism is only phenomenological theory but no description of an
unique reality. A simple Gedankenexperiment is considered which challenges the
universality of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation and the Bohr's
complementarity principle.
