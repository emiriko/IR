A generalized linear sigma model for low energy QCD is employed to study the
quark structure of eight low lying scalar isomultiplets as well as eight low
lying pseudoscalar isomultiplets. The model, building on earlier work, assumes
the possible mixing of quark anti-quark states with others made of two quarks
and two antiquarks. No {\it a priori} assumption is made about the quark
contents of the states, which emerge as predictions. An amusing and contrasting
pattern for the quark structure is found; the lighter conventional
pseudoscalars are, as expected, primarily of two quark type whereas the lighter
scalars have very large four quark admixtures. The new feature of the present
paper compared to earlier ones in this series involves the somewhat subtle and
complicated effects of SU(3) flavor breaking. They do not alter the general
pattern of two quark vs. four quark mixing obtained in the SU(3)symmetric case
but, of course, give a more detailed picture.
