Generalized form factors of hadrons are objects appearing in moments of the
generalized parton distributions. Their leading-order DGLAP-ERBL QCD evolution
is exceedingly simple and the solution is given in terms of matrix triangular
structures of linear equations where the coefficients are the evolution ratios.
We point out that this solution has a practical importance in analyses where
the generalized form factors are basic objects, e.g., the lattice-gauge studies
or models. It also displays general features of their evolution.
