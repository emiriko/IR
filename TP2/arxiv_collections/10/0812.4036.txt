We present a search for new particles whose decays produce two jets (dijets)
using proton-antiproton collision data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 1.13 fb-1 collected with the CDF II detector. The measured dijet
mass spectrum is found to be consistent with next-to-leading-order perturbative
QCD predictions, and no significant evidence of new particles is found. We set
upper limits at the 95% confidence level on cross sections times the branching
fraction for the production of new particles decaying into dijets with both
jets having a rapidity magnitude |y| < 1. These limits are used to determine
the mass exclusions for the excited quark, axigluon, flavor-universal coloron,
E6 diquark, color-octet technirho, W', and Z'.
