We study surface operators in the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with
gauge groups SO(n) and Sp(2n). As recently shown by Gukov and Witten these
theories have a class of rigid surface operators which are expected to be
related by S-duality. The rigid surface operators are of two types, unipotent
and semisimple. We make explicit proposals for how the S-duality map should act
on unipotent surface operators. We also discuss semisimple surface operators
and make some proposals for certain subclasses of such operators.
