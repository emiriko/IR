A new nonlocal form of the off-shell kinetic equation is derived. While being
equivalent to the Kadanoff--Baym and Botermans--Malfliet formulations in the
range of formal applicability, it has certain advantages beyond this range. It
possesses more accurate conservation laws for Noether quantities than those in
the Botermans--Malfliet formulation. At the same time the nonlocal form,
similarly to the Botermans--Malfliet one, allows application of the
test-particle method for its numerical solution, which makes it practical for
simulations of heavy-ion collisions. The physical meaning of the time-space
nonlocality is clarified.
