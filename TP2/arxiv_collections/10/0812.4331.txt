We show that the Lorentz shear modulus of macroscopically homogeneous
electronic states in the lowest Landau level is proportional to the bulk
modulus of an equivalent system of interacting classical particles in the
thermodynamic limit. Making use of this correspondence we calculate the Lorentz
shear modulus of Laughlin's fractional quantum Hall states at filling factor
$\nu=1/m$ ($m$ an odd integer) and find that it is equal to $\pm \hbar mn/4$,
where $n$ is the density of particles and the sign depends on the direction of
magnetic field. This is in agreement with the recent result obtained by Read in
arXiv:0805.2507 and corrects our previous result published in Phys. Rev. B {\bf
76}, 161305 (R) (2007).
