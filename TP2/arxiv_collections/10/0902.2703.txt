We discuss a method of calculating the various scalar densities encountered
in Lovelock theory which relies on diagrammatic, instead of algebraic
manipulations. Taking advantage of the known symmetric and antisymmetric
properties of the Riemann tensor which appears in the Lovelock densities, we
map every quadratic or higher contraction into a corresponding permutation
diagram. The derivation of the explicit form of each density is then reduced to
identifying the distinct diagrams, from which we can also read off the overall
combinatoric factors. The method is applied to the first Lovelock densities, of
order two (Gauss-Bonnet term) and three.
