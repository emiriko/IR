The purpose of this contribution is to provide an introduction for a general
physics audience to the recent results of Emile Grgin that unifies quantum
mechanics and relativity into the same mathematical structure. This structure
is the algebra of quantions, a non-division algebra that is the natural
framework for electroweak theory on curved space-time. Similar with
quaternions, quantions preserve the core features of associativity and complex
conjugation while giving up the unnecessarily historically biased property of
division. Lack of division makes possible structural unification with
relativity (one cannot upgrade the linear Minkowski space to a division algebra
due to null light-cone vectors) and demands an adjustment from Born's standard
interpretation of the wave function in terms of probability currents. This
paper is an overview to the theory of quantions, followed by discussions.
