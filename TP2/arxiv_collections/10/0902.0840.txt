Using the energy variational method of magneto-solid-mechanical theory of a
perfectly conducting elastic medium threaded by magnetic field, the frequency
spectrum of Lorentz-force-driven global torsional nodeless vibrations of a
neutron star with Ferraro's form of axisymmetric poloidal nonhomogeneous
internal and dipole-like external magnetic field is obtained and compared with
that for this toroidal Alfv\'en mode in a neutron star with homogeneous
internal and dipolar external magnetic field. The relevance of considered
asteroseismic models to quasi-periodic oscillations of the X-ray flux during
the ultra powerful outbursts of SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14 is discussed.
