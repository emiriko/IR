We investigate a possibility to measure parameters of the Littlest Higgs
model with T-parity at the ILC with sqrt(s) = 500 GeV. The model predicts new
gauge bosons (AH, ZH, and WH), among which the heavy photon (AH) is a candidate
for dark matter. Through Monte Carlo simulations of the process of e+ e- -> AH
ZH, we show that the masses can be determined with accuracies of 16.2% for m_AH
and 4.3% for m_ZH. In additionally, the vacuum expectation value can be
determined with accuracies of 4.3%.
