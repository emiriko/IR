A generalized Kullback-Leibler relative entropy is introduced starting with
the symmetric Jackson derivative of the generalized overlap between two
probability distributions. The generalization retains much of the structure
possessed by the original formulation. We present the fundamental properties
including positivity, metricity, concavity, bounds and stability. In addition,
a connection to shift information and behavior under Liouville dynamics are
discussed.
