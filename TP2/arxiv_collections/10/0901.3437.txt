The problem of the universal form of the size spectrum is analyzed. The
half-widths of two wings of spectrum is introduced and it is shown that their
ratio is very close to the golden fraction. In appendix it is shown that behind
the golden fraction of an image one can find the information basis, i.e. the
proportion of the golden fraction corresponds to some method to find extremum.
The method to find extrema associated with Fibonacci numbers also leads to
proportions which can be seen in nature or can be introduced artificially. The
information origin of proportions is proved theoretically and confirmed by
examples in nature and human life.
