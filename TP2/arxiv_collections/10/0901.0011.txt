We present a comprehensive overview of an extension of the Standard Model
that contains three right-handed (sterile) neutrinos with masses below the
electroweak scale [the Neutrino Minimal Standard Model, (nuMSM)]. We consider
the history of the Universe from the inflationary era through today and
demonstrate that most of the observed phenomena beyond the Standard Model can
be explained within the framework of this model. We review the mechanism of
baryon asymmetry of the Universe in the nuMSM and discuss a dark matter
candidate that can be warm or cold and satisfies all existing constraints. From
the viewpoint of particle physics the model provides an explanation for
neutrino flavor oscillations. Verification of the nuMSM is possible with
existing experimental techniques.
