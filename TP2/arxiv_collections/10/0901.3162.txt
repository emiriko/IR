The region in the HR-diagram where the main sequence intersects the classical
instability strip hosts A- and F-type stars exhibiting a rich variety of
physical phenomena, such as pulsations on various time scales and chemical
peculiarities. We aim to investigate the occurrence of these phenomena among
suspected binary systems in this region of the HR-diagram and their mutual
interactions.
