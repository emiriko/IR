At the present time, SDSS early-type BCGs have larger Re than early-type
galaxies of similar L, whether these other objects are in the field, or are
satellites in clusters (Re ~ L for BCGs). At fixed M* and formation time, BCGs
at lower z are larger and have smaller velocity dispersions, i.e. Re increases
and sigma decreases with age. As a result, at z~0.25, corresponding to a
lookback time of order 3 Gyrs, BCGs are smaller than their lower z counterparts
by as much as 70% for the brightest BCGs: Re evolves as (1+z)^{0.85(Mr+21)}.
Qualitatively similar but weaker evolution in the sizes is also seen in the
bulk of the early-type population: at Mr<-22 Re evolves as (1+z)^{0.7(Mr+21)},
while at Mr>-22 the evolution is approximately (1+z)^{-0.7}, independent of Mr.
The sigma-L correlation also evolves: (1+z)^{-0.2(Mr+21)} at Mr < -22 (as for
the BCGs) and (1+z)^{0.2} for fainter galaxies. The Re- and sigma-M*
correlations yield consistent results. These trends are most easily understood
if early-type BCGs grew from many dry minor mergers rather than a few major
mergers. Only in such a scenario can BCGs be the descendents of the superdense
galaxies seen at z~2; major dry mergers, which increase the size in proportion
to the mass, cannot bring these galaxies onto the BCG Re-M* relation at z~0. We
also compared the ages and sizes of our early-type BCGs with satellites. BCGs
are larger than satellites of similar L or M* at the same redshift. Although
both satellites and BCGs trace the same weak age-L or age-M* relation, this can
be understood by noting that BCGs are typically about 1 Gyr older than the
satellites in their group, and they are about 0.5 mags more luminous. Finally,
we find that the mean satellite L is approximately independent of BCG L, in
agreement with recent predictions based on the L-dependence of clustering.
