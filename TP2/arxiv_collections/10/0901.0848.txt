The effect of initial correlations between nucleons on the nuclear break-up
mechanism is studied. A quantum transport theory which extends standard
mean-field approach is developed to incorporate short range pairing correlation
as well as direct nucleon-nucleon collisions. A time evolution of the nuclear
break-up from a correlated system leading to the emission of two particles to
the continuum is performed. We show that initial correlations have strong
influence on relative angles between particles emitted in coincidence. The
present qualitative study indicates that nuclear break-up might be a tool to
infer the residual interaction between nucleons in the nuclear medium.
