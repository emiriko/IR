A general, uniform, rigorous and constructive thermodynamic approach to
weakly nonlocal non-equilibrium thermodynamics is reviewed. A method is given
to construct and restrict the evolution equations of physical theories
according to the Second Law of thermodynamics and considering weakly nonlocal
constitutive state spaces. The evolution equations of internal variables, the
classical irreversible thermodynamics and Korteweg fluids are treated.
