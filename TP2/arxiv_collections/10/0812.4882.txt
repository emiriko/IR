We consider $\alpha$-mixing observations and deal with the estimation of the
conditional mode of a scalar response variable $Y$ given a random variable $X$
taking values in a semi-metric space. We provide a convergence rate in $L^p$
norm of the estimator. A useful and typical application to functional times
series prediction is given.
