We calculate the gamma-ray albedo due to cosmic-ray interactions with debris
(small rocks, dust, and grains) in the Oort Cloud. We show that under
reasonable assumptions a significant proportion of what is called the
"extragalactic gamma-ray background" could be produced at the outer frontier of
the solar system and may be detectable by the Large Area Telescope, the primary
instrument on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. If detected it could provide
unique direct information about the total column density of material in the
Oort Cloud that is difficult to access by any other method. The same gamma ray
production process takes place in other populations of small solar system
bodies such as Main Belt asteroids, Jovian and Neptunian Trojans, and Kuiper
Belt objects. Their detection can be used to constrain the total mass of debris
in these systems.
