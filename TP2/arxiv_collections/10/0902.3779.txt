We study the coupled current and magnetization noise in magnetic
nanostructures by magnetoelectronic circuit theory. Spin current fluctuations,
which depend on the magnetic configuration, are found to be an important source
of magnetization noise and damping in thinly layered systems. The enhanced
magnetization fluctuations in spin valves can be directly measured by their
effect on the resistance noise.
