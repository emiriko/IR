We present the first full evolutionary calculations aimed at exploring the
origin of hot DQ white dwarfs. These calculations consistently cover the whole
evolution from the born-again stage to the white dwarf cooling track. Our
calculations provide strong support to the diffusive/convective-mixing picture
for the formation of hot DQs. We find that the hot DQ stage is a short-lived
stage and that the range of effective temperatures where hot DQ stars are found
can be accounted for by different masses of residual helium and/or different
initial stellar masses. In the frame of this scenario, a correlation between
the effective temperature and the surface carbon abundance in DQs should be
expected, with the largest carbon abundances expected in the hottest DQs. From
our calculations, we suggest that most of the hot DQs could be the cooler
descendants of some PG1159 stars characterized by He-rich envelopes markedly
smaller than those predicted by the standard theory of stellar evolution. At
least for one hot DQ, the high-gravity white dwarf SDSS J142625.70+575218.4, an
evolutionary link between this star and the massive PG1159 star H1504+65 is
plausible.
