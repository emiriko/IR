We prove that any evolution equation admitting a potential symmetry can
always be reduced to another evolution equation such that the potential
symmetry in question maps into the group of its contact symmetries. Based on
this fact is out group approach to classification of evolution equations
possessing non-local symmetries. We present several examples of classifications
of second-order evolution equations admitting potential symmetries.
