Formation of complex polyaniline (PANI) films with diamagnetic TCNQ and
paramagnetic metal ion impurities cast under applied magnetic field was
studied. It has been found that the applied magnetic field affects interaction
of PANI chains with the impurities and induces formation of magnetically
ordered regions in the complex film doped by paramagnetic metal ions in
contrast to the reference film of the same composition but prepared under
ambient conditions. The magnetically ordered regions have been observed
directly by scanning magnetic force microscopy. It was found a correlation in
distribution of the magnetically ordered regions and peculiarities of the
surface relief of a film. Electronic absorption spectra and conductivity
measurements showed that an applied stationary magnetic field can suppress the
interaction of PANI chains and paramagnetic metal ions and lowers conductivity
of the resulting complex film up to one order of magnitude as compared with the
reference film. An alternating magnetic field was found to improve interaction
of PANI and diamagnetic TCNQ molecules. The mechanisms of the magnetic field
influence on the complex film formation are discussed.
