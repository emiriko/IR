Flickering is a phenomenon related to the mass accretion observed among many
classes of astrophysical objects. In this paper we present a study of the
flickering emission lines and continuum of the Cataclysmic Variable V3885 Sgr.
The flickering behavior is first analyzed through statistical analysis and
lightcurves power spectra. Autocorrelation techniques are then employed to
estimate the flickering flares timescales. A cross correlation study between
the line and its underlying continuum variability is presented. The cross
correlation between the photometric and spectroscopic data is also discussed.
The periodograms, calculated using emission line data, show a behavior that is
similar to those obtained from photometric datasets found in the literature,
with a plateau at lower frequencies and a power law at higher frequencies. The
power law index is consistent with stochastic events. The cross-correlation
study indicates the presence of a correlation between the variability on
H-alpha and its underlying continuum. Flickering timescales derived from the
photometric data were estimated as 25 minutes for two lightcurves and 10
minutes for one of them. The average timescales of the line flickering is 40
minutes, while for its underlying continuum it drops to 20 minutes.
