We present a new mechanism for spin-wave excitation using a pinned domain
wall which is forced to oscillate at its eigenfrequency and radiates spin
waves. The domain wall acts as a frequency doubler, as the excited spin waves
have twice the frequency of the domain wall oscillation. The investigations
have been carried out using micromagnetic simulations and enable the
determination of the main characteristics of the excited spin-waves such as
frequency, wavelength, and velocity. This behavior is understood by the
oscillation in the perpendicular magnetization which shows two anti-nodes
oscillating out of phase with respect to each other.
