We consider an ancient solution $g(\cdot,t)$ of the Ricci flow on a compact
surface that exists for $t\in (-\infty,T)$ and becomes spherical at time $t=T$.
We prove that the metric $g(\cdot,t)$ is either a family of contracting
spheres, which is a type I ancient solution, or a Rosenau solution, which is a
type II ancient solution.
