Using Brownian dynamics computer simulations we show that binary mixtures of
colloids driven in opposite directions by an oscillating external field exhibit
axial segregation in sheets perpendicular to the drive direction. The
segregation effect is stable only in a finite window of oscillation frequencies
and driving strengths and is taken over by lane formation in direction of the
driving field if the driving force is increased. In the crossover regime, bands
tilted relative to the drive direction are observed. Possible experiments to
verify the axial segregation are discussed.
