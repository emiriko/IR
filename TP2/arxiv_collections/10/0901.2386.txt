Using the atmospheric neutrinos to probe the density profile of the Earth
depends on knowing the angular distribution of the neutrinos at production and
the neutrino cross section. This paper reviews the essential features of the
angular distribution with emphasis on the relative contributions of pions,
kaons and charm.
