We give an extension to certain \textit{RD-space} $\X$, i.e space of
homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman and Weiss, which has the reverse
doubling property, of the definition and various properties of the product of
functions in $\BMO(\X)$ and $\H^{1}(\X)$, and functions in Lipschitz space
$\Lambda_{\frac{1}{p}-1}(\X)$ and $\H^{p}(\X)$ for
$p\in(\frac{\n}{\n+\theta},1]$, where $\n$ and $\theta$ denote respectively the
"dimension" and the order of $\X$
