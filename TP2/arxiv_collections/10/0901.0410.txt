Theoretically expected natures of a supernova driven by a wind/jet are
discussed. Approximate analytical formulations are derived to clarify basic
physical processes involved in the wind/jet-driven explosions, and it is shown
that the explosion properties are characterized by the energy injection rate
(Edot_iso) and the mass injection rate (Mdot_iso). To explain observations of
SN 1998bw associated with Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 980425, the following
conditions are required: Edot_iso Mdot_iso > ~ 10^{51} erg M_sun s^{-2} and
Edot_iso > ~ 2 x 10^{52} erg s^{-1} (if the wind Lorentz factor Gamma_w ~ 1) or
Edot_iso > ~ 7 x 10^{52} erg s^{-1} (if Gamma_w >> 1). In SN 1998bw, 56Ni (~
0.4M_sun) is probably produced in the shocked stellar mantle, not in the wind.
The expected natures of SNe, e.g., ejected 56Ni masses and ejecta masses, vary
depending on Edot_iso and Mdot_iso. The sequence of the SN properties from high
Edot_iso and Mdot_iso to low Edot_iso and Mdot_iso is the following: SN
1998bw-like -- intermediate case -- low mass ejecta (< ~ 1M_sun$) where 56Ni is
from the wind -- whole collapse. This diversity may explain the diversity of
supernovae associated with GRBs. Our result can be used to constrain natures of
the wind/jet, which is linked to the central engine of GRBs, by studying
properties of the associated supernovae.
