We examine the recent star formation associated with four supergiant shells
(SGSs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC): LMC 1, 4, 5, and 6, which have been
shown to have simple expanding-shell structures. H II regions and OB
associations are used to infer star formation in the last few Myr, while
massive young stellar objects (YSOs) reveal the current ongoing star formation.
Distributions of ionized, H I, and molecular components of the interstellar gas
are compared with the sites of recent and current star formation to determine
whether triggering has taken place. We find that a great majority of the
current star formation has occurred in gravitationally unstable regions, and
that evidence of triggered star formation is prevalent at both large and local
scales.
