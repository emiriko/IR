The two dark sectors of the universe - dark matter and dark energy - may
interact with each other. Background and linear density perturbation evolution
equations are developed for a generic coupling. We then establish the general
conditions necessary to obtain models free from early time non-adiabatic
instabilities. As an application, we consider a viable universe in which the
interaction strength is proportional to the dark energy density. The scenario
does not exhibit "phantom crossing" and is free from instabilities, including
early ones. A sizeable interaction strength is compatible with combined WMAP,
HST, SN, LSS and H(z) data. Neutrino mass and/or cosmic curvature are allowed
to be larger than in non-interacting models. Our analysis sheds light as well
on unstable scenarios previously proposed.
