We show how, within a preformed pair scenario for the cuprate pseudogap, the
nodal and antinodal responses in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
necessarily have very different temperature $T$ dependences. We examine the
behavior and the contrasting $T$ dependences for a range of temperatures both
below and above $T_c$. Our calculations are based on a fully microscopic
$T$-matrix approach for addressing pairing correlations in a regime where the
attraction is stronger than BCS and the coherence length is anomalously short.
Previously, the distinct nodal and anti-nodal responses have provided strong
support for the "two-gap scenario" of the cuprates in which the pseudogap
competes with superconductivity. Instead, our theory supports a picture in
which the pseudogap derives from pairing correlations, identifying the two gap
components with non-condensed and condensed pairs. It leads to reasonably good
agreement with a range of different experiments in the moderately underdoped
regime and we emphasize that here there is no explicit curve fitting. Ours is a
microscopic rather than a phenomenological theory. We briefly address the more
heavily underdoped regime in which the behavior is more complex.
