We argue that using an equilibrated gas of neutrinos it is possible to probe
the phase diagram of QCD for finite isospin and small baryon chemical
potentials. We discuss this region of the phase diagram in detail and
demonstrate that for large enough neutrino densities a Bose-Einstein condensate
of positively charged pions arises. Moreover, we show that for nonzero neutrino
density the degeneracy in the lifetimes and masses of the charged pions is
lifted.
