Let $A$ and $B$ be finite subsets of $\mathbb{C}$ such that $|B|=C|A|$. We
show the following variant of the sum product phenomenon: If $|AB|<\alpha|A|$
and $\alpha \ll \log |A|$, then $|kA+lB|\gg |A|^k|B|^l$. This is an application
of a result of Evertse, Schlickewei, and Schmidt on linear equations with
variables taking values in multiplicative groups of finite rank, in combination
with an earlier theorem of Ruzsa about sumsets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. As an
application of the case $A=B$ we give a lower bound on $|A^+|+|A^\times|$,
where $A^+$ is the set of sums of distinct elements of $A$ and $A^\times$ is
the set of products of distinct elements of $A$.
