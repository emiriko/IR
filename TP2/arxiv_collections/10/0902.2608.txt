Lev Davidovich Landau was arguably one of the greatest and most versatile
physicists. His work spans a very wide range and has had a considerable impact
on all areas of physics including condensed matter physics, plasma, high energy
and particle physics, fluid dynamics, astrophysics, gravitation, elasticity,
etc. Along with his former fellow student, E Lifshitz, he wrote the set of a
dozen volumes, the magnificent world-renowned Course of Theoretical Physics
which covered topics ranging from mechanics, classical theory of fields,
quantum mechanics, electrodynamics of continuous media, fluid dynamics, kinetic
theory, theory of elasticity, statistical physics and more.
