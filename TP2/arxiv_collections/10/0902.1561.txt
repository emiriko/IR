The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) consists of four Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) in Namibia for the detection of cosmic
very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the
potential VHE gamma-ray sources. VHE gamma-emission from GRBs is predicted by
many GRB models. Because of its generally fast-fading nature in many wavebands,
the time evolution of any VHE gamma-radiation is still unknown. In order to
probe the largely unexplored VHE gamma-ray spectra of GRBs, a GRB observing
program has been set up by the H.E.S.S. collaboration. With the high
sensitivity of the H.E.S.S. array, VHE gamma-ray flux levels predicted by GRB
models are well within reach. We report the H.E.S.S. observations of and
results from some of the reported GRB positions during March 2003 - May 2006.
