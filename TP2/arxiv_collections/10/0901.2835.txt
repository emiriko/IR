The classification of time series from photometric large scale surveys into
variability types and the description of their properties is difficult for
various reasons including but not limited to the irregular sampling, the
usually few available photometric bands, and the diversity of variable objects.
Furthermore, it can be seen that different physical processes may sometimes
produce similar behavior which may end up to be represented as same models. In
this article we will also be presenting our approach for processing the data
resulting from the Gaia space mission. The approach may be classified into
following three broader categories: supervised classification, unsupervised
classifications, and "so-called" extractor methods i.e. algorithms that are
specialized for particular type of sources. The whole process of
classification- from classification attribute extraction to actual
classification- is done in an automated manner.
