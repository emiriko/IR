We present multi-molecular line maps obtained with the Mopra Telescope
towards the southern giant molecular cloud (GMC) complex G333, associated with
the HII region RCW 106. We have characterised the GMC by decomposing the 3D
data cubes with GAUSSCLUMPS, and investigated spatial correlations among
different molecules with principal component analysis (PCA). We find no
correlation between clump size and line width, but a strong correlation between
emission luminosity and line width. PCA classifies molecules into high and low
density tracers, and reveals that HCO+ and N2H+ are anti-correlated.
