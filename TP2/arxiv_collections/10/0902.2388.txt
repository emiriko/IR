For temperatures above $T^*=130$K C$_{60} \cdot$C$_8$H$_8$ forms a cubic
crystal consisting of two interpenetrating fcc sublattices, one of freely
rotating Buckys C$_{60}$ and the other of orientationally ordered cubane
C$_8$H$_8$. The crystal structure below a discontinuous transition is found to
be orthorhombic, but the nature of the ordering of the Buckys has not yet been
determined. Here possible orderings of the Buckys consistent with the size and
symmetry of the orthorhombic unit cell are analyzed. Most likely inversion
symmetry is preserved at the transition, in which case the small number of
possible orderings are described. If inversion symmetry is removed, the point
group can be C$_{2v}$ which supports ferroelectricity or D$_2$ which can be
confirmed by proton NMR measurements.
