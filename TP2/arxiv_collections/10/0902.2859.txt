Threads as considered in thread algebra model behaviours to be controlled by
some execution environment: upon each action performed by a thread, a reply
from its execution environment -- which takes the action as an instruction to
be processed -- determines how the thread proceeds. In this paper, we are
concerned with the case where the execution environment is remote: we describe
and analyse some transmission protocols for passing instructions from a thread
to a remote execution environment.
