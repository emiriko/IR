Novel kinetic models for both Dumbbell-like and rigid-rod like polymers are
derived, based on the probability distribution function $f(t, x, n, \dot n)$
for a polymer molecule positioned at $x$ to be oriented along direction $n$
while embedded in a $\dot n$ environment created by inertial effects. It is
shown that the probability distribution function of the extended model, when
converging, will lead to well accepted kinetic models when inertial effects are
ignored such as the Doi models for rod like polymers, and the Finitely
Extensible Non-linear Elastic (FENE) models for Dumbbell like polymers.
