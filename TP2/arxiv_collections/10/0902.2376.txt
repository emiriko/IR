The double-beta decay Q values of 130Te, 128Te, and 120Te have been
determined from parent-daughter mass differences measured with the Canadian
Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The 132Xe-129Xe mass difference, which is
precisely known, was also determined to confirm the accuracy of these results.
The 130Te Q value was found to be 2527.01(32) keV which is 3.3 keV lower than
the 2003 Atomic Mass Evaluation recommended value, but in agreement with the
most precise previous measurement. The uncertainty has been reduced by a factor
of 6 and is now significantly smaller than the resolution achieved or foreseen
in experimental searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay. The 128Te and
120Te Q values were found to be 865.87(131) keV and 1714.81(125) keV,
respectively. For 120Te, this reduction in uncertainty of nearly a factor of 8
opens up the possibility of using this isotope for sensitive searches for
neutrinoless double-electron capture and electron capture with positron
emission.
