We present results of Moessbauer experiment in a rotating system, which is
induced by our recent disclosure (Phys. Scr., 77 (2008) 035302) and which
consisted in the fact that a correct processing of Kundig experiment data on
the subject gives an appreciable deviation of a relative energy shift dE/E
between emission and absorption resonant lines from the standard prediction
based on the relativistic dilation of time (that is dE/E=-v2/2c2 to the
accuracy c-2, where v is the tangential velocity of absorber of resonant
radiation, and c is the light velocity in vacuum). Namely, the Kundig result
following the correction we brought to it, is dE/E=-(0.596+/-0.006)v2/c2. In
our own experiment we carried out measurements for two absorbers with
substantially different isomer shift, which allowed us to make a correction of
Moessbauer data to a level of vibrations in the rotor system at various
rotational frequencies. As a result we got the estimation
dE/E=-(0.68+/-0.03)v2/c2. A deviation from the relativistic formula is
discussed.
