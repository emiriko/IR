The optical response of spiral magnets is studied, with special attention to
its electromagnon features. We show that these features trace back to the
resonant magnetoelectric response resulting from the spiral ordering
(irrespective of any concomitant ferroelectricity). This response, being
magnetoelectric in nature, not always can be reduced to an effective electric
permittivity. We argue that electromagnons in spiral magnets can produce, in
addition to the observed peaks in the optical absorption of multiferroics, a
(dynamically enhanced) optical rotation and a negative refractive index
behavior.
