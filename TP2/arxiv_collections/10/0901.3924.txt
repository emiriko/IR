A rectangular layout is a partition of a rectangle into a finite set of
interior-disjoint rectangles. Rectangular layouts appear in various
applications: as rectangular cartograms in cartography, as floorplans in
building architecture and VLSI design, and as graph drawings. Often areas are
associated with the rectangles of a rectangular layout and it might hence be
desirable if one rectangular layout can represent several area assignments. A
layout is area-universal if any assignment of areas to rectangles can be
realized by a combinatorially equivalent rectangular layout. We identify a
simple necessary and sufficient condition for a rectangular layout to be
area-universal: a rectangular layout is area-universal if and only if it is
one-sided. More generally, given any rectangular layout L and any assignment of
areas to its regions, we show that there can be at most one layout (up to
horizontal and vertical scaling) which is combinatorially equivalent to L and
achieves a given area assignment. We also investigate similar questions for
perimeter assignments. The adjacency requirements for the rectangles of a
rectangular layout can be specified in various ways, most commonly via the dual
graph of the layout. We show how to find an area-universal layout for a given
set of adjacency requirements whenever such a layout exists.
