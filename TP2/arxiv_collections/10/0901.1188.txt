The evolution operator of a discrete-time quantum walk involves a conditional
shift in position space which entangles the coin and position degrees of
freedom of the walker. After several steps, the coin-position entanglement
(CPE) converges to a well defined value which depends on the initial state. In
this work we provide an analytical method which allows for the exact
calculation of the asymptotic reduced density operator and the corresponding
CPE for a discrete-time quantum walk on a two-dimensional lattice. We use the
von Neumann entropy of the reduced density operator as an entanglement measure.
The method is applied to the case of a Hadamard walk for which the dependence
of the resulting CPE on initial conditions is obtained. Initial states leading
to maximum or minimum CPE are identified and the relation between the coin or
position entanglement present in the initial state of the walker and the final
level of CPE is discussed. The CPE obtained from separable initial states
satisfies an additivity property in terms of CPE of the corresponding
one-dimensional cases. Non-local initial conditions are also considered and we
find that the extreme case of an initial uniform position distribution leads to
the largest CPE variation.
