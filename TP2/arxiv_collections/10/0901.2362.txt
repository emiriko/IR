We reformulate an approach fist given by Barbour and Bertotti (BB) for
implementing Mach's principle for nonrelativistic particles. This reformulation
can deal with arbitrary symmetry groups and finite group elements. Applying
these techniques to U(1) and SU(N) invariant scalar field theories, we show
that BB's proposal is nearly equivalent to defining a covariant derivative
using a dynamical connection. We then propose a modified version of the BB
method which implements Mach's principle using gauge theory techniques and
argue that this modified method is equivalent to the original. Given this
connection between the particle models and Yang-Mills theories, we consider the
effect of dynamic curvature as a possible generalization of the BB scheme.
Since the BB method can be used as a novel way of deriving geometrodynamics,
the connection with gauge theory may shed new light on the gauge properties of
the gravitational field.
