We present a novel method for the evaluation of shot noise in quasi
one-dimensional field-effect transistors, such as those based on carbon
nanotubes and silicon nanowires. The method is derived by using a statistical
approach within the second quantization formalism and allows to include both
the effects of Pauli exclusion and Coulomb repulsion among charge carriers. In
this way it extends Landauer-Buttiker approach by explicitly including the
effect of Coulomb repulsion on noise. We implement the method through the
self-consistent solution of the 3D Poisson and transport equations within the
NEGF framework and a Monte Carlo procedure for populating injected electron
states. We show that the combined effect of Pauli and Coulomb interactions
reduces shot noise in strong inversion down to 23 % of the full shot noise for
a gate overdrive of 0.4 V, and that neglecting the effect of Coulomb repulsion
would lead to an overestimation of noise up to 180 %.
