Long-lived charged massive particles (CHAMPs) appear in various particle
physics models beyond the Standard Model. In this Letter, we discuss the
prospects for studying the stopping and decaying events of such long-lived
CHAMPs at the LHC detectors, and show that the lifetime measurement (and the
study of decay products) is possible with the LHC detectors for a wide range of
the lifetime O(0.1)-O(10^{10}) sec, by using periods of no $pp$ collision. Even
a short lifetime of order one second can be measured by (i) identifying the
stopping event with the online Event Filter, (ii) immediately making a
beam-dump signal which stops the $pp$ collision of the LHC, and at the same
time (iii) changing the trigger menu to optimize it for the detection of a
CHAMP decay in the calorimeter. Other possibilities are also discussed.
