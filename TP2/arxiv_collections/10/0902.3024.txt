Ferromagnetic rings exhibit many novel physical phenomena with promise for
potential applications. Here, we focus on switching processes which are
fundamental properties of magnetic systems and are especially crucial for data
storage applications. A brief introduction on the advantages of ring geometries
is presented, followed by a background survey of the model and methods to study
nanomagnetic elements. The relevant magnetic states identified until now are
discussed, with special emphasis given to vortex, onion, and twisted states.
Such states are potential candidates for data storage applications. Switching
processes under uniform fields are categorized into three types, and their
mechanisms are explained in detail. In particular, explanations from a
topological point of view are shown to be enlightening. We conclude with a
brief discursion of circular field switching and data storage applications of
magnetic nanorings.
