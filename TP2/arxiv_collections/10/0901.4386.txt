Using Gabor analysis, we give a complete characterization of all lattice
sampling and interpolating sequences in the Fock space of polyanalytic
functions, displaying a "Nyquist rate" which increases with $n$, the degree of
polyanaliticity of the space. Such conditions are equivalent to sharp lattice
density conditions for certain vector-valued Gabor systems, namely superframes
and Gabor super-Riesz sequences with Hermite windows, and in the case of
superframes they were studied recently by Gr\"{o}chenig and Lyubarskii. The
proofs of our main results use variations of the Janssen-Ron-Shen duality
principle and reveal a duality between sampling and interpolation in
polyanalytic spaces, and multiple interpolation and sampling in analytic
spaces. To connect these topics we introduce the\emph{polyanalytic Bargmann
transform}, a unitary mapping between vector valued Hilbert spaces and
polyanalytic Fock spaces, which extends the Bargmann transform to polyanalytic
spaces. Motivated by this connection, we discuss a vector-valued version of the
Gabor transform. These ideas have natural applications in the context of
multiplexing of signals. We also point out that a recent result of Balan,
Casazza and Landau, concerning density of Gabor frames, has important
consequences for the Gr\"{o}chenig-Lyubarskii conjecture on the density of
Gabor frames with Hermite windows.
