It is shown that the Shan-Chen (SC) model for non-ideal lattice fluids can be
made compliant with a pseudo free-energy principle by simple addition of a
gradient force, whose expression is uniquely specified in terms of the fluid
density. This additional term is numerically shown to provide fairly negligible
effects on the system evolution during phase-separation. To the best of our
knowledge, these important properties of the SC model were not noted before.
The approach developed in the present work is based on a continuum analysis:
further extensions, more in line with a discrete lattice theory (X. Shan, {\it
Phys Rev E}, {\bf 77} 066702 (2008)) can be envisaged for the future.
