We investigate numerically at various fillings the ground state of the
one-dimensional Hubbard model with correlated hopping x (Hirsch model). It is
found that, for a wide range of filling values n around half filling, and for
repulsive Coulomb interaction u\leq u_c(x,n), phase separation at a nanoscale
(NPS phase) between two conducting phases at different densities occurs when
x\gtrsim 2/3. The NPS phase is accompanied by the opening of a spin gap and the
system behaves as a Luther-Emery Liquid with dominant superconducting
correlations. Close to half filling, an anomalous peak emerges in the charge
structure factor related to the density of doubly occupied sites, which
determines the size of the droplets in the NPS phase. For 1/2\lesssim x\lesssim
2/3 a crossover to a homogeneous phase, still superconducting, takes place.
