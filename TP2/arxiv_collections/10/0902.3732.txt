The orbital evolution of particles released from the surface of a rubble-pile
body by Earth's tides during flyby within the Roche limit is studied. Test
particles initially placed on the surface leave the surface and escape the
parent body. Released particles remain in a relative small cloud for about 500
years and spread evenly along the orbit of the parent asteroid during next
several hundred years. Their orbital elements exhibit very small dispersion in
the mentioned time frame.
