We define the notions of finite-state and functionally recursive matrices and
their growth. We also introduce two rings generated by functionally recursive
matrices. The first is isomorphic to the 2-generated free ring. The second is a
2-generated monomial ring such that the multiplicative semigroup of monomials
in the generators is nil of degree 5 and the ring has Gelfand Kirillov
dimension 1 + log(2)/log(a) where a=1/2(1+sqrt(5)).
