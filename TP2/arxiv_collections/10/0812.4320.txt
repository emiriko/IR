During the last few years the Tevatron has dramatically improved the bounds
on rare B-meson decays into two leptons. In the case of B_s --> mu+ mu-, the
current bound is only ten times greater than the Standard Model expectation.
Sensitivity to this decay is one of the benchmark goals for LHCb performance
and physics. The Higgs penguin dominates this rate in the region of large
tan(beta) of the MSSM. This is not necessarily the case in the region of low
tan(beta), since box and Z-penguin diagrams may contribute at a comparable
rate. In this article, we compute the complete one-loop MSSM contribution to B
--> l+l'- for l,l' = e, mu. We study the predictions for general values of
tan(beta) with arbitrary flavour mixing parameters. We discuss the possibility
of both enhancing and suppressing the branching ratios relative to their
Standard Model expectations. In particular, we find that there are
"cancellation regions" in parameter space where the branching ratio is
suppressed well below the Standard Model expectation, making it effectively
invisible to the LHC.
