The polarization properties of RX J1856.5-3754 are investigated, based on the
plasma emission model presented in previous works. It is shown that if the
emission of this source is generated by the synchrotron mechanism, the X-ray
and the optical emission are linearly polarized and the corresponding degrees
of linear polarization are calculated. The measurement of the polarization
patterns of this source appears to be most reliable way, to make clear its real
emission nature.
