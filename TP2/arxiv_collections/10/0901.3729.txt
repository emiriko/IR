The VISTA Data Flow System comprises nightly pipeline and archiving of near
infrared data from UKIRT-WFCAM and VISTA. This includes multi-epoch data which
can be used to find moving and variable objects. We have developed a new model
for archiving these data which gives the user an extremely flexible and
reliable data set that is easy to query through an SQL interface. We have
introduced several new database tables into our schema for deep/synoptic
datasets. We have also developed a set of curation procedures, which give
additional quality control and automation. We discuss the methods used and show
some example data. Our design is particularly effective on correlated
data-sets, where the observations in different filters are synchronised. It is
scalable to large VISTA datasets which will be observed in the next few years
and to future surveys such as Pan-STARRS and LSST.
