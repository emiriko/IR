Special calorimeters are needed to instrument the very forward region of an
ILC detector. These devices will improve the hermeticity being important for
new particle searches. A luminometer is foreseen to measure the rate of low
angle Bhabha scattering with a precision better than 10-3. A calorimeter
adjacent to the beam-pipe will be hit by a large amount of beamstrahlung
remnants. The amount and shape of these depositions will allow a fast
luminosity estimate and the determination of beam parameters. However, the
sensors must be extremely radiation hard. Finely segmented and very compact
calorimeters will match the requirements. Due to the high occupancy fast FE
electronics is needed. A possible design of the calorimeters is presented and
an overview on the R&D status is given
