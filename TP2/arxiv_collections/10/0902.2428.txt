We have studied the coherent excitation of a strongly coupled QD/photonic
crystal cavity system. Time-resolved reflectivity measurements show the vacuum
Rabi oscillation of the dot in the cavity. Next, we considered the resonant
driving of a cavity-detuned dot, which efficiently populates the cavity mode.
This cavity-controlled read-out channel allows high-resolution single quantum
dot spectroscopy. Autocorrelation measurements on the cavity mode show
antibunching and suggest the use of the resonantly driven QD/cavity system as
an on-demand source of single photons with potentially near-unity
indistinguishability.
