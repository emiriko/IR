We point out that, if one accepts the view that the standard second on an
atomic clock is dilated at low gravitational potential (ordinary gravitational
time dilation), then the standard meter must also be dilated at low
gravitational potential and by the same factor (gravitational space dilation).
These effects may be viewed as distortions of the time and length standards by
the gravitational field, and measurements made with these distorted standards
can be "corrected" by means of a conformal transformation applied to the usual
spacetime metric of general relativity. The surprising feature of this
single-observer picture is a substantial simplification of interpretation and
formalism for numerous phenomena in a static gravitational field as compared to
the conventional "many-observer" interpretation of general relativity.
