In this paper we study the possibility of sustaining an evolving wormhole via
exotic matter made of phantom energy in the presence of a cosmological
constant. We derive analytical evolving wormhole geometries by supposing that
the radial tension of the phantom matter, which is negative to the radial
pressure, and the pressure measured in the tangential directions have
barotropic equations of state with constant state parameters. In this case the
presence of a cosmological constant ensures accelerated expansion of the
wormhole configurations. More specifically, for positive cosmological constant
we have wormholes which expand forever and, for negative cosmological constant
we have wormholes which expand to a maximum value and then recolapse. At
spatial infinity the energy density and the pressures of the anisotropic
phantom matter threading the wormholes vanish; thus these evolving wormholes
are asymptotically vacuum $\Lambda$-Friedmann models with either open or closed
or flat topologies.
