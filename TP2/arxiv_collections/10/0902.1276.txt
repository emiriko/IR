We demonstrate an implementation scheme for constructing quantum gates using
unitary evolutions of the one-dimensional spin-J ferromagnetic XXZ chain. We
present numerical results based on simulations of the chain using the
time-dependent DMRG method and techniques from optimal control theory. Using
only a few control parameters, we find that it is possible to implement one-
and two-qubit gates on a system of spin-3/2 XXZ chains, such as Not, Hadamard,
Pi-8, Phase, and C-Not, with fidelity levels exceeding 99%.
