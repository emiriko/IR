The CALICE collaboration has constructed a hadronic sandwich calorimeter
prototype with 7608 scintillating plates, individually read out by multi-pixel
silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). For the first time ever the read out is
performed using SiPMs on a large scale. Results of test beam operations with
muon, positron and hadron beams at CERN are presented here, validating the
feasibility of the novel SiPM technology. Results of the application of the
particle flow approach in shower energy reconstruction are presented for the
first time ever using real data.
