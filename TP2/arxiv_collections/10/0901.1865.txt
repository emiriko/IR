The status of Monte Carlo programs for the simulation of tau-lepton
production and decay in high-energy accelerator experiments is reviewed. No
basic changes in the organization of the programs were necessary since the
previous tau-lepton conference in 2006. Minor in size, but practical,
extensions for the use of the programs in high precision mixed languages
environments are being introduced:
  (i) For the TAUOLA Monte Carlo generator of tau-lepton decays, automated and
simultaneous use of many versions of form-factors for the calculation of
optional weights for fits was discussed. A pilot example of its use was
presented. (ii) New tests for PHOTOS Monte Carlo for QED bremsstrahlung in W
decays were shown. (iii) Prototype version of the TAUOLA universal interface
based on HepMC (the C++ event record) was mentioned. Its tests with the help of
MC-TESTER were discussed.
  Presented results illustrate the status of the projects performed in
collaboration with Vladimir Cherepanov, Nadia Davidson, Piotr Golonka, Gizo
Nanava, Tomasz Przedzinski Elzbieta Richter-Was and others.
