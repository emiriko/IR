We use the emergent field of Complex Networks to analyze the network of
scientific collaborations between entities (universities, research
organizations, industry related companies,...) which collaborate in the context
of the so-called Framework Programme. We demonstrate here that it is a
scale--free network with an accelerated growth, which implies that the creation
of new collaborations is encouraged. Moreover, these collaborations possess
hierarchical modularity. Likewise, we find that the information flow depends on
the size of the participants but not on geographical constraints.
