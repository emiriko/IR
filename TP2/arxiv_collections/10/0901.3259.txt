It is well-known that in thin ferromagnetic film with a net magnetization
perpendicular to the film the collinear arrangement of spins is unstable in an
in-plane field $H$ smaller than its saturation value $H_c$. Existence of a
stripe phase was proposed with elongated domains of alternating direction of
magnetization component perpendicular to the film. We consider in the present
paper the strong-field regime $H<H_c$ and discuss the minimal microscopic model
describing this phenomenon, two-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet with strong
easy-axis anisotropy and dipolar forces. The noncollinear (stripe) phase is
discussed using the technique of the Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons.
Some previously unknown results are observed concerning the stripe phase.
Evolution is established of the spin arrangement in the noncollinear phase upon
the field rotation within the plane. We find a rapid decreasing of the period
of the stripe structure as the field decreases. We demonstrate that spins
components perpendicular to the film form a sinusoid in the noncollinear phase
at $H\approx H_c$ that transforms to a step-like profile upon the field
decreasing so that the domain wall density decreases from unity to a value much
smaller than unity. The spin-wave spectrum in the noncollinear phase is
discussed.
