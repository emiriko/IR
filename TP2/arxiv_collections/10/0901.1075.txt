The relationships among coronal loop structures at different temperatures is
not settled. Previous studies have suggested that coronal loops in the core of
an active region are not seen cooling through lower temperatures and therefore
are steadily heated. If loops were cooling, the transition region would be an
ideal temperature regime to look for a signature of their evolution. The
Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode provides monochromatic
images of the solar transition region and corona at an unprecedented cadence
and spatial resolution, making it an ideal instrument to shed light on this
issue. Analysis of observations of active region 10978 taken in 2007 December 8
-- 19 indicates that there are two dominant loop populations in the active
region: core multi-temperature loops that undergo a continuous process of
heating and cooling in the full observed temperature range 0.4-2.5 MK and even
higher as shown by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT); and peripheral loops which evolve
mostly in the temperature range 0.4-1.3 MK. Loops at transition region
temperatures can reach heights of 150 Mm in the corona above the limb and
develop downflows with velocities in the range of 39-105 km/s.
