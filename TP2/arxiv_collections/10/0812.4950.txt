We analyse one-loop radiative corrections to the inflationary potential in
the theory, where inflation is driven by the Standard Model Higgs field. We
show that inflation is possible provided the Higgs mass m_H lies in the
interval m_min<m_H<m_max, where m_min=[136.7+(m_t-171.2)*1.95]GeV,
m_max=[184.5+(m_t-171.2)*0.5]GeV and m_t is the mass of the top quark.
Moreover, the predictions of the spectral index of scalar fluctuations and of
the tensor-to-scalar ratio practically do not depend on the Higgs mass within
the admitted region and are equal to n_s=0.97 and r=0.0034 correspondingly.
