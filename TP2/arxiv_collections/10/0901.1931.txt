In this paper we show how an infinite system of coupled Toda-type nonlinear
differential equations derived by one of us can be used efficiently to
calculate the time-dependent pair-correlations in the Ising chain in a
transverse field. The results are seen to match extremely well long large-time
asymptotic expansions newly derived here. For our initial conditions we use new
long asymptotic expansions for the equal-time pair correlation functions of the
transverse Ising chain, extending an old result of T.T. Wu for the 2d Ising
model. Using this one can also study the equal-time wavevector-dependent
correlation function of the quantum chain, a.k.a. the q-dependent diagonal
susceptibility in the 2d Ising model, in great detail with very little
computational effort.
