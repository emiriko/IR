We consider the dynamics towards the initial singularity of Bianchi type IX
vacuum and orthogonal perfect fluid models with a linear equation of state. The
`Bianchi type IX attractor theorem' states that the past asymptotic behavior of
generic type IX solutions is governed by Bianchi type I and II vacuum states
(Mixmaster attractor). We give a comparatively short and self-contained new
proof of this theorem. The proof we give is interesting in itself, but more
importantly it illustrates and emphasizes that type IX is special, and to some
extent misleading when one considers the broader context of generic models
without symmetries.
