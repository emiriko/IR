We present the serendipitous discovery of an L subdwarf, 2MASS
J06164006-6407194, in a search of the Two Micron All Sky Survey for T dwarfs.
Its spectrum exhibits features indicative of both a cool and metal poor
atmosphere including a heavily pressured-broadened K I resonant doublet, Cs I
and Rb I lines, molecular bands of CaH, TiO, CrH, FeH, and H2O, and enhanced
collision induced absorption of H2. We assign 2MASS 0616-6407 a spectral type
of sdL5 based on a comparison of its red optical spectrum to that of near
solar-metallicity L dwarfs. Its high proper motion (mu =1.405+-0.008 arcsec
yr-1), large radial velocity (Vrad = 454+-15 km s-1), estimated uvw velocities
(94, -573, 125) km s-1 and Galactic orbit with an apogalacticon at ~29 kpc are
indicative of membership in the outer halo making 2MASS 0616-6407 the first
ultracool member of this population.
