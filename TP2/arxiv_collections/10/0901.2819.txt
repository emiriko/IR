We construct the CP-odd weak basis invariants from the neutrino mass matrix
in a weak basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal and find
the necessary and sufficient conditions for CP conservation. We study the
interrelationships between different CP-odd weak basis invariants to examine
their implications for the Dirac and Majorana type CP violating phases for the
phenomenologically allowed Frampton-Glashow-Marfatia texture zero structures of
the neutrino mass matrix.
