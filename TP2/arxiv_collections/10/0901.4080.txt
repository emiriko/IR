Since the topic emerged several years ago, work on regular model checking has
mostly been devoted to the verification of state reachability and safety
properties. Though it was known that linear temporal properties could also be
checked within this framework, little has been done about working out the
corresponding details. This paper addresses this issue in the context of
regular model checking based on the encoding of states by finite or infinite
words. It works out the exact constructions to be used in both cases, and
proposes a partial solution to the problem resulting from the fact that
infinite computations of unbounded configurations might never contain the same
configuration twice, thus making cycle detection problematic.
