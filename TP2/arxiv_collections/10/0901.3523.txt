We present a method of diagonalization for the sfermion mass matrices of the
minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). It provides analytical
expressions for the masses and mixing angles of rather general hermitian
sfermion mass matrices, and allows the study of scenarios that extend the usual
constrained - MSSM. Three signature cases are presented explicitly and a
general study of flavor changing neutral current processes is outlined in the
discussion.
