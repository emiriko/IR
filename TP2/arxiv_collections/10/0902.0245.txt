The two still unidentified MeV sources EGR J1122-5946 and AGL J2022+3622 are
here tentatively associated with soft gamma-ray candidate counterparts detected
through INTEGRAL/IBIS observations. On the basis of spatial proximity and/or
similar transient behaviour, we propose the supergiant fast X-ray transient
(SFXT) IGR J11215-5952 and the candidate SFXT IGR J20188+3647 as possible
candidate counterparts of EGR J1122-5946 and AGL J2022+3622, respectively. Our
findings possibly suggest that hard fast X-ray transients could represent a new
class of galactic transient MeV/TeV emitters. Additional evidence for the
existence of such new class is also provided by very recent AGILE and GLAST
discoveries on the galactic plane of several unidentified transient MeV sources
lasting only a few days.
