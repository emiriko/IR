The spectral distribution of positron created by photon and the spectral
distribution of photons radiated from electron in an oriented single crystal of
intermediate thickness is calculated at intermediate energies. The energy loss
of charged particles as well as photon absorption are taken into account. The
used basic probabilities of processes include the action of field of axis as
well as the multiple scattering of radiating electron or particles of the
created pair (the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect)
