Let X be a finite CW complex or compact Lipschitz neighborhood retract with
universal cover Z; let M be a compact orientable manifold of dimension at least
2 and nonempty boundary. We establish the existence of an isoperimetric profile
for functions from M to Z, in the metric and cellular senses, and show that
they are equivalent up to scaling factors when X is a triangulated CLNR (for
example a triangulated Riemannian manifold). This seems to be most interesting
when X is highly connected, but this is not required. We also show that two
finite complexes X and Y have the same profiles up to scaling given the
existence of a sufficiently connected map between them.
