We show that a top-prime quark as heavy as 600 GeV can be discovered at the
Tevatron, provided it is resonantly pair-produced via a vector color octet. If
the top-prime originates from a vectorlike quark, then the production of a
single top-prime in association with a top may also be observable, even through
its decay into a Higgs boson and a top. A color octet with mass of about 1 TeV,
which decays into a top-prime pair, may account for the CDF excess of
semileptonic (Wj)(Wj) events.
