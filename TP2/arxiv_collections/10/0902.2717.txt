Swift, high resolution CMOS pixel sensors are being developed for the ILC
vertex detector, aiming to allow approaching the interaction point very
closely. A major issue is the time resolution of the sensors needed to deal
with the high occupancy generated by the beam related background. A 128x576
pixel sensor providing digitised outputs at a read-out time of 92.5 us, was
fabricated in 2008 within the EU project EUDET, and tested with charged
particles at the CERN-SPS. Its prominent performances in terms of noise,
detection efficiency versus fake hit rate, spatial resolution and radiation
tolerance are overviewed. They validate the sensor architecture.
