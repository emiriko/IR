The doping dependence of the micro-Raman spectra of high quality
La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 microcrystals with x=0.0-0.45 has been investigated in the
region 10-300 K. The phonon at ~100 cm^{-1} of the orthorhombic phase shows a
classical soft mode behavior up to x=0.17, supporting its correlation with the
LTO to HTT transition. In the xx/yy polarization spectra of the superconducting
concentrations new modes at ~150 and 370 cm^{-1} related to the symmetry
breaking and a broad band at ~280 cm^{-1} are attributed to the charge ordering
at temperatures well above T_c. At all temperatures studied a correlation has
been found between the doping dependence of the transition temperature and the
intensity of the bands at ~150, ~280, ~370 cm^{-1}, the intensity of the La/Sr
mode, and the asymmetry of the apex phonon.
