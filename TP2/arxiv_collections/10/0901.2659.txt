The effects of locally random magnetic fields are considered in a
nonequilibrium Ising model defined on a square lattice with nearest-neighbors
interactions. In order to generate the random magnetic fields, we have
considered random variables $\{h\}$ that change randomly with time according to
a double-gaussian probability distribution, which consists of two single
gaussian distributions, centered at $+h_{o}$ and $-h_{o}$, with the same width
$\sigma$. This distribution is very general, and can recover in appropriate
limits the bimodal distribution ($\sigma\to 0$) and the single gaussian one
($ho=0$). We performed Monte Carlo simulations in lattices with linear sizes in
the range $L=32 - 512$. The system exhibits ferromagnetic and paramagnetic
steady states. Our results suggest the occurence of first-order phase
transitions between the above-mentioned phases at low temperatures and large
random-field intensities $h_{o}$, for some small values of the width $\sigma$.
By means of finite size scaling, we estimate the critical exponents in the
low-field region, where we have continuous phase transitions. In addition, we
show a sketch of the phase diagram of the model for some values of $\sigma$.
