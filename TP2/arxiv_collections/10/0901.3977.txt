We introduce a new and efficient numerical method for multicriterion optimal
control and single criterion optimal control under integral constraints. The
approach is based on extending the state space to include information on a
"budget" remaining to satisfy each constraint; the augmented
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE is then solved numerically. The efficiency of our
approach hinges on the causality in that PDE, i.e., the monotonicity of
characteristic curves in one of the newly added dimensions. A semi-Lagrangian
"marching" method is used to approximate the discontinuous viscosity solution
efficiently. We compare this to a recently introduced "weighted sum" based
algorithm for the same problem. We illustrate our method using examples from
flight path planning and robotic navigation in the presence of friendly and
adversarial observers.
