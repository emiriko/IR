The first phase of stellar evolution in the history of the universe may be
Dark Stars, powered by dark matter heating rather than by fusion. Weakly
interacting massive particles, which are their own antiparticles, can
annihilate and provide an important heat source for the first stars in the
universe. This and the previous contribution present the story of Dark Stars.
In this second part, we describe the structure of Dark Stars and predict that
they are very massive ($\sim 800 M_\odot$), cool (6000 K), bright ($\sim 10^6
L_\odot$), long-lived ($\sim 10^6$ years), and probable precursors to
(otherwise unexplained) supermassive black holes. Later, once the initial dark
matter fuel runs out and fusion sets in, dark matter annihilation can
predominate again if the scattering cross section is strong enough, so that a
Dark Star is born again.
