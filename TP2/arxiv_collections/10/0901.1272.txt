We show that there exist uncanceled soft divergences in the k_T factorization
for nonfactorizable amplitudes of two-body nonleptonic B meson decays, similar
to those identified in hadron hadroproduction. These divergences can be grouped
into a soft factor using the eikonal approximation, which is then treated as an
additional nonperturbative input in the perturbative QCD formalism. Viewing the
special role of the pion as a q-qbar bound state and as a pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone boson, we postulate that the soft effect associated with it is
significant. This soft factor enhances the nonfactorizable color-suppressed
tree amplitudes, such that the branching ratios B(pi^0 pi^0) and B(pi^0 rho^0)
are increased under the constraint of the B(rho^0 rho^0) data, the difference
between the direct CP asymmetries A_{CP}(pi^\mp K^\pm) and A_{CP}(pi^0 K^\pm)
is enlarged, and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry S_{pi^0 K_S} is reduced.
Namely, the known pi pi and pi K puzzles can be resolved simultaneously.
