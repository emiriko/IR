We study the presence of Pomeranchuk instabilities induced by interactions on
a Fermi liquid description of a graphene layer. Using a recently developed
generalization of Pomeranchuk method we present a phase diagram in the space of
fillings versus on-site and nearest neighbors interactions. Interestingly, we
find that for both interactions being repulsive an instability region exists
near the Van Hove filling, in agreement with earlier theoretical work. In
contrast, near half filling, the Fermi liquid behavior appears to be stable, in
agreement with theoretical results and experimental findings using ARPES. The
method allows for a description of the complete phase diagram for arbitrary
filling.
