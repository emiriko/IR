The recent demonstration by the CODALEMA Collaboration of the ability of the
radio-detection technique for the characterization of UHE cosmic-rays calls for
the use of this powerful method for the observation of UHE neutrinos. For this
purpose, an adaptation of the existing 21CM Array (China) is presently under
achievment. In an exceptionally low electromagnetic noise level, 10160
log-periodic 50-200 MHz antennas sit along two high valleys, surrounded by
mountain chains. This lay-out results in 30-60 km effective rock thicnesses for
neutrino interactions with low incidence trajectories along the direction of
two 4-6 km baselines. We will present first in-situ radio measurements
demonstrating that this environment shows particularly favourable conditions
for the observation of electromagnetic decay signals of taus originating from
the interaction of 10^17-20 eV tau neutrinos.
