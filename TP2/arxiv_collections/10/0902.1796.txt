We introduce the concept of a geometric categorical sl(2) action and relate
it to that of a strong categorical sl(2) action. The latter is a special kind
of 2-representation in the sense of Rouquier. The main result is that a
geometric categorical sl(2) action induces a strong categorical sl(2) action.
This allows one to apply the theory of strong sl(2) actions to various
geometric situations. Our main example is the construction of a geometric
categorical sl(2) action on the derived category of coherent sheaves on
cotangent bundles of Grassmannians.
