We present a series of theoretical studies of the boundary between a
superfluid and normal region in a partially polarized gas of strongly
interacting fermions. We present mean-field estimates of the surface energy in
this boundary as a function of temperature and scattering length. We discuss
the structure of the domain wall, and use a previously introduced
phenomonological model to study its influence on experimental observables.
  Our microscopic mean-field calculations are not consistent with the magnitude
of the surface tension found from our phenomonological modelling of data from
the Rice experiments. We conclude that one must search for novel mechanisms to
explain the experiments.
