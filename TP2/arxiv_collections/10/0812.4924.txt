Dynamical models of prototype gravastars made of phantom energy are
constructed, in which an infinitely thin spherical shell of a perfect fluid
with the equation of state $p = (1-\gamma)\sigma$ divides the whole spacetime
into two regions, the internal region filled with a dark energy (or phantom)
fluid, and the external Schwarzschild region. It is found that in some cases
the models represent the "bounded excursion" stable gravastars, where the thin
shell is oscillating between two finite radii, while in other cases they
collapse until the formation of black holes or normal stars. In the phase
space, the region for the "bounded excursion" gravastars is very small in
comparison to that of black holes, but not empty, as found in our previous
papers. Therefore, although the existence of gravastars can not be completely
excluded from current analysis, the opposite is not possible either, that is,
even if gravastars exist, they do not exclude the existence of black holes.
