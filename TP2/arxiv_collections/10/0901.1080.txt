We consider a model based on A4 semidirect product (Ze x Zmu x Ztau) flavor
symmetry for Tri-Bimaximal lepton mixing with two scalar A4-triplets whose
vacuum expectation values have the same alignment. Neutrino masses are
generated through effective dimension five Weinberg operators. Charged leptons
mass hierarchies are generated with an additional Froggatt-Nielsen U(1) flavor
symmetry under which right-handed leptons are charged.
