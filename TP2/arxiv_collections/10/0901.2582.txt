A modified Coherent 899-21 titanium sapphire laser is injection locked to
produce 6-6.5 W of single-frequency light at 852 nm. After closed-loop
amplitude control and frequency stabilization to a high-finesse cavity, it
delivers 4-4.5 W with <1 kHz linewidth at the output of a single-mode fiber.
The laser is tunable from about 700-1000 nm; up to 8 W should be possible at
750-810 nm.
