We present measurements of the branching fraction and fraction of
longitudinal polarization for the decay B+ -> K*0bar K*+ with a sample of 467
+/- 5 million BBbar pairs collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II
asymmetric-energy e+e- collider at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. We
obtain the branching fraction Br(B+ -> K*0bar K*+) = (1.2 +/- 0.5 +/- 0.1) x
10^{-6} with a significance of 3.7 standard deviations including systematic
uncertainties. We measure the fraction of longitudinal polarization f_L =
0.75+0.16-0.26 +/- 0.03. The first error quoted is statistical and the second
is systematic.
