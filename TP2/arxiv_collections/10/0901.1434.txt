Different choices exist for the renormalisation group resummation in the
determination of $\alpha_s$ from hadronic $\tau$ decays: namely fixed-order
(FOPT) and contour-improved perturbation theory (CIPT). The two approaches lead
to systematic differences in the resulting $\alpha_s$. On the basis of a model
for higher-order terms in the perturbative series, which incorporates
well-known structure from renormalons, it is found that while CIPT is unable to
account for the fully resummed series, FOPT smoothly approaches the Borel sum.
Employing the model to determine $\alpha_s$ yields $\alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.316 \pm
0.006$, which after evolution leads to $\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1180 \pm 0.0008$.
