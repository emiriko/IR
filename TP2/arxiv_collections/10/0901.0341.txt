A dynamic scheme basing on equation for T-matrix momentum transfer spectral
density and integral representation for Jost function is proposed for local
Dirac Hamiltonians in arbitrary N- dimension spaces and for Schrodinger one
with singular or nonlocal generalized Yukawa-type potentials. A generalization
of the off-shell-Jost function method for that Hamiltonians and universal
renormalization procedure of Jost function calculation for singular and
nonlocal potentials is proposed.
