Gamma-ray line emission from the radioactive decay of 26Al reflects
nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supernovae. We use INTEGRAL 26Al
measurements to characterize the distribution and characteristics of 26Al
source regions throughout the Galaxy. We detect the 26Al line from the inner
Galaxy at 28\sigma significance. The line appears narrow, and we constrain
broadening in the source regions to <1.3 keV (2\sigma). Different sky
distribution models do not significantly affect those large-scale results. The
26Al intensity for the inner Galaxy is derived as (2.9\pm 0.2)\times 10^{-4}ph\
cm^{-2} s^{-1} rad^{-1}, consistent with earlier results from COMPTEL and SPI
data. This can be translated to an 26Al mass of 2.7\pm 0.7 solar mass in the
Galaxy as a whole. The 26Al intensity is also confirmed to be somewhat brighter
in the 4th than in the 1st quadrant (ratio 1.3\pm 0.2). 26Al spectra separately
derived for regions along the Galactic plane show clear line centroid shifts,
attributed largely to the Galaxy's large-scale rotation. The 26Al line toward
the direction of the Aquila region (20deg < l < 40deg) appears somewhat
broadened. Latitudinal variations of 26Al emission towards the inner Galaxy are
studied, finding a latitudinal scale height of 130^{+120}_{-70} pc (1\sigma)
for 26Al in the inner Galaxy and a hint of peculiar 26Al emission towards the
region l<0deg, b>5deg.
