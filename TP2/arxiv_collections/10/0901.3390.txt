The connection of cluster mergers with the presence of extended, diffuse
radio sources in galaxy clusters is still being debated. In this paper we aim
to obtain new insights into the internal dynamics of Abell 959, showing
evidence of a diffuse radio source, analyzing velocities and positions of
member galaxies. Our analysis is based on redshift data for 107 galaxies in the
cluster field acquired at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We also use
photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Data Release 6). We combine
galaxy velocities and positions to select 81 galaxies recognized as cluster
members and determine global dynamical properties. We analyze the cluster
searching for substructures by using several statistical methods. We also study
the 2D galaxy distribution in the field of the cluster. We compare our results
with those from X-ray and gravitational lensing analyses. We estimate a cluster
redshift of z=0.2883 +/- 0.0004. We detect an NE high velocity group at 5' from
the cluster center with a relative line--of--sight (LOS) velocity of ~ +1900
km/s with respect to the main system. We also detect a central, dense structure
elongated along the SE--NW direction likely connected with the two dominant
galaxies and their surrounding cores. This elongated central structure is
probably the trace of an old cluster merger. The LOS velocity dispersion of
galaxies is very high (1025 (-75/+104) km/s). The virial mass is M(<R=1.48
Mpc)= 1.15 (-0.19/+0.25) Msun. Our results suggest that this cluster is forming
along two main directions of mass accretion and show the typical
characteristics of radio clusters; i.e., it is very massive and shows a young
dynamical state. However, deeper radio observations are needed to clarify the
nature of the diffuse radio emission in Abell 959.
