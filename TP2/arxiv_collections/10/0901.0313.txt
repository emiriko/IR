High-energy nuclear collision provide a unique tool to study the strongly
interacting medium. Recent results from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC) on \phi-meson production has revealed the formation of a dense partonic
medium. The medium constituents are found to exhibit collective behaviour
initiated due to partonic interactions in the medium. We present a brief review
of the recent results on \phi production in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. One
crucial question is where, in the phase diagram, does the transition happen for
the matter changing from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom. We discuss
how \phi-meson elliptic flow in heavy-ion collisions can be used for the search
of the QCD phase boundary.
