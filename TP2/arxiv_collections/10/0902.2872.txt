We have investigated the low-energy electronic structure of the heavy fermion
superconductor CeCoIn5 by angle-resolved photoemission and band structure
calculations. We measured the Fermi surface and energy distribution maps along
the high-symmetry directions at hn = 100 eV and T = 25 K. The compound has
quasi two-dimensional Fermi surface sheets centered at the M-A line of the
Brillouin zone. The band structure calculations have been carried out within
the local density approximation where the 4f electrons have been treated either
localized or itinerant. We discuss the comparison to the experimental data and
the implications for the nature of the 4f electrons at the given temperature.
