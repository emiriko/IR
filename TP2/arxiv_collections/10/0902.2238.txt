We present explicit upper bounds for the number and size of conjugacy classes
in finite Chevalley groups and their variations. These results have been used
by many authors to study zeta functions associated to representations of finite
simple groups, random walks on Chevalley groups, the final solution to the Ore
conjecture about commutators in finite simple groups and other similar
problems. In this paper, we solve a strong version of the Boston-Shalev
conjecture on derangements in simple groups for most of the families of
primitive permutation group representations of finite simple groups (the
remaining cases are settled in two other papers of the authors and applications
are given in a third).
