Lorentz's reciprocity lemma and Feld-Tai reciprocity theorem show the effect
of interchanging the action and reaction in Maxwell's equations. We derive a
free-space version of these reciprocity relations which generalizes the
conservation of the momentum-energy tensor. This relation corresponds to the
interference conservation of electromagnetic waves. We show that for any
transformation or symmetry that leaves Maxwell's equations invariant, we can
modify the reciprocity relation to introduce a conserving density, optical flux
and stress tensor extending Noether's theorem to a different context. We apply
this method to transformations that can be expressed as Hermitian operators and
more specifically we define the operators associated with the optical energy,
spin, linear and angular momentum.
