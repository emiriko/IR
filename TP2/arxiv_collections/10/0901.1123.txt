-Residue Number System (RNS) is a valuable tool for fast and parallel
arithmetic. It has a wide application in digital signal processing, fault
tolerant systems, etc. In this work, we introduce the 3-moduli set {2^n,
2^{2n}-1, 2^{2n}+1} and propose its residue to binary converter using the
Chinese Remainder Theorem. We present its simple hardware implementation that
mainly includes one Carry Save Adder (CSA) and a Modular Adder (MA). We compare
the performance and area utilization of our reverse converter to the reverse
converters of the moduli sets {2^n-1, 2^n, 2^n+1, 2^{2n}+1} and {2^n-1, 2^n,
2^n+1, 2^n-2^{(n+1)/2}+1, 2^n+2^{(n+1)/2}+1} that have the same dynamic range
and we demonstrate that our architecture is better in terms of performance and
area utilization. Also, we show that our reverse converter is faster than the
reverse converter of {2^n-1, 2^n, 2^n+1} for dynamic ranges like 8-bit, 16-bit,
32-bit and 64-bit however it requires more area.
