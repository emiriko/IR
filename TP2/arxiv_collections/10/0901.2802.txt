We show that in theories where the lowest energy excitations are not
quasiparticles but they form a continuum, the shear viscosity to entropy
density ratio goes to zero as the temperature goes to zero. In these theories
therefore there is no lower bound for the shear viscosity to entropy density
ratio, in contrast to the predictions coming from the AdS/CFT correspondence.
