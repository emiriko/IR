The spin 0 generalized phase space approach provides a general expression for
local current which depends on the choice of distribution function and
generally deviates from the Schrodinger current. It is shown that the
continuity equation restricts the admissible bilinear distributions such that
the current has a unique dependence on the wavefunction and coincides with the
non-relativistic limit of the relativistic spin 1/2 current for a spin
eigenstate, up to a constant vector. Examples of non-bilinear distributions
that have the latter property are given.
