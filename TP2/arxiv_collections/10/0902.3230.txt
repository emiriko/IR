We solve the entanglement classification under stochastic local operations
and classical communication (SLOCC) for all multipartite symmetric states in
the general $N$-qubit case. For this purpose, we introduce 2 parameters playing
a crucial role, namely the \emph{diversity degree} and the \emph{degeneracy
configuration} of a symmetric state. Those parameters give rise to a simple
method of identifying operational families of SLOCC entanglement classes of all
symmetric $N$-qubit states, where the number of families grows as the partition
function of the number of qubits.
