Nanocomposite films were fabricated by supersonic cluster beam deposition
(SCBD) of palladium clusters on Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surfaces. The
evolution of the electrical conductance with cluster coverage and microscopy
analysis show that Pd cluster are implanted in the polymer and form a
continuous layer extending for several tens of nanometers beneath the polymer
surface. This allows the deposition, using stencil masks, of cluster-assembled
Pd microstructures on PMMA showing a remarkably high adhesion compared to
metallic films obtained by thermal evaporation. These results suggest that SCBD
is a promising tool for the fabrication of metallic microstructures on flexible
polymeric substrates.
