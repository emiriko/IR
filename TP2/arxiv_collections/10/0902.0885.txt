We provide a new class of positive maps in matrix algebras. The construction
is based on the family of balls living in the space of density matrices of
n-level quantum system. This class generalizes the celebrated Choi map and
provide a wide family of entanglement witnesses which define a basic tool for
analyzing quantum entanglement.
