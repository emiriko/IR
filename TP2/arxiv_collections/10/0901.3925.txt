In \cite{kamz} the author proved that every quasiconformal harmonic mapping
between two Jordan domains with $C^{1,\alpha}$, $0<\alpha\le 1$, boundary is
bi-Lipschitz, providing that the domain is convex. In this paper we avoid the
restriction of convexity. More precisely we prove: any quasiconformal harmonic
mapping between two Jordan domains $\Omega_j$, $j=1,2$, with $C^{j,\alpha}$,
$j=1,2$ boundary is bi-Lipschitz.
