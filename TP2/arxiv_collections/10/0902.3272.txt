We study the effect of noise on the evolution of the growth factor of density
perturbations in the context of the LCDM model. Stochasticity is introduced as
a Wiener process amplified by an intensity parameter alpha. By comparing the
evolution of deterministic and stochastic cases for different values of alpha
we estimate the intensity level necessary to make noise relevant for
cosmological tests based on large-scale structure data. Our results indicate
that the presence of random forces underlying the fluid description can lead to
significant deviations from the nonstochastic solution at late times for
alpha>0.001.
