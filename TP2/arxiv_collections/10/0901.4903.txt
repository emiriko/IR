In June 2008 single-sided silicon strip sensors with 50 $\mu$m readout pitch
were tested in a highly energetic pion beam at the SPS at CERN. The purpose of
the test was to evaluate characteristic detector properties by varying the
strip width and the number of intermediate strips. The experimental setup and
first results for the spatial resolution are discussed.
