Using the Luthar--Passi method, we investigate the Zassenhaus and Kimmerle
conjectures for normalized unit groups of integral group rings of the Held and
O'Nan sporadic simple groups. We confirm the Kimmerle conjecture for the Held
simple group and also derive for both groups some extra information relevant to
the classical Zassenhaus conjecture.
