We investigate the fitness advantage associated with the robustness of a
phenotype against deleterious mutations using deterministic mutation-selection
models of quasispecies type equipped with a mesa shaped fitness landscape. We
obtain analytic results for the robustness effect which become exact in the
limit of infinite sequence length. Thereby, we are able to clarify a seeming
contradiction between recent rigorous work and an earlier heuristic treatment
based on a mapping to a Schr\"odinger equation. We exploit the quantum
mechanical analogy to calculate a correction term for finite sequence lengths
and verify our analytic results by numerical studies. In addition, we
investigate the occurrence of an error threshold for a general class of
epistatic landscape and show that diminishing epistasis is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for error threshold behavior.
