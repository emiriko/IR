We explicitly construct an infinite family of asymptotically good
concatenated quantum stabilizer codes where the outer code uses CSS-type
quantum Reed-Solomon code and the inner code uses a set of special quantum
codes. In the field of quantum error-correcting codes, this is the first time
that a family of asymptotically good quantum codes is derived from bad codes.
Its occurrence supplies a gap in quantum coding theory.
