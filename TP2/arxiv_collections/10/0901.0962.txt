We report on polarimetric observations of 100 pulsars centered on 774 MHz,
made using the Green Bank Telescope, presenting their polarization profiles and
polarized flux densities and comparing them with previous observations when
possible. For 67 pulsars, these are the first such measurements made.
Polarization profiles of 8 millisecond pulsars in our sample show wide profiles
and flat position-angle curves. Strong linear polarization, sometimes
approaching 100% of the total intensity, has been detected in all or a part of
the average pulse profiles of some pulsars. In general, circular polarization
is very weak, although it is observed to be extremely strong in the leading
component of PSR J1920+2650. Sense reversal of circular polarization as a
function of pulse phase has been detected from both core and other components
of more than 20 pulsars. Any relationship between the spin-down luminosity and
the percentage of linear polarization is not evident in our data at this
frequency.
