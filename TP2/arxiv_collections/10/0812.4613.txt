We have studied both clusters and bulk systems while investigating amorphous
states. We have varied the nature of interaction amongst the particles of the
system under consideration in order to reveal the possible presence of
universality (i.e. independence of the potential). For clusters, the number of
particles is varied to investigate the effect of finite size on various
properties. To study bulk amorphous systems, we actually use periodic crystals
with as large a primitive cell as possible. For any finite disorder, the number
of particles in the primitive cell should ideally be made arbitrarily large.
However, in practice, this is limited by the available computational resources.
We should note here that due to the periodic nature of our approximation to the
bulk disordered system, the analysis of spectral fluctuations becomes a lot
more subtle and has not been reported in this thesis. We report results only
on: (1) Universality in the density of states for clusters, (2) Universality in
spectral fluctuations in the case of clusters, and (3) Universality in the
density of states for bulk amorphous systems.
