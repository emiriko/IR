We derive analytical solutions for the system of two ultracold spin-polarized
fermions interacting in p wave and confined in an axially symmetric harmonic
trap. To this end we utilize p-wave pseudopotential with an energy-dependent
scattering volume. This allows to describe the scattering in tight trapping
potentials in the presence of scattering resonances. We verify predictions of
the pseudopotential treatment for some model interaction potential, obtaining
an excellent agreement with exact energy levels. Then we turn to the
experimentally relevant case of neutral atom interactions in the vicinity of a
p-wave Feshbach resonance. In the framework of the multichannel quantum-defect
theory we derive relatively simple formula for an energy-dependent scattering
volume, and later we apply it to investigate the energy spectrum of trapped
atoms close to the p-wave Feshbach resonance.
