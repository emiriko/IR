When using dimensional regularization, the bare couplings are expressed as a
power series in (2 - n/2)^{-1} where n is the number of dimensions. It is shown
how the renormalization group can be used to sum the leading pole, next to
leading pole etc. contributions to these sums in scalar electrodynamics (or any
theory with multiple couplings.)
