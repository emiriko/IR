Some fundamental and formal aspects of the quantum dwell time are reviewed,
examples for free motion and scattering off a potential barrier are provided,
as well as extensions of the concept. We also examine the connection between
the dwell time of a quantum particle in a region of space and flux-flux
correlations at the boundaries, as well as operational approaches and
approximations to measure the flux-flux correlation function and thus the
second moment of the dwell time, which is shown to be characteristically
quantum, and larger than the corresponding classical moment even for freely
moving particles.
