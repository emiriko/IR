For a subfamily of multiplicative measures on integer partitions we give
conditions for properly rescaled associated Young diagrams to converge in
probability to a certain deterministic curve named the limit shape of
partitions. We provide explicit formulas for the scaling function and the limit
shape covering some known and some new examples.
