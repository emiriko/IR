We investigate topology and temporal evolution of the foreign currency
exchange market viewed from a weighted network perspective. Based on exchange
rates for a set of 46 currencies (including precious metals), we construct
different representations of the FX network depending on a choice of the base
currency. Our results show that the network structure is not stable in time,
but there are main clusters of currencies, which persist for a long period of
time despite the fact that their size and content are variable. We find a
long-term trend in the network's evolution which affects the USD and EUR nodes.
In all the network representations, the USD node gradually loses its
centrality, while, on contrary, the EUR node has become slightly more central
than it used to be in its early years. Despite this directional trend, the
overall evolution of the network is noisy.
