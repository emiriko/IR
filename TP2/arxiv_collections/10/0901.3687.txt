Natural cilia are hair-like microtubule-based structures that are able to
move fluid at low Reynolds number through asymmetric motion. In this paper we
follow a biomimetic approach to design artificial cilia lining the inner
surface of microfluidic channels with the goal to propel fluid. The artificial
cilia consist of polymer films filled with magnetic nanoparticles. The
asymmetric, non-reciprocating motion is generated by tuning an external
magnetic field. To obtain the magnetic field and associated magnetization local
to the cilia we solve the Maxwell equations, from which the magnetic torques
can be deduced. To obtain the ciliary motion we solve the dynamic equations of
motion which are then fully coupled to the fluid dynamic equations that
describe fluid flow around the cilia. By doing so we show that by properly
tuning the applied magnetic field, asymmetric ciliary motion can be generated
that is able to propel fluid in a microchannel. The results are presented in
terms of three dimensionless parameters that fully delineate the asymmetry and
cycle time as a function of the relative contribution of elastic, inertial,
magnetic and viscous fluid forces.
