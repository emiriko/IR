Using accurate and fully general-relativistic simulations we assess the
effect that magnetic fields have on the gravitational-wave emission produced
during the inspiral and merger of magnetized neutron stars. In particular, we
show that magnetic fields have an impact after the merger, because they are
amplified by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but also during the inspiral, most
likely because the magnetic tension reduces the stellar tidal deformation for
extremely large initial magnetic fields, B_0>~10^{17}G. We quantify the
influence of magnetic fields by computing the overlap, O, between the waveforms
produced during the inspiral by magnetized and unmagnetized binaries. We find
that for any realistic magnetic field strength B_0<~10^{14}G the overlap during
the inspiral is O>~0.999 and is quite insensitive to the mass of the neutron
stars. Only for unrealistically large magnetic fields like B_0~10^{17}G the
overlap does decrease noticeably, becoming at our resolutions O<~0.76/0.67 for
stars with baryon masses M_b~1.4/1.6 Msun, respectively. Because neutron stars
are expected to merge with magnetic fields ~10^{8}-10^{10}G and because present
detectors are sensitive to O<~0.995, we conclude that it is very unlikely that
the present detectors will be able to discern the presence of magnetic fields
during the inspiral of neutron stars.
