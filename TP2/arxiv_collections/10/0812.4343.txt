By examining two counterexamples to the existing theory, it is shown, with
mathematical rigor, that as far as scattered particles are concerned the true
distribution function is in principle not determinable (indeterminacy principle
or uncertainty principle) while the average distribution function over each
predetermined finite velocity solid-angle element can be calculated.
