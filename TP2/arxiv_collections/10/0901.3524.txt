Effects of the lightest neutrino mass in "flavoured" leptogenesis when the
CP-violation necessary for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the
Universe is due exclusively to the Dirac and/or Majorana phases in the neutrino
mixing matrix $U$ are discussed. The type I see-saw scenario with three heavy
right-handed Majorana neutrinos having hierarchical spectrum is considered. The
"orthogonal" parametrisation of the matrix of neutrino Yukawa couplings, which
involves a complex orthogonal matrix $R$, is employed. Results for light
neutrino mass spectrum with normal and inverted ordering (hierarchy) are
reviewed.
