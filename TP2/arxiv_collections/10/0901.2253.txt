We discuss a strongly entangled two-particle state of motion that emerges
naturally from the double-pulse dissociation of a diatomic molecule. This
state, which may be called dissociation-time entangled, permits the unambiguous
demonstration of non-classical correlations by violating a Bell inequality
based on switched single particle interferometry and only position
measurements. We apply time-dependent scattering theory to determine the
detrimental effect of dispersion. The proposed setup brings into reach the
possibility of establishing non-classical correlations with respect to system
properties that are truly macroscopically distinct.
