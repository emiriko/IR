We compare the amount of magnetic flux measured in Stokes V and Stokes I in a
sample of early- and mid-M stars around the boundary to full convection
(~M3.5). Early-M stars possess a radiative core, mid-M stars are fully
convective. While Stokes V is sensitive to the net polarity of magnetic flux
arising mainly from large-scale configurations, Stokes I measurements can see
the total mean flux. We find that in early-M dwarfs, only ~6% of the total
magnetic flux is detected in Stokes V. This ratio is more than twice as large,
~14%, in fully convective mid-M dwarfs. The bulk of the magnetic flux on
M-dwarfs is not seen in Stokes V. This is presumably because magnetic flux is
mainly stored in small scale components. There is also more to learn about the
effect of the weak-field approximation on the accuracy of strong field
detections. In our limited sample, we see evidence for a change in magnetic
topology at the boundary to full convection. Fully convective stars store a 2-3
times higher fraction of their flux in fields visible to Stokes V. We estimate
the total magnetic energy detected in Stokes I and compare it to results from
Stokes V. We find that in early-M dwarfs only ~0.5% of the total magnetic
energy is detected in Stokes V while this fraction is ~2.5% in mid-M dwarfs.
