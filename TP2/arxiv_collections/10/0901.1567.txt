It is revealed that ensembles consisting of multipartite quantum states can
exhibit different kinds of nonlocalities. An operational measure is introduced
to quantify nonlocalities in ensembles consisting of bipartite quantum states.
Various upper and lower bounds for the measure are estimated and the exact
values for ensembles consisting of mutually orthogonal maximally entangled
bipartite states are evaluated.
