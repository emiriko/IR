Given a rational homogeneous variety G/P where G is complex simple and of
type ADE, we prove that all tangent bundles T_{G/P} are simple, meaning that
their only endomorphisms are scalar multiples of the identity. This result
combined with Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence implies stability of these
tangent bundles with respect to the anticanonical polarization. Our main tool
is the equivalence of categories between homogeneous vector bundles on G/P and
finite dimensional representations of a given quiver with relations.
