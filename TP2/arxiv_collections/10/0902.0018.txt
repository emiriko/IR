In this paper we use the angular deficit scheme [V. Borrelli, F. Cazals, and
J.-M. Morvan, {\sl Computer Aided Geometric Design} {\bf 20}, 319 (2003)] to
determine the distribution of Gaussian curvature in developable cones (d-cones)
[E. Cerda, S. Chaieb, F. Melo, and L. Mahadevan, {\sl Nature} {\bf 401}, 46
(1999)] numerically. These d-cones are formed by pushing a thin elastic sheet
into a circular container. Negative Gaussian curvatures are identified at the
rim where the sheet touches the container. Around the rim there are two narrow
bands with positive Gaussian curvatures. The integral of the (negative)
Gaussian curvature near the rim is almost completely compensated by that of the
two adjacent bands. This suggests that the Gauss-Bonnet theorem which
constrains the integral of Gaussian curvature globally does not explain the
spontaneous curvature cancellation phenomenon [T. Liang and T. A. Witten, {\sl
Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 73}, 046604 (2006)]. The locality of the compensation seems
to increase for decreasing d-cone thickness. The angular deficit scheme also
provides a new way to confirm the curvature cancellation phenomenon.
