The fallacy that the many worlds intepretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics
implies certain survival in quantum Russian roulette-like situations (the
'Quantum Suicide' (QS) thought experiment) has become common enough that it is
now necessary to publicly debunk this belief despite the risk of further
publicizing it. 'Quantum Immortality' is an extension of the QS Fallacy (QSF)
with some additional unlikely assumptions. The QS/QI ideas are examined here
and shown to be false.
