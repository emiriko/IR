In this note we give evidence for an equality of the spectra, including
wrapping, of the SU(2)-sector spin chain for real deformations beta and
beta+1/L, in marginally beta-deformed N=4 Yang-Mills, which appears after
relaxing the cyclicity constraint. Evidence for the equality is given by
evaluating the first wrapping correction to the energy of the undeformed magnon
of momentum pi, and the beta=1/2, physical magnon, for several spin chain
lengths L. We also show that the term of maximal transcendentality coincides
for both magnons to all L. As a by-product we provide an expression for the
first wrapping correction to the beta = 1/2 single-magnon operator dimension,
valid for all even L. We then apply the symmetry to the magnon dispersion
relation of N=4, obtaining its first wrapping correction for a discrete set of
magnon momenta.
