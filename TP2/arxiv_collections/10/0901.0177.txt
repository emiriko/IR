We report the 75As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement of the
hole-doped superconductor Ba1-xKxFe2As2 with different lattice parameters and
different superconducting volume fractions (Tc = 38K). 75As-NMR spectra
revealed that the magnetically ordered and superconducting phases are
microscopically separated. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 in the normal
state reflects the existence of a large two-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuation. The 1/T1 in the superconducting state down to the lowest
measurement temperature T varies close to T^3. In addition, it exhibits no
coherence peak just below Tc. This shows a T dependence similar to those of
other iron pnictides.
