X-rays from planetary nebulae (PNs) are believed to originate from a shock
driven into the fast stellar wind (v ~ 1000 km/s) as it collides with an
earlier circumstellar slow wind (v ~ 10 km/s). In theory, the shocked fast wind
(hot bubble) and the ambient cold nebula can remain separated by magnetic
fields along a surface referred to as the contact discontinuity (CD) that
inhibits diffusion and heat conduction. The CD region is extremely difficult to
probe directly owing to its small size and faint emission. This has largely
left the study of CDs, stellar-shocks, and the associated micro-physics in the
realm of theory. This paper presents spectroscopic evidence for ions from the
hot bubble (kT ~ 100 eV) crossing the CD and penetrating the cold nebular gas
(kT ~ 1 eV). Specifically, a narrow radiative recombination continuum (RRC)
emission feature is identified in the high resolution X-ray spectrum of the PN
BD+30 3639 indicating bare C VII ions are recombining with cool electrons at
kT_e=1.7+-1.3 eV. An upper limit to the flux of the narrow RRC of H-like C VI
is obtained as well. The RRCs are interpreted as due to C ions from the hot
bubble of BD+30 3639 crossing the CD into the cold nebula, where they
ultimately recombine with its cool electrons. The RRC flux ratio of C VII to C
VI constrains the temperature jump across the CD to Delta kT > 80 eV, providing
for the first time direct evidence for the stark temperature disparity between
the two sides of an astrophysical CD, and constraining the role of magnetic
fields and heat conduction accordingly. Two colliding-wind binaries are noted
to have similar RRCs suggesting a temperature jump and CD crossing by ions may
be a common feature of stellar wind shocks.
