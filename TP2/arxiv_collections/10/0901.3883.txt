When an electromagnetic wave is obliquely incident on an inhomogeneous high
density plasma, it will be absorbed resonantly as long as it is polarized in
the plane of incidence and has an electric field component along the plasma
electron density gradient. This process takes place by linear mode conversion
into an electron plasma wave. In this paper, we have considered the resonant
absorption of laser light near the critical density of a plasma with linear
electron density profile. The behaviour of the electric and magnetic vectors of
a laser light propagating through inhomogeneous plasma has been studied by
calculating them using Maxwell's equations using a new semi-analytical model.
The absorbed fraction of the laser light energy, then, evaluated and plotted
versus the angle of incidence. It has been shown that this new model can
explain the previous classical approximated results at high density scale
lengths as well as the reported numerical results in almost all density scale
lengths.
