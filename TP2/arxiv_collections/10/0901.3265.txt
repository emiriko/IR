We study successive measurements of two observables using von Neumann's
measurement model. The two-pointer correlation for arbitrary coupling strength
allows retrieving the initial system state. We recover Luders rule, the Wigner
formula and the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution in the appropriate limits of the
coupling strength.
