We study transport of non-interacting electrons through two quantum dot
molecules embedded in an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. The system in
equilibrium exhibits bound states in the continuum (BIC) and total suppression
of transmission. It also shows a magnetic flux-dependent effective level
attraction and lines of perfect transmission when the intramolecular coupling
is weak. Out of equilibrium, the current displays two kind of negative
differential conductance (NDC) regions, which have different origins. One is
generated by the usual mechanism of the NDC arising in a double quantum dot
system. The other is induced by the magnetic flux, and it occurs at small
voltages and for a well definite range of the intramolecular couplings. We
explain this effect in terms of the level attraction displayed by the system.
