We present new 7 mm and archive 1.3 cm high angular resolution observations
of the HL/XZ Tau region made with the VLA. At 7 mm, the emission from HL Tau
seems to be arising in a clumpy disk with radius of order 25 AU. The 1.3 cm
emission from XZ Tau shows the emission from a binary system with 0"3 (42 AU)
separation, known from previous optical/IR observations. However, at 7 mm, the
southern radio component resolves into a binary with 0"09 (13 AU) separation,
suggesting that XZ Tau is actually a triple star system. We suggest that the
remarkable ejection of gas from the XZ Tau system observed with the HST may be
related to a periastron passage of this newly discovered close binary system.
