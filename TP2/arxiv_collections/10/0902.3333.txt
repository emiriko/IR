Motivated by the hyperfine interaction of electron spins with surrounding
nuclei, we investigate systems of central spins coupled to a bath of
noninteracting spins in the framework of random matrix theory. With increasing
number of central spins a transition from Poissonian statistics to the Gaussian
orthogonal ensemble occurs which can be described by a generalized Brody
distribution. These observations are unaltered upon applying an external
magnetic field. In the transition region, the classical counterparts of the
models studied have mixed phase space.
