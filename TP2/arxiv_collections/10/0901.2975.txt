The scheme of quantum teleportation, where Bob has multiple (N) output ports
and obtains the teleported state by simply selecting one of the N ports, is
thoroughly studied. We consider both deterministic version and probabilistic
version of the teleportation scheme aiming to teleport an unknown state of a
qubit. Moreover, we consider two cases for each version: (i) the state employed
for the teleportation is fixed to a maximally entangled state, and (ii) the
state is also optimized as well as Alice's measurement. We analytically
determine the optimal protocols for all the four cases, and show the
corresponding optimal fidelity or optimal success probability. All these
protocols can achieve the perfect teleportation in the asymptotic limit of
$N\to\infty$. The entanglement properties of the teleportation scheme are also
discussed.
