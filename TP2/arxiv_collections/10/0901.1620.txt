We prove the Erdos-Turan equidistribution inequality, using a construction
due to Chebyshev, Markov, and Stieltjes. The method is applicable in a more
general setting. As an example, we state another inequality that can be proved
using this method. The inequality can be used to get an error estimate in
Wigner's law which is sharp near the edge.
