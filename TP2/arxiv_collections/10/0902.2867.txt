We present a general model to account for the multimode nature of the quantum
electromagnetic field in projective photon-counting measurements. We focus on
photon-subtraction experiments, where non-gaussian states are produced
conditionally. These are useful states for continuous-variable quantum
information processing. We present a general method called mode reduction that
reduces the multimode model to an effective two-mode problem. We apply this
method to a multimode model describing broadband parametric downconversion,
thereby improving the analysis of existing experimental results. The main
improvement is that spatial and frequency filters before the photon detector
are taken into account explicitly. We find excellent agreement with previously
published experimental results, using fewer free parameters than before, and
discuss the implications of our analysis for the optimized production of states
with negative Wigner functions.
