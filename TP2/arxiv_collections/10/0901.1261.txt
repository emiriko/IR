A bottleneck simulation of road traffic on a loop, using the deterministic
cellular automata (CA) Nagel-Schreckenberg model with zero dawdling
probability, reveals three types of stationary wave solutions. They consist of
i) two shock waves, one at each bottleneck boundary, ii) one shock wave at the
boundary and one on the "open" road, and iii) the trivial solution, i.e.
homogeneous, uniform flow. These solutions are selected dynamically from a
range of kinematicly permissible stationary shocks. This is similar in fashion
to the wave selection in a bottleneck simulation of the optimal-velocity (OV)
model, which is explained by a travelling wave phase-plane analysis of the
corresponding continuum model. It is yet another strong indication that CA and
OV models share certain underlying dynamics, although the former are discrete
in space and time while the latter are continuous.
