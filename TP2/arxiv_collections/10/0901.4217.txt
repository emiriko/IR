Equation of state for superdense nuclear matter is considered in the
framework of relativistic mean-field theory, when the scalar-isovector -meson
effective field is taken into account, as well. Assuming that the transition to
the strange quark matter is a usual first-order phase transition described by
Maxwells construction, the changes of the parameters of phase transition caused
by the presence of -meson field are investigated. To describe a quark phase the
advanced version of the MIT bag model is used, in which the interactions
between quarks are taken into account in the one-gluon exchange approximation.
For different values of the bag constant B, some series of the equations of the
state of matter with deconfinement phase transition are constructed. Also the
upper bound, Bcr, corresponding to the unstable state of the infinitizimal
quark core in a neutron star is found.
