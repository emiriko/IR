Nuclear physics offers us a powerful tool: using nuclear resonance absorption
lines to infer the physical conditions in astrophysical settings which are
otherwise difficult to deduce. Present-day technology provides an increase in
sensitivity over previous gamma-ray missions large enough to utilize this tool
for the first time. The most exciting promise is to measure gamma-ray bursts
from the first star(s) at redshifts 20-60, but also active galactic nuclei are
promising targets.
