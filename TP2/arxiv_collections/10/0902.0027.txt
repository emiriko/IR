We analyze the co-alignment between Hinode's BFI-Gband images and
simultaneous SP maps with the aim of characterizing the general off-sets
between them and the second order non-linear effects in SP's slit scanning
mechanism. We provide calibration functions and parameters to correct for the
nominal pixel scales and positioning.
