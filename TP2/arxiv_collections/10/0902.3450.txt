We use the results of first-principles electronic structure calculations and
a strong coupling perturbation approach, together with general theoretical
arguments, to illustrate the differences in super-exchange interactions between
the copper-oxides and iron-pnictides. We show that the two magnetic ground
states can be understood in a simple manner within the same theoretical
foundation. Contrary to the emerging view that magnetic order in the
iron-pnictides is of itinerant nature, we argue that the observed magnetic
moment is small because of frustration introduced by the electrons of the Fe
orbitals as they compete to impose their preferred magnetic ordering.
