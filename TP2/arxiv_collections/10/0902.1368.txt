We use the power density spectra obtained by fluctuation-enhanced sensing of
bacterial odors (Escherichia coli and Anthrax-surrogate Bacillus subtilis) to
generate new, highly distinguishable, types of patterns based on the average
slope of the spectra in different frequency ranges. Such plots can be
considered as "fingerprints" of bacterial odors. Three different ways of
pattern generation are tested, including a simple binary version. The obtained
patterns are simple enough to identify the situation by the naked eye without a
pattern recognizer.
