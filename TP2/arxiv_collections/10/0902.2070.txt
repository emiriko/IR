Pareto law, which states that wealth distribution in societies have a
power-law tail, has been a subject of intensive investigations in statistical
physics community. Several models have been employed to explain this behavior.
However, most of the agent based models assume the conservation of number of
agents and wealth. Both these assumptions are unrealistic. In this paper, we
study the limiting wealth distribution when one or both of these assumptions
are not valid. Given the universality of the law, we have tried to study the
wealth distribution from the asset exchange models point of view. We consider
models in which a) new agents enter the market at constant rate b) richer
agents fragment with higher probability introducing newer agents in the system
c) both fragmentation and entry of new agents is taking place. While models a)
and c) do not conserve total wealth or number of agents, model b) conserves
total wealth. All these models lead to a power-law tail in the wealth
distribution pointing to the possibility that more generalized asset exchange
models could help us to explain emergence of power-law tail in wealth
distribution.
