The problem of the logarithmic discretization of an arbitrary positive
function (such as the density of states) is studied in general terms.
Logarithmic discretization has arbitrary high resolution around some chosen
point (such as Fermi level) and it finds application, for example, in the
numerical renormalization group (NRG) approach to quantum impurity problems
(Kondo model), where the continuum of the conduction band states needs to be
reduced to a finite number of levels with good sampling near the Fermi level.
The discretization schemes under discussion are required to reproduce the
original function after averaging over different interleaved discretization
meshes, thus systematic deviations which appear in the conventional logarithmic
discretization are eliminated. An improved scheme is proposed in which the
discretization-mesh points themselves are determined in an adaptive way; they
are denser in the regions where the function has higher values. Such schemes
help in reducing the residual numeric artefacts in NRG calculations in
situations where the density of states approaches zero over extended intervals.
A reference implementation of the solver for the differential equations which
determine the full set of discretization coefficients is also described.
