This whitepaper is the result of discussions and presentations initiated at
the DUSEL Town Meeting held in Washington in November 2007. The essential
elements of this report are:
  - The quest to detect dark matter is a science goal of the very highest
priority, and is flagship science for DUSEL.
  - The dark matter community presents here a Roadmap for a set of proposals
for the Initial Suite of Experiments. The science goals will be reached in two
phases of experiments, at the 4850 and 7400 ft levels, respectively.
  - The US is currently the world leader in the search for WIMP dark matter.
Constructing DUSEL will ensure that the US will continue its leading role and
attract international collaborators to DUSEL.
