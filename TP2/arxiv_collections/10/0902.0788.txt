We consider the diffusion equation in the setting of operator theory. In
particular, we study the characterization of the limit of the diffusion
operator for diffusivities approaching zero on a subdomain $\Omega_1$ of the
domain of integration of $\Omega$. We generalize Lions' results to covering the
case of diffusivities which are piecewise $C^1$ up to the boundary of
$\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$, where $\Omega_2 := \Omega \setminus
\overline{\Omega}_1$ instead of piecewise constant coefficients. In addition,
we extend both Lions' and our previous results by providing the strong
convergence of $(A_{\bar{p}_\nu}^{-1})_{\nu \in \mathbb{N}^\ast},$ for a
monotonically decreasing sequence of diffusivities $(\bar{p}_\nu )_{\nu \in
\mathbb{N}^\ast}$.
