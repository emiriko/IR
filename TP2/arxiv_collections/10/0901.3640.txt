The primary focus of this dissertation is the study of the Casimir effect and
the possibility that this phenomenon may serve as a mechanism to mediate higher
dimensional stability, and also as a possible mechanism for creating a small
but non-zero vacuum energy density. In chapter one we review the nature of the
quantum vacuum and discuss the different contributions to the vacuum energy
density arising from different sectors of the standard model. Next, in chapter
two, we discuss cosmology and the introduction of the cosmological constant
into Einstein's field equations. In chapter three we explore the Casimir effect
and study a number of mathematical techniques used to obtain a finite physical
result for the Casimir energy. We also review the experiments that have
verified the Casimir force. In chapter four we discuss the introduction of
extra dimensions into physics. We begin by reviewing Kaluza Klein theory, and
then discuss three popular higher dimensional models: bosonic string theory,
large extra dimensions and warped extra dimensions. Chapter five is devoted to
an original derivation of the Casimir energy we derived for the scenario of a
higher dimensional vector field coupled to a scalar field in the fifth
dimension. In chapter six we explore a range of vacuum scenarios and discuss
research we have performed regarding moduli stability. Chapter seven explores a
novel approach to spacecraft propulsion we have proposed based on the idea of
manipulating the extra dimensions of string/M theory. Finally, in chapter 8, we
discuss some issues in heterotic string phenomenology derived from the free
fermionic approach.
