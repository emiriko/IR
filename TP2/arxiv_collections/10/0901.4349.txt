Let p_j^(n) be the probability that a Hadamard quantum walk, started at site
j on the integer lattice {0,...,n}, is absorbed at 0. We give an explicit
formula for p_j^(n). Our formula proves a conjecture of John Watrous,
concerning an empirically observed linear fractional recurrence relation for
the numbers p_1^(n).
