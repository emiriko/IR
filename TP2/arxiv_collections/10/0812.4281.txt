We present small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and Bitter decoration
studies of the superconducting vortices in
Ba(Fe$_{0.93}$Co$_{0.07}$)$_2$As$_2$}. A highly disordered vortex configuration
is observed at all measured fields, and is attributed to strong pinning. This
conclusion is supported by the absence of a Meissner rim in decoration images
obtained close to the sample edge. The field dependence of the magnitude of the
SANS scattering vector indicates vortex lattice domains of (distorted)
hexagonal symmetry, consistent with the decoration images which show primarily
6-fold coordinated vortex domains. An analysis of the scattered intensity shows
that this decreases much more rapidly than expected from estimates of the upper
critical field, consistent with the large degree of disorder.
