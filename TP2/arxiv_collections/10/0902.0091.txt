We review neutron scattering investigations of the crystal structures,
magnetic structures, and spin dynamics of the iron-based RFe(As,P)O (R=La, Ce,
Pr, Nd), (Ba,Sr,Ca)Fe2As2, and Fe1+x(Te-Se) systems. On cooling from room
temperature all the undoped materials exhibit universal behavior, where a
tetragonal-to-orthorhombic/monoclinic structural transition occurs, below which
the systems become antiferromagnets. For the first two classes of materials the
magnetic structure within the a-b plane consists of chains of parallel Fe spins
that are coupled antiferromagnetically in the orthogonal direction, with an
ordered moment typically less than one Bohr magneton. Hence these are itinerant
electron magnets, with a spin structure that is consistent with Fermi-surface
nesting and a very energetic spin wave bandwidth ~0.2 eV. With doping, the
structural and magnetic transitions are suppressed in favor of
superconductivity. Magnetic correlations are observed in the superconducting
regime, with a magnetic resonance that follows the superconducting order
parameter just like the cuprates. The rare-earth moments order
antiferromagnetically at low T like conventional magnetic-superconductors.
Pressure in CaFe2As2 transforms the system from a magnetically ordered
orthorhombic material to a collapsed non-magnetic tetragonal system. Tetragonal
Fe1+xTe transforms to a low T monoclinic structure at small x that changes to
orthorhombic at larger x, which is accompanied by a crossover from commensurate
to incommensurate magnetic order. Se doping suppresses the magnetic order.
