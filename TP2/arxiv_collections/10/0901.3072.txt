The output fields of a pair of coherently coupled nonlinear optical cavities
are found to exhibit strong optical entanglement. For sufficiently strong
coupling the quantum correlations become asynchronous providing a resource for
quantum information protocols such as all-optical quantum memories. A
straightforward experimental implementation applicable to whispering gallery
mode resonators such as microtoroids is proposed.
