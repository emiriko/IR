We study the combinatorial and structural properties of the circle map
sequences. We introduce an embedding procedure which gives a map from the
hull(closure of the set of translates) to the sequence of embedding operations
through which we study the structure of the hull. We also study the set of
admissible words and classify them in terms of their appearance.
