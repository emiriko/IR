We present an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing a pure state on a
quantum computer, where the quantum state corresponds to that of a molecular
system with a given number $m$ of electrons occupying a given number $n$ of
spin orbitals. Each spin orbital is mapped to a qubit: the states $| 1 >$ and
$| 0>$ of the qubit represent, respectively, whether the spin orbital is
occupied by an electron or not. To prepare a general state in the full Hilbert
space of $n$ qubits, which is of dimension $2^{n}$%, $O(2^{n})$ controlled-NOT
gates are needed, i.e., the number of gates scales \emph{exponentially} with
the number of qubits. We make use of the fact that the state to be prepared
lies in a smaller Hilbert space, and we find an algorithm that requires at most
$O(2^{m+1} n^{m}/{m!})$ gates, i.e., scales \emph{polynomially} with the number
of qubits $n$, provided $n\gg m$. The algorithm is simulated numerically for
the cases of the hydrogen molecule and the water molecule. The numerical
simulations show that when additional symmetries of the system are considered,
the number of gates to prepare the state can be drastically reduced, in the
examples considered in this paper, by several orders of magnitude, from the
above estimate.
