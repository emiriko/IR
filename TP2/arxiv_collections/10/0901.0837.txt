We derive the structural relations between nested harmonic sums and the
corresponding Mellin transforms of Nielsen integrals and harmonic
polylogarithms at weight {\sf w = 6}. They emerge in the calculations of
massless single--scale quantities in QED and QCD, such as anomalous dimensions
and Wilson coefficients, to 3-- and 4--loop order. We consider the set of the
multiple harmonic sums at weight six without index $\{-1\}$. This restriction
is sufficient for all known physical cases. The structural relations supplement
the algebraic relations, due to the shuffle product between harmonic sums,
studied earlier. The original amount of 486 possible harmonic sums contributing
at weight {\sf w = 6} reduces to 99 sums with no index $\{-1\}$. Algebraic and
structural relations lead to a further reduction to 20 basic functions. These
functions supplement the set of 15 basic functions up to weight {\sf w = 5}
derived formerly. We line out an algorithm to obtain the analytic
representation of the basic sums in the complex plane.
