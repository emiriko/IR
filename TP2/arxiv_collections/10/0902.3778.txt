Using the relativistic coupled-cluster method, we have calculated ionization
potentials, E1 matrix elements and dipole polarizabilities of many low-lying
states of Ca$^+$. Contributions from the Breit interaction are given explicitly
for these properties. Polarizabilities of the ground and the first excited
d-states are determined by evaluating the wave functions that are perturbed to
first order by the electric dipole operator and the black-body radiation shifts
are estimated from these results. We also report the results of branching
ratios and lifetimes of the first excited p-states using both the calculated
and experimental wavelengths and compare them with their measured values.
