The electronic structure of cuprate superconductors is studied within the
kinetic energy driven superconducting mechanism in the presence of the
out-of-plane impurities. With increasing the impurity concentration, although
both superconducting coherence peaks around nodal and antinodal regions are
suppressed, the position of the leading-edge mid-point of the electron spectrum
around the nodal region remains at the same position, while it is shifted
towards higher binding energies around the antinodal region, this leads to a
strong deviation from the monotonic d-wave superconducting gap in the
out-of-plane impurity-controlled cuprate superconductors.
