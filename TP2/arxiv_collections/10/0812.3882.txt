A central issue on high-Tc superconductivity is the nature of the
normal-state gap (pseudogap) in the underdoped regime and its relationship with
superconductivity. Despite persistent efforts, theoretical ideas for the
pseudogap evolve around fluctuating superconductivity, competing order and
spectral weight suppression due to many-body effects. Recently, while some
experiments in the superconducting state indicate a distinction between the
superconducting gap and pseudogap, others in the normal state, either by
extrapolation from high-temperature data or directly from La1.875Ba0.125CuO4
(LBCO-1/8) at low temperature, suggest the ground-state pseudogap is a single
gap of d-wave form. Here we report angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) data
from LBCO-1/8, collected with improved experimental conditions, that reveal the
ground-state pseudogap has a pronounced deviation from the simple d-wave form.
It contains two distinct components: a d-wave component within an extended
region around the node and the other abruptly enhanced close to the antinode,
pointing to a dual nature of the pseudogap in this failed high-Tc
superconductor which involves a possible precursor pairing energy scale around
the node and another of different but unknown origin near the antinode.
