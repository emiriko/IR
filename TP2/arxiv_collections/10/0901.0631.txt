The cooperative action of many molecular motors is essential for dynamic
processes such as cell motility and mitosis. This action can be studied by
using motility assays in which the motion of cytoskeletal filaments over a
surface coated with motor proteins is tracked. In previous studies of
actin-myosin II systems, fast directional motion was observed, reflecting the
tendency of myosin II motors to propagate unidirectionally along actin
filaments. Here, we present a motility assay with actin bundles consisting of
short filamentous segments with randomly alternating polarities. These actin
tracks exhibit bidirectional motion with macroscopically large time intervals
(of the order of several seconds) between direction reversals. Analysis of this
bidirectional motion reveals that the characteristic reversal time,
$\tau_{rev}$, does not depend on the size of the moving bundle or on the number
of motors, $N$. This observation contradicts previous theoretical calculations
based on a two-state ratchet model [Badoual et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
vol. 99, p. 6696 (2002)], predicting an exponential increase of $\tau_{rev}$
with $N$. We present a modified version of this model that takes into account
the elastic energy due to the stretching of the actin track by the myosin II
motors. The new model yields a very good quantitative agreement with the
experimental results.
