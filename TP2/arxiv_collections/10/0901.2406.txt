We present a detailed analysis of the NA49 experimental particle yield
results, and discuss the physical properties of the particle source. We explain
in depth how our analysis differs from the work of other groups, what advance
this implies in terms of our understanding, and what new physics about the
deconfined particle source this allows us to recognize. We answer several
frequently asked questions, presenting a transcript of a discussion regarding
our data analysis. We show that the final NA49 data at 40, 80, 158 AGeV lead to
a remarkably constant extensive thermal chemical-freeze-out properties of the
fireball. We discuss briefly the importance of thermal hadronization pressure.
