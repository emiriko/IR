Almost all extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of charged
Higgs bosons. This talk focuses on the minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model (MSSM), which is relatively predictive. The outlook for
detecting supersymmetric particles and Higgs bosons at the LHC are discussed,
as are the prospects for finding indirect effects of supersymmetric Higgs
bosons at low energies, e.g., in K decays. The outlook for discovering
observable effects of CP-violating supersymmetric phases at high energies or in
B decays is also mentioned.
