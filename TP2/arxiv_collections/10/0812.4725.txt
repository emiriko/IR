We study the statistical properties of return intervals $r$ between
successive energy dissipation rates above a certain threshold $Q$ in
three-dimensional fully developed turbulence. We find that the distribution
function $P_Q(r)$ scales with the mean return interval $R_Q$ as
$P_Q(r)=R_Q^{-1}f(r/R_Q)$ except for $r=1$, where the scaling function $f(x)$
has two power-law regimes. The return intervals are short-term and long-term
correlated and possess multifractal nature. The Hurst index of the return
intervals decays exponentially against $R_Q$, predicting that rare extreme
events with $R_Q\to\infty$ are also long-term correlated with the Hurst index
$H_\infty=0.639$.
