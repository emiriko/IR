We discuss ILC measurements for a specific MSSM scenario with CP phases,
where the lightest neutralino, a candidate for dark matter, annihilates through
t-channel exchange of light staus. These prospective ILC measurements are used
to fit the underlying model parameters. A collider prediction of the relic
density of the neutralino from this fit gives 0.116<Omega h2<0.19 at 95%CL.
