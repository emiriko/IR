We study the virtual photon structure functions from gauge/string duality. If
the Bjorken variable x is not small, supergravity approximation becomes good in
dual string theory. We calculate the virtual photon structure functions at
large 't Hooft coupling in a moderate x-region and determine x-behavior of the
structure functions. We also show that the Callan-Gross relation F_L=0 is
satisfied to a good approximation in gravity calculation.
