We discuss the results of the first model of the gas dynamics in the Milky
Way in the presence of two bars: the large scale primary bar or boxy bulge and
a secondary bar in the Galactic center region. We have obtained an accurate
potential by modeling 2MASS star counts and we have used this potential to
simulate the gas dynamics. As a first approximation we have used one single
pattern speed \Omega_p. The models with Omega_p=30-40 \kmskpc and a primary bar
orientation of 20-35 deg reproduce successfully many characteristics of the
observed longitude-velocity diagrams as the terminal velocity curve or the
spiral arm tangent points. The Galactic Molecular Ring is not an actual ring
but the inner part of the spiral arms, within corotation. The model reproduces
quantitatively the "3-kpc arm" and the recently found far-side counterpart,
which are the lateral arms that contour the bar. In the Galactic center region,
the model reproduces the 1-kpc HI ring and the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ),
which is the gas response to the secondary bar. In order to reproduce the
observed parallelogram shape of the CO longitude velocity diagram of the CMZ,
the secondary bar should be oriented by and angle of 60-70 deg with respect to
the Sun-GC line. The mass of the secondary bar amounts to (2-5.5)10^9 Msun,
which is 10-25 % of the mass of the primary bar.
