This is a proposal of an algebra which aims at distributed array processing.
The focus lies on re-arranging and distributing array data, which may be
multi-dimensional. The context of the work is scientific processing; thus, the
core science operations are assumed to be taken care of in external libraries
or languages. A main design driver is the desire to carry over some of the
strategies of the relational algebra into the array domain.
