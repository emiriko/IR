Using the second order Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics we discuss the effect of
viscosity on photon production in a parton plasma created in relativistic heavy
ion collisions. We find that photon production rates can enhance by several
factors due to the viscous effect in a chemically nonequilibrated plasma.
