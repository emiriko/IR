The mechanisms of physical and chemical interactions of low temperature
plasmas with surfaces can be fruitfully explored using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. MD simulations follow the detailed motion of sets of interacting
atoms through integration of atomic equations of motion, using inter-atomic
potentials that can account for bond breaking and formation that result when
energetic species from the plasma impact surfaces. This article summarizes the
current status of the technique for various applications of low temperature
plasmas to material processing technologies. The method is reviewed, and
commonly used inter-atomic potentials are described. Special attention is paid
to the use of MD in understanding various representative applications,
including tetrahedral amorphous carbon film deposition from energetic carbon
ions; the interactions of radical species with amorphous hydrogenated silicon
films; silicon nano-particles in plasmas; and plasma etching.
