The author supposes a capability of transition doubly excited configurations
of separate atoms to a superconducting state. The conditions of this transition
are determined and the experiments for its detection are offered. The
capability of join of superconducting atoms in a superconducting condensate is
considered. The capability of spontaneous formation of similar condensates in
atmospheres of the Earth and Sun is considered.
