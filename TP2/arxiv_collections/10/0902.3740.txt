Tau-pair process has been analyzed in the ILD detector model as a benchmark
process for LoI. Results of background rejection, forward-backward asymmetry
and polarization measurements are obtained with full detector simulation.
Impact of detector parameters for tau-pair analysis is also discussed in this
paper.
