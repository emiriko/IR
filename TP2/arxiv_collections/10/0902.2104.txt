We develop a tableau-based decision procedure for the full coalitional
multiagent temporal-epistemic logic of linear time CMATEL(CD+LT). It extends
LTL with operators of common and distributed knowledge for all coalitions of
agents. The tableau procedure runs in exponential time, matching the lower
bound obtained by Halpern and Vardi for a fragment of our logic, thus providing
a complexity-optimal decision procedure for CMATEL(CD+LT).
