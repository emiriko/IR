Using as basic observable an angular-integrated asymmetry to be measured in
Drell-Yan lepton-pair production at the LHC, we discuss the identification
reach on the spin-2 of the lowest-lying Randall-Sundrum resonance predicted by
gravity in one warped extra dimension, against the spin-1 and spin-0
hypotheses. Numerical results indicate that, depending on the graviton coupling
strength to the standard model particles, such a spin-2 identification can
extend up to mass scales of 1.0-1.6 TeV and 2.4-3.2 TeV for LHC integrated
luminosities of 10 and 100 fb^{-1}, respectively.
