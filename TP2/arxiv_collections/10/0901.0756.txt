We present a brief review of various approaches to late time acceleration of
universe. The cosmological relevance of scaling solutions is emphasized in case
of scalar field models of dark energy. The underlying features of a variety of
scalar field models is highlighted. Various alternatives to dark energy are
discussed including the string curvature corrections to Einstein-Hilbert
action, higher dimensional effects, non-locally corrected gravity and $f(R)$
theories of gravity. The recent developments related to $f(R)$ models with
disappearing cosmological constant are reviewed.
