The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive pedagogical
introduction into Keldysh technique for interacting out-of-equilibrium
fermionic and bosonic systems. The emphasis is placed on a functional integral
representation of underlying microscopic models. A large part of the review is
devoted to derivation and applications of the non-linear sigma-model for
disordered metals and superconductors. We discuss such topics as transport
properties, mesoscopic effects, counting statistics, interaction corrections,
kinetic equation, etc. The sections devoted to disordered superconductors
include Usadel equation, fluctuation corrections, time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory, proximity and Josephson effects, etc. (This review is a
substantial extension of arXiv:cond-mat/0412296.)
