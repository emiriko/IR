We prove generalizations of the isoperimetric inequality for both spherical
and hyperbolic wave fronts (i.e. piecewise smooth curves which may have cusps).
  We then discuss "bicycle curves" using the generalized isoperimetric
inequalities. The euclidean model of a bicycle is a unit segment AB that can
move so that it remains tangent to the trajectory of point A (the rear wheel is
fixed on the bicycle frame). We extend this definition to a general Riemannian
manifold, and concern ourselves in particular with bicycle curves in the
hyperbolic plane H^2 and on the sphere S^2. We prove results along the lines of
those proven by Levi and Tabachnikov and resolve both spherical and hyperbolic
versions of Menzin's conjecture, which relates the area bounded by a curve to
its associated monodromy map.
