We examine a Josephson junction involving two arbitrary equal-spin-pairing
unitary triplet superconductors and a ferromagnetic tunneling barrier. Using
perturbation theory, we show how the interaction of the barrier moment with the
spin of the tunneling triplet Cooper pairs can reverse the sign of the
Josephson charge current. This also results in a Josephson spin current, which
contains a phase-independent contribution due to reflection processes at the
barrier. We verify our analytic predictions using a non-perturbative
Bogoliubov-de Gennes method.
