This is the second of two papers where we study the asymptotics of the
generalized Nariai solutions and its relation to the cosmic no-hair conjecture.
In the first paper, the author suggested that according to the cosmic no-hair
conjecture, the Nariai solutions are non-generic among general solutions of
Einstein's field equations in vacuum with a positive cosmological constant. We
checked that this is true within the class of spatially homogeneous solutions.
In this paper now, we continue these investigations within the spatially
inhomogeneous Gowdy case. On the one hand, we are motivated to understand the
fundamental question of cosmic no-hair and its dynamical realization in more
general classes than the spatially homogeneous case. On the other hand, the
results of the first paper suggest that the instability of the Nariai solutions
can be exploited to construct and analyze physically interesting cosmological
black hole solutions in the Gowdy class, consistent with certain claims by
Bousso in the spherically symmetric case. However, in contrast to that, we find
that it is not possible to construct cosmological black hole solutions by means
of small Gowdy symmetric perturbations of the Nariai solutions and that the
dynamics shows a certain new critical behavior. For our investigations, we use
the numerical techniques based on spectral methods which we introduced in a
previous publication.
