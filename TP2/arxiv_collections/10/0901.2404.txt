On a spin manifold with conformal cusps, we prove under an invertibility
condition at infinity that the eta function of the twisted Dirac operator has
at most simple poles and is regular at the origin. For hyperbolic manifolds of
finite volume, the eta function of the Dirac operator twisted by any
homogeneous vector bundle is shown to be entire.
