We examine the behavior of single photons at multiport devices and inquire if
coherent effects are possible. In particular we study how single photons need
to be manipulated in order to study coherent phenomena. We show that single
photons need to be produced in W states which lead to vanishing mean amplitude
but nonzero correlations between the inputs at different ports. Such
correlations restore coherent effects with single photons. As a specific
example we demonstrate Bloch oscillations with single photons and thus provide
strict analog of Bloch oscillation of electrons.
