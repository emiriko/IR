Extending the idea formulated in Makino {\it{et al}}[Phys.Rev.E
{\bf{67}},066205], that is based on the Berry--Robnik approach [M.V. Berry and
M. Robnik, J. Phys. A {\bf{17}}, 2413], we investigate the statistical
properties of a two-point spectral correlation for a classically integrable
quantum system. The eigenenergy sequence of this system is regarded as a
superposition of infinitely many independent components in the semiclassical
limit. We derive the level number variance (LNV) in the limit of infinitely
many components and discuss its deviations from Poisson statistics. The slope
of the limiting LNV is found to be larger than that of Poisson statistics when
the individual components have a certain accumulation. This property agrees
with the result from the semiclassical periodic-orbit theory that is applied to
a system with degenerate torus actions[D. Biswas, M.Azam,and S.V.Lawande, Phys.
Rev. A {\bf 43}, 5694].
