Through the introduction of a class of appropriate translationally invariant
trial wave functions, we show that the strong correlations in the lowest Landau
level (LLL) reflect in finite systems the emergence of intrinsic point-group
symmetries associated with rotations and vibrations of molecules formed through
particle localization. This quantal molecular description is universal, being
valid for both bosons and fermions, for both the yrast and excited states of
the LLL spectra, and for both low and high angular momenta. "Quantum-fluid"
physical pictures associated with Jastrow-type trial functions are shown to be
reducible to the molecular description introduced in this paper.
