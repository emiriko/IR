We report the transverse momentum (pT) distributions for identified charged
pions, protons and anti-protons using events triggered by high deposit energy
in the Barrel Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) from p + p collisions at psNN
= 200 GeV. The spectra are measured around mid-rapidity (|y|<0.5) over the
range of 3<pT<15 GeV/c with particle identification (PID) by the relativistic
ionization energy loss (rdE/dx) in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) in the
Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR). The charged pion, proton and anti-proton
spectra at high pT are compared with published results from minimum bias
triggered events and the Next-Leading-Order perturbative quantum chromodynamic
(NLO pQCD) calculations (DSS, KKP and AKK 2008). In addition, we present the
particle ratios of pi-/pi+, pbar/p, p/pi+ and pbar/pi- in p + p collisions.
