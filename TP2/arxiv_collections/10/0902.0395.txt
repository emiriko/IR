We construct crude estimates for non-optimality of quantum measurements in
terms of their violation of Holevo's simplified minimum-error optimality
conditions. As an application, we show that a modification of Barnett and
Croke's proof of the optimality conditions yields a convergent iterative scheme
for computing optimal measurements.
