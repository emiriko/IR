The made-to-measure N-body method (Syer & Tremaine 1996) slowly adapts the
particle weights of an N-body model, whilst integrating the trajectories in an
assumed static potential, until some constraints are satisfied, such as optimal
fits to observational data. I propose a novel technique for this adaption
procedure, which overcomes several limitations and shortcomings of the original
method. The capability of the new technique is demonstrated by generating
realistic N-body equilibrium models for dark-matter haloes with prescribed
density profile, triaxial shape, and slowly outwardly growing radial velocity
anisotropy
