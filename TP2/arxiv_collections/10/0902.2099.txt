We consider products of two Macdonald polynomials of type A, indexed by
dominant weights which are respectively a multiple of the first fundamental
weight and a weight having zero component on the k-th fundamental weight. We
give the explicit decomposition of any Macdonald polynomial of type A in terms
of this basis.
