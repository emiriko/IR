We study augmented quasiclassical equations of superconductivity with the
Lorentz force, which is missing from the standard Ginzburg-Landau and
Eilenberger equations. It is shown that the magnetic Lorentz force on
equilibrium supercurrents induces finite charge distribution and the resulting
electric field to balance the Lorentz force. An analytic expression is obtained
for the corresponding Hall coefficient of clean type-II superconductors with
simultaneously incorporating the Fermi-surface and gap anisotropies. It has the
same sign and magnitude at zero temperature as the normal state for an
arbitrary pairing, having no temperature dependence specifically for the s-wave
pairing. The gap anisotropy may bring a considerable temperature dependence in
the Hall coefficient and can lead to its sign change as a function of
temperature, as exemplified for a model d-wave pairing with a two-dimensional
Fermi surface. The sign change may be observed in some high-$T_{c}$
superconductors.
