We investigate the J/psi polarization in photoproduction at the Hadron
Electron Ring Accelerator(HERA) up to the next-to-leading order of QCD. The
results show that the transverse momentum p_t and energy fraction z
distributions of J/psi production do not agree with the observed ones very
well. The theoretical uncertainties for the z distributions of the J/psi
polarization parameters with respect to various choices of the renormalization
and factorization scales are too large to give an accurate prediction. The
uncertainties for the p_t distributions of these parameters are small when
p_t>3GeV and the obtained p_t distributions can not describe the experimental
data even in this region.
