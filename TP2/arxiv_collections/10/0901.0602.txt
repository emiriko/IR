We set up the Dirac equation in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry and
separate the spatial and time variables. In the case of a closed universe, the
spatial dependence is solved explicitly, giving rise to a discrete set of
solutions. We compute the probability integral and analyze a space-time
normalization integral. This analysis allows us to introduce the fermionic
projector in a closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry and to specify its
global normalization as well as its local form.
