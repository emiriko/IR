The already very active field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED),
traditionally studied in atomic systems, has recently gained additional
momentum by the advent of experiments with semiconducting and superconducting
systems. In these solid state implementations, novel quantum optics experiments
are enabled by the possibility to engineer many of the characteristic
parameters at will. In cavity QED, the observation of the vacuum Rabi mode
splitting is a hallmark experiment aimed at probing the nature of matter-light
interaction on the level of a single quantum. However, this effect can, at
least in principle, be explained classically as the normal mode splitting of
two coupled linear oscillators. It has been suggested that an observation of
the scaling of the resonant atom-photon coupling strength in the
Jaynes-Cummings energy ladder with the square root of photon number n is
sufficient to prove that the system is quantum mechanical in nature. Here we
report a direct spectroscopic observation of this characteristic quantum
nonlinearity. Measuring the photonic degree of freedom of the coupled system,
our measurements provide unambiguous, long sought for spectroscopic evidence
for the quantum nature of the resonant atom-field interaction in cavity QED. We
explore atom-photon superposition states involving up to two photons, using a
spectroscopic pump and probe technique. The experiments have been performed in
a circuit QED setup, in which ultra strong coupling is realized by the large
dipole coupling strength and the long coherence time of a superconducting qubit
embedded in a high quality on-chip microwave cavity.
