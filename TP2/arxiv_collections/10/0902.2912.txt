We have developed URDME, a general software for simulation of stochastic
reaction-diffusion processes on unstructured meshes. This allows for a more
flexible handling of complicated geometries and curved boundaries compared to
simulations on structured, cartesian meshes. The underlying algorithm is the
next subvolume method, extended to unstructured meshes by obtaining jump
coefficients from a finite element formulation of the corresponding macroscopic
equation.
  This manual describes version 1.4 of the software. Refer to www.urdme.org for
the latest updates.
