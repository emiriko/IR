We consider a generic renormalizable and gauge invariant messenger sector and
derive the sparticle mass spectrum using the formalism introduced for General
Gauge Mediation. Our results recover many expressions found in the literature
in various limits. Constraining the messenger sector with a global symmetry
under which the spurion field is charged, we analyze Extraordinary Gauge
Mediation beyond the small SUSY breaking limit. Finally, we include D-term
contributions and compute their corrections to the soft masses. This leads to a
perturbative framework allowing to explore models capable of fully covering the
parameter space of General Gauge Mediation to the Supersymmetric Standard
Model.
