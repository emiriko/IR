We give a list of Heun equations which are Picard-Fuchs associated to
families of algebraic varieties. Our list is based on the classification of
families of elliptic curves with four singular fibers done by Herfurtner. We
also show that pullbacks of hypergeometric functions by rational Belyi
functions with restricted ramification data give rise to Heun equations.
