We present arguments that the structure of the spectrum of the supersymmetric
matrix model with 16 real supercharges in the large N limit is rather
nontrivial, involving besides the natural energy scale ~\lambda^{1/3} = (g^2
N)^{1/3} also a lower scale ~\lambda^{1/3}N^{-5/9}. This allows one to
understand a nontrivial behaviour of the mean internal energy of the system, E
proportional to T^{14/5}, predicted by AdS duality arguments.
