We report observation of a narrow (sub-natural) and high-contrast resonance
of increased absorption ("bright" resonance) in Rb cell with Ne buffer gas
under previously unexplored experimental conditions for coupling and probe
radiation configuration. The coupling laser stabilized frequency is detuned by
~ 3 GHz from 5S1/2, Fg=3 --> 5P3/2, Fe=2,3,4 transitions, while the probe laser
frequency is scanned across these transitions. We believe the bright resonance
formation, occurring when the probe laser frequency is blue-shifted from the
coupling frequency by a value of the ground state hyperfine splitting, is
caused predominantly by a 2-photon absorption of the probe radiation 5S1/2,
Fg=2 --> 5S1/2, Fg=3 with 5P3/2 as an intermediate state. We also report and
interpret splitting of the bright resonance into 6 well resolved and contrast
components in moderate magnetic fields (B ~ 10 - 250 G).
