Assuming the idea of retardation as an underlying axiom, we investigate how
Jefimenko's and Maxwell's equations can be inferred. In the inference, we begin
with the retarded versions of Coulomb's and Biot-Savart's field expression as
an incomplete, starting ansatz. By calculating and comparing their divergences,
curls, and time derivatives, we improve the ansatz. Thus improved ansatz is
further improved through the same procedure and the final ansatz fields are
identified with Jefimenko's fields. Our inference of Maxwell's equations is in
much the same spirit as the derivation of static differential equations
(divergences and curls) from the Coulomb's and Biot-Savart's fields known
experimentally without knowing their governing laws of the divergence and curl
equations.
