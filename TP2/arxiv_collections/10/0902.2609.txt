The arrival directions of ultrahigh energy extensive air showers (EAS) by
Yakutsk, AGASA, P. Auger array data are analyzed. For the first time, the maps
of equal exposition of celestial sphere for the distribution of particles by
AGASA and P. Auger arrays data have been constructed. The large-scale
anisotropy of cosmic particles at E>4.1019 eV by Yakutsk, AGASA and P. Auger
array data has been detected. The problem of cosmic particle origin is
discussed.
