We investigate hypernova (hyper-energetic supernova) and gamma-ray burst
(GRB) remnants in our Galaxy as TeV gamma-ray sources, particularly in the role
of potential TeV unidentified sources, which have no clear counterpart at other
wavelengths. We show that the observed bright sources in the TeV sky could be
dominated by GRB/hypernova remnants, even though they are fewer than supernova
remnants (SNRs). If this is the case, TeV SNRs are more extended (and more
numerous) than deduced from current observations. In keeping with their role as
cosmic ray accelerators, we discuss hadronic gamma-ray emission from pi^0
decay, from beta decay followed by inverse Compton emission, and propose a
third, novel process of TeV gamma-ray emission arising from the decay of
accelerated radioactive isotopes such as 56Co entrained by relativistic or
semi-relativistic jets in GRBs/hypernovae. We discuss the relevant
observational signatures which could discriminate between these three
mechanisms.
