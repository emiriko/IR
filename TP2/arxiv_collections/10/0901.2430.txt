We have investigated the effects caused by proton-induced radiation damage on
Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), a pixelized photon detector developed by
Hamamatsu Photonics. The leakage current of irradiated MPPC samples linearly
increases with total irradiated doses due to radiation damage, which is not
completely recovered even after a year from the irradiation. No significant
change has been observed in the gains at least up to 8.0 Gy ($9.1\times10^7$
n/mm$^2$ in 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence, $\Phi_{\rm eq}$). The device has
completely lost its photon-counting capability due to baseline fluctuations and
noise pile-up after 21 Gy irradiation ($2.4\times10^8$ n/mm$^2$ in $\Phi_{\rm
eq}$), which might be problematic for some applications, such as ring-imaging
Cherenkov detectors. We have found that the pulse-height resolution has been
slightly deteriorated after 42 Gy irradiation ($4.8\times10^8$ n/mm$^2$ in
$\Phi_{\rm eq}$), where the measured sample has been illuminated with a few
hundred photons. This effect should be considered in the case of
energy-measurement applications.
