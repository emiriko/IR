LHCb is the heavy flavour precision experiment of the proton-proton Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It will search for new physics in CP violation
and rare decays and is ready for the start-up of the LHC. An overview of its
physics program will be given, illustrated by few key examples: measurements of
the CKM angle $\gamma$, of the CP violating phase in $ B_s \overline{B_s}$
oscillations and searches for new physics in $B^0_d \to K^*\mu^+\mu^-$ and in
$B^0_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$.
