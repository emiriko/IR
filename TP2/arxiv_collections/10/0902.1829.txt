A quantitative method is presented for stopping the intrinsic precession of a
spherical pendulum due to ellipsoidal motion. Removing this unwanted precession
renders the Foucault precession due to the turning of the Earth readily
observable. The method is insensitive to the size and direction of the
perturbative forces leading to ellipsoidal motion. We demonstrate that a short
(three meter) pendulum can be pushed in a controlled way to make the Foucault
precession dominant. The method makes room-height or table-top Foucault pendula
more accurate and practical to build.
