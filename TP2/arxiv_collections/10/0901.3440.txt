A nanoscale-sized Stirling engine with an atomistic working fluid has been
modeled using molecular dynamics simulation. The design includes heat
exchangers based on thermostats, pistons attached to a flywheel under load, and
a regenerator. Key aspects of the behavior, including the time-dependent flows,
are described. The model is shown to be capable of stable operation while
producing net work at a moderate level of efficiency.
