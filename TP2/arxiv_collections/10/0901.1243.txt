A structure comprising a coupled pair of two-dimensional arrays of oblate
plasmonic nanoellipsoids in a dielectric host medium is proposed as a superlens
in the optical domain for both horizontal and vertical polarizations. By means
of simulations it is demonstrated that a structure formed by silver
nanoellipsoids is capable of restoring subwavelength features of the object for
both polarizations at distances larger than half-wavelength. The bandwidth of
subwavelength resolution is in all cases very large (above 13%).
