We introduce a new universality class of one-dimensional unimodal dissipative
maps. The new family, from now on referred to as the ($z_1,z_2$)-{\it
logarithmic map}, corresponds to a generalization of the $z$-logistic map. The
Feigenbaum-like constants of these maps are determined. It has been recently
shown that the probability density of sums of iterates at the edge of chaos of
the $z$-logistic map is numerically consistent with a $q$-Gaussian, the
distribution which, under appropriate constraints, optimizes the nonadditive
entropy $S_q$. We focus here on the presently generalized maps to check whether
they constitute a new universality class with regard to $q$-Gaussian attractor
distributions. We also study the generalized $q$-entropy production per unit
time on the new unimodal dissipative maps, both for strong and weak chaotic
cases. The $q$-sensitivity indices are obtained as well. Our results are, like
those for the $z$-logistic maps, numerically compatible with the
$q$-generalization of a Pesin-like identity for ensemble averages.
