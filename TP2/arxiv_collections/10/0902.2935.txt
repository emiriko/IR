Macroscopic concentration of massless charge carriers with linear conic
spectrum - Dirac Fermions (DF) - was shown in 2004 to exist in highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and governs its electronic properties. These carriers
can have the same nature as DF observed in graphite monolayer(graphene) and let
to view HOPG as superposition of 2D carbon layers, almost independent
electronically. We overview here the recent experimental evidences of 2D DF in
graphite and their similarity with carriers in graphene.
