In cellular automata with memory, the unchanged maps of the conventional
cellular automata are applied to cells endowed with memory of their past states
in some specified interval. We implement Rule 30 automata with a majority
memory and show that using the memory function we can transform quasi-chaotic
dynamics of classical Rule 30 into domains of travelling structures with
predictable behaviour. We analyse morphological complexity of the automata and
classify dynamics of gliders (particles, self-localizations) in memory-enriched
Rule 30. We provide formal ways of encoding and classifying glider dynamics
using de Bruijn diagrams, soliton reactions and quasi-chemical representations.
