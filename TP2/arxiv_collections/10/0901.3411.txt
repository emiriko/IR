A unified theoretical treatment is presented to describe the physics of
electron dynamics in semiconductor and graphene systems. Electron spin fast
alignment with the Zeeman magnetic field (physical or effective) is treated as
a form of adiabatic spin evolution which necessarily generates a monopole in
magnetic space. One could transform this monopole into the physical and
intuitive topological magnetic fields in the useful momentum (K) or real spaces
(R). The physics of electron dynamics related to spin Hall, torque,
oscillations and other technologically useful spinor effects can be inferred
from the topological magnetic fields in spintronic, graphene and other SU(2)
systems.
