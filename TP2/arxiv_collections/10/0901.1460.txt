The CP asymmetry in neutrino oscillations, assuming new physics at production
and/or detection processes, is analyzed. We compute this CP asymmetry using the
standard quantum field theory within a general new physics scenario that may
generate new sources of CP and flavor violation. Well known results for the CP
asymmetry are reproduced in the case of V -A operators, and additional
contributions from new physics operators are derived. We apply this formalism
to SUSY extensions of the Standard Model where the contributions from new
operators could produce a CP asymmetry observable in the next generation of
neutrino experiments.
