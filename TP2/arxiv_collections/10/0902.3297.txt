The mass spectra of ground-state triply heavy baryons are systematically
unscrambled and computed in QCD sum rules. With a tentative $(QQ)-(Q')$
configuration for $QQQ'$, the interpolating currents representing the triply
heavy baryons are proposed. Technically, contributions of the operators up to
dimension six are included in operator product expansion (OPE). The numerical
results are presented in comparison with other theoretical predictions.
