We revisit the nature of the quasi-one-dimensional Ising model on the basis
of Wang-Landau simulation. We introduce the density of states in the
two-dimensional energy space corresponding to the intra- and inter-chain
directions. We then analyze the interchain coupling dependence of the specific
heat of the anistropic two-dimensional Ising model in the context of the
density of states, and further discuss the size dependences of the peak
temperature. We also discuss the feature of the phase transition in the
three-dimensional case.
