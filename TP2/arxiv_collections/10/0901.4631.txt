Using a non-perturbative renormalization-group technique, we compute the
momentum and frequency dependence of the anomalous self-energy and the
one-particle spectral function of two-dimensional interacting bosons at zero
temperature. Below a characteristic momentum scale $k_G$, where the Bogoliubov
approximation breaks down, the anomalous self-energy develops a square root
singularity and the Goldstone mode of the superfluid phase (Bogoliubov sound
mode) coexists with a continuum of excitations, in agreement with the
predictions of Popov's hydrodynamic theory. Thus our results provide a unified
picture of superfluidity in interacting boson systems and connect Bogoliubov's
theory (valid for momenta larger than $k_G$) to Popov's hydrodynamic approach.
