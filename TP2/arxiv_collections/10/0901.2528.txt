This paper was presented in poster form at and in the proceedings of the QCMC
2008. It is a summary of a fuller paper to appear separately. The classical
product state capacity of a noisy quantum channel with memory is investigated.
A forgetful noise-memory channel is constructed by Markov switching between two
depolarizing channels which introduces non-Markovian noise correlations between
successive channel uses. This function of a Markov process can be reformulated
as an algebraic measure. This framework provides an expression for the
asymptotic entropy rate and thus enables the calculation of the classical
capacity. The effects of the hidden-Markovian memory on the capacity are
explored. An increase in noise-correlations is found to increase the capacity.
