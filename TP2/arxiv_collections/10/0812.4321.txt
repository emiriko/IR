We propose ways to create and detect fractionally charged excitations in
\emph{integer} quantum Hall edge states. The charge fractionalization occurs
due to the Coulomb interaction between electrons propagating on different edge
channels. The fractional charge of the soliton-like collective excitations can
be observed in time resolved or frequency dependent shot noise measurements.
