Over the last decades, modelling of the inhomogeneous vertical abundance
distributions of various chemical elements in magnetic peculiar A-type has
largely relied on simple step-function approximations. In contrast, the
recently introduced regularised vertical inverse problem (VIP) is not based on
parametrised stratification profiles and has been claimed to yield unique
solutions without a priori assumptions as to the profile shapes. It is the
question of uniqueness of empirical stratifications which is at the centre of
this article. An error analysis establishes confidence intervals about the
abundance profiles and it is shown that many different step-functions of
sometimes widely different amplitudes give fits to the observed spectra which
equal the VIP fits in quality. Theoretical arguments are advanced in favour of
abundance profiles that depend on magnetic latitude, even in moderately strong
magnetic fields. Including cloud, cap and ring models in the discussion, it is
shown that uniqueness of solutions cannot be achieved without phase resolved
high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and high spectral resolution (R)
spectropolarimetry in all 4 Stokes parameters.
