In this paper we study one-dimensional sections of the maps of WMAP ILC and
of the NVSS survey on scale lengths of 0.75, 3, 4.5, and 6.75 degrees and
analyze the correlation properties of the sections. On these maps we identify
the domains where the absolute value of the correlation coefficient exceeds
0.5. The catalog of such domains is presented. It is shown that the number of
the domains agrees with the number of such domains on simulated maps and this
fact may be indicative of just statistical agreement of the arrangement of the
domains considered.
