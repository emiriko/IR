The beam-beam interaction is one of the dominant sources of emittance growth
and luminosity lifetime deterioration. A current carrying wire has been
proposed to compensate long-range beam-beam effects in the LHC and strong
localized long-range beam-beam effects are experimentally investigated in the
RHIC collider. Tune shift, beam transfer function, and beam loss rate are
measured in dedicated experiments. In this paper, we report on simulations to
study the effect of beam-wire interactions based on diffusive apertures, beam
loss rates, and beam transfer function using a parallelized weak-strong beam
simulation code (bbsimc). The simulation results are compared with measurements
performed in RHIC during 2007 and 2008.
