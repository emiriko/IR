Complex systems (CS) are ubiquitous in nature. It is argued that fractional
order (FO) calculus is more suitable to describe fractal systems. Motivated by
the fractal space time theory some fractional generalizations of Scrodinger and
Klein-Gordon equations are given. In many CS systems statistics is described by
heavy tailed distributions e.g. fractal and Levy-Weibull ones. Here a
generalized Weibull (GW) distribution is proposed to interpolate between them.
