The first phase of stellar evolution in the history of the universe may be
Dark Stars, powered by dark matter heating rather than by fusion. Weakly
interacting massive particles, which are their own antiparticles, can
annihilate and provide an important heat source for the first stars in the
universe. This and the following contribution present the story of Dark Stars.
In this first part, we describe the conditions under which dark stars form in
the early universe: 1) high dark matter densities, 2) the annihilation products
get stuck inside the star, and 3) dark matter heating wins over all other
cooling or heating mechanisms.
