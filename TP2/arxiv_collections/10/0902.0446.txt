NA60 collaboration has extracted the inverse slope parameters, T_{eff} of the
dimuon spectra originating from the In+In collisions at root(s_NN)=17.3 GeV for
various invariant mass region. They have observed that the inverse slope
parameter as a function of invariant mass of the lepton pair drops beyond the
rho-peak. In the present work, first we reproduce the observed invariant mass
and transverse momentum spectra of the muon pairs. Then show that the slope
parameters extracted from the transverse momentum distributions for various
invariant mass region windows can be explained by assuming formation of a
partonic phase initially which reverts to hadronic phase through a weak first
order phase transition at a temperature T_c ~ 175 MeV. It is observed that a
scenario without the formation of a partonic phase does not reproduce the
non-monotonic behaviour of the inverse slope parameter non typical of radial
flow.
