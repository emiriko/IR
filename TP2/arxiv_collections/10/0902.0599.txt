Inelastic neutron scattering was used to determine the spin Hamiltonian for
the singlet ground state system of fully deuterated BPCB,
(C$_{5}$D$_{12}$N)$_{2}$CuBr$_{4}$. A 2-leg spin-1/2 ladder model, with $J_\bot
= (1.09 \pm 0.01)$ meV and $J_\| = (0.296 \pm 0.005)$ meV, accurately describes
the data. The experimental limit on the effective inter-ladder exchange
constant is $|J_{\rm int}^{\rm eff}|\lesssim 0.006$ meV, and the limit on total
diagonal, intra-ladder exchange is $|J_F+J_{F'}|\leq 0.1$ meV. Including the
effects of copper to bromide covalent spin transfer on the magnetic
form-factor, the experimental ratios of intra-ladder bond energies are
consistent with the predictions of continuous unitary transformation.
