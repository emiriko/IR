We used the revised New Luyten Two-Tenths (rNLTT) catalog to select high
proper motion white dwarf candidates. We studied the spectra of 70
hydrogen-rich (DA) white dwarfs, which were obtained at the Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) and extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). We determined their effective temperature and surface gravity by
fitting their Balmer line profiles to model white dwarf spectra. Using
evolutionary mass-radius relations we determined their mass and cooling age. We
also conducted a kinematical study of the white dwarf sample and found that
most belong to the thin disk population. We have identified three magnetic
white dwarfs and estimated their surface magnetic field. Finally, we have
identified 6 white dwarfs that lie within 20 pc from the Sun.
