A dilute Ising ferromagnet is considered in this study using renormalization
group techniques with a hierarchical lattice. A series of phase diagrams have
been produced that probe the effects of varying the temperature and
concentration of nonmagnetic impurities. Each phase diagram corresponds to a
different strength for the internal coupling coefficients on our lattice.
Phases have been interpreted and critical exponents calculated for the higher
order transitions.
