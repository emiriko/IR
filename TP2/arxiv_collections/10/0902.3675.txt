The CMDs/TRGB (Color-Magnitude Diagrams/Tip of the Red Giant Branch) section
of the Extragalactic Distance Database contains a compilation of observations
of nearby galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope. Approximately 250 (and
increasing) galaxies in the Local Volume have CMDs and the stellar photometry
tables used to produce them available through the web. Various stellar
populations that make up a galaxy are visible in the CMDs, but our primary
purpose for collecting and analyzing these galaxy images is to measure the TRGB
in each. We can estimate the distance to a galaxy by using stars at the TRGB as
standard candles. In this paper we describe the process of constructing the
CMDs and make the results available to the public.
