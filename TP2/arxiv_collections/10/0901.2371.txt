Many newly discovered mesons behave like $\ccbar$ charmonium states in that
they preferentially decay into final states that contain a $c$- and a
$\bar{c}$-quark, but do not fit expectations for any of the unfilled levels of
the conventional $\ccbar$ spectrum. There is a growing suspicion that at least
some of these states are {\it exotic}, {\it i.e.} have a substructure that is
more complex than the quark-antiquark mesons of the classical constituent quark
model. Some of these candidate states have a non-zero electric charge and,
thus, a minimal quark content of $\ccbar u\bar{d}$ or $\ccbar d\bar{u}$. In
addition, states with similar properties have been observed in the $b$- and
$s$-quark sectors. In this report, the experimental situation is briefly
reviewed.
