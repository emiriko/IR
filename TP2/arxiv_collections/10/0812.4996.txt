Searches for Physics beyond the Standard Model have entered an exciting new
phase: the complete HERA data samples obtained until the end of operations in
the Summer of 2007 are now available for analysis. ZEUS and H1 have each
collected about 0.5 fb^{-1} of lepton proton data, distributed over electron
and positron running, and over different lepton beam polarisations. At the same
time the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider is accumulating data at
unprecedented rates, with current analyses based on up to 3 fb^{-1}. The
Tevatron experiments DZERO and CDF have each already recorded over 4 fb^{-1}
(Fall 2008), and are aiming for a total of 8 fb^{-1} of antiproton-proton
collisions at 2 TeV center-of-mass energy for Tevatron Run II. I am presenting
recent updates (from the last 12 months) on searches, grouped loosely into
three classes: well-established `traditional' searches, mostly for very
specific signatures and models, more recent and/or more generalized searches
for broader classes of phenomena, and newer searches that strive to be
model-independent.
