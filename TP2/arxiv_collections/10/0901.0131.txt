Cloud Computing has become another buzzword after Web 2.0. However, there are
dozens of different definitions for Cloud Computing and there seems to be no
consensus on what a Cloud is. On the other hand, Cloud Computing is not a
completely new concept; it has intricate connection to the relatively new but
thirteen-year established Grid Computing paradigm, and other relevant
technologies such as utility computing, cluster computing, and distributed
systems in general. This paper strives to compare and contrast Cloud Computing
with Grid Computing from various angles and give insights into the essential
characteristics of both.
