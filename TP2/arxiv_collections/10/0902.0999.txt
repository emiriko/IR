We propose a mechanism of thermalization of nucleons in relativistic
nucleus-nucleus collisions. Our model belongs, to a certain degree, to the
transport ones; we consider the evolution of the system, but we parametrize
this development by the number of collisions of every particle in the system
rather than by the time variable. We based on the assumption that the nucleon
momentum transfer after several nucleon-nucleon (-hadron) collisions becomes a
random quantity driven by a proper distribution.
