In the framework of the scale relativity theory, the chaotic behavior in time
only of a number of macroscopic systems corresponds to motion in a space with
geodesics of fractal dimension 2 and leads to its representation by a
Schr\"odinger-like equation acting in the macroscopic domain. The fluid
interpretation of such a Schr\"odinger equation yields Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. We therefore choose to extend this formalism to study the properties
of a system exhibiting a chaotic behavior both in space and time which amounts
to consider them as issued from the geodesic features of a mathematical object
exhibiting all the properties of a fractal `space-time'. Starting with the
simplest Klein-Gordon-like form that can be given to the geodesic equation in
this case, we obtain a motion equation for a `three fluid' velocity field and
three continuity equations, together with parametric expressions for the three
velocity components which allow us to derive relations between their
non-vanishing curls. At the non relativistic limit and owing to the physical
properties exhibited by this solution, we suggest that it could represent some
kind of three-dimensional chaotic behavior in a classical fluid, tentatively
turbulent if particular conditions are fulfilled. The appearance of a
transition parameter ${\cal D}$ in the equations allows us to consider
different ways of testing experimentally our proposal.
