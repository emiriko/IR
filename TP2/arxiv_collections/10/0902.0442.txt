One of the most popular class of tests for independence between two random
variables is the general class of rank statistics which are invariant under
permutations. This class contains Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation
statistic, Fisher-Yates statistic, weighted Mann statistic and others. Under
the null hypothesis of independence these test statistics have a permutation
distribution that usually the normal asymptotic theory used to approximate the
p-values for these tests. In this note we suggest using a saddlepoint approach
that almost exact and need no extensive simulation calculations to calculate
the p-value of such class of tests.
