A new scheme for incorporating radiative cooling in hydrodynamical codes is
presented, centered around exact integration of the governing semi-discrete
cooling equation. Using benchmark calculations based on the cooling downstream
of a radiative shock, I demonstrate that the new scheme outperforms traditional
explicit and implicit approaches in terms of accuracy, while remaining
competitive in terms of execution speed.
