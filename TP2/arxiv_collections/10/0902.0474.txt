We introduce an approach to scattering problems in theories with
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, usually known as PT-symmetric quantum theories, by
means of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. The modifications of usual
methods needed to employ time-dependent metrics are described. We argue that an
analogue of the adiabatic theorem hold for time dependent metrics and that its
validity forms a necessary condition for consistency of the procedure.
