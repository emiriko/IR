We examine the effect of giant planet migration on the formation of inner
terrestrial planet systems. We consider situations in which the giant planet
halts migration at semi-major axes in the range 0.13 - 1.7 AU due to gas disk
dispersal. An N-body code is employed that is linked to a viscous gas disk
algorithm capable of simulating: gas loss via accretion onto the central star
and photoevaporation; gap formation by the giant planet; type II migration of
the giant; optional type I migration of protoplanets; gas drag on
planetesimals. We find that most of the inner system planetary building blocks
survive the passage of the giant planet, either by being shepherded inward or
scattered into exterior orbits. Systems of one or more hot-Earths are predicted
to form and remain interior to the giant planet, especially if type II
migration has been limited, or where type I migration has affected
protoplanetary dynamics. Habitable planets in low eccentricity warm-Jupiter
systems appear possible if the giant planet makes a limited incursion into the
outer regions of the habitable zone (HZ), or traverses its entire width and
ceases migrating at a radial distance of less than half that of the HZ's inner
edge. We conclude that Type II migration does not prevent terrestrial planet
formation.
