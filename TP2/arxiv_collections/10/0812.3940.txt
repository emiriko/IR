We present a feasibility study for loading cold atomic clouds into magnetic
traps created by single-wall carbon nanotubes grown directly onto dielectric
surfaces. We show that atoms may be captured for experimentally sustainable
nanotube currents, generating trapped clouds whose densities and lifetimes are
sufficient to enable detection by simple imaging methods. This opens the way
for a novel type of conductor to be used in atomchips, enabling atom trapping
at sub-micron distances, with implications for both fundamental studies and for
technological applications.
