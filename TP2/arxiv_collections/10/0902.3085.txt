We study shot noise in tunneling current through a double quantum dot
connected to two electric leads. We derive two master equations in the
occupation-state basis and the eigenstate basis to describe the electron
dynamics. The approach based on the occupation-state basis, despite widely used
in many previous studies, is valid only when the interdot coupling strength is
much smaller than the energy difference between the two dots. In contrast, the
calculations using the eigenstate basis are valid for an arbitrary interdot
coupling. We show that the master equation in the occupation-state basis
includes only the low-order terms with respect to the interdot coupling
compared with the more accurate master equation in the eigenstate basis. Using
realistic model parameters, we demonstrate that the predicted currents and
shot-noise properties from the two approaches are significantly different when
the interdot coupling is not small. Furthermore, properties of the shot noise
predicted using the eigenstate basis successfully reproduce qualitative
features found in a recent experiment.
