We employ the velocity map imaging technique to measure kinetic energy and
angular distributions of state selected CH3 (v2=0,1,2,3) and Br (2P3/2,2P1/2)
photofragments produced by methyl bromide photolysis at 215.9 nm. These results
show unambiguously that the Br and Br* forming channels result in different
vibrational excitation of the umbrella mode of the methyl fragment. Low energy
structured features appear on the images which arise from CH3Br+
photodissociation near 330 nm. The excess energy of the probe laser photon is
channeled into CH3+ vibrational excitation, most probably in the nu_4
degenerate bend
