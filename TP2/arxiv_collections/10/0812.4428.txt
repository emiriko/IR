We present a propagation scheme for time-dependent inhomogeneous
Schr\"odinger equations which occur for example in optimal control theory or in
reactive scattering calculations. A formal solution based on a polynomial
expansion of the inhomogeneous term is derived. It is subjected to an
approximation in terms of Chebychev polynomials. Different variants for the
inhomogeneous propagator are demonstrated and applied to two examples from
optimal control theory. Convergence behavior and numerical efficiency are
analyzed.
