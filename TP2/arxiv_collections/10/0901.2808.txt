In Ayache and Taqqu (2005), the multifractional Brownian (mBm) motion is
obtained by replacing the constant parameter $H$ of the fractional Brownian
motion (fBm) by a smooth enough functional parameter $H(.)$ depending on the
time $t$. Here, we consider the process $Z$ obtained by replacing in the
wavelet expansion of the fBm the index $H$ by a function $H(.)$ depending on
the dyadic point $k/2^j$. This process was introduced in Benassi et al (2000)
to model fBm with piece-wise constant Hurst index and continuous paths. In this
work, we investigate the case where the functional parameter satisfies an
uniform H\"older condition of order $\beta>\sup_{t\in \rit} H(t)$ and ones
shows that, in this case, the process $Z$ is very similar to the mBm in the
following senses: i) the difference between $Z$ and a mBm satisfies an uniform
H\"older condition of order $d>\sup_{t\in \R} H(t)$; ii) as a by product, one
deduces that at each point $t\in \R$ the pointwise H\"older exponent of $Z$ is
$H(t)$ and that $Z$ is tangent to a fBm with Hurst parameter $H(t)$.
