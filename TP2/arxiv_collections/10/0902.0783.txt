The 15N(p,gamma)16O reaction controls the passage of nucleosynthetic material
from the first to the second carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. A direct
measurement of the total 15N(p,gamma)16O cross section at energies
corresponding to hydrogen burning in novae is presented here. Data have been
taken at 90-230 keV center-of-mass energy using a windowless gas target filled
with nitrogen of natural isotopic composition and a bismuth germanate summing
detector. The cross section is found to be a factor two lower than previously
believed.
