Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) can have excellent spin
sensitivity depending on their magnetic flux noise, pick-up loop diameter, and
distance from the sample. We report a family of scanning SQUID susceptometers
with terraced tips that position the pick-up loops 300 nm from the sample. The
600 nm - 2 um pickup loops, defined by focused ion beam, are integrated into a
12-layer optical lithography process allowing flux-locked feedback, in situ
background subtraction and optimized flux noise. These features enable a
sensitivity of ~70 electron spins per root Hertz at 4K.
