Entanglement between two free bosonic modes can be determined via detection
of each mode by different observers and then observing the correlations between
their measurements. We show that such entanglement is degraded as a function of
time if one observer begins in a state of inertial motion but ends in a state
of uniform acceleration while the other remains inertial. At late times we
recover previously established results for observers in relative uniform
acceleration.
