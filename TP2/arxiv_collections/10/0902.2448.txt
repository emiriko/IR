The usual inflationary scenario predicts a Gaussian random primordial density
fluctuation, different Fourier modes of which do not correlate with each other.
In this paper we propose a correlation between these different modes. A simple
case is that these different Fourier modes correlate with each other following
a Gaussian function. For such a primordial density fluctuation we calculate the
CMB angular power spectrum and find that its amplitude decreases but the
decrease is different for different $l$. This feature can be used to constrain
the the correlation strength from the real data.
