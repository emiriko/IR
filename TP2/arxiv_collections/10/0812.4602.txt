We consider the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in a corral-like
potential. Compared to the electronic quantum corrals, the atomic quantum
corrals have the advantage of allowing direct and convenient observation of the
wave dynamics. Our numerical study shows that this advantage not only allows
people to explore the rich dynamical structures in the density distribution but
also makes the corrals useful in many other aspects. In particular, the corrals
for atoms can be arranged into a stadium shape for the experimental
visualization of quantum chaos, which has been elusive with the electronic
quantum corrals.
