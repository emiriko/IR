A number of current theories of plasticity in amorphous solids assume at
their basis that plastic deformations are spatially localized. We present in
this paper a series of numerical experiments to test the degree of locality of
plastic deformation. These experiments increase in terms of the stringency of
the removal of elastic contributions to the observed elasto-plastic
deformations. It is concluded that for all our simulational protocols the
plastic deformations are not localized, and their scaling is sub-extensive. We
offer a number of measures of the magnitude of the plastic deformation, all of
which display sub-extensive scaling characterized by non-trivial exponents. We
provide some evidence that the scaling exponents governing the sub-extensive
scaling laws are non-universal, depending on the degree of disorder and on the
parameters of the systems. Nevertheless understanding what determines these
exponents should shed considerable light on the physics of amorphous solids.
