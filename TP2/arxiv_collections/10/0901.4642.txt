Minimizing handoff latency and achieving near-zero packet loss is critical
for delivering multimedia infotainment applications to fast-moving vehicles
that are likely to encounter frequent handoffs. In this paper, we propose a
dual-radio cross-layer handoff scheme for infrastructure-mode 802.11 Wireless
Networks that achieve this goal. We present performance results of an
implementation of our algorithm in a Linux-based On-Board-Unit prototype.
