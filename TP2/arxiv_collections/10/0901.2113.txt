We present high resolution simulations on the impact of ionizing radiation of
massive O-stars on the surrounding turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). The
simulations are performed with the newly developed software iVINE which
combines ionization with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and
gravitational forces. We show that radiation from hot stars penetrates the ISM,
efficiently heats cold low density gas and amplifies over-densities seeded by
the initial turbulence. The formation of observed pillar-like structures in
star forming regions (e.g. in M16) can be explained by this scenario. At the
tip of the pillars gravitational collapse can be induced, eventually leading to
the formation of low mass stars. Detailed analysis of the evolution of the
turbulent spectra shows that UV-radiation of O-stars indeed provides an
excellent mechanism to sustain and even drive turbulence in the parental
molecular cloud.
