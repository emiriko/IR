We consider one aspect of the theoretical foundations of polarization
experiments on elastic scattering of electrons on protons yielding form factor
ratios incompatible with those that are extracted from nonpolarization
experiments. We analyze the consequences of abandoning the assumption that the
nucleon is a Dirac particle. We show that the process of elastic scattering of
electrons on nucleons is described by the same formulas, irrespective of the
proper Lorentz group representation associated with the nucleon as a particle
with the rest spin 1/2.
