Non-universal boundary conditions in grand unified theories can lead to
nonuniversal gaugino masses at the unification scale. In R-parity preserving
theories the lightest supersymmetric particle is a natural candidate for the
dark matter. The composition of the lightest neutralino and the identity of the
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle are studied, when nonuniversal gaugino
masses come from representations of SO(10). In these cases, the thermal relic
density compatible with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations
is found. Relic densities are compared with the universal case. Mass spectra in
the studied cases are discussed.
