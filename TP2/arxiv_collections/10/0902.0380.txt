In this paper we construct trigonometric functions of the sum T_{p}(h,k),
which is called Dedekind type DC-(Dahee and Changhee) sums. We establish
analytic properties of this sum. We find trigonometric representations of this
sum. We prove reciprocity theorem of this sums. Furthermore, we obtain
relations between the Clausen functions, Polylogarithm function, Hurwitz zeta
function, generalized Lambert series (G-series), Hardy-Berndt sums and the sum
T_{p}(h,k). We also give some applications related to these sums and functions.
