We provide a series of arguments which support the idea that the peak seen in
the $\gamma p \to K^+ \Lambda$ reaction around 1920 MeV should correspond to
the recently predicted state of $J^P=1/2^+$ as a bound state of $K \bar{K}N$
with a mixture of $a_0(980)N$ and $f_0(980)N$ components. At the same time we
propose polarization experiments in that reaction as a further test of the
prediction, as well as a study of the total cross section for $\gamma p \to K^+
K^- p$ at energies close to threshold and of $d \sigma/d M_{inv}$ for invariant
masses close to the two kaon threshold.
