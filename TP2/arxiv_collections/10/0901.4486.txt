Single photons detected by the DELPHI experiment at LEP2 in the years
1997-2000 are reanalysed to investigate the existence of a single extra
dimension in a modified ADD scenario with slightly warped large extra
dimensions. The data collected at centre-of-mass energies between 180 and 209
GeV for an integrated luminosity of ~650 pb^{-1} agree with the predictions of
the Standard Model and allow a limit to be set on graviton emission in one
large extra dimension. The limit obtained on the fundamental mass scale M_D is
1.69 TeV/c^2 at 95% CL, with an expected limit of 1.71 TeV/c^2.
