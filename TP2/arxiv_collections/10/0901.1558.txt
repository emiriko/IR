The influence of phase shifts of electron waves passing through and reflected
by the potential barrier on the Andreev reflection in a
ferromagnet/isolator/d-wave superconductor (FIS) contact is studied. It is
found that in a superconductor the surface spin-dependent Andreev bound states
inside the superconducting gap are formed as a result of the interference of
electron-like and hole-like quasiparticles due to repeated Andreev reflections.
The peak in the conductance of the FIS contact at the zero potential for the
(110)-oriented superconductor disappears rapidly as the polarization of a
ferromagnet increases, whereas for the (100)-oriented superconductor it
appears. The physical reason for this behavior of conductance is discussed.
