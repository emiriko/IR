Development of readout electronics for Time Projection Chamber for a Linear
Collider is ongoing under stringent requirements on high channel density,
lowest possible power consumption and small material budget. In the studied TPC
readout electronics time and charge of TPC signals are measured with the help
of Time-to-Digit Converters. Optimization of performance of this electronics is
considered and a methodology of signal simulation is presented.
