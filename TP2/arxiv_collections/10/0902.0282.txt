Avalanche dynamics and related power law statistics are ubiquitous in nature,
arising in phenomena like earthquakes, forest fires and solar flares. Very
interestingly, an analogous behavior is associated with many condensed matter
systems, like ferromagnets and martensites. Bearing it in mind, we study the
prototypical 3D RFIM at T=0. We find a finite correlation between waiting
intervals between avalanches and the previous avalanche size. This correlation
is not found in other models for avalanches, such as the standard BTW model,
but it is experimentally found in earthquakes and in forest fires. Our study
suggests that this effect occurs in critical points which are at the end of an
athermal first-order transition line separating two behaviors: one with high
activity from another with low activity.
