Electrically small metamaterial-based antennas are discussed from the
industrial point of view using mobile phones as the application example. It
appears, that despite the interesting theoretical findings, the commercial
acceptability of these antennas is low. Some of the issues possibly leading to
this situation are addressed. Discussion topics range from challenging
application environment, through the response of finite-size composite-material
samples, all the way to the required constructive criticism and acknowledgement
of prior art. Selected issues are discussed in more details, and proposals how
to possibly improve the commercial acceptability of metamaterial-based antennas
are made.
