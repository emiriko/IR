This paper addresses two questions in the context of neuronal networks
dynamics, using methods from dynamical systems theory and statistical physics:
(i) How to characterize the statistical properties of sequences of action
potentials ("spike trains") produced by neuronal networks ? and; (ii) what are
the effects of synaptic plasticity on these statistics ? We introduce a
framework in which spike trains are associated to a coding of membrane
potential trajectories, and actually, constitute a symbolic coding in important
explicit examples (the so-called gIF models). On this basis, we use the
thermodynamic formalism from ergodic theory to show how Gibbs distributions are
natural probability measures to describe the statistics of spike trains, given
the empirical averages of prescribed quantities. As a second result, we show
that Gibbs distributions naturally arise when considering "slow" synaptic
plasticity rules where the characteristic time for synapse adaptation is quite
longer than the characteristic time for neurons dynamics.
