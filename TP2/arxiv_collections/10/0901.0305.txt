Using an energy-independent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach to open
systems, we fully describe transport through a sequence of potential barriers
as external barriers are varied. Analyzing the complex eigenvalues of the
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian model, a transition to a superradiant regime is shown
to occur. Transport properties undergo a strong change at the superradiance
transition, where the transmission is maximized and a drastic change in the
structure of resonances is demonstrated. Finally, we analyze the effect of the
superradiance transition in the Anderson localized regime.
