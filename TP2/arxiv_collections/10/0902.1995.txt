We present results from simulations of the extragalactic polarized sky at 1.4
GHz. As the basis for our polarization models, we use a semi-empirical
simulation of the extragalactic total intensity (Stokes I) continuum sky
developed at the University of Oxford (http://scubed.physics.ox.ac.uk) under
the European SKA Design Study (SKADS) initiative, and polarization
distributions derived from analysis of polarization observations. By
considering a luminosity dependence for the polarization of AGN, we are able to
fit the 1.4 GHz polarized source counts derived from the NVSS and the DRAO
ELAIS N1 deep field survey down to approximately 1 mJy. This trend is confirmed
by analysis of the polarization of a complete sample of bright AGN. We are
unable to fit the additional flattening of the polarized source counts from the
deepest observations of the ELAIS N1 survey, which go down to ~0.5 mJy. Below 1
mJy in Stokes I at 1.4 GHz, starforming galaxies become an increasingly
important fraction of all radio sources. We use a spiral galaxy integrated
polarization model to make realistic predictions of the number of polarized
sources at microJy levels in polarized flux density and hence, realistic
predictions of what the next generation radio telescopes such as ASKAP, other
SKA pathfinders and the SKA itself will see.
