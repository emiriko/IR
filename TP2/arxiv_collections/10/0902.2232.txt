The pressure-dependence of the hidden order phase transition of URu2Si2 is
shown to depend sensitively upon the quality of hydrostatic pressure conditions
during electrical resistivity measurements. Hysteresis in pressure is
demonstrated for two choices of pressure medium: the commonly-used mixture of
1:1 Fluorinert FC70/FC77 and pure FC75. In contrast, no hysteresis is observed
when the pressure medium is a 1:1 mixture of n-pentane/isoamyl alcohol, as it
remains hydrostatic over the entire studied pressure range. Possible
ramifications for the interpretation of the temperature-pressure phase diagram
of URu2Si2 are discussed.
