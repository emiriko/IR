We consider soft photons effects (IR structure of QED) on the construction of
physical qubits. Soft-photons appear when we build charged qubits from the
asymptotic states of QED. This construction is necessary in order to include
the effect of soft photons on entanglement measures. The nonexistence of free
charged particles (due to the long range of QED interactions) lead us to
question the sense of the very concept of free charged qubit. In this letter,
using the "dressing" formalism, we build physical charged qubits from dressed
fields which have the correct asymptotic behavior, are gauge invariant, their
propagators have a particle pole structure and are free from infrared
divergences. Finally, we discuss the impact of the soft corrections on the
entanglement measures.
