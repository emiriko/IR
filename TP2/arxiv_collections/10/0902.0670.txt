We report on the generation of continuous-wave squeezed vacuum states of
light at the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm. The squeezed vacuum
states were produced by type I optical parametric amplification (OPA) in a
standing-wave cavity built around a periodically poled potassium titanyl
phosphate (PPKTP) crystal. A non-classical noise reduction of 5.3 dB below the
shot noise was observed by means of balanced homodyne detection.
