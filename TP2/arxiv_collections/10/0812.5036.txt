The expected performance of track reconstruction with LHC events using the
CMS silicon tracker is presented. Track finding and fitting is accomplished
with Kalman Filter techniques that achieve efficiencies above 99% on single
muons with pT>1 GeV/c. Difficulties arise in the context of standard LHC events
with a high density of charged particles, where the rate of fake combinatorial
tracks is very large for low pT tracks, and nuclear interactions in the tracker
material reduce the tracking efficiency for charged hadrons. Recent
improvements with the CMS track reconstruction now allow to efficiently
reconstruct charged tracks with pT down to few hundred MeV/c and as few as
three crossed layers, with a very small fake fraction, by making use of an
optimal rejection of fake tracks in conjunction with an iterative tracking
procedure.
