Neutron diffraction is used to probe the (H,T) phase diagram of
magneto-electric (ME) LiNiPO4 for magnetic fields along the c-axis. At zero
field the Ni spins order in two antiferromagnetic phases. One has commensurate
(C) structures and general ordering vectors (0,0,0), the other one is
incommensurate (IC) with ordering vector (0,q,0). At low temperatures the C
order collapses above 12 Tesla and adopts an IC structure with modulation
vector parallel to (0,q,0). We show that C order is required for the ME effect
and establish how electric polarization results from a field-induced reduction
of the total magneto-elastic energy.
