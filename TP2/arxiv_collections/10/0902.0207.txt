The formula for the lens is derived based on the information of instantaneous
focal function. Focal function is an important tool in designing lenses with
extended depth of focus (EDoF) because this allows EDoF lens designers to try
out various mathematical curves using computers to optimize their design. Once
an optimal focal function information is obtained, the corresponding physical
EDoF lens can be fabricated using the lens equation formulated in this
presentation.
