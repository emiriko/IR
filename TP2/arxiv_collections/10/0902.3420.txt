We study the quantum dynamics of a system consisting of a magnetic molecule
placed on a microcantilever. The amplitude and frequencies of the coupled
magneto-mechanical oscillations are computed. Parameter-free theory shows that
the existing experimental techniques permit observation of the driven coupled
oscillations of the spin and the cantilever, as well as of the splitting of the
mechanical modes of the cantilever caused by spin tunneling.
