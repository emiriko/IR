In the given work the first attempt to generalize quantum uncertainty
relation on macro objects is made. Business company as one of economical
process participants was chosen by the authors for this purpose. The analogies
between quantum micro objects and the structures which from the first sight do
not have anything in common with physics are given. The proof of generalized
uncertainty relation is produced. With the help of generalized uncertainty
relation the authors wanted to elaborate a new non-traditional approach to the
description of companies' business activity and their developing and try to
formulate some advice for them. Thus, our work makes the base of quantum theory
of econimics
