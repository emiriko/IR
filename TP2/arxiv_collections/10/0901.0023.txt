This article presents a heuristic combination of the local and global
formulations of the second law of thermodynamics that suggests the possibility
of theoretical existence of thermodynamics processes with positive and negative
entropy production.Such processes may exhibit entropy couplings that reveal an
unusual behavior from the point of view of conventional thermodynamics.
