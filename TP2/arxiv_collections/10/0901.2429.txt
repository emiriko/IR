We present some of the High Dynamic Range Imaging activities developed around
the coronagraphic test-bench of the Laboratoire A. H. Fizeau (Nice). They
concern research and development of an Apodized Lyot Coronagraph (ALC) for the
VLT-SPHERE instrument and experimental results from our testbed working in the
visible domain. We determined by numerical simulations the specifications of
the apodizing filter and searched the best technological process to manufacture
it. We present the results of the experimental tests on the first apodizer
prototype in the visible and the resulting ALC nulling performances. The tests
concern particularly the apodizer characterization (average transmission radial
profile, global reflectivity and transmittivity in the visible), ALC nulling
performances compared with expectations, sensitivity of the ALC performances to
misalignments of its components.
