A search for muon neutrinos from neutralino annihilations in the Sun has been
performed with the IceCube 22-string neutrino detector using data collected in
104.3 days of live-time in 2007. No excess over the expected atmospheric
background has been observed. Upper limits have been obtained on the
annihilation rate of captured neutralinos in the Sun and converted to limits on
the WIMP-proton cross-sections for WIMP masses in the range 250 - 5000 GeV.
These results are the most stringent limits to date on neutralino annihilation
in the Sun.
