Algorithmic entropy and Shannon entropy are two conceptually different
information measures, as the former is based on size of programs and the later
in probability distributions. However, it is known that, for any recursive
probability distribution, the expected value of algorithmic entropy equals its
Shannon entropy, up to a constant that depends only on the distribution. We
study if a similar relationship holds for R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies of
order $\alpha$, showing that it only holds for R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies
of order 1 (i.e., for Shannon entropy). Regarding a time bounded analogue
relationship, we show that, for distributions such that the cumulative
probability distribution is computable in time $t(n)$, the expected value of
time-bounded algorithmic entropy (where the alloted time is $nt(n)\log
(nt(n))$) is in the same range as the unbounded version. So, for these
distributions, Shannon entropy captures the notion of computationally
accessible information. We prove that, for universal time-bounded distribution
$\m^t(x)$, Tsallis and R\'{e}nyi entropies converge if and only if $\alpha$ is
greater than 1.
