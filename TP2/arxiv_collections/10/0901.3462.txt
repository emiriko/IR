In this paper we investigate electromagnetic interactions for massive spin 2
particles in (A)dS space at linear approximation using gauge invariant
description for such massive particles. We follow bottom-up approach, i.e. we
begin with the introduction of minimal interaction and then proceed by adding
non-minimal interactions with higher and higher number of derivatives together
with corresponding non-minimal corrections to gauge transformations until we
are able to restore gauge invariance broken by transition to gauge covariant
derivatives. We manage to construct a model that smoothly interpolates between
massless particle in (A)dS space and massive one in a flat Minkowski space.
Also we reproduce the same results in a frame-like formalism which can be more
suitable for generalizations on higher spins.
