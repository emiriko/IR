The overall quality of multilayer thin films prepared by electrodeposition is
strongly influenced by the surface and interface roughness which increases with
the layer number. For that very reason the reliable analysis of the first few
layers can be necessary. However, in depth profiling methods based on
sputtering techniques the first layer is always found at the bottom of the
sputtered crater. Since the depth resolution decreases during sputtering, the
analysis of the first few layers are difficult. In order to circumvent this
problem, we used reverse Secondary Neutral Mass Spectrometry (SNMS) depth
profiling method for electrodeposited multilayered films. We prepared thin film
samples in two ways. First, Co/Cu multilayer stacks were electrodeposited on
Si/Cr/Cu substrates and SNMS depth profiling was carried out from the direction
of the topmost layer. Secondly, elecrodeposited Co/Cu multilayer stacks were
coated with a few microns thick Ni layer and detached from the Si substrate in
order to study the film structure from the side of the substrate. Using this
latter method, we were able to analyze the first and, probably, the most even
layers of the thin film structure with high resolution.
