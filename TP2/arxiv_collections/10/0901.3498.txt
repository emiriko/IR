We present results for the evolution of the momentum distribution of a hard
parton traversing a brick of quark-gluon plasma, considering both
bremsstrahlung and collisional energy loss. The complete leading order
transition rates are included. We find a significant modification of the
evolving momentum distribution compared to results obtained by employing an
approximate implementation of the collisional energy loss that uses the mean
energy loss, together with momentum diffusion.
