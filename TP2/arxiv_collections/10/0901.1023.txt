Gravitational field equations in Randers-Finsler space of approximate Berwald
type are investigated. A modified Friedmann model is proposed. It is showed
that the accelerated expanding universe is guaranteed by a constrained
Randers-Finsler structure without invoking dark energy. The geodesic in
Randers-Finsler space is studied. The additional term in the geodesic equation
acts as repulsive force against the gravity.
