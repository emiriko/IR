The propagator of confined quarks is calculated for timelike momenta by
transforming Minkowski Greens functions to the Temporal Euclidean space. Based
on the framework of the Schwinger-Dyson equations the QCD quark propagator is
obtained in two approximations which differ by assuming behaviour of gluon
propagator. In both studied cases we get universal result for the light quarks:
The quark mass function becomes complex bellow expected perturbative threshold,
the obtained absolute value of the infrared mass is $M\simeq \Lambda_{QCD} $
with the infrared phase $\simeq {\pi\over 2}$. Permanent confinement of quarks
is maintained by generation of the complex mass function which prevents a real
pole in the propagator. We will show that timelike dynamical Chiral Symmetry
Breaking (CSB) solution is approximately, but non-trivially determined by the
solution of gap equation in the standard Euclidean space.
