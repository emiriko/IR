We extend to all planar simply connected domains Makarov-type results about
the Hausdorff dimension of $p$-harmonic measure pioneered by Lewis and
Bennewitz in the context of quasidisks.
  The key to our analysis is a gradient estimate using the distance to the
boundary and constants that only depend on $p$. This is achieved by studying
the conformal map from the unit disk to the simply connected domain to
construct good quasicurves from a point in the domain to the boundary.
