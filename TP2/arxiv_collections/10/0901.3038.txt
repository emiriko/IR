We give trade-offs between classical communication, quantum communication,
and entanglement for processing information in the Shannon-theoretic setting.
We first prove a unit-resource capacity theorem that applies to the scenario
where only the above three noiseless resources are available for consumption or
generation. The optimal strategy mixes the three fundamental protocols of
teleportation, super-dense coding, and entanglement distribution. We then
provide an achievable rate region and a matching multi-letter converse for the
direct static capacity theorem. This theorem applies to the scenario where a
large number of copies of a noisy bipartite state are available (in addition to
consumption or generation of the above three noiseless resources). Our coding
strategy involves a protocol that we name the classically-assisted state
redistribution protocol and the three fundamental protocols. We finally provide
an achievable rate region and a matching mutli-letter converse for the direct
dynamic capacity theorem. This theorem applies to the scenario where a large
number of uses of a noisy quantum channel are available in addition to the
consumption or generation of the three noiseless resources. Our coding strategy
combines the classically-enhanced father protocol with the three fundamental
unit protocols.
