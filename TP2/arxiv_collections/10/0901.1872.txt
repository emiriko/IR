Observations of white dwarfs in the globular clusters NGC 6397 and
  Omega Centauri indicate that these stars may get a velocity kick during their
time as giants. If the mass loss while on the asymptotic giant branch is
slightly asymmetric, the resulting white dwarf could be born with such a
velocity kick. These energetic white dwarfs will impart their excess energy on
other stars as they travel through the cluster. A Monte-Carlo simulation of the
white-dwarfs kicks combined with estimate of the phase-space diffusion of the
white dwarfs reveals that as the white dwarfs equilibrate, they lose most of
their energy in the central region of the cluster. They could possibly augment
the effect of binaries, delaying core collapse or increasing the size of
globular cluster cores.
