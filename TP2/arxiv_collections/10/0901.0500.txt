We investigate the dependency of electrostatic interaction forces on applied
potentials in Electrostatic Force Microscopy (EFM) as well as in related local
potentiometry techniques like Kelvin Probe Microscopy (KPM). The approximated
expression of electrostatic interaction between two conductors, usually
employed in EFM and KPM, may loose its validity when probe-sample distance is
not very small, as often realized when realistic nanostructured systems with
complex topography are investigated. In such conditions, electrostatic
interaction does not depend solely on the potential difference between probe
and sample, but instead it may depend on the bias applied to each conductor.
For instance, electrostatic force can change from repulsive to attractive for
certain ranges of applied potentials and probe-sample distances, and this fact
cannot be accounted for by approximated models. We propose a general
capacitance model, even applicable to more than two conductors, considering
values of potentials applied to each of the conductors to determine the
resulting forces and force gradients, being able to account for the above
phenomenon as well as to describe interactions at larger distances. Results
from numerical simulations and experiments on metal stripe electrodes and
semiconductor nanowires supporting such scenario in typical regimes of EFM
investigations are presented, evidencing the importance of a more rigorous
modelling for EFM data interpretation. Furthermore, physical meaning of Kelvin
potential as used in KPM applications can also be clarified by means of the
reported formalism.
