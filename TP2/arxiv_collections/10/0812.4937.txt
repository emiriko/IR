A novel algorithm is proposed for the interpolation step of the
Guruswami-Sudan list decoding algorithm. The proposed method is based on the
binary exponentiation algorithm, and can be considered as an extension of the
Lee-O'Sullivan algorithm. The algorithm is shown to achieve both asymptotical
and practical performance gain compared to the case of iterative interpolation
algorithm. Further complexity reduction is achieved by integrating the proposed
method with re-encoding. The key contribution of the paper, which enables the
complexity reduction, is a novel randomized ideal multiplication algorithm.
