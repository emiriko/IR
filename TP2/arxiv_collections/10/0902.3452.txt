Numerical simulations of the effect of a long-range scalar interaction (LRSI)
acting only on nonbaryonic dark matter, with strength comparable to gravity,
show patterns of disruption of satellites that can agree with what is seen in
the Milky Way. This includes the symmetric Sagittarius stellar stream. The
exception presented here to the Kesden and Kamionkowski demonstration that an
LRSI tends to produce distinctly asymmetric streams follows if the LRSI is
strong enough to separate the stars from the dark matter before tidal
disruption of the stellar component, and if stars dominate the mass in the
luminous part of the satellite. It requires that the Sgr galaxy now contains
little dark matter, which may be consistent with the Sgr stellar velocity
dispersion, for in the simulation the dispersion at pericenter exceeds virial.
We present other examples of simulations in which a strong LRSI produces
satellites with large mass-to-light ratio, as in Draco, or free streams of
stars, which might be compared to "orphan" streams.
