The variance of an observable in a quantum state is usually used to describe
Heisenberg uncertainty relation. For mixed states, the variance includes
quantum uncertainty and classical uncertainty. By means of the skew information
and the decomposition of the variance, a stronger uncertainty relation was
presented by Luo in [Phys. Rev. A 72, 042110 (2005)]. In this paper, by using
Wigner-Yanase-Dyson information which is a generalization of the skew
information, we propose a general uncertainty relation of mixed states.
