Assuming high-energy tri-bi-maximal mixing we study the radiative running of
leptonic mixing angles and obtain limits on the high-energy scale from
requiring consistency with the observed mixing. We construct a model in which a
non-Abelian discrete family symmetry leads both to a quasi-degenerate neutrino
mass spectrum and to near tri-bi-maximal mixing.
