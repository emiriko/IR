We introduce a class of models of semiflexible polymers. The latter are
characterized by a strong rigidity, the correlation length associated to the
gradient-gradient correlations, called the persistence length, being of the
same order as the polymer length.
  We determine the macroscopic scaling limit, from which we deduce bounds on
the free energy of a polymer confined inside a narrow tube.
