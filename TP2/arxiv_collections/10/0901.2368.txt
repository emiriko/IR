We perform a new analysis of the extant ROSAT and XMM-Newton X-ray surveys of
the southern open cluster Blanco 1, utilizing new BVIc photometric and proper
motion data sets. In our study, we match optical counterparts to 47 X-ray
sources associated with Blanco 1 cluster members, 6 of which were listed in
previous X-ray studies as cluster nonmembers. Our new catalog of optical
counterparts to X-ray sources clearly traces out the Blanco 1 main sequence in
a CMD, extending from early G to mid-M spectral types. Additionally, we derive
new Lx as well as Lx/Lbol ratios for confirmed cluster members. We compare
these X-ray properties to other young open clusters, including the coeval
Pleiades cluster, to investigate the relationship between age and X-ray
activity. We find that stars in Blanco 1 generally exhibit X-ray properties
similar to those of other open clusters, namely increasing Lx/Lbol with
reducing mass for earlier-type stars, and a saturation limit of Lx/Lbol at a
magnitude of 10^-3 for stars with V-Ic > 1.25. More generally, the X-ray
detected stars in Blanco 1 have X-ray emission magnitudes that agree with the
overall trends seen in the other young clusters. In a direct comparison of
Blanco 1 to the Pleiades open cluster, members of both clusters have similar
X-ray characteristics; however, there does appear to be some discrepancies in
the distribution of Lx/Lbol as a function of color that may be related to
scatter seen in the Pleiades CMD. Moreover, previous comparisons of this nature
for Blanco 1 were not possible due to the reliance on photographic photometry.
This is where the power of precise, homogeneous, and standardized CCD
photometry allows for a high fidelity, detailed study of the X-ray properties
of stars in Blanco 1. [abridged]
