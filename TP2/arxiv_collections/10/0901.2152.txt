We derive the equations of motion describing the feedback control of quantum
systems in the regime of "good control", in which the control is sufficient to
keep the system close to the desired state. One can view this regime as the
quantum equivalent of the "linearized" regime for feedback control of classical
nonlinear systems. Strikingly, while the dynamics of a single qubit in this
regime is indeed linear, that of all larger systems remains nonlinear, in
contrast to the classical case. As a first application of these equations, we
determine the steady-state performance of feedback protocols for a single qubit
that use unbiased measurements.
