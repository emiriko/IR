We present Chandra observations of nine high-redshift quasars (z=2.7-5.9)
discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with weak or undetectable
high-ionization emission lines in their UV spectra (WLQs). Adding archival
X-ray observations of six additional sources of this class has enabled us to
place the strongest constraints yet on the X-ray properties of this remarkable
class of AGNs. Although our data cannot rule out the possibility that the
emission lines are overwhelmed by a relativistically boosted continuum, as
manifested by BL Lac objects, we find that WLQs are considerably weaker in the
X-ray and radio bands than the majority of BL Lacs found at much lower
redshifts. If WLQs are high-redshift BL Lacs, then it is difficult to explain
the lack of a large parent population of X-ray and radio bright weak-lined
sources at high redshift. We also consider the possibility that WLQs are
quasars with extreme properties, and in particular that the emission lines are
suppressed by high accretion rates. Using joint spectral fitting of the X-ray
spectra of 11 WLQs we find that the mean photon index in the hard X-ray band is
consistent with those observed in typical radio-quiet AGNs with no hint of an
unusually steep hard-X-ray spectrum. This result poses a challenge to the
hypothesis that WLQs have extremely high accretion rates, and we discuss
additional observations required to test this idea.
