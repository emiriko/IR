A topological modulation of magnetic thin films can induce a magnetic
anisotropy of magnetostatic origin. In this letter, we report on the magnetic
properties of NiFe layers deposited on wavy shaped Si substrates. Without any
modulation, our films always present an intrinsic anisotropy. We show
unambiguously that patterning the substrate can overcome this anisotropy and
even impose a different easy axis of magnetization. This allows the definition
of two orthogonal easy axes at different places on the same substrate. This
control of anisotropy both in direction and intensity paves the way to the
realization of high precision bidimensional magnetic sensors.
