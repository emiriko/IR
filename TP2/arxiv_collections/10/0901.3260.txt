We present an exact result for the non-adiabatic transition probability and
hence the defect density in the final state of a one-dimensional Kitaev model
following a slow quench of the parameter $J_-$, which estimates the anisotropy
between the interactions, as $J_-(t)\sim -|t/\tau|$. Here, time $t$ goes from
$-\infty$ to $+\infty$ and $\tau$ defines the rate of change of the
Hamiltonian. In other words, the spin chain initially prepared in its ground
state is driven by changing $J_-$ linearly in time up to the quantum critical
point, which in the model considered here occurs at at $t=0$, reversed and then
gradually decreased to its initial value at the same rate. We have thoroughly
compared the reverse quenching with its counterpart forward quenching $i.e.,$
$J_-\sim t/\tau$. Our exact calculation shows that the probability of
excitations is zero for the wave vector at which the instantaneous energy gap
is zero at the critical point $J_{-}=0$ as opposed to the maximum value of
unity in the forward quenching. It is also shown that the defect density in the
final state following a reverse quenching, we propose here, is nearly half of
the defects generated in the forward quenching. We argue that the defects
produced when the system reaches the quantum critical point gets redistributed
in the wave vector space at the final time in case of reverse quenching whereas
it keeps on increasing till the final time in the forward quenching. We study
the entropy density and also the time evolution of the diagonal entropy density
in the case of the reverse quenching and compare it with the forward case.
