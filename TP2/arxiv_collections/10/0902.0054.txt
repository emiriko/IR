We express generalized Cauchy-Stieltjes transforms of some particular Beta
distributions (of ultraspherical type generating functions for orthogonal
polynomials) as a powered Cauchy-Stieltjes transform of some measure. For
suitable values of the power parameter, the latter measure turns out to be a
probability measure and its density is written down using Markov transforms.
The discarded values give a negative answer to a deformed free probability
unless a restriction on the power parameter is made. A particular symmetric
distribution interpolating between Wigner and arcsine distributions is
obtained. Its moments are expressed through a terminating hypergeometric series
interpolating between Catalan and shifed Catalan numbers. for small values of
the power parameter, the free cumulants are computed. Interesting opne problems
related to a deformed representation theory of the infinite symmetric group and
to a deformed Bozejko's convolution are discussed.
