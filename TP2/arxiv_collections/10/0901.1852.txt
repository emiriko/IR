Systems consisting of cold interacting bosons show interesting collective
phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation or superfluidity and are currently
studied in condensed matter and atomic physics. Of particular interest are
nonideal bosons which exhibit strong correlation and spatial localization
effects. Here we analyse the ground-state of a two-dimensional Bose system with
a Hartree-Fock type approximation that was first introduced by Romanovsky et
al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 230405 (2004)]. We apply this method to a one
dimensional system of charged bosons and analyze the behaviour at strong
coupling.
