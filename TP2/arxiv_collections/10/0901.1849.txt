Working in Winfree's abstract tile assembly model, we show that a
constant-size tile assembly system can be programmed through relative tile
concentrations to build an n x n square with high probability, for any
sufficiently large n. This answers an open question of Kao and Schweller
(Randomized Self-Assembly for Approximate Shapes, ICALP 2008), who showed how
to build an approximately n x n square using tile concentration programming,
and asked whether the approximation could be made exact with high probability.
We show how this technique can be modified to answer another question of Kao
and Schweller, by showing that a constant-size tile assembly system can be
programmed through tile concentrations to assemble arbitrary finite *scaled
shapes*, which are shapes modified by replacing each point with a c x c block
of points, for some integer c. Furthermore, we exhibit a smooth tradeoff
between specifying bits of n via tile concentrations versus specifying them via
hard-coded tile types, which allows tile concentration programming to be
employed for specifying a fraction of the bits of "input" to a tile assembly
system, under the constraint that concentrations can only be specified to a
limited precision. Finally, to account for some unrealistic aspects of the tile
concentration programming model, we show how to modify the construction to use
only concentrations that are arbitrarily close to uniform.
