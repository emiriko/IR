Aims: A pilot project has been carried out to measure circumstellar CO
emission from three OH/IR stars close to the Galactic centre. The intention was
to find out whether it would be possible to conduct a large-scale survey for
mass-loss rates using, for example, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).
Such a survey would increase our understanding of the evolution of the Galactic
bulge.
  Methods: Two millimetre-wave instruments were used: the Nobeyama Millimeter
Array at 115 GHz and the Submillimeter Array at 230 GHz. An interferometer is
necessary as a `spatial filter' in this region of space because of the
confusion with interstellar CO emission.
  Results: Towards two of the stars, CO emission was detected with positions
and radial velocities coinciding within the statistical errors with the
corresponding data of the associated OH sources. However, for one of the stars
the line profile is not what one expects for an unresolved expanding
circumstellar envelope. We believe that this CO envelope is partially resolved
and that this star therefore is a foreground star not belonging to the bulge.
  Conclusions: The results of the observations have shown that it is possible
to detect line profiles of circumstellar CO from late-type stars both within
and in the direction of the Galactic bulge. ALMA will be able to detect CO
emission in short integrations with sensitivity sufficient to estimate
mass-loss rates from a large number of such stars.
