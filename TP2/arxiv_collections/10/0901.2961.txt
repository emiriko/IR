We explicitly describe certain components of the finite size groundstate of
the inhomogeneous transfer matrix of the O(n=1) loop model on a strip with
non-trivial boundaries on both sides. In addition we compute explicitly the
groundstate normalisation which is given as a product of four symplectic
characters.
