We study the one loop new physics effects to the CP even triple neutral gauge
boson vertices $\gamma^\star \gamma Z$, $\gamma^\star Z Z$, $Z^\star Z \gamma$
and $Z^\star Z Z$ in the context of Little Higgs models. We compute the
contribution of the additional fermions in Littles Higgs model in the framework
of direct product groups where $[SU(2)\times U(1)]^2 $ gauge symmetry is
embedded in SU(5) global symmetry and also in the framework of simple group
where $SU(N)\times U(1)$ gauge symmetry breaks down to $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$. We
calculate the contribution of the fermions to these couplings when $T$ parity
is invoked. In addition, we re-examine the MSSM contribution at the chosen
point of SPS1a' and compare with the SM and Little Higgs models.
