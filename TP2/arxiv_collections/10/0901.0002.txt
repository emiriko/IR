We present updated leading-order, next-to-leading order and
next-to-next-to-leading order parton distribution functions ("MSTW 2008")
determined from global analysis of hard-scattering data within the standard
framework of leading-twist fixed-order collinear factorisation in the MSbar
scheme. These parton distributions supersede the previously available "MRST"
sets and should be used for the first LHC data-taking and for the associated
theoretical calculations. New data sets fitted include CCFR/NuTeV dimuon cross
sections, which constrain the strange quark and antiquark distributions, and
Tevatron Run II data on inclusive jet production, the lepton charge asymmetry
from W decays and the Z rapidity distribution. Uncertainties are propagated
from the experimental errors on the fitted data points using a new dynamic
procedure for each eigenvector of the covariance matrix. We discuss the major
changes compared to previous MRST fits, briefly compare to parton distributions
obtained by other fitting groups, and give predictions for the W and Z total
cross sections at the Tevatron and LHC.
