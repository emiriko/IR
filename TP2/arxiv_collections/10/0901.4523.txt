A noticeable fraction of subdwarf B stars shows either short-period (p-mode)
or long-period (g-mode) luminosity variations, with two objects so far known to
exhibit hybrid behaviour, i.e. showing both types of modes at the same time.
The pulsating subdwarf B star V391 Pegasi (or HS2201+2610), which is close to
the two known hybrid pulsators in the log g - Teff plane, has recently been
discovered to host a planetary companion. In order to learn more about the
planetary companion and its possible influence on the evolution of its host
star (subdwarf B star formation is still not well understood), an accurate
characterisation of the host star is required. As part of an ongoing effort to
significantly improve the asteroseismic characterisation of the host star, we
investigate the low-frequency behaviour of HS2201+2610. We obtained rapid high
signal-to-noise photometric CCD (B-filter) and PMT (clear-filter) data at
2m-class telescopes and carried out a careful frequency analysis of the light
curves. In addition to the previously known short-period luminosity variations
in the range 342s-367s, we find a long-period variation with a period of 54min
and an amplitude of 0.15 per cent. This can most plausibly be identified with a
g-mode pulsation, so that HS2201+2610 is a new addition to the short list of
hybrid sdB pulsators. Along with the previously known pulsating subdwarf B
stars HS0702+6043 and Balloon090100001 showing hybrid behaviour, the new hybrid
HS2201+2610 is the third member of this class. This important property of
HS2201+2610 can lead to a better characterisation of this planet-hosting star,
helping the characterisation of its planetary companion as well. Current
pulsation models cannot yet reproduce hybrid sdBV stars particularly well and
improved pulsation models for this object have to include the hybrid behaviour.
