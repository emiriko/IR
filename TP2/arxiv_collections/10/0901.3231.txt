We present the status of our analysis on the order of the finite temperature
transition in QCD with two flavors of degenerate fermions. Our new simulations
on large lattices support the hypothesis of the first order nature of the
transition, showing a preliminary two state signal. We will discuss the
implications and the next steps in our analysis.
