Consider a compact, orientable, three dimensional Riemannian manifold with
boundary with nonnegative scalar curvature. Suppose its boundary is the
disjoint union of two pieces: the horizon boundary and the outer boundary,
where the horizon boundary consists of the unique closed minimal surfaces in
the manifold and the outer boundary is metrically a round sphere. We obtain an
inequality relating the area of the horizon boundary to the area and the total
mean curvature of the outer boundary. Such a manifold may be thought as a
region, surrounding the outermost apparent horizons of black holes, in a
time-symmetric slice of a space-time in the context of general relativity. The
inequality we establish has close ties with the Riemannian Penrose Inequality,
proved by Huisken and Ilmanen, and by Bray.
