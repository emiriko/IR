The Jimbo-Miwa equation is the second equation in the well known KP hierarchy
of integrable systems, which is used to describe certain interesting
(3+1)-dimensional waves in physics but not pass any of the conventional
integrability tests. The Konopelchenko-Dubrovsky equations arose in physics in
connection with the nonlinear weaves with a weak dispersion. In this paper, we
obtain two families of explicit exact solutions with multiple parameter
functions for these equations by using Xu's stable-range method and our
logarithmic generalization of the stable-range method. These parameter
functions make our solutions more applicable to related practical models and
boundary value problems.
