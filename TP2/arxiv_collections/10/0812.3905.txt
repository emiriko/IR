Etching experiments were performed that reveal the vertical distribution of
optically active nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond created in close
proximity to a surface through ion implantation and annealing. The NV
distribution depends strongly on the native nitrogen concentration, and
spectral measurements of the neutral and negatively-charged NV peaks give
evidence for electron depletion effects in lower-nitrogen material. The results
are important for potential quantum information and magnetometer devices where
NV centers must be created in close proximity to a surface for coupling to
optical structures.
