Self-similar structures converging to accumulation points are observed in
optically injected lasers. These structures are associated to saddle-node
bifurcations. We found that these phenomena can be properly explained in the
framework of saddle-node bifurcation cascade. Apparently not connected
phenomena in these lasers are shown to be related within this framework.
