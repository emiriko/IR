The Bose condensation of 2D dipolar excitons in quantum wells is numerically
studied by the diffusion Monte Carlo simulation method. The correlation,
microscopic, thermodynamic, and spectral characteristics are calculated. It is
shown that, in structures of coupled quantum wells, in which low-temperature
features of exciton luminescence have presently been observed, dipolar excitons
form a strongly correlated system. Their Bose condensation can experimentally
be achieved much easily than for ideal or weakly correlated excitons.
