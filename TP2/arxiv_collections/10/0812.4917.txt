In the leading twist approximation of the Wilson operator product expansion
with standard and "frozen" versions of strong copling constant we show that the
Bessel-inspired behavior of the structure function $F_2$ at small $x$, obtained
for a flat initial condition in the DGLAP evolution, leads to very good
agreement with the deep inelastic scattering experimental data from HERA.
