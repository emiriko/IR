We investigate Josephson junctions with superconducting ferropnictides, both
in the diffusive and ballistic limit. We focus on the proposed $s_\pm$-wave
state, and find that the relative phase shift intrinsic to the $s_\pm$-wave
state may provide 0-$\pi$ oscillations in the Josephson current. This feature
can be used to discriminate this pairing state from the conventional s-wave
symmetry. The 0-$\pi$ oscillations appear both as a function of the ratio of
the interface resistances for each band and, more importantly, as a function of
temperature, which greatly aids in their detection.
