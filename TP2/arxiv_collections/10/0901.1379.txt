This study presents miscellaneous properties of pseudo-factorials, which are
numbers whose recurrence relation is a twisted form of that of usual
factorials. These numbers are associated with special elliptic functions, most
notably, a Dixonian and a Weierstrass function, which parametrize the Fermat
cubic curve and are relative to a hexagonal lattice. A continued fraction
expansion of the ordinary generating function of pseudo-factorials, first
discovered empirically, is established here. This article also provides a
characterization of the associated orthogonal polynomials, which appear to form
a new family of "elliptic polynomials", as well as various other properties of
pseudo-factorials, including a hexagonal lattice sum expression and elementary
congruences.
