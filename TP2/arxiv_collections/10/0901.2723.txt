Adopting the scientific method a theoretical model is proposed as foundation
for information science and technology, extending the existing theory of
signaling: a fact f becomes known in a physical system only following the
success of a test f, tests performed primarily by human sensors and applied to
(physical) phenomena within which further tests may be performed. Tests are
phenomena and classify phenomena. A phenomenon occupies both time and space,
facts and inferences having physical counterparts which are phenomena of
specified classes. Identifiers such as f are conventional, assigned by humans;
a fact (f', f'') reports the success of a test of generic class f', the outcome
f'' of the reported application classifying the successful test in more detail.
Facts then exist only within structures of a form dictated by constraints on
the structural design of tests. The model explains why responses of real time
systems are not uniquely predictable and why restrictions, on concurrency in
performing inferences within them, are needed. Improved methods, based on the
model and applicable throughout the software life-cycle, are summarised in the
paper. No report of similar work has been found in the literature.
