We report measurements of the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation and a
band structure calculation for the pnictide superconductor BaNi$_2$P$_2$, which
is isostructural to BaFe$_2$As$_2$, the mother compound of the iron-pnictide
high-$T_c$ superconductor (Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$)Fe$_2$As$_2$. Six dHvA-frequency
branches with frequencies up to $\sim$8 kT were observed, and they are in
excellent agreement with results of the band-structure calculation. The
determined Fermi surface is large, enclosing about one electron and hole per
formula unit, and three-dimensional. This is in contrast to the small
two-dimensional Fermi surface expected for the iron-pnictide high-$T_c$
superconductors. The mass enhancement is about two.
