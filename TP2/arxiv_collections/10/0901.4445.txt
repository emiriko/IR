We re-examine the recent suggestion of a high fraction of transition discs
(i.e. those with a cleared inner hole) in M stars, motivated by the fact that
we expect that, for M stars, even discs without inner holes should exhibit very
weak excess shortward of around 10um. Our analysis of spectral energy
distribution models suggest that this indeed means that M stars where a
detectable excess begins at around 6um may be mis-classified as transition
discs when in fact they have optically thick dust extending in to the dust
sublimation radius. Consequently, we estimate that the transition disc fraction
among M stars in the Coronet cluster is ~15 +/-10 % (rather than the recently
claimed value of 50%). This revised figure would imply that the transition disc
fraction is not after all markedly higher in later type stars. We suggest that
for M stars, transition discs can only be readily identified if they have
emission that is close to photospheric out to > 10um.
