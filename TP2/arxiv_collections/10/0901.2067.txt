We study the three-player Prisoner's Dilemma game under the effect of
decoherence and correlated noise. It is seen that the quantum player is always
better off over the classical players. It is also seen that the game's Nash
equilibrium does not change in the presence of correlated noise in
contradiction to the effect of decoherence in multiplayer case. Furthermore, it
is shown that for maximum correlation the game does not behave as a noiseless
game and the quantum player is still better off for all values of the
decoherence parameter p which is not possible in the two-player case. In
addition, the payoffs reduction due to decoherence is controlled by the
correlated noise throughout the course of the game.
