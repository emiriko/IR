The magnetoresistance (MR) of CeCoIn_5 is notably different from that in many
conventional metals. We show that a pronounced crossover from negative to
positive MR at elevated temperatures and fixed magnetic fields is determined by
the scaling behavior of quasiparticle effective mass. At a quantum critical
point (QCP) this dependence generates kinks (crossover points from fast to slow
growth) in thermodynamic characteristics (like specific heat, magnetization
etc) at some temperatures when a strongly correlated electron system transits
from the magnetic field induced Landau Fermi liquid (LFL) regime to the
non-Fermi liquid (NFL) one taking place at rising temperatures. We show that
the above kink-like peculiarity separates two distinct energy scales in QCP
vicinity - low temperature LFL scale and high temperature one related to NFL
regime. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis of experimental data permits to
reveal for the first time new MR and kinks scaling behavior as well as to
identify the physical reasons for above energy scales.
