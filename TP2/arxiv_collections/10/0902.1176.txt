We perform a realistic evaluation of the potential of IceCube, a
kilometer-scale neutrino detector under construction at the South Pole, to
detect neutrinos in the direction of the potential accelerators of the Galactic
cosmic rays. We take fully account of the fact that the measurement of the
energy of the secondary muons can be used to further discriminate between the
signal and the background of atmospheric neutrinos. We conclude that IceCube
could identify the sources in the Milagro sky map as the sources of the
Galactic cosmic rays at the 3 sigma level in one year and at the 5 sigma level
in three years. We discuss the dependence of these expectations on ambiguities,
mostly associated with our incomplete knowledge of the astrophysics of the
sources.
