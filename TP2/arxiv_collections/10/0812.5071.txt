The transport of interacting Brownian particles in a periodic asymmetric
(ratchet) substrate is studied numerically. In a zero-temperature regime, the
system behaves as a reversible step motor, undergoing multiple sign reversals
of the particle current as any of the following parameters are varied: the
pinning potential parameters, the particle occupation number, and the
excitation amplitude. The reversals are induced by successive changes in the
symmetry of the effective ratchet potential produced by the substrate and the
fraction of particles which are effectively pinned. At high temperatures and
low frequencies, thermal noise assists delocalization of the pinned particles,
rendering the system to recover net motion along the gentler direction of the
substrate potential. The joint effect of high temperature and high frequency,
on the other hand, induces an additional current inversion, this time favoring
motion along the direction where the ratchet potential is steeper. The
dependence of these properties on the ratchet parameters and particle density
is analyzed in detail.
