In this paper, we study the thermodynamical properties of the
(2+1)dimensional black hole with a non-linear electrodynamics and without
cosmological constant using the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). This
approach shows that there is a maximum temperature for the black hole depending
only on the electric charge and corresponding to the minimum radius of the
event horizon, of the order of the Planck scale. Finally we show that the heat
capacity for this black hole has the expected behavior.
