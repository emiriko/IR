The onset of Fourier's law in a one-dimensional quantum system is addressed
via a simple model of weakly coupled quantum systems in contact with thermal
baths at their edges. Using analytical arguments we show that the crossover
from the ballistic (invalid Fourier's law) to diffusive (valid Fourier's law)
regimes is characterized by a thermal length-scale, which is directly related
to the profile of the local temperature. In the same vein, dephasing is shown
to give rise to a classical Fourier's law, similarly to the onset of Ohm's law
in mesoscopic conductors.
