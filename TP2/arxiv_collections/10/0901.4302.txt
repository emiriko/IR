We have re-examined the most luminous X-ray sources in the starburst galaxy
NGC 4631, using XMM-Newton, Chandra and ROSAT data. The most interesting source
is a highly variable supersoft ULX. We suggest that its bolometric luminosity ~
a few 10^{39} erg/s in the high/supersoft state: this is an order of magnitude
lower than estimated in previous studies, thus reducing the need for extreme or
exotic scenarios. Moreover, we find that this source was in a non-canonical
low/soft (kT ~ 0.1-0.3 keV) state during the Chandra observation. By comparing
the high and low state, we argue that the spectral properties may not be
consistent with the expected behaviour of an accreting intermediate-mass black
hole. We suggest that recurrent super-Eddington outbursts with photospheric
expansion from a massive white dwarf (M_{wd} >~ 1.3 M_{sun}), powered by
non-steady nuclear burning, may be a viable possibility, in alternative to the
previously proposed scenario of a super-Eddington outflow from an accreting
stellar-mass black hole. The long-term average accretion rate required for
nuclear burning to power such white-dwarf outbursts in this source and perhaps
in other supersoft ULXs is ~ 5-10 x 10^{-6} M_{sun}/yr: this is comparable to
the thermal-timescale mass transfer rate invoked to explain the most luminous
hard-spectrum ULXs (powered by black hole accretion). The other four most
luminous X-ray sources in NGC 4631 (three of which can be classified as ULXs)
appear to be typical accreting black holes, in four different spectral states:
high/soft, convex-spectrum, power-law with soft excess, and simple power-law.
None of them requires masses >~ 50 M_{sun}.
