We review recent experimental measurements of the Fermi surface of the
iron-pnictide superconductor LaFePO using quantum oscillation techniques. These
studies show that the Fermi surface topology is close to that predicted by
first principles density functional theory calculations, consisting of
quasi-two-dimensional electron-like and hole-like sheets. The total volume of
the two hole sheets is almost equal to that of the two electron sheets, and the
hole and electron Fermi surface sheets are close to a nesting condition. No
evidence for the predicted three dimensional pocket arising from the Fe
$d_{z^2}$ band is found. Measurements of the effective mass suggest a
renormalisation of around two, close to the value for the overall band
renormalisation found in recent angle resolved photoemission measurements.
