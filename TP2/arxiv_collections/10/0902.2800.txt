Single resonant productions of the fourth standard model generation charged
lepton via anomalous interactions at gamma e colliders based on future linear
e^+ e^- colliders with 500 GeV and 1 TeV center of mass energies are studied.
Signatures of $\gamma e\to \ell_4\to e\gamma $ and $\gamma e\to \ell_4\to eZ$
anomalous processes followed by the hadronic and leptonic decay of the Z boson
and corresponding standard model backgrounds are discussed in details. The
lowest necessary luminosities to observe these processes and the achievable
values of the anomalous coupling strengths are determined.
