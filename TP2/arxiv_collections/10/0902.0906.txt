The calculations of three-body direct nuclear reactions with nonlocal optical
potentials are performed for the first time using the framework of Faddeev-type
scattering equations. Important nonlocality effect is found for transfer
reactions like d+16O -> p + 17O often improving the description of the
experimental data.
