We study single soft scalar emission amplitudes of $\mathcal{N}=8$
supergravity (SUGRA) at the one-loop level using an explicit formula for
one-loop amplitudes in terms of tree amplitudes, which in turn are evaluated
using supersymmetric BCFW recursion relations. It turns out that the infrared
finite parts of all such amplitudes vanish in the soft momentum limit, which
supports the conjecture that $E_{7(7)}$ symmetry has no anomalies at the
one-loop level.
