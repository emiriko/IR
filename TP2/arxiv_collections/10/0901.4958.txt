The fully hadronic final states of two signal processes from an mSUGRA
inspired scenario (SUSY-P5) are studied within a full simulation of the LDC'
detector model. These are chargino pair and neutralino pair production, i.e.
e+e- -> C1C1 -> qq'N1 qq'N1 and e+e- -> N2N2 -> qq'N1 qq'N1. Both processes
have to be separated sufficiently from all background to measure the respective
production cross sections and extract the masses of the involved bosinos,
m(C1), m(N2) and m(LSP)=m(N1). This is achieved by fitting the energy spectra
of the reconstructed gauge bosons while taking into account the finite width of
the boson mass. From simulation data corresponding to 500/fb of luminosity, a
mass resolution of about 0.5 GeV seems to be achievable.
