In this work we discuss the occurrence of ferromagnetism in transition-like
metals. The metal is represented by two hybridized($V$) and shifted
$(\epsilon_s$) bands one of which includes Hubbard correlation whereas the
other is uncorrelated. The starting point is to transform the original
Hamiltonian into an effective one. Only one site retains the full correlation
(U) while in the others the correlations are represented by an effective field,
the self-energy(single-site approximation). This field is self-consistently
determined by imposing the translational invariance of the problem. Thereby one
gets an exchange split quasi-particle density of states and then an
electron-spin polarization for some values of the parameters $(U,V, \alpha,
\epsilon_s)$, $\alpha$ being the ratio of the effective masses of the two bands
and of the occupation number $n$.
