We prove that a compactly supported homeomorphism of a smooth manifold of
dimension greater or equal to 5 can be approximated uniformly by compactly
supported diffeomorphisms if and only if it is isotopic to a diffeomorphism. If
the given homeomorphism is in addition volume preserving, then it can be
approximated uniformly by volume preserving diffeomorphisms.
