We develop an algebraic framework for the description and analysis of
financial behaviours, that is, behaviours that consist of transferring certain
amounts of money at planned times. To a large extent, analysis of financial
products amounts to analysis of such behaviours. We formalize the cumulative
interest compliant conservation requirement for financial products proposed by
Wesseling and van den Bergh by an equation in the framework developed and
define a notion of financial product behaviour using this formalization. We
also present some properties of financial product behaviours. The development
of the framework has been influenced by previous work on the process algebra
ACP.
