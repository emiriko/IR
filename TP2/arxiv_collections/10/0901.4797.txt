We study the spectrum and possible observability of Higgs-like scalar
particles associated with spontaneous breaking at high energies of fermion
family symmetries such as $SU(3)_f$ proposed sometime ago by King and Ross. We
treat the energy scale at which the symmetry is broken as a variable not
necessarily as high as the GUT scale used by King and Ross. We compare and
contrast a non-supersymmetric treatment of the fermion family symmetry model
introduced here, and the supersymmetric treatment used by King and Ross.
