As technological advances allow us to fabricate smaller autonomous
self-propelled devices, it is clear that at some point directed propulsion
could not come from pre-specified deterministic periodic deformation of the
swimmer's body and we need to develop strategies to extract a net directed
motion from a series of random transitions in the conformation space of the
swimmer. We present a theoretical formulation to describe the "stochastic
motor" that drives the motion of low Reynolds number swimmers based on this
concept, and use it to study the propulsion of a simple low Reynolds number
swimmer, namely, the three-sphere swimmer model. When the detailed-balanced is
broken and the motor is driven out of equilibrium, it can propel the swimmer in
the required direction. The formulation can be used to study optimal design
strategies for molecular-scale low Reynolds number swimmers.
