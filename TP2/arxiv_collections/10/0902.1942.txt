We give a new, purely coding-theoretic proof of Koch's criterion on the
tetrad systems of Type II codes of length 24 using the theory of harmonic
weight enumerators. This approach is inspired by Venkov's approach to the
classification of the root systems of Type II lattices in R^{24}, and gives a
new instance of the analogy between lattices and codes.
