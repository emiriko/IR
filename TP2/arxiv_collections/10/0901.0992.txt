We propose a method to construct a proposal density for the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of
the GARCH model. The proposal density is constructed adaptively by using the
data sampled by the MCMC metho d itself. It turns out that autocorrelations
between the data generated with our adaptive proposal density are greatly
reduced. Thus it is concluded that the adaptive construction method is very
efficient and works well for the MCMC simulations of the GARCH model.
