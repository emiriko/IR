The Lorentz transformation is derived without assuming the existence of
Maxwell's equations, or that the speed of light is a constant, or even that
light exists. This leads us logically to sonsider the existence of a primal
field called stuff which at every space-time point is traveling in every
posssible direction with the speed of light. All physical quantities are to be
derived from operations on the stuff field. To familiarize ourselves with the
implications of the new paradigm equations are developed for a world of time
and only one spatial dimension. These non-linear equations lead to the
existence of quantized particles, of light, and of gravity. Conservation laws
and symmetries are obtained. Spin space is introduced by assuming the stuff
field is a matrix. For a 3x3 matrix an eight fold classification of particles
arises and the equations describing their dynamical structure are obtained. The
extreeme simplicity of the equations suggests that they may have a (1+3)
dimensional counterpart which is adequate to unify the four forces of our real
world. A candidate (1+3)-d equation is proposed.
