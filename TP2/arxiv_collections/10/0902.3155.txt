In this talk, we discuss a TeV scale model which would explain neutrino
oscillation, dark matter, and baryon asymmetry of the Universe simultaneously
by the dynamics of the extended Higgs sector and TeV-scale right-handed
neutrinos. By the imposed exact $Z_2$ symmetry, tiny neutrino masses are
generated at the three loop level, and the stability of the dark matter
candidate, an additional singlet scalar field, is guaranteed. The extra Higgs
doublet is introduced not only for neutrino masses but also for successful
electroweak baryogenesis. The model provides various discriminative predictions
in Higgs phenomenology, which can be tested at the Large Hadron Collider and
the International Linear Collider.
