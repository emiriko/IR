Using recently developed quantum SU(2)xU(1) rotor approach, that provides a
self-consistent treatment of the antiferromagnetic state we have performed
electronic spectral function calculations for the Hubbard model on the square
lattice. The collective variables for charge and spin are isolated in the form
of the space-time fluctuating U(1) phase field and rotating spin quantization
axis governed by the SU(2) symmetry, respectively. As a result interacting
electrons appear as composite objects consisting of bare fermions with attached
U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. This allows us to write the fermion Green's
function in the space-time domain as the product CP^1 propagator resulting from
the SU(2) gauge fields, U(1) phase propagator and the pseudo-fermion
correlation function. As a result the problem of calculating the spectral line
shapes now becomes one of performing the convolution of spin, charge and
pseudo-fermion Green's functions. The collective spin and charge fluctuations
are governed by the effective actions that are derived from the Hubbard model
for any value of the Coulomb interaction. The emergence of a sharp peak in the
electron spectral function in the antiferromagnetic state indicates the decay
of the electron into separate spin and charge carrying particle excitations.
