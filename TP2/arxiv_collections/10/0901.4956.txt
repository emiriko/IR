We have studied the electronic and magnetic properties of graphene and their
modification due to the adsorption of water and other gas molecules. Water and
gas molecules adsorbed on nanoscale graphene were found to play the role of
defects which facilitate the tunability of the bandgap and allow us to control
the magnetic ordering of localized states at the edges. The adsorbed molecules
push the wavefunctions corresponding to $\alpha$-spin (up) and $\beta$-spin
(down) states of graphene to the opposite (zigzag) edges. This breaks the
sublattice and molecular point group symmetry that results in opening of a
large bandgap. The efficiency of the wavefunction displacement depends strongly
on the type of molecules adsorbed
