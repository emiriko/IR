We present some results on instanton corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli
space in Calabi-Yau compactifications of Type II string theories. Previously,
using twistor methods, only a class of D-instantons (D2-instantons wrapping
A-cycles) was incorporated exactly and the rest was treated only linearly. We
go beyond the linear approximation and give a set of holomorphic functions
which, through a known procedure, capture the effect of D-instantons at all
orders. Moreover, we show that for a sector where all instanton charges have
vanishing symplectic invariant scalar product, the hypermultiplet metric can be
computed explicitly.
