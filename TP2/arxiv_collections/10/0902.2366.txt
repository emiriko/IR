We present a geometric description to study the relativistic EPR correlations
in curved spacetime background given by the application of the Fermi-Walker
transport in the relativistic EPR states and we show that its result has the
same effect as the applications of successive infinitesimal Lorentz boosts in
the relativistic EPR states. We also show that the expression for the Bell
inequality due to the Fermi-Walker transport is equivalent to the expression
demonstrated by Terashima and Ueda \cite{TU2}, where the degree of violation of
the Bell inequality is dependent of the angle of the Wigner rotation. This
geometrical approach to study the relativistic EPR correlations is a promissing
formulation to investigate the EPR correlations in the general relativity
background.
