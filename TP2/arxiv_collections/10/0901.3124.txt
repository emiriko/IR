We present a construction of an entropy-preserving equivariant surjective map
from the $d$-dimensional critical sandpile model to a certain closed,
shift-invariant subgroup of $\mathbb{T}^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$ (the `harmonic model').
A similar map is constructed for the dissipative abelian sandpile model and is
used to prove uniqueness and the Bernoulli property of the measure of maximal
entropy for that model.
