K 3-35 is a planetary nebula (PN) where H2O maser emission has been detected,
suggesting that it departed from the proto-PNe phase only some decades ago.
Interferometric VLA observations of the OH 18 cm transitions in K~3-35 are
presented.OH maser emission is detected in all four ground state lines (1612,
1665, 1667, and 1720 MHz). All the masers appear blueshifted with respect to
the systemic velocity of the nebula and they have different spatial and
kinematic distributions.The OH 1665 and 1720 MHz masers appear spatially
coincident with the core of the nebula, while the OH 1612 and 1667 MHz ones
exhibit a more extended distribution. We suggest that the 1665 and 1720 masers
arise from a region close to the central star, possibly in a torus, while the
1612 and 1667 lines originate mainly from the extended northern lobe of the
outflow. It is worth noting that the location and velocity of the OH 1720 MHz
maser emission are very similar to those of the H2O masers (coinciding within
0.1" and ~2 km/s, respectively). We suggest that the pumping mechanism in the
H2O masers could be produced by the same shock that is exciting the OH 1720 MHz
transition. A high degree of circular polarization (>50%) was found to be
present in some features of the 1612, 1665, and 1720 MHz emission.For the 1665
MHz transition at ~ +18 km/s the emission with left and right circular
polarizations (LCP and RCP) coincide spatially within a region of ~0.03" in
diameter.Assuming that these RCP and LCP 1665 features come from a Zeeman pair,
we estimate a magnetic field of ~0.9 mG within 150 AU from the 1.3 cm continuum
peak. This value is in agreement with a solar-type magnetic field associated
with evolved stars.
