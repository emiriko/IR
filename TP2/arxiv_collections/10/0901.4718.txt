We report on the X-ray emission from the radio jet of 3C 17 from Chandra
observations and compare the X-ray emission with radio maps from the VLA
archive and with the optical-IR archival images from the Hubble Space
Telescope. X-ray detections of two knots in the 3C 17 jet are found and both of
these features have optical counterparts. We derive the spectral energy
distribution for the knots in the jet and give source parameters required for
the various X-ray emission models, finding that both IC/CMB and synchrotron are
viable to explain the high energy emission. A curious optical feature (with no
radio or X-ray counterparts) possibly associated with the 3C 17 jet is
described. We also discuss the use of curved jets for the problem of
identifying inverse Compton X-ray emission via scattering on CMB photons.
