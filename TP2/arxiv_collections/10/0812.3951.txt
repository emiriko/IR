The internally electrodynamic (IED) particle model was derived based on
overall experimental observations, with the IED process itself being built
directly on three experimental facts, a) electric charges present with all
material particles, b) an accelerated charge generates electromagnetic waves
according to Maxwell's equations and Planck energy equation and c) source
motion produces Doppler effect. A set of well-known basic particle equations
and properties become predictable based on first principles solutions for the
IED process; several key solutions achieved are outlined, including the de
Broglie phase wave, de Broglie relations, Schr\"odinger equation, mass,
Einstein mass-energy relation, Newton's law of gravity, single particle self
interference, and electromagnetic radiation and absorption; these equations and
properties have long been broadly experimentally validated or demonstrated. A
specific solution also predicts the Doebner-Goldin equation which emerges to
represent a form of long-sought quantum wave equation including gravity. A
critical review of the key experiments is given which suggests that the IED
process underlies the basic particle equations and properties not just
sufficiently but also necessarily.
