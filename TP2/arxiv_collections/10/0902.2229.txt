We report on the observation and characterisation of an inelastic loss
feature in collisions between ultracold Rb-85 |F=2, m_F=-2> atoms at a magnetic
field of 220 G. Our apparatus creates ultracold Rb-85 clouds by sympathetic
cooling with a Rb-87 reservoir, and can produce pure Rb-87 condensates of 10^6
atoms by a combination of evaporative cooling in a quadrupole-Ioffe magnetic
trap and further evaporation in a weak, large-volume optical dipole trap. By
combining Rb-85 and Rb-87 atoms collected in a dual-species magneto-optical
trap and selectively evaporating the heavier isotope, we demonstrate strong
sympathetic cooling of the Rb-85 cloud, increasing its phase space density by
three orders of magnitude with no detectable loss in number. We have used
ultracold samples created in this way to observe the variation of inelastic
loss in ultracold Rb-85 as a function of magnetic field near the 155 G Feshbach
resonance. We have also measured a previously unobserved loss feature at
219.9(1) G with a width of 0.28(6) G, which we associate with a narrow Feshbach
resonance predicted by theory.
