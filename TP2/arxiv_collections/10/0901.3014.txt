The escaping set I(f) of a transcendental meromorphic function f consists of
all points which tend to infinity under iteration. The Eremenko-Lyubich class B
consists of all transcendental meromorphic functions for which the set of
finite critical and asymptotic values of f is bounded. It is shown that if f is
in B and of finite order of growth, if infinity is not an asymptotic value of f
and if the multiplicities of the poles of f are uniformly bounded, then the
Hausdorff dimension of I(f) is strictly smaller than 2. In fact, we give a
sharp bound for the Hausdorff dimension of I(f) in terms of the order of f and
the bound for the multiplicities of the poles.
  If f satisfies the above hypotheses but is of infinite order, then the area
of I(f) is zero. This result does not hold without a restriction on the
multiplicities of the poles.
