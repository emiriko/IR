The Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) continues to be engaged
in research and development towards an ILC detector. The latest efforts at
SCIPP are described, including those associated with the LSTFE front-end
readout ASIC, the use of charge division to obtain a longitudinal coordinate
from silicon strip detectors, and the contribution of strip resistance to
readout noise.
