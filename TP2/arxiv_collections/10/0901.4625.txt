We present a scheme for eliminating the optical diffraction of slow-light in
a thermal atomic medium of electromagnetically induced transparency.
Nondiffraction is achieved for an arbitrary paraxial image by manipulating the
susceptibility in momentum space, in contrast to the common approach, which
employs guidance of specific modes by manipulating the susceptibility in real
space. For negative two-photon detuning, the moving atoms drag the transverse
momentum components unequally, resulting in a Doppler trapping of light by
atoms in two dimensions.
