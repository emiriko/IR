The head-tail modes are described for the space charge tune shift
significantly exceeding the synchrotron tune. A general equation for the modes
is derived. The spatial shapes of the modes, their frequencies, and coherent
growth rates are explored. The Landau damping rates are also found. The
suppression of the transverse mode coupling instability by the space charge is
explained.
