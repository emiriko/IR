FASTERD is a Monte Carlo event generator to study the final state radiation
both in the $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ and $e^+e^-\to\pi^0\pi^0\gamma$
processes in the energy region of the $\phi$-factory DA$\Phi$NE. Differential
spectra that include both initial and final state radiation and the
interference between them are produced. Three different mechanisms for the
$\pi\pi\gamma$ final state are considered: Bremsstrahlung process (both in the
framework of sQED and Resonance Perturbation Theory), the $\phi$ direct decay
($e^+e^-\to\phi\to (f_0;f_0+\sigma)\gamma\to \pi\pi\gamma$) and the double
resonance mechanism (as $e^+e^-\to\phi\to \rho^\pm\pi^\mp\to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$
and $e^+e^-\to\rho\to \omega\pi^0\to \pi^0\pi^0\gamma$). Additional models can
be incorporated as well.
