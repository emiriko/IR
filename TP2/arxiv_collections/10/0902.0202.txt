We present two quite different algorithms to compute the number of elements
in the sphere of radius $n$ of Thompson's group $F$ with standard generating
set. The first of these requires exponential time and polynomial space, but
additionally computes the number of geodesics and is generalisable to many
other groups.
  The second algorithm requires polynomial time and space and allows us to
compute the size of the spheres of radius $n$ with $n \leq 1500$. Using the
resulting series data we find that the growth rate of the group is bounded
above by $2.62167...$. This is very close to Guba's lower bound of
$\tfrac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ \cite{Guba2004}. Indeed, numerical analysis of the
series data strongly suggests that the growth rate of the group is exactly
$\tfrac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}$.
