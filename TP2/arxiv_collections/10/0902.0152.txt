We prove a general combinatorial formula yielding the intersection number
$c_{u,v}^w$ of three particular $\Lambda$-minuscule Schubert classes in any
Kac-Moody homogeneous space, generalising the Littlewood-Richardson rule. The
combinatorics are based on jeu de taquin rectification in a poset defined by
the heap of $w$.
