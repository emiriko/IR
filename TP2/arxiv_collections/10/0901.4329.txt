We carried out axisymmetric simulations of disk accretion to a rapidly
rotating magnetized star in the "propeller" regime. Simulations show that
propellers may be "weak" (with no outflows), and "strong" (with outflows).
Investigation of the difference between these two regimes have shown that
outflows appear only in the case where the "friction" between the disk and
magnetosphere is sufficiently large, and when accreting matter flux is not very
small. Matter outflows in a wide cone and is magneto-centrifugally ejected from
the inner regions of the disk. Closer to the axis there is a strong,
collimated, magnetically dominated outflow of energy and angular momentum
carried by the open magnetic field lines from the star. The "efficiency" of the
propeller may be very high in the respect that most of the incoming disk matter
is expelled from the system in winds. The star spins-down rapidly due to the
magnetic interaction with the disk through closed field lines and with corona
through open field lines. This mechanism may act in a variety of situations
where magnetized star rotates with super-Keplerian velocity at the
magnetospheric boundary. We speculate that in general any object rotating with
super-Keplerian velocity may drive outflows from accreting disk, if the
friction between them is sufficiently large.
