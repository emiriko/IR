We investigate the exact bright and dark solitary wave solutions of an
effective one dimensional (1D) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) by assuming that
the interaction energy is much less than the kinetic energy in the transverse
direction. In particular, following the earlier works in the literature
P\'erez-Garc\'ia et al. [Physica D 221 (2006) 31], Serkin et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 98 (2007) 074102], G\"urses [arXiv:0704.2435] and Kundu [Phys. Rev. E 79
(2009) 015601], we point out that the effective 1D equation res ulting from the
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation can be transformed into the stand ard soliton
(bright/dark) possessing, completely integrable 1D nonlinear Schr\"o dinger
(NLS) equation by effecting a change of variables of the coordinates and the
wave function. We consider both confining and expulsive harmonic trap
potentials separately and treat the atomic scattering length, gain/loss term
and trap frequency as the experimental control parameters by modulating them as
a function of time. In the case when the trap frequency is kept constant, we
show the existence of different kinds of soliton solutions, such as the
periodic oscillating solitons, collapse and revival of condensate, snake-like
solitons, stable solitons, soliton growth and decay and formation of
two-soliton like bound state, as the atomic scattering length and gain/loss
term are varied. However when the trap frequency is also modulated, we show the
phenomena of collapse and revival of two-soliton like bound state formation of
the condensate for double modulated periodic potential and bright and dark
solitons for step-wise modulated potentials.
