We construct a sequence of compact embedded minimal disks in the unit ball in
Euclidean 3-space whose boundaries are in the boundary of the ball and where
the curvatures blow up at every point of a line segment of the vertical axis,
extending from the origin. We further study the transversal structure of the
minimal limit lamination and find removable singularities along the line
segment and a non-removable singularity at the origin. This extends a result of
Colding and Minicozzi where they constructed a sequence with curvatures blowing
up only at the center of the ball, Dean's construction of a sequence with
curvatures blowing up at a prescribed discrete set of points, and the classical
case of the sequence of re-scaled helicoids with curvatures blowing up along
the entire vertical axis.
