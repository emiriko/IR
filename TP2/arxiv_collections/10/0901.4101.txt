We compute the leading color, next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the
dominant partonic channels for the production of a W boson in association with
three jets at the Tevatron and the LHC. This is the first application of
generalized unitarity for realistic one-loop calculations. The method performs
well in this non-trivial test and offers great promise for the future.
