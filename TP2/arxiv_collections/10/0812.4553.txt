One-dimensional magnonic crystals have been implemented as gratings of
shallow grooves chemically etched into the surface of yttrium-iron garnet
films. Scattering of backward volume magnetostatic spin waves from such
structures is investigated experimentally and theoretically. Well-defined
rejection frequency bands are observed in transmission characteristics of the
magnonic crystals. The loss inserted by the gratings and the rejections bands
bandwidths are studied as a function of the film thickness, the groove depth,
the number of grooves, and the groove width. The experimental data are well
described by a theoretical model based on the analogy of a spin-wave
film-waveguide with a microwave transmission line. Our study shows that
magnonic crystals with required operational characteristics can be engineered
by adjusting these geometrical parameters.
