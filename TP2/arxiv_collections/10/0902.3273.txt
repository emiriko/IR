We present Spitzer 70 and 160 micron observations of the COSMOS Spitzer
survey (S-COSMOS). The data processing techniques are discussed for the
publicly released products consisting of images and source catalogs. We present
accurate 70 and 160 micron source counts of the COSMOS field and find
reasonable agreement with measurements in other fields and with model
predictions. The previously reported counts for GOODS-North and the
extragalactic First Look Survey are updated with the latest calibration, and
counts are measured based on the large area SWIRE survey to constrain the
bright source counts. We measure an extragalactic confusion noise level of
sigma_c = 9.4+/-3.3 mJy (q=5) for the MIPS 160-micron band based on the deep
S-COSMOS data and report an updated confusion noise level of sigma_c =
0.35+/-0.15 mJy (q=5) for the MIPS 70-micron band.
