Double no-touch options, contracts which pay out a fixed amount provided an
underlying asset remains within a given interval, are commonly traded,
particularly in FX markets. In this work, we establish model-free bounds on the
price of these options based on the prices of more liquidly traded options
(call and digital call options). Key steps are the construction of super- and
sub-hedging strategies to establish the bounds, and the use of Skorokhod
embedding techniques to show the bounds are the best possible.
  In addition to establishing rigorous bounds, we consider carefully what is
meant by arbitrage in settings where there is no {\it a priori} known
probability measure. We discuss two natural extensions of the notion of
arbitrage, weak arbitrage and weak free lunch with vanishing risk, which are
needed to establish equivalence between the lack of arbitrage and the existence
of a market model.
