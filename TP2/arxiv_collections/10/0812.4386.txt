In this paper we first apply the general analysis described in our first
paper to a binary mixture of cyclohexane and $n$-hexane. We use the square
gradient model for the continuous description of a non-equilibrium surface and
obtain numerical profiles of various thermodynamic quantities in various
stationary state conditions. In the second part of this paper we focus on the
verification of local equilibrium of the surface as described with excess
quantities. We give a definition of the temperature and chemical potential
difference for the surface and verify that these quantities are independent of
the choice of the dividing surface. We verify that the non-equilibrium surface
can be described in terms of Gibbs excess densities which are in good
approximation equal to their equilibrium values at the temperature and chemical
potential difference of the surface.
