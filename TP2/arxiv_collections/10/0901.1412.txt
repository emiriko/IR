In this paper, we study the $0^{+}$ nonet mesons as tetraquark states with
interpolating currents induced from the color-magnetic wavefunction. This
wavefunction is the eigenfunction of effective color-magnetic Hamiltonian with
the lowest eigenvalue, meaning that the state depicted by this wavefunction is
the most stable one and is most probable to be observed in experiments. Our
approach can be recognized as determining interpolating currents dynamically.
We perform an OPE calculation up to dimension eight condensates and find that
the best QCD sum rule is achived when the current induced from the
color-magnetic wavefunction is a proper mixture of the tensor and pseudoscalar
diquark-antidiquark bound states. Compared with previous results, to sigma(600)
and kappa(800), our results appear better, due to larger pole contribution. The
direct instanton contribution are also considered, which yields a consistent
result with previous OPE results. Finally, we also discuss the eta' problem as
a possible six-quark state.
