We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework and a quantitative test of
the method we recently proposed for processing data from a spherical detector
with five or six transducers. Our algorithm is a trigger event generator
performing a coherent analysis of the sphere channels. In order to test our
pipeline we first built a detailed numerical model of the detector, including
deviations from the ideal case such as quadrupole modes splitting, and
non-identical transducer readout chains. This model, coupled with a Gaussian
noise generator, has then been used to produce six time series, corresponding
to the outputs of the six transducers attached to the sphere. We finally
injected gravitational wave burst signals into the data stream, as well as
bursts of non-gravitational origin in order to mimic the presence of
non-Gaussian noise, and then processed the mock data. We report quantitative
results for the detection efficiency versus false alarm rate and for the
affordability of the reconstruction of the direction of arrival. In particular,
the combination of the two direction reconstruction methods can reduce by a
factor of 10 the number false alarms due to the non-Gaussian noise.
