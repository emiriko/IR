The AMANDA-II detector, operating since 2000 in the deep ice at the
geographic South Pole, has accumulated a large sample of atmospheric muon
neutrinos in the 100 GeV to 10 TeV energy range. The zenith angle and energy
distribution of these events can be used to search for various phenomenological
signatures of quantum gravity in the neutrino sector, such as violation of
Lorentz invariance (VLI) or quantum decoherence (QD). Analyzing a set of 5511
candidate neutrino events collected during 1387 days of livetime from 2000 to
2006, we find no evidence for such effects and set upper limits on VLI and QD
parameters using a maximum likelihood method. Given the absence of evidence for
new flavor-changing physics, we use the same methodology to determine the
conventional atmospheric muon neutrino flux above 100 GeV.
