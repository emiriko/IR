We present an original method for reconstructing a three-dimensional object
having two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension from data provided by
the infrared slit spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. During
acquisition, the light flux is deformed by a complex process comprising four
main elements (the telescope aperture, the slit, the diffraction grating and
optical distortion) before it reaches the two-dimensional sensor.
  The originality of this work lies in the physical modelling, in integral
form, of this process of data formation in continuous variables. The inversion
is lso approached with continuous variables in a semi-parametric format
decomposing the object into a family of Gaussian functions. The estimate is
built in a deterministic regularization framework as the minimizer of a
quadratic criterion.
  These specificities give our method the power to over-resolve. Its
performance is illustrated using real and simulated data. We also present a
study of the resolution showing a 1.5-fold improvement relative to conventional
methods.
