We study the Coulomb-Fr\"ohlich model on a triangular lattice, looking in
particular at states with angular momentum. We examine a simplified model of
crab bipolarons with angular momentum by projecting onto the low energy
subspace of the Coulomb-Fr\"ohlich model with large phonon frequency. Such a
projection is consistent with large long-range electron-phonon coupling and
large repulsive Hubbard $U$. Significant differences are found between the band
structure of singlet and triplet states: The triplet state (which has a flat
band) is found to be significantly heavier than the singlet state (which has
mass similar to the polaron). We test whether the heavier triplet states
persist to lower electron-phonon coupling using continuous time quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) simulation. The triplet state is both heavier and larger,
demonstrating that the heavier mass is due to quantum interference effects on
the motion. We also find that retardation effects reduce the differences
between singlet and triplet states, since they reintroduce second order terms
in the hopping into the inverse effective mass.
