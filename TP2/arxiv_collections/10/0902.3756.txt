For the particular class of \textbf{$SU(4)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}$} electro-weak
models without exotic electric charges, some plausible phenomenological
predictions - such as the boson mass spectrum and charges of all the fermions
involved therein - are made by using the algebraical approach of the exactly
solving method for gauge models with high symmetries. Along with the
one-parameter resulting mass scale (to be confirmed at TeV scale in LHC, LEP,
CDF and other high energy experiments) our approach predicts the exact
expressions of the charges (both electric and neutral) in the fermion sector,
while all the Standard Model phenomenology is naturally recovered.
