The gluing technique is used to construct hypersurfaces in Euclidean space
having approximately constant prescribed mean curvature. These surfaces are
perturbations of unions of finitely many spheres of the same radius assembled
end-to-end along a line segment. The condition on the existence of these
hypersurfaces is the vanishing of the sum of certain integral moments of the
spheres with respect the prescribed mean curvature function.
