Recently, conceptually new physics beyond the Standard Model has been
proposed by Georgi, where a new physics sector becomes conformal and provides
"unparticle" which couples to the Standard Model sector through higher
dimensional operators in low energy effective theory. Among several
possibilities, we focus on operators involving the (scalar) unparticle, Higgs
and the gauge bosons. Once the Higgs develops the vacuum expectation value
(VEV), the conformal symmetry is broken and as a result, the mixing between the
unparticle and the Higgs boson emerges. In this paper, we consider the
unparticle as a hidden sector of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, and give some
phenomenological consequences of this scenario. The result shows that there is
a possibility for the unparticle as a hidden sector in SUSY breaking sector,
and can provide a solution to the mu problem in SUSY models.
