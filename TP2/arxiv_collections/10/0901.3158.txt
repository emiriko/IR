We prove the renormalizability of a quark-gluon model with a soft breaking of
the BRST symmetry, which accounts for the modification of the large distance
behavior of the quark and gluon correlation functions. The proof is valid to
all orders of perturbation theory, by making use of softly broken Ward
identities.
