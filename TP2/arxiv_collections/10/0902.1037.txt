In this work we deal with the optimal design and optimal control of
structures undergoing large rotations. In other words, we show how to find the
corresponding initial configuration and the corresponding set of multiple load
parameters in order to recover a desired deformed configuration or some
desirable features of the deformed configuration as specified more precisely by
the objective or cost function. The model problem chosen to illustrate the
proposed optimal design and optimal control methodologies is the one of
geometrically exact beam. First, we present a non-standard formulation of the
optimal design and optimal control problems, relying on the method of Lagrange
multipliers in order to make the mechanics state variables independent from
either design or control variables and thus provide the most general basis for
developing the best possible solution procedure. Two different solution
procedures are then explored, one based on the diffuse approximation of
response function and gradient method and the other one based on genetic
algorithm. A number of numerical examples are given in order to illustrate both
the advantages and potential drawbacks of each of the presented procedures.
