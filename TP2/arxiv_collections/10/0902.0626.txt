Thin-film colossal magnetoresistance manganites such as
La$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ (LCMO) have now been intensely studied for more
than a decade, but the issue of possible nanoscale electronic phase separation
is not fully solved. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy / Spectroscopy (STS) has
been pivotal in studying phase separation, but is hindered by being surface-
rather than bulk-sensitive. For our sputtered LCMO films the data indicates a
strong correlation between surface morphology and signatures of phase
separation; rough films show phase separation while atomically flat films are
electronically homogeneous but have a more or less inactive surface layer.
Regardless of surface morphology, the film bulk is electronically and
magnetically active. Many of the reported conclusions about electronic
inhomogeneities measured by STS have been confused by this issue. We study both
strained and unstrained films and find no correlation between substrate-induced
strain and either electronic phase separation or dead layers.
