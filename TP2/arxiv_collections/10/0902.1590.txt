One of the greatest scientific achievements of physics in the 20th century is
the discovery of quantum mechanics. The Schrodinger equation is the most
fundamental equation in quantum mechanics describing the time-based evolution
of the quantum state of a physical system. It has been found that the
time-independent version of the equation can be derived from a general
optimization algorithm. Instead of arguing for a new interpretation and
possible deeper principle for quantum mechanics, this paper elaborates a few
points of the equation as a general global optimization algorithm. Benchmarked
against randomly generated hard optimization problems, this paper shows that
the algorithm significantly outperformed a classic local optimization
algorithm. The former found a solution in one second with a single trial better
than the best one found by the latter around one hour after one hundred
thousand trials.
