For a given real entire function $\phi$ with finitely many nonreal zeros, we
establish a connection between the number of real zeros of the functions
$Q=(\phi'/\phi)'$ and $Q_1=(\phi''/\phi')'$. This connection leads to a proof
of the Hawaii conjecture [T.Craven, G.Csordas, and W.Smith, The zeros of
derivatives of entire functions and the P\'olya-Wiman conjecture, Ann. of Math.
(2) 125 (1987), 405--431] stating that the number of real zeros of $Q$ does not
exceed the number of nonreal zeros of $\phi$.
