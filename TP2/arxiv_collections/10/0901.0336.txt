We demonstrate a fiber-optical switch that is activated at tiny energies
corresponding to few hundred optical photons per pulse. This is achieved by
simultaneously confining both photons and a small laser-cooled ensemble of
atoms inside the microscopic hollow core of a single-mode photonic-crystal
fiber and using quantum optical techniques for generating slow light
propagation and large nonlinear interaction between light beams.
