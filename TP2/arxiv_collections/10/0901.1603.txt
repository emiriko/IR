We compare two different ways of quantization a simple sequential game Cat's
Dilemma in the context of the debate on intransitive and transitive
preferences. This kind of analysis can have essential meaning for the research
on the artificial intelligence (some possibilities are discussed). Nature has
both properties transitive and intransitive and maybe quantum models can be
more able to capture this dualism than classical one. We also present electoral
interpretation of the game.
