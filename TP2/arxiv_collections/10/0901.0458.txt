In the framework of the debate on high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs),
after a review of GWs in standard General Relativity, which is due for
completness, the possibility of merging such a traditional analysis with the
Hyperspace formalism that has been recently introduced in some papers in the
literature, with the goal of a better understanding of manifolds dimensionality
also in a cosmological framework, is discussed. Using the concept of refractive
index in the Hyperspace, spherical solutions are given and the propagation of
GWs in a region of the Hyperspace with an unitary refractive index is also
discussed. Propagation phenomena associated to the higher dimensionality are
proposed, possibly including non-linear effects. Further and accurate studies
in this direction are needed.
