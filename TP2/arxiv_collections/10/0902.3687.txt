We investigate the conductance statistics of a quantum-chaotic dot--a
normal-metal grain--with a superconducting lead attached to it. The cases of
one and two normal leads additionally attached to the dot are studied. For
these two configurations the complete distribution of the conductance is
calculated, within the framework of random matrix theory, as a function of the
transparency parameter of the Schottky barrier formed at the interface of the
normal-metal and superconducting regions. Our predictions are verified by
numerical simulations.
