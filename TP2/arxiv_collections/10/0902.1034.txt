I propose an alternative, purely kinematical, derivation of Einstein's
Doppler formula. It is valid for periodic signals of any shape that propagate
with the velocity of light. The formula is asymptotic in a parameter
proportional to the relative variation of the distance source-receiver during
one period. As a by-product, I also derive an alternative proof of Einstein's
aberration formulae.
