One of the six extended X-ray sources found in the Chandra DeepField North is
centred on HDF130, which has recently been shown to be a massive galaxy at
z=1.99 with a compact radio nucleus. The X-ray source has a roughly
double-lobed structure with each lobe about 41 arcsec long, or 345 kpc at the
redshift of HDF130. We have analyzed the 2 Ms X-ray image and spectrum of the
source and find that it is well fit by a power-law continuum of photon index
2.65 and has a 2--10 keV luminosity of 5.4x10^{43}ergps (if at z=1.99). Any
further extended emission within a radius of 60 arcsec has a luminosity less
than half this value, which is contrary to what is expected from a cluster of
galaxies. The source is best explained as an inverse Compton ghost of a giant
radio source, which is no longer being powered, and for which Compton losses
have downgraded the energetic electrons, \gamma> 10^4, required for
high-frequency radio emission. The lower energy electrons, \gamma~1000, produce
X-rays by inverse Compton scattering on the Cosmic Microwave Background.
Depending on the magnetic field strength, some low frequency radio emission may
remain. Further inverse Compton ghosts may exist in the Chandra deep fields.
