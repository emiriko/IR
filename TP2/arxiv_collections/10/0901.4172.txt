Analysis of type 1a supernovae observations out to a redshift of $z$=1.6
shows that there is good agreement between the light-curve widths and $(1+z)$
which is usually interpreted as a strong support for time dilation due to an
expanding universe. This paper argues that a strong case can be made for a
static universe where the supernovae light-curve-width dependence on redshift
is due to selection effects. The analysis is based on the principle that it is
the total energy (the fluence) and not the peak magnitude that is the best
`standard candle' for type 1a supernovae. A simple model using a static
cosmology provides an excellent prediction for the dependence of light curve
width on redshift and the luminosity-width relationship for nearby supernovae.
The width dependence arises from the assumption of constant absolute magnitude
resulting in strong selection of lower luminosity supernovae at higher
redshifts due to the use of an incorrect distance modulus. Using a static
cosmology, curvature-cosmology, and without fitting any parameters the analysis
shows that the total energy is independent of redshift and provides a Hubble
constant of $63.1\pm2.5$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. There is no indication of any
deviation at large redshifts that has been ascribed to the occurrence of dark
energy.
