We study the interaction of dark-bright solitons in two component
Bose-Einstein condensates by suitably tailoring the trap potential, atomic
scattering length and atom gain or loss. We show that the coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation can be mapped onto the Manakov model. An
interesting class of matter wave solitons and their interaction are identified
with time independent and periodically modulated trap potentials, which can be
experimentally realized in two component condensates. These include periodic
collapse and revival of solitons, and snake-like matter wave solitons as well
as different kinds of two soliton interactions.
