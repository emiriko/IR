A fundamental question in cometary science is whether the different dynamical
classes of comets have different chemical compositions, which would reflect
different initial conditions. From the ground or Earth orbit, radio and
infrared spectroscopic observations of a now significant sample of comets
indeed reveal deep differences in the relative abundances of cometary ices.
However, no obvious correlation with dynamical classes is found. Further
results come, or are expected, from space exploration. Such investigations, by
nature limited to a small number of objects, are unfortunately focussed on
short-period comets (mainly Jupiter-family). But these in situ studies provide
"ground truth" for remote sensing. We discuss the chemical differences in
comets from our database of spectroscopic radio observations, which has been
recently enriched by several Jupiter-family and Halley-type comets.
