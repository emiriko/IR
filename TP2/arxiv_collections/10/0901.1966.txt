Theory of non-stationary coherent effects is developed for
superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) structures with relatively strong
normal scattering on S/N interfaces (interface resistance is large compared to
intrinsic resistance of N metal). Analitical expressions are found for the
time-dependent anomalous Green functions induced in the N region under the
fixed-voltage-bias. The amplitude of the current oscillations is determined in
non-equilibrium conditions. Non-stationary correction to the distribution
function is calculated in high-temperature limit and found to be slowly
decreasing with the temperature, leading to the dominance of the
second-harmonic term in the Josepshon current at high temperatures and low
voltage.
