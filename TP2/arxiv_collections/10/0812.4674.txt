We present and analyze the simple analytically solvable model of 1/f noise,
which can be relevant for the understanding of the origin, main properties and
parameter dependencies of the flicker noise. In the model, the currents or
signals represented as sequences of the random pulses, which recurrence time
intervals between transit times of pulses are uncorrelated with the shape of
the pulse, are analyzed. It is shown that for the pulses of fixed area with
random duration, distributed uniformly in a wide interval, 1/f behavior of the
power spectrum of the signal or current in wide range of frequency may be
obtained.
