The associativity property, usually defined for binary functions, can be
generalized to functions of a given fixed arity n>=1 as well as to functions of
multiple arities. In this paper, we investigate these two generalizations in
the case of polynomial functions over bounded distributive lattices and present
explicit descriptions of the corresponding associative functions. We also show
that, in this case, both generalizations of associativity are essentially the
same.
