We use the finite-element method for simulating light transmission through a
2D-periodic array of rectangular apertures in a film of highly conductive
material. We report results with a relative error of the transmissivity lower
than 0.01%. This is an improvement of about one order of magnitude compared to
previously reported results. Further, the influence of corner and edge
roundings on light transmission through the subwavelength apertures is
investigated.
