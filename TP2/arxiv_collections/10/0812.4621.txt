The effect of feedback on a two-level dissipative system is studied in this
paper. The results show that it is possible to control the phase in the open
system even if its state can not be manipulated from an arbitrary initial one
to an arbitrary final one. The dependence of the geometric phase on the control
parameters is calculated and discussed.
