After a brief resume of the theory underpinning the central exclusive process
(CEP) pp \to p+H+p, attention is focussed upon Higgs bosons produced in the
Standard Model, the MSSM and the NMSSM. In all cases, CEP adds significantly to
the physics potential of the LHC and in some scenarios it may be crucial.
