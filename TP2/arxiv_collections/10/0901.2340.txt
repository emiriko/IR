We summarize recent progress in the studies of the short-rang correlations
(SRC) in nuclei in high energy electron and hadron nucleus scattering and
suggest directions for the future high energy studies aimed at establishing
detailed structure of two-nucleon SRCs, revealing structure of three nucleon
SRC correlations and discovering non-nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei.
