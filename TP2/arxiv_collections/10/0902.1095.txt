We present a perfect state transfer protocol via a qubit chain with the
evolution governed by the $xx$ Hamiltonian. In contrast to the recent protocol
announced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 230502 (2008)], our method does not
demand any remote-cooperated initialization and sending classical information
about measurement outcomes. We achieve the perfect state transfer only with the
assumption of access to two spins at each end of the chain, while the initial
state of the whole chain is irrelevant.
