We analyze the non-local transport properties of a d-wave superconductor
coupled to metallic electrodes at nanoscale distances. We show that the
non-local conductance exhibits an algebraical decay with distance rather than
the exponential behavior which is found in conventional superconductors.
Crossed Andreev processes, associated with electronic entanglement, are favored
for certain orientations of the symmetry axes of the superconductor with
respect to the leads. These properties would allow its experimental detection
using present technologies.
