26 different concrete representations of the space of vector valued
distributions on a smooth manifold of dimension n are presented systematically,
most of them new. In the particular case of representations as module
homomorphisms acting on sections of the dual bundle resp. on n-forms, the
continuity of these homomorphisms is already a consequence of their algebraic
properties.
