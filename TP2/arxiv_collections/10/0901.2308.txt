We report the likely detection of near-infrared 2.29 $\mu$m first overtone
Carbon Monoxide (CO) emission from the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A
(Cas A). The continuum-subtracted CO filter map reveals CO knots within the
ejecta-rich reverse shock. We compare the first overtone CO emission with that
found in the well-studied supernova, SN 1987A and find $\sim$30 times less CO
in Cas A. The presence of CO suggests that molecule mixing is small in the SN
ejecta and that astrochemical processes and molecule formation may continue at
least ~300 years after the initial explosion.
