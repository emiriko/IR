We propose a new light source based on having alkaline-earth atoms in an
optical lattice collectively emit photons on an ultra-narrow clock transition
into the mode of a high Q-resonator. The resultant optical radiation has an
extremely narrow linewidth in the mHz range, even smaller than that of the
clock transition itself due to collective effects. A power level of order
$10^{-12}W$ is possible, sufficient for phase-locking a slave optical local
oscillator. Realizing this light source has the potential to improve the
stability of the best clocks by two orders of magnitude.
