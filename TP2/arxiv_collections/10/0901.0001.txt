We establish theoretical bounds on qubit detuning for high fidelity
controlled-NOT logic gate implementations with weakly coupled Josephson phase
qubits. It is found that the value of qubit detuning during the entangling
pulses must not exceed 2g for two-step, and g for single-step control
sequences, where g is the relevant coupling constant.
