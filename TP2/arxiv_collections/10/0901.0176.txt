Recently the ATIC and PAMELA collaborations released their results which show
the abundant e^\pm excess in cosmic rays well above the background, but not for
the \bar{p}. Their data if interpreted as the dark matter particles'
annihilation imply that the new physics with the dark matter is closely related
to the lepton sector. In this paper we study the possible connection of the new
physics responsible for the cosmic e^\pm excesses to the neutrino mass
generation. We consider a class of models and do the detailed numerical
calculations. We find that these models can natually account for the ATIC and
PAMELA e^\pm and \bar{p} data and at the same time generate the small neutrino
masses.
