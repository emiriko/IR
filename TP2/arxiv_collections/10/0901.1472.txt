The paper contains a brief review of recent results on hidden symmetries in
higher dimensional black hole spacetimes. We show how the existence of a
principal CKY tensor (that is a closed conformal Killing-Yano 2-form) allows
one to generate a `tower' of Killing-Yano and Killing tensors responsible for
hidden symmetries. These symmetries imply complete integrability of geodesic
equations and the complete separation of variables in the Hamilton-Jacobi,
Klein-Gordon, Dirac and gravitational perturbation equations in the general
Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metrics. Equations of the parallel transport of frames along
geodesics in these spacetimes are also integrable.
