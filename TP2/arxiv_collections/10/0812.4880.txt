In the first part of this work (http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0509044),
it was shown that the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell electrodynamics in the unitary gauge
allows natural elimination of the particle wave function and describes
independent evolution of the electromagnetic field. Therefore, the
electromagnetic field can be regarded as the guiding field in the Bohm
interpretation of quantum mechanics. An extension of those results to the
Dirac-Maxwell electrodynamics was less general, but represented at least an
interesting toy model of quantum theory. Another model based on the
Dirac-Maxwell electrodynamics is considered in this work. The model also
typically allows elimination of the wave function and describes independent
evolution of the electromagnetic field.
