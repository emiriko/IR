We present physical arguments based on loop space representations for
Dirac/Klein gordon determinants that some suitable Fermionic String Ising
models at the critical point and defined on the space-time base manifold are
formal quantum states of the gravitational field when quantized in the
Ashtekar-Sen connection canonical formalism .These results complements our
previous Loop Space studies on the subject (Random surface representation for
Einstein quantum gravity, Phys.Rev.D52,6941 (1995))
