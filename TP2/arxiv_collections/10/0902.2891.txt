More than four decades after the discovery of pulsars, the composition of
matter at their cores is still a mystery. This white paper summarizes how
recent high-precision measurements of millisecond pulsar masses have introduced
new experimental constraints on the properties of super-dense matter, and how
continued timing of intriguing new objects, coupled with radio telescope
surveys to discover more pulsars, might introduce significantly more stringent
constraints.
