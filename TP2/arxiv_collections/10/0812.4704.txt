The charged Higgs boson decays $H^\pm\to W^\pm A_1$ and $H^\pm\to W^\pm h_i$
are studied in the framework of the next-to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (NMSSM). It is found that the decay rate for H^\pm\to W^\pm A_1 can
dominate both below and above the top-bottom threshold. We suggest that p p\to
H^\pm A_1 is a promising discovery channel for a light charged Higgs boson in
the NMSSM with small or moderate \tan\beta and dominant decay mode H^\pm \to
W^\pm A_1 which leads to W^\pm A_1 A_1. This W^\pm A_1 A_1 signature can also
arise from the Higgsstrahlung process pp\to W^\pm h_1 followed by the decay
h_1\to A_1 A_1. It is shown that there exist regions of parameter space where
these processes can have comparable cross sections and we suggest that their
respective signals can be distinguished at the LHC by using appropriate
reconstruction methods.
