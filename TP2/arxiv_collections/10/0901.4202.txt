In a collaboration of the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO) and
AstroGrid-D, the German Astronomy Community Grid (GACG), we provide a VO
service for the access and the calculation of stellar synthetic energy
distributions (SEDs) based on static as well as expanding non-LTE model
atmospheres.
  At three levels, a VO user may directly compare observed and theoretical
SEDs: The easiest and fastest way is to use pre-calculated SEDs from the GAVO
database. For individual objects, grids of model atmospheres and SEDs can be
calculated on the compute resources of AstroGrid-D within reasonable wallclock
time. Experienced VO users may even create own atomic-data files for a more
detailed analyses.
