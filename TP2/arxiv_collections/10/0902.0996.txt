The double pulsar J0737-3039A/B is a unique system with which to test
gravitational theories in the strong-field regime. However, the accuracy of
such tests will be limited by knowledge of the distance and relative motion of
the system. Here we present very long baseline interferometry observations
which reveal that the distance to PSR J0737-3039A/B is 1150+220-160 pc, more
than double previous estimates, and confirm its low transverse velocity (~9
km/s). Combined with a decade of pulsar timing, these results will allow tests
of gravitational radiation emission theories at the 0.01% level, putting
stringent constraints on theories which predict dipolar gravitational
radiation. They also allow insight into the system's formation and the source
of its high-energy emission.
