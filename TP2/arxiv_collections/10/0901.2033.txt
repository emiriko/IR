In this paper we revisit the issue of determining the oscillating primordial
scalar power spectrum and oscillating equation of state of dark energy from the
astronomical observations. By performing a global analysis with the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo method, we find that the current observations from five-year
WMAP and SDSS-LRG matter power spectrum, as well as the "union" supernovae
sample, constrain the oscillating index of primordial spectrum and oscillating
equation of state of dark energy with the amplitude less than $|n_{\rm
amp}|<0.116$ and $|w_{\rm amp}|<0.232$ at 95% confidence level, respectively.
This result shows that the oscillatory structures on the primordial scalar
spectrum and the equation of state of dark energy are still allowed by the
current data. Furthermore, we point out that these kinds of modulation effects
will be detectable (or gotten a stronger constraint) in the near future
astronomical observations, such as the PLANCK satellite, LAMOST telescope and
the currently ongoing supernovae projects SNLS.
