The universal character is a generalization of the Schur function attached to
a pair of partitions. We study an integrable system of q-difference equations
satisfied by the universal characters, which is an extension of the q-KP
hierarchy and is called the lattice q-UC hierarchy. We describe the lattice
q-UC hierarchy as a compatibility condition of its associated linear system
(Lax formalism) and explore an application to the q-Painleve equations via
similarity reduction. In particular a higher-order analogue of the q-Painleve
VI equation is presented.
