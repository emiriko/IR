Properties of a two-level atom coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field
at finite temperature are determined. The analysis is based on a new method
(inspired by QED) of describing qubits, developed previously at zero
temperature (Phys. Rev. A 76, 062106 (2007)). In this paper, we make a
generalization to finite temperature by introducing the Matsubara formalism and
the temperature propagators. We analyze the spectral properties of different
types of propagators and we derive a direct connection between the temperature
propagators and the real time propagators. To show the effectiveness of this
method, we calculate the temperature dependence of the polarizability of a
two-level atom in the lowest order of perturbation theory and we predict an
unexpected sharpening of the resonance. The whole discussion is carried out
without the rotating wave approximation.
