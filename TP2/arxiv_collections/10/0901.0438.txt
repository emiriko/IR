We study theoretically reflection problem in the junction between a normal
metal and an insulator characterized by a parameter $M$, which is a usual
insulator for $M>0$ or a quantum spin Hall system for $M<0$. The spin rotation
angle $\alpha$ at the reflection is obtained in the plane of $M$ and the
incident angle $\theta$ measured from the normal to the interface. The $\alpha$
shows rich structures around the quantum critical point M=0 and $\theta=0$,
i.e., $\alpha$ can be as large as $\sim \pi$ at an incident angle in the quatum
spin Hall case $M<0$ because the helical edge modes resonantly enhance the spin
rotation, which can be used to map the energy dispersion of the helical edge
modes. As an experimentally relevant system, we also study spin rotation effect
in quantum spin Hall/normal metal/quantum spin Hall trilayer junction.
