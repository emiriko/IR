A variety of modeling frameworks have been proposed and utilized in complex
systems studies, including dynamical systems models that describe state
transitions on a system of fixed topology, and self-organizing network models
that describe topological transformations of a network with little attention
paid to dynamical state changes. Earlier network models typically assumed that
topological transformations are caused by exogenous factors, such as
preferential attachment of new nodes and stochastic or targeted removal of
existing nodes. However, many real-world complex systems exhibit both of these
two dynamics simultaneously, and they evolve largely autonomously based on the
system's own states and topologies. Here we show that, by using the concept of
graph rewriting, both state transitions and autonomous topology transformations
of complex systems can be seamlessly integrated and represented in a unified
computational framework.We call this novel modeling framework "Generative
Network Automata (GNA)". In this chapter, we introduce basic concepts of GNA,
its working definition, its generality to represent other dynamical systems
models, and some of our latest results of extensive computational experiments
that exhaustively swept over possible rewriting rules of simple binary-state
GNA. The results revealed several distinct types of the GNA dynamics.
