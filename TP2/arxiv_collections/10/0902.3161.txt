The pion number fluctuations are considered in the system of pions and large
mass fireballs decaying finally into pions. A formulation which gives an
extension of the model of independent sources is suggested. The grand canonical
and micro-canonical ensemble formulations of the pion-fireball gas are
considered as particular examples.
