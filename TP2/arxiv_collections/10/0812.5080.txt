We argue that BPS ansatzes, entering manifestly vacuum BPS monopole solutions
to equations of motion in the (Minkowskian) non-Abelian Higgs model play the
role of some electric form-factors and that this implies (soft) violating the
CP-invariance of the mentioned model, similar to taking place in the Euclidian
Yang-Mills (YM) theory with instantons, generating the $\theta$-term in the
appropriate effective Hamiltonian.
