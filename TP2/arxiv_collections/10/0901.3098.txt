The cross section measurements of the Higgs boson production in the vector
boson fusion (VBF) process at the LHC followed by a Higgs boson decay into
tautau, WW and gamma gamma will significantly extend the possibility of Higgs
boson coupling measurements. Prospective analyses with the CMS experiment are
discussed for the H-> gammagamma, WW and tautau decay channels for an
integrated LHC luminosity of 30 fb-1. For a Higgs boson mass in the range 115
to 140 GeV, an observation with a significance above 2 standard deviations is
expected in the H to gammagamma channel, and above 3 standard deviations in the
H to tautau channel. The H to WW channel offers a discovery reach above 5 sigma
in the mass range 140 to 200 GeV. A new complete strategy is presented for the
control of systematics and early searches at very low luminosities of the order
of 1 fb-1.
