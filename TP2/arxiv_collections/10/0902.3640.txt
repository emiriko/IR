A spectroscopic analysis of the DBA (or DAB) white dwarf KUV 02196+2816 is
presented. The observed hydrogen and helium line profiles are shown to be
incompatible with model spectra calculated under the assumption of a
homogeneous hydrogen and helium chemical composition. In contrast, an excellent
fit to the optical spectrum of KUV 02196+2816 can be achieved if the object is
interpreted as an unresolved double degenerate composed of a hydrogen-line DA
star and a helium-line DB star. The atmospheric parameters obtained from the
best fit are Teff=27,170 K and log g=8.09 for the DA star, Teff=36,340 K and
log g=8.09 for the DB star, which implies that the total mass of the system
(M~1.4 Msol) is very close to the Chandrasekhar limit. Moreover, the effective
temperature of the DB stars lies well within the so-called DB gap where very
few bright DB stars are found. The implications of this discovery with respect
to the DAB and DBA spectral classes and to the evolution of double degenerate
binaries are discussed.
