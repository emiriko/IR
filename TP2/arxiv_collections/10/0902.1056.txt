The range of nucleon interaction 10-4 cm - 1 cm is interesting because it
corresponds to the mass range of a intermediate particle inside so named "axion
window" that is not closed yet by experiment. Depolarization of ultracold
neutrons (UCN) during their storage in material traps can be caused by
CP-violating pseudo-magnetic precession of the neutron spin in the vicinity of
the unpolarized substance surface. Using the experimental limits for UCN
depolarization new constraints were set for the product of the scalar,
pseudo-scalar dimensionless constants gS*gP and the parameter lam_PS,
determining the Yukawa-type of the nucleon interaction potential via new
pseudo-scalar boson (axion-like particle) with a mass of m_PS: gS*gP*lam_PS^2
<= 2.96*10-21 [cm^2] for 10-3 cm < lam_PS < 1 cm; gS*gP*lam_PS^2 <= 3.9*10-22
[cm^2] for 10-4 cm < lam_PS < 10-3 cm. Improvement of the limit for gS*gP in
the area of lam_PS from 0.1 cm to 1 cm accounts for 4-5 orders of magnitude in
comparision with previous limit. The prospects of increasing in accuracy search
for CP-violating pseudo-magnetic precession are considered. The estimations of
the possible effects of pseudo-magnetic precession in the frame of the
theoretical models with CP-violation are discussed.
