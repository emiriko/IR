Considering epicyclic oscillations of pressure-supported perfect fluid tori
orbiting Kerr black holes we examine non-geodesic (pressure) effects on the
epicyclic modes properties. Using a perturbation method we derive fully general
relativistic formulas for eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of the radial and
vertical epicyclic modes of a slightly non-slender, constant specific angular
momentum torus up to second-order accuracy with respect to the torus thickness.
The behaviour of the axisymmetric and lowest-order ($m=\pm 1$) non-axisymmetric
epicyclic modes is investigated. For an arbitrary black hole spin we find that,
in comparison with the (axisymmetric) epicyclic frequencies of free test
particles, non-slender tori receive negative pressure corrections and exhibit
thus lower frequencies. Our findings are in qualitative agreement with the
results of a recent pseudo-Newtonian study of analogous problem defined within
the Paczy{\'n}ski-Wiita potential. Implications of our results on the
high-frequency QPO models dealing with epicyclic oscillations are addressed.
