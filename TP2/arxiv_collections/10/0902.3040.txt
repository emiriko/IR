The CALICE prototype for a Si/W electromagnetic calorimeter has been tested
in large scale test beams. Several million events with electrons and hadrons of
different energies and impact angles have been recorded. The energy resolution
has been measured to be (16.6 +- 0.1)%/sqrt(E(GeV)) for the stochastic and (1.1
+- 0.1)% for the constant term with a linearity within the 1% level. The next
step will be the construction of a large scale prototype which will take
realistic experimental costraints into account. This module will naturally
benefit from the experience gained with the first prototype.
