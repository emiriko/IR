In this paper we present a method for the real-time detection of the bases of
the deoxyribonucleic acid using their signatures in negative differential
conductance measurements. The present methods of electronic detection of
deoxyribonucleic acid bases are based on a statistical analysis because the
electrical currents of the four bases are weak and do not differ significantly
from one base to another. In contrast, we analyze a device that combines the
accumulated knowledge in nanopore and scanning tunneling detection, and which
is able to provide very distinctive electronic signatures for the four bases.
