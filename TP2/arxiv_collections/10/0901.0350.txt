Molecular motors are essential components for the biophysical functions of
the cell. Our current quantitative understanding of how multiple motors move
along a single track is not complete; even though models and theories for
single motor chemomechanics abound. Recently, M.J.I. M$\ddot{\rm u}$ller {\em
et al.} have developed a tug-of-war model to describe the bidirectional
movement of the cargo (PNAS(2008) 105(12) P4609-4614). Through Monte Carlo
simulations, they discovered that the tug-of-war model exhibits several
qualitative different motility regimes, which depend on the precise value of
single motor parameters, and they suggested the sensitivity can be used by a
cell to regulate its cargo traffic. In the present paper, we carry out a
thorough analysis of the tug-of-war model. All the stable, i.e., biophysically
observable, steady states are obtained. Depending on several parameters, the
system exhibits either uni-, bi- or tristability. Based on the separating
boundary of the different stable states and the initial numbers of the
different motor species that are bound to the track, the steady state of the
cargo movement can be predicted, and consequently the steady state velocity can
be obtained. It is found that, the velocity, even the direction, of the cargo
movement change with the initial numbers of the motors which are bound to the
track and several other parameters.
