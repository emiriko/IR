Zeolite channels can be used as effective hydrocarbon traps. Earlier
experiments (Czaplewski {\sl et al.}, 2002) show that the presence of large
aromatic molecules (toluene) block the diffusion of light hydrocarbon molecules
(propane) inside the narrow pore of a zeolite sample. As a result, the
desorption temperature of propane is significantly higher in the binary mixture
than in the single component case. In order to obtain further insight into
these results, we use a simple lattice gas model of diffusion of hard-core
particles to describe the diffusive transport of two species of molecules in a
one-dimensional zeolite channel. Our dynamical Monte Carlo simulations show
that taking into account an Arrhenius dependence of the single molecule
diffusion coefficient on temperature, one can explain many significant features
of the temperature programmed desorption profile observed in experiments.
However, on a closer comparison of the experimental curve and our simulation
data, we find that it is not possible to reproduce the higher propane current
than toluene current near the desorption peak seen in experiment. We argue that
this is caused by a violation of strict single-file behavior.
