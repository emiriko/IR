We study a least squares estimator $\hat {\theta}_T$ for the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, $dX_t=\theta X_t dt+\sigma dB^H_t$, driven by
fractional Brownian motion $B^H$ with Hurst parameter $H\ge \frac12$. We prove
the strong consistence of $\hat {\theta}_T$ (the almost surely convergence of
$\hat {\theta}_T$ to the true parameter ${% \theta}$). We also obtain the rate
of this convergence when $1/2\le H<3/4$, applying a central limit theorem for
multiple Wiener integrals. This least squares estimator can be used to study
other more simulation friendly estimators such as the estimator $\tilde
\theta_T$ defined by (4.1).
