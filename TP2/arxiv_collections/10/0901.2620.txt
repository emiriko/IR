Some mixed states composed of only GHZ states can be expressed in terms of
only W-states. This fact implies that such states have vanishing three-tangle.
One of such rank-3 states, $\Pi_{GHZ}$, is explicitly presented in this paper.
These results are used to compute analytically the three-tangle of a rank-4
mixed state $\sigma$ composed of four GHZ states. This analysis with
considering Bloch sphere $S^{16}$ of $d=4$ qudit system allows us to derive the
hyper-polyhedron. It is shown that the states in this hyper-polyhedron have
vanishing three-tangle. Computing the one-tangles for $\Pi_{GHZ}$ and $\sigma$,
we prove the monogamy inequality explicitly. Making use of the fact that the
three-tangle of $\Pi_{GHZ}$ is zero, we try to explain why the W-class in the
whole mixed states is not of measure zero contrary to the case of pure states.
