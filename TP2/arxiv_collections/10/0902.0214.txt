Gamma-ray line emission from radioactive decay of 60Fe provides constraints
on nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supernovae. We detect the gamma-ray
lines from 60Fe decay at 1173 and 1333 keV using three years of data from the
spectrometer SPI on board INTEGRAL. The average flux per line is (4.4 \pm 0.9)
\times 10^{-5} ph cm^{-2} s^{-1} rad^{-1} for the inner Galaxy region. Deriving
the Galactic 26Al gamma-ray line flux with using the same set of observations
and analysis method, we determine the flux ratio of 60Fe/26Al gamma-rays as
0.15 \pm 0.05. We discuss the implications of these results for the widely-held
hypothesis that 60Fe is synthesized in core-collapse supernovae, and also for
the closely-related question of the precise origin of 26Al in massive stars.
