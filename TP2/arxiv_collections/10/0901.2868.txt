To faithfully simulate ITER and other modern fusion devices, one must resolve
electron and ion fluctuation scales in a five-dimensional phase space and time.
Simultaneously, one must account for the interaction of this turbulence with
the slow evolution of the large-scale plasma profiles. Because of the enormous
range of scales involved and the high dimensionality of the problem, resolved
first-principles global simulations are very challenging using conventional
(brute force) techniques. In this thesis, the problem of resolving turbulence
is addressed by developing velocity space resolution diagnostics and an
adaptive collisionality that allow for the confident simulation of velocity
space dynamics using the approximate minimal necessary dissipation. With regard
to the wide range of scales, a new approach has been developed in which
turbulence calculations from multiple gyrokinetic flux tube simulations are
coupled together using transport equations to obtain self-consistent,
steady-state background profiles and corresponding turbulent fluxes and
heating. This approach is embodied in a new code, Trinity, which is capable of
evolving equilibrium profiles for multiple species, including electromagnetic
effects and realistic magnetic geometry, at a fraction of the cost of
conventional global simulations. Furthermore, an advanced model physical
collision operator for gyrokinetics has been derived and implemented, allowing
for the study of collisional turbulent heating, which has not been extensively
studied. To demonstrate the utility of the coupled flux tube approach,
preliminary results from Trinity simulations of the core of an ITER plasma are
presented.
