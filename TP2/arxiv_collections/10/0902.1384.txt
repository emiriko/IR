Using the description of the subprocess $\gamma\gamma^*\to S(P)$ in terms of
local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model we calculate the cross sections of
photoproduction of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons in high energy photon-lepton
collisions processes. The dependence on the transversal momentum and the total
cross sections in Weizsaecker-Williams approximation are presented.
