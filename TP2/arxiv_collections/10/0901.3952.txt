As Oleg Viro describes in his paper, the most fundamental property of the
Khovanov homology group is their invariance under Reidemeister moves. Viro
constructes Khovanov complex and homology consisting of Jordan curves with sign
and also gives a proof for the only case of first Reidemeister move by using
his definition of Khovanov homology groups. In this paper, homotopy maps are
obtained explicitly for the other Reidemeister moves, i.e. second and third.
