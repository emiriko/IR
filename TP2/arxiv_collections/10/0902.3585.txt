The rapid deposition of energy by Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) onto plasma
facing components, is a potentially serious issue for large Tokamaks such as
ITER and DEMO. The trigger for ELMs is believed to be the ideal
Magnetohydrodynamic Peeling-Ballooning instability, but recent numerical
calculations have suggested that a plasma equilibrium with an X-point - as is
found in all ITER-like Tokamaks, is stable to the Peeling mode. This contrasts
with analytical calculations (G. Laval, R. Pellat, J. S. Soule, Phys Fluids,
{\bf 17}, 835, (1974)), that found the Peeling mode to be unstable in
cylindrical plasmas with arbitrary cross-sectional shape. However the
analytical calculation only applies to a Tokamak plasma in a cylindrical
approximation. Here, we re-examine the assumptions made in cylindrical geometry
calculations, and generalise the calculation to an arbitrary Tokamak geometry
at marginal stability. The resulting equations solely describe the Peeling
mode, and are not complicated by coupling to the ballooning mode, for example.
We find that stability is determined by the value of a single parameter
$\Delta'$ that is the poloidal average of the normalised jump in the radial
derivative of the perturbed magnetic field's normal component. We also find
that near a separatrix it is possible for the energy principle's $\delta W$ to
be negative (that is usually taken to indicate that the mode is unstable, as in
the cylindrical theory), but the growth rate to be arbitrarily small.
