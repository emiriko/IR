We consider the basic features of complex dynamical and control systems.
Special attention is paid to the problems of synthesis of dynamical models of
complex systems, construction of efficient control models, and to the
development of simulation techniques. We propose an approach to the synthesis
of dynamic models of complex systems that integrates expert knowledge with the
process of modeling. A set-theoretic model of complex system is defined and
briefly analyzed. A mathematical model of complex dynamical system with
control, based on aggregate description, is also proposed. The structure of the
model is described, and architecture of computer simulation system is
presented, requirements to and components of computer simulation systems are
analyzed.
