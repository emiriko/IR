In this article we derive the effective pairwise interactions in a Langevin
type united atoms model of water. The interactions are determined from the
trajectories of a detailed molecular dynamics simulation of simple point charge
water. A standard method is used for estimating the conservative interaction,
whereas a new "bottom-up" method is used to determine the effective dissipative
and stochastic interactions. We demonstrate that, when compared to the standard
united atoms model, the transport properties of the coarse-grained model is
significantly improved by the introduction of the derived dissipative and
stochastic interactions. The results are compared to a previous study, where a
"top-down" approach was used to obtain transport properties consistent with
those of the simple point charge water model.
