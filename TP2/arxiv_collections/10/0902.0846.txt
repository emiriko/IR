An N-body code containing live stellar evolution through combination of the
software packages NBODY6 and STARS is presented. Operational details of the two
codes are outlined and the changes that have been made to combine them
discussed. We have computed the evolution of clusters of 10 000 stars using the
combined code and we compare the results with those obtained using NBODY6 and
the synthetic stellar evolution code SSE. We find that, providing the physics
package within STARS is set up correctly to match the parameters of the models
used to construct SSE, the results are very similar. This provides a good
indication that the new code is working well. We also demonstrate how this
physics can be changed simply in the new code with convective overshooting as
an example. Similar changes in SSE would require considerable reworking of the
model fits. We conclude by outlining proposed future development of the code to
include more complete models of single stars and binary star systems.
