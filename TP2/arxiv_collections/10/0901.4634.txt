Since the early days of search for a quantum theory of gravity the attempts
have been mostly concentrated on the quantization of an otherwise classical
system. The two most contentious candidate theories of gravity, sting theory
and quantum loop gravity are based on a quantum field theory - the latter is a
quantum field theory of connections on a SU(2) group manifold and former a
quantum field theory in two dimensional spaces. Here we argue that there is a
very close relation between quantum mechanics and gravity. Without gravity
quantum mechanics becomes ambiguous. We consider this observation as the
evidence for an intrinsic relation between these fundamental laws of nature. We
suggest a quantum role and definition for gravity in the context of a quantum
universe, and present a preliminary formulation for gravity in a system with a
finite number of particles.
