We propose a new experiment to study primary composition around the knee. The
Carpet-3 EAS array is the further development of the Carpet-2 EAS array (1700 m
a.s.l., Baksan Valley) and it is supposed to be a multi-component and
multi-purpose array detecting, in the EASs with $E > 10^{13}$ eV, electrons,
gammas, muons (with a threshold energy of 1 GeV), hadrons (with energies more
than 30 GeV), and thermal neutrons as well. The experimental data are to be
used in the multi-component analysis to make conclusions about the composition
of the primary cosmic rays.
