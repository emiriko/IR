We propose carbon as new resistive memory material for non-volatile memories
and compare three allotropes of carbon, namely carbon nanotubes, graphene-like
conductive carbon and insulating carbon for their possible application as
resistance-change material in high density non-volatile memories. Repetitive
high-speed switching and the potential for multi-level programming have been
successfully demonstrated.
