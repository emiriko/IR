Pulsar timing at the Mt Pleasant observatory focused on Vela, which could be
tracked for 18 hours of the day. These nearly continuous timing records extend
over 24 years allowing a great insight into details of timing noise, micro
glitches and other more exotic effects. It has been found that the spin up for
the Vela pulsar occurs instantaneously to within the uncertainties of the data.
The potential for new, higher resolution data, to unveil insights of the
Neutron Star interiors is discussed.
