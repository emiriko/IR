Systematic Raman studies on several cuprates (YBa$_{\rm 2}$Cu$_{\rm
3}$O$_{\rm x}$, YBa$_{\rm 2}$Cu$_{\rm 4}$O$_{\rm 8}$ or Bi$_{\rm 2}$Sr$_{\rm
2}$CaCu$_{\rm 2}$O$_{\rm 8}$) have shown that at optimal doping the compounds
are at the edge of lattice instability; once this level is exceeded, by means
of doping or applying external hydrostatic pressure, the changes in the
transition temperature are accompanied by spectral modifications. There are
strong indications that the reduction in T$_{\rm c}$ is correlated with a
separation into nanoscale phases, which involve the oxygen atoms of the
CuO$_{\rm 2}$ planes. In this work, modifications with doping in the Raman
spectra of the La$_{\rm 2-x}$Sr$_{\rm x}$CuO$_{\rm 4}$ compound are presented,
which show that spin or charge ordering is coupled with lattice distortions in
the whole doping region.
