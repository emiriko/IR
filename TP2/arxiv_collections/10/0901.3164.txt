I study the post-inflation oscillation and decay of light coherent scalar
field condensates that may develop during an inflationary phase of the
universe. In particular, the light scalars studied are a composition of the
scalar particles of a supersymmetric theory which correspond to the flat
directions of the theory's scalar potential. Some toy models that possess
supersymmetric flat directions are presented and numerical solutions for the
evolution of the scalar fields are obtained. Both analytic and numeric results
suggest that such condensates, if they existed in the early universe, can decay
through a rapid and nonperturbative process long before these condensates could
significantly affect the thermalization of the universe.
