RNA folding is a kinetic process governed by the competition of a large
number of structures stabilized by the transient formation of base pairs that
may induce complex folding pathways and the formation of misfolded structures.
Despite of its importance in modern biophysics, the current understanding of
RNA folding kinetics is limited by the complex interplay between the weak
base-pair interactions that stabilize the native structure and the disordering
effect of thermal forces. The possibility of mechanically pulling individual
molecules offers a new perspective to understand the folding of nucleic acids.
Here we investigate the folding and misfolding mechanism in RNA secondary
structures pulled by mechanical forces. We introduce a model based on the
identification of the minimal set of structures that reproduce the patterns of
force-extension curves obtained in single molecule experiments. The model
requires only two fitting parameters: the attempt frequency at the level of
individual base pairs and a parameter associated to a free energy correction
that accounts for the configurational entropy of an exponentially large number
of neglected secondary structures. We apply the model to interpret results
recently obtained in pulling experiments in the three-helix junction S15 RNA
molecule (RNAS15). We show that RNAS15 undergoes force-induced misfolding where
force favors the formation of a stable non-native hairpin. The model reproduces
the pattern of unfolding and refolding force-extension curves, the distribution
of breakage forces and the misfolding probability obtained in the experiments.
