By placing a collection of membranes in 11 dimensional background
supergravity six form field and considering the non-linear action of multiple
membranes we obtain the potential for transverse scalar fields of membranes and
study some possible vacuum configurations. We find that the system has a stable
vacuum in which is a formation of membranes into fuzzy three sphere.
