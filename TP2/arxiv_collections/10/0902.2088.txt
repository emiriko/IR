The radial part of the Klein-Gordon equation for the generalized Woods-Saxon
potential is solved by using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method in the case of
spatially dependent mass within the new approximation scheme to the centrifugal
potential term. The energy eigenvalues and corresponding normalized
eigenfunctions are computed. The solutions in the case of constant mass are
also studied to check out the consistency of our new approximation scheme.
