High-temperature superconducting microbridges implemented with
YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-delta) thin-films are shown to be possible fault current
limiters for microelectronic devices with some elements working at temperatures
below the superconducting critical temperature and, simultaneously, under very
low power conditions (below 1W). This is the case in the important applications
of superconductors as SQUID based electronics, and technologies for
communication or infrared detectors. In this paper it is shown that the good
thermal behavior of these microlimiters allows working in a regime where even
relatively small faults induce their transition to highly dissipative states,
dramatically increasing their limitation efficiency. The conditions for optimal
refrigeration and operation of these microlimiters are also proposed.
