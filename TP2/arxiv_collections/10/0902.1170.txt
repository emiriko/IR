The semiclassical limit of a 4-simplex amplitude for a spin foam quantum
gravity model with an Immirzi parameter is studied. If the boundary state
represents a non-degenerate 4-simplex geometry, the asymptotic formula contains
the Regge action for general relativity. A canonical choice of phase for the
boundary state is introduced and is shown to be necessary to obtain the
results.
