Using the POLISH instrument, I am unable to reproduce the large-amplitude
polarimetric observations of Berdyugina et al. (2008) to the >99.99% confidence
level. I observe no significant polarimetric variability in the HD 189733
system, and the upper limit to variability from the exoplanet is Delta_P < 7.9
x 10^(-5) with 99% confidence in the 400 nm to 675 nm wavelength range.
Berdyugina et al. (2008) report polarized, scattered light from the atmosphere
of the HD 189733b hot Jupiter with an amplitude of two parts in 10^4. Such a
large amplitude is over an order of magnitude larger than expected given a
geometric albedo similar to other hot Jupiters. However, my non-detection of
polarimetric variability phase-locked to the orbital period of the exoplanet,
and the lack of any significant variability, shows that the polarimetric
modulation reported by Berdyugina et al. (2008) cannot be due to the exoplanet.
