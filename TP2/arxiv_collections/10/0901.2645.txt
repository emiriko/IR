We present here some results on particular elimination schemes for chordal
graphs, namely we show that for any chordal graph we can construct in linear
time a simplicial elimination scheme starting with a pending maximal clique
attached via a minimal separator maximal (resp. minimal) under inclusion among
all minimal separators.
