In this paper, we study binary and ternary matrices that are used for CDMA
applications that are injective on binary or ternary user vectors. In other
words, in the absence of additive noise, the interference of overloaded CDMA
can be removed completely. Some new algorithms are proposed for constructing
such matrices. Also, using an information theoretic approach, we conjecture the
extent to which such CDMA matrix codes exist. For overloaded case, we also show
that some of the codes derived from our algorithms perform better than the
binary Welch Bound Equality codes; the decoding is ML but of low complexity.
