This paper presents a recursive hiding scheme for 2 out of 3 secret sharing.
In recursive hiding of secrets, the user encodes additional information about
smaller secrets in the shares of a larger secret without an expansion in the
size of the latter, thereby increasing the efficiency of secret sharing. We
present applications of our proposed protocol to images as well as text.
