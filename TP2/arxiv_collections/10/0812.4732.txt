We calculate $^3$He+$p$ scattering phase shifts in two different microscopic
cluster models, Model T and Model C, in order to show the effects of tensor
force as well as $D$-wave components in the cluster wave function. Model T
employs a realistic nucleon-nucleon potential and includes the $D$-wave,
whereas Model C employs an effective potential in which the tensor-force effect
is considered to be renormalized into the central force and includes only the
$S$-wave for the cluster intrinsic motion. The $S$- and $P$-wave elastic
scattering phase shifts are obtained in the \{$^3$He+$p$\}+\{$d$ + 2$p$\}
coupled-channels calculation. In Model T, the $d$ + 2$p$ channel plays a
significant role in producing the $P$-wave resonant phase shifts but hardly
affects the $S$-wave non-resonant phase shifts. In Model C, however, the effect
of the $d$ + 2$p$ channel is suppressed in both of the $S$- and $P$-wave phase
shifts, suggesting that it is renormalized mostly as the $^3$He(1/2$^+$)+$p$
channel in the resonance region.
