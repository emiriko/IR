In a recent paper it was reported a planetary system around the star HD60532,
composed by two giant planets in a possible 3:1 mean motion resonance, that
should be confirmed within the next decade. Here we show that the analysis of
the global dynamics of the system allows to confirm this resonance. The present
best fit to data already corresponds to this resonant configuration and the
system is stable for at least 5Gry. The 3:1 resonance is so robust that
stability is still possible for a wide variety of orbital parameters around the
best fit solution and also if the inclination of the system orbital plane with
respect to the plane of the sky is as small as 15 deg. Moreover, if the
inclination is taken as a free parameter in the adjustment to the observations,
we find an inclination ~ 20 deg, which corresponds to M_b =3.1 M_Jup and M_c =
7.4 M_Jup for the planetary companions.
