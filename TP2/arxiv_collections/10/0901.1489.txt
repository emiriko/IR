We discuss one of the most interesting phenomena exhibited by baby skyrmions
-- breaking of rotational symmetry. The topics we will deal with here include
the appearance of rotational symmetry breaking in the static solutions of baby
Skyrme models, both in flat as well as in curved spaces, the zero-temperature
crystalline structure of baby skyrmions, and finally, the appearance of
spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in rotating baby skyrmions.
