We study the spatial decay of electron coherence due to electron-electron
interaction in a finite-length disorder-free quantum wire. Based on the
Luttinger liquid theory, we demonstrate that the coherence length
characterizing the exponential decay of the coherence can vary from region to
region, and that the coherence can even revive after the decay. This
counterintuitive behavior, which is in clear contrast to the conventional
exponential decay with single coherence length, is due to the fractionalization
of an electron and the finite-size-induced recombination of the fractions.
