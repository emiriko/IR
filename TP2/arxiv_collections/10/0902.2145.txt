Intrigued by some features of a small but significant fraction of the
multi-muon events recently published by the CDF collaboration, we show an
explicit attempt to describe them in terms of a light scalar singlet $\phi$
which communicates with the standard quarks either through a heavy scalar or a
heavy fermion exchange. As suggested in arXiv:0810.7530, the singlet $\phi$ has
a chain decay into a final state made of four $\tau\bar{\tau}$ pairs. We can
simulate most of the muon properties of the selected sample of events. Some of
these properties adhere rather well to the already published data; others
should allow a decisive test of the proposed interpretation. Assuming that the
test is positively passed, we show how the PAMELA excess can be fitted by the
annihilation of a TeV Dark Matter particle that communicates with the Standard
Model via the new light singlet(s).
