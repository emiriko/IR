This paper is devoted to the study of the regularity of solutions to some
systems of reaction--diffusion equations, with reaction terms having a
subquadratic growth. We show the global boundedness and regularity of
solutions, without smallness assumptions, in any dimension $N$.
  The proof is based on blow-up techniques. The natural entropy of the system
plays a crucial role in the analysis. It allows us to use of De Giorgi type
methods introduced for elliptic regularity with rough coefficients. In spite
these systems are entropy supercritical, it is possible to control the
hypothetical blow-ups, in the critical scaling, via a very weak norm. Analogies
with the Navier-Stokes equation are briefly discussed in the introduction.
