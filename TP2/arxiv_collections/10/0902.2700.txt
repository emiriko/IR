Based on SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics we interprete Aracde2's and the
results of earlier radio-surveys on low-frequency CMB line temperatures as a
phase-boundary effect. We explain the excess at low frequencies by evanescent,
nonthermal photon fields of the CMB whose intensity is nulled by that of Planck
distributed calibrator photons. The CMB baseline temperature thus is identified
with the critical temperature of the deconfining-preconfining transition.
