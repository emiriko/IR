Ferromagnetic resonance and static magnetic properties of CoFe/Al2O3/CoFe/Py
and CoFe/Al2O3/CoFeB/Py magnetic tunnel junctions and of 25nm thick
single-layer Permalloy(Py) films have been studied as a function of temperature
down to 2K. The temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic resonance excited
in the Py layers in magnetic tunnel junctions shows knee-like enhancement of
the resonance frequency accompanied by an anomaly in the magnetization near
60K. We attribute the anomalous static and dynamic magnetic response at low
temperatures to interface stress induced magnetic reorientation transition at
the Py interface which could be influenced by dipolar soft-hard layer coupling
through the Al2O3 barrier.
