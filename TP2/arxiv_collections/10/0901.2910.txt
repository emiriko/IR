We study multi-parameter Carnot-Caratheodory balls, generalizing results due
to Nagel, Stein, and Wainger in the single parameter setting. The main
technical result is seen as a uniform version of the theorem of Frobenius. In
addition, we study maximal functions associated to certain multi-parameter
families of Carnot-Caratheodory balls.
