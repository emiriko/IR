We consider an atomic Fermi gas confined in a uniform optical lattice
potential, where the atoms can pair into molecules via a magnetic field
controlled narrow Feshbach resonance. Thus by adjusting the magnetic field the
portion of fermionic and bosonic particles in the system can be continuously
varied. We analyze the statistical mechanics of this system and consider the
interplay of the lattice physics with the atom-molecule conversion. We study
the entropic behavior of the system and characterize the temperature changes
that occur during adiabatic ramps across the Feshbach resonance. We show that
an appropriate choice of filling fraction can be used to reduce the system
temperature during such ramps.
