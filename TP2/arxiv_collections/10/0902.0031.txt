We study the free decay of capillary turbulence on the charged surface of
liquid hydrogen. We find that decay begins from the high frequency end of the
spectral range, while most of the energy remains localized at low frequencies.
The apparent discrepancy with the self-similar theory of nonstationary wave
turbulent processes is accounted for in terms of a quasi-adiabatic decay
wherein fast nonlinear wave interactions redistribute energy between frequency
scales in the presence of finite damping at all frequencies. Numerical
calculations based on this idea agree well with experimental data.
