In this paper, we are presenting a new model for interactive music. Unlike
most interactive systems, our model is based on file organization, but does not
require digital audio treatments. This model includes a definition of a
constraints system and its solver. The products of this project are intended
for the general public, inexperienced users, as well as professional musicians,
and will be distributed commercially. We are here presenting three products of
this project. The difficulty of this project is to design a technology and
software products for interactive music which must be easy to use by the
general public and by professional composers.
