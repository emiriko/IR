We study theoretically the rate of spontaneous emission of a two-level
quantum emitter embedded in realistic systems: near a mirror, near a plasmonic
sphere, or in a 3D photonic bandgap crystal. At constant frequency and
position, we find striking (up to $10^{2}\times$) variations in emission rate
by varying the orientation of the transition dipole moment. We present a
general representation of rate versus orientation that only invokes symmetry of
the Green function. The concomitant 3-dimensional geometric surfaces provide
much insight in how preferred orientations for enhancement (or inhibition)
depend on the emitter's frequency and location, and on optimal strategies to
actively switch emission rates by controlling oriented dipoles.
