The information on stellar parameters and on the stellar interior we can get
by studying pulsating stars depends crucially on the available observational
constraints: both seismic constraints precision and number of detected modes,
identification, nature of the modes) and "classical" observations (photospheric
abundances, effective temperature, luminosity, surface gravity). We consider
the case of beta Cephei pulsators and, with the aim of estimating
quantitatively how the available observational constraints determine the type
and precision of our inferences, we set the stage for Hare&Hound exercises. In
this contribution we present preliminary results for one simple case, where we
assume as "observed" frequencies a subset of frequencies of a model and then
evaluate a seismic merit function on a dense and extensive grid of models of
B-type stars. We also compare the behaviour of chi^2 surfaces obtained with and
without mode identification.
