The CALICE collaboration is involved in the design of compact calorimeters
featuring a high granularity. The technical developments have to overcome
various design issues such as the power dissipation, the integration of the
front-end electronics inside the detector and connections between the parts. A
huge collaborative work is required to achieve the devices using common tools
and designs.
