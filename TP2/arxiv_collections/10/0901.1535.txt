Heavy flavour production is one of the key components of the HERA II physics
programme. While most of the results presented use leptons or the
reconstruction of charmed mesons to identify heavy flavour production, both the
H1 and ZEUS experiments now have working microvertex detectors that are being
used more and more. In this talk I will summarise a selection of the recent
results obtained by the two collaborations.
