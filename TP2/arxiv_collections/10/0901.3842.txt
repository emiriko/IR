Systematic numerical simulations of model dense granular materials in
monotonous, quasistatic deformation reveal the existence of two different
r\'egimes. In the first one, the macroscopic strains stem from the deformation
of contacts. The motion can be calculated by purely static means, without
inertia, stress controlled or strain rate controlled simulations yield
identical smooth rheological curves for a same sample. In the second r\'egime,
strains are essentially due to instabilities of the contact network, the
approach to the limits of large samples and of small strain rates is
considerably slower and the material is more sensitive to perturbations. These
results are discussed and related to experiments : measurements of elastic
moduli with very small strain increments, and slow deformation (creep) under
constant stress.
