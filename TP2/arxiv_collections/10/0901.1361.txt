Intragenomic recombination (crossover) is a very important evolutionary
mechanism. The crossover events are not evenly distributed along the natural
chromosomes. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that frequency of recombinations
decides about the strategy of chromosomes' and genomes' evolution. In large
panmictic populations, under high recombination rate the Darwinian purifying
selection operates keeping the fraction of defective genes at the relatively
low level. In small populations and under low recombination rate the strategy
of complementing haplotypes seems to be more advantageous. Switching between
the two strategies has a character of phase transition - it depends on
inbreeding coefficient and crossover rate. The critical recombination rate
depends also on the size of chromosome. It is also possible, that in one genome
some chromosomes could be under complementing while some other under purifying
selection. Such situation stabilizes genome evolution and reproduction
strategy. It seems that this phenomenon can be responsible for the positive
correlation between kinship and fecundity, recently found in the Islander
population. When large population is forced to enter the complementing
strategy, the phenomenon of sympatric speciation is observed.
