We study the formation of local moments in quantum dots arising in quasi-one
dimensional electron wires due to localized spin-orbit (Rashba) interaction.
Using an Anderson-like model to describe the occurrence of the magnetic moments
in these Rashba dots, we calculate the local magnetization within the
mean-field approximation. We find that the magnetization becomes a nontrivial
function of the Rashba coupling strength. We discuss both the equilibrium and
nonequilibrium cases. Interestingly, we obtain a magnetic phase which is stable
at large bias due to the Rashba interaction.
