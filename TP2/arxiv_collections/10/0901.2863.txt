The global geometric entanglement is studied in the context of
newly-developed tensor network algorithms for finite systems. For
one-dimensional quantum spin systems it is found that, at criticality, the
leading finite-size correction to the global geometric entanglement per site
behaves as $b/n$, where $n$ is the size of the system and $b$ a given
coefficient. Our conclusion is based on the computation of the geometric
entanglement per spin for the quantum Ising model in a transverse magnetic
field and for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. We also discuss the possibility of
coefficient $b$ being universal.
