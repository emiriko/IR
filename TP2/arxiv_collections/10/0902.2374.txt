We describe a new algorithm for including the dynamical effects of ionizing
radiation in SPH simulations, and we present several examples of how the
algorithm can be applied to problems in star formation. We use the HEALPix
software to tessellate the sky and to solve the equation of ionization
equilibrium along a ray towards each of the resulting tesserae. We exploit the
hierarchical nature of HEALPix to make the algorithm adaptive, so that fine
angular resolution is invoked only where it is needed, and the computational
cost is kept low. We present simulations of (i) the spherically symmetric
expansion of an HII region inside a uniform-density, non--self-gravitating
cloud; (ii) the spherically symmetric expansion of an HII region inside a
uniform-density, self-gravitating cloud; (iii) the expansion of an off-centre
HII region inside a uniform-density, non--self-gravitating cloud, resulting in
rocket acceleration and dispersal of the cloud; and (iv) radiatively driven
compression and ablation of a core overrun by an HII region. The new algorithm
provides the means to explore and evaluate the role of ionizing radiation in
regulating the efficiency and statistics of star formation.
