We analyse new deep g and i-band imaging with the CFHT of 16 QSOs in the
redshift range 0.9 to 1.3. The principal points of interest are the symmetry
and signs of tidal effects in the QSO hosts and nearby (`companion') galaxies.
The sample measures are compared with similar measures on randomly selected
field galaxy samples. Asymmetry measures are made for all objects to g ~22, and
magnitudes of all galaxies 2 magnitudes fainter. The QSOs are found in denser
environments than the field, and are somewhat offset from the centroid of their
surrounding galaxies. The QSO hosts appear more disturbed than other galaxies.
While the QSO companions and field galaxies have the same average asymmetry,
the distribution of asymmetry values is different. QSO companions within 15
arcsec are fainter than average field galaxies. We discuss scenarios that are
consistent with these and other measured quantities.
