First, the description of a quantization local electromagnetic field is
proposed by presentation of quantum form of Maxwell equations in the vacuum
which describes the electromagnetic field by the model of a Bose-gas consisting
of the interacting fundamental neutral Bose-particles (light bosons) with spin
one and a finite mass $m$. The later represents as a fundamental constant $
m=2.4 \cdot 10^{-35} kg $. The light bosons of electromagnetic field induce the
Bose-excitations, which are the photon modes. In this letter, we show that the
Bose gas of light bosons undergoes a phase transition at low temperatures to
condition in which the zero-momentum quantum state is occupied by a finite
fraction of the light bosons. This momentum-condensed phase represents as a
superfluid component for electromagnetic field. The later is absent at the
transition temperature, which is found in this letter.
