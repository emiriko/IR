We advocate charmed-hadron inclusive hadroproduction as a laboratory to probe
intrinsic charm (IC) inside the colliding hadrons. Working at next-to-leading
order in the general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme endowed with
non-perturbative fragmentation functions recently extracted from a global fit
to e^+e^- annihilation data from KEKB, CESR, and LEP1, we first assess the
sensitivity of Tevatron data of D^0, D^+, and D^{*+} inclusive production to
the IC parameterizations provided by Pumplin et al. We then argue that similar
data from pp collisions at RHIC would have the potential to discriminate
between different IC models provided they reach out to sufficiently large
values of transverse momentum.
