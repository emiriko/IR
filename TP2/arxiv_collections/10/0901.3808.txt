We explore the possibility that the right-handed top quark is composite,
identifying possible signatures of compositeness and how they might manifest
themselves at the LHC and Tevatron. We perform a complete analysis of the
dimension six modifications of the top coupling to gluons and find that
cancellations among operators in the t\bar{t} rate allow for very low
compositeness scales, but this can be drastically improved by looking at
kinematic distributions. Turning to the LHC, we examine four top production
from a dimension six four-top operator and estimate the LHC with 100 {\rm
fb}^{-1} collected luminosity to be sensitive to compositeness scales as high
as 5 TeV.
