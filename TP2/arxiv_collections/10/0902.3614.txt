We study the combination of the following already known ideas for showing
confluence of unconditional or conditional term rewriting systems into
practically more useful confluence criteria for conditional systems: Our
syntactical separation into constructor and non-constructor symbols, Huet's
introduction and Toyama's generalization of parallel closedness for
non-noetherian unconditional systems, the use of shallow confluence for proving
confluence of noetherian and non-noetherian conditional systems, the idea that
certain kinds of limited confluence can be assumed for checking the
fulfilledness or infeasibility of the conditions of conditional critical pairs,
and the idea that (when termination is given) only prime superpositions have to
be considered and certain normalization restrictions can be applied for the
substitutions fulfilling the conditions of conditional critical pairs. Besides
combining and improving already known methods, we present the following new
ideas and results: We strengthen the criterion for overlay joinable noetherian
systems, and, by using the expressiveness of our syntactical separation into
constructor and non-constructor symbols, we are able to present criteria for
level confluence that are not criteria for shallow confluence actually and also
able to weaken the severe requirement of normality (stiffened with
left-linearity) in the criteria for shallow confluence of noetherian and
non-noetherian conditional systems to the easily satisfied requirement of
quasi-normality. Finally, the whole paper may also give a practically useful
overview of the syntactical means for showing confluence of conditional term
rewriting systems.
