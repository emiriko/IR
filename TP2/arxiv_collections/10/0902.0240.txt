In biomedical studies, researchers are often interested in assessing the
association between one or more ordinal explanatory variables and an outcome
variable, at the same time adjusting for covariates of any type. The outcome
variable may be continuous, binary, or represent censored survival times. In
the absence of precise knowledge of the response function, using monotonicity
constraints on the ordinal variables improves efficiency in estimating
parameters, especially when sample sizes are small. An active set algorithm
that can efficiently compute such estimators is proposed, and a
characterization of the solution is provided. Having an efficient algorithm at
hand is especially relevant when applying likelihood ratio tests in restricted
generalized linear models, where one needs the value of the likelihood at the
restricted maximizer. The algorithm is illustrated on a real life data set from
oncology.
