Polycrystalline samples of a new superconducting EuAsFeO0.85F0.15 compound
with critical temperature Tc=11K were prepared by solid state synthesis. Its
electric and magnetic properties have been investigated in magnetic fields from
0.1 to 140000 Oe. Critical magnetic fields Hc1, and Hc2 were measured and hence
the magnetic penetration depths and the coherence length have been estimated.
The temperature dependence Hc2 (T) exhibits clear hyperbolic - type behavior
starting with the lowest fields. The data derived were used to estimate
probable high Tc and Hc2 in compounds doped with rare-earths having small
atomic radii.
