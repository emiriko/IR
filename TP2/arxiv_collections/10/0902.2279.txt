Although there are many more stellar population studies of elliptical and
lenticular galaxies, studies of spiral galaxies are catching up, due to higher
signal to noise data on one hand, and better analysis methods on the other.
Here I start by discussing some modern methods of analyzing integrated spectra
of spiral galaxies, and comparing them with traditional methods. I then discuss
some recent developments in our understanding of the stellar content of spiral
galaxies, and their associated dust content. I discuss star formation
histories, radial stellar population gradients, and stellar populations in
sigma drops.
