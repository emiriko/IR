We present a combined neutron and synchrotron powder diffraction study of the
crystal and magnetic structure of VOCl. The occurrence of antiferromagnetic
order in VOCl is accompanied by a monoclinic distortion. The high sensitivity
of the magnetic interaction parameters on V-O-V bond angles and V-V distances
yields strong magnetoelastic coupling which implies the structural distortion
below T$_N$ as well as anomalous structural effects in the paramagnetic phase.
