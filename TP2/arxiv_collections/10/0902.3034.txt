We consider the continuous-time version of our recently proposed quantum
theory of optical temporal phase and instantaneous frequency [Tsang, Shapiro,
and Lloyd, Phys. Rev. A 78, 053820 (2008)]. Using a state-variable approach to
estimation, we design homodyne phase-locked loops that can measure the temporal
phase with quantum-limited accuracy. We show that post-processing can further
improve the estimation performance, if delay is allowed in the estimation. We
also investigate the fundamental uncertainties in the simultaneous estimation
of harmonic-oscillator position and momentum via continuous optical phase
measurements from the classical estimation theory perspective. In the case of
delayed estimation, we find that the inferred uncertainty product can drop
below that allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Although this result
seems counter-intuitive, we argue that it does not violate any basic principle
of quantum mechanics.
