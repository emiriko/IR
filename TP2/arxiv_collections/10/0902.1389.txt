We investigate the motion of a nano tippe top, which is formed from a C60
fullerene, and which is assumed to be spinning on either a graphene sheet or
the interior of a single-walled carbon nanotube. We assume no specific
geometric configuration for the top, however for example, the nano tippe top
might be formed by joining a fullerene C60 with a small segment of a smaller
radius carbon nanotube. We assume that it is spinning on a graphene sheet or a
carbon nanotube surface only as a means of positioning and isolating the
device, and the only effect of the graphene or the carbon nanotube surface is
only through the frictional effect generated at the point of the contact. We
employ the same basic physical ideas originating from the classical tippe top
and find that the total retarding force, which comprises both a frictional
force and a magnetic force at the contact point between the C60 fullerene and
the graphene sheet or the inner surface of the single-walled carbon nanotube,
induces the C60 molecule to spin and precess from a standing up position to a
lying down position. Unlike the classical tippe top, the nanoscale tippe top
does not flip over since the gravitational effect is not sufficient at the nano
scale. After the precession, while the molecular top spins about its lying down
axis, if we apply the opposite retarding magnetic force at the contact point,
then the molecule will return to its standing up position. The standing up and
the lying down configurations of the nano tippe top during the precession and
retraction processes demonstrate its potential use as a memory device in
nano-computing.
