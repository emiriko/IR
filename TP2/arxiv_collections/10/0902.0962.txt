We introduce a new form of stable spatio-temporal self-trapped optical
packets stemming from the interplay of local and nonlocal nonlinearities.
Pulsed self-trapped light beams in media with both electronic and molecular
nonlinear responses are addressed to prove that spatial and temporal effects
can be decoupled, allowing for independent tuning. We numerically demonstrate
that (3+1)D light bullets and anti-bullets, i. e. bright and dark temporal
solitons embedded in stable (2+1)D nonlocal spatial solitons, can be generated
in reorientational media under experimentally feasible conditions.
