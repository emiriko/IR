(Abridged abstract) A theory of incompressible MHD turbulence recently
developed by Boldyrev predicts the existence of a scale dependent angle of
alignment between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations that is proportional
to the lengthscale of the fluctuations to the power 1/4. In this study, plasma
and magnetic field data from the Wind spacecraft are used to investigate the
angle between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind as a
function of the timescale of the fluctuations and to look for the power law
scaling predicted by Boldyrev.
