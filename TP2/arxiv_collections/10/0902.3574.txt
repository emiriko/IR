We investigate whether the so-called kappa distribution, often used to fit
electron distributions detected in-situ in the solar wind, can describe
electrons producing the hard X-ray emission in solar flares. Using Ramaty High
Energy Solar Spectroscopic imager (RHESSI) flare data we fit spatially- and
feature-integrated spectra, assuming kappa distribution for the mean electron
flux spectrum. We show that a single kappa distribution generally cannot
describe spatially integrated X-ray emission composed of both footpoint and
coronal sources. In contrast, the kappa distribution is consistent with mean
electron spectra producing hard X-ray emission in some coronal sources.
