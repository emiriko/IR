In realizations of quantum computing, a two-level system (qubit) is often
singled out of the many levels of an anharmonic oscillator. In these cases,
simple qubit control fails on short time scales because of coupling to leakage
levels. We provide an easy to implement analytic formula that inhibits this
leakage from any single-control analog or pixelated pulse. It is based on
adding a second control that is proportional to the time-derivative of the
first. For realistic parameters of superconducting qubits, this strategy
reduces the error by an order of magnitude relative to the state of the art,
all based on smooth and feasible pulse shapes. These results show that even
weak anharmonicity is sufficient and in general not a limiting factor for
implementing quantum gates.
