We present applications of the recently introduced ``Generalized SIC-Slater''
scheme which provides a simple Self-Interaction Correction approximation in the
framework of the Optimized Effective Potential. We focus on the computation of
static polarizabilities which are known to constitute stringent tests for
Density Functional Theory. We apply the new method to model H chains, but also
to more realistic systems such as C4 (organic) chains, and less symmetrical
systems such as a Na5 (metallic) cluster. Comparison is made with other SIC
schemes, especially with the standard SIC-Slater one.
