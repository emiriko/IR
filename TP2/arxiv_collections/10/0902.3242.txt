We study the evolution of the pairing from weak to strong coupling on a
honeycomb lattice by Quantum Monte Carlo. We show numerical evidence of the
BCS-BEC crossover as the coupling strength increases on a honeycomb lattice
with small fermi surface by measuring a wide range of observables: double
occupancy, spin susceptibility, local pair correlation, and kinetic energy.
Although at low energy, the model sustains Dirac fermions, we do not find
significant qualitative difference in the BCS-BEC crossover as compared to
those with an extended Fermi surface, except at weak coupling, BCS regime.
