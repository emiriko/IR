Three coarse-grained models of the double-stranded DNA are proposed and
compared in the context of mechanical manipulation such as twisting and various
schemes of stretching. The models differ in the number of effective beads
(between two and five) representing each nucleotide. They all show similar
behavior and, in particular, lead to a torque-force phase diagrams
qualitatively consistent with experiments and all-atom simulations.
