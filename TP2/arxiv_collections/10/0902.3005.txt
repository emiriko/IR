Since the beginning, quantum mechanics has raised major foundational and
interpretative problems. Foundational research has been an important factor in
the development of quantum cryptography, quantum information theory and,
perhaps one day, practical quantum computers. Many believe that, in turn,
quantum information theory has bearing on foundational research. This is
largely related to the so-called epistemic view of quantum states, which
maintains that the state vector represents information on a system and has led
to the suggestion that quantum theory needs no interpretation. I will argue
that this and related approaches fail to take into consideration two different
explanatory functions of quantum mechanics, namely that of accounting for
classically unexplainable correlations between classical phenomena and that of
explaining the microscopic structure of classical objects. If interpreting
quantum mechanics means answering the question, "How can the world be for
quantum mechanics to be true?", there seems to be no way around it.
