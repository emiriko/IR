Kawai, Parrondo, and Van den Broeck [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 080602 (2007)] have
recently established a quantitative relationship between dissipated work and a
microscopic, information-theoretic measure of irreversibility. We illustrate
this result using the exactly solvable system of a Brownian particle in a
dragged harmonic trap.
