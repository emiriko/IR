The main obstacle to coherent control of two-level quantum systems is their
coupling to an uncontrolled environment. For electron spins in III-V quantum
dots, the random environment is mostly given by the nuclear spins in the
quantum dot host material; they collectively act on the electron spin through
the hyperfine interaction, much like a random magnetic field. Here we show that
the same hyperfine interaction can be harnessed such that partial control of
the normally uncontrolled environment becomes possible. In particular, we
observe that the electron spin resonance frequency remains locked to the
frequency of an applied microwave magnetic field, even when the external
magnetic field or the excitation frequency are changed. The nuclear field
thereby adjusts itself such that the electron spin resonance condition remains
satisfied. General theoretical arguments indicate that this spin resonance
locking is accompanied by a significant reduction of the randomness in the
nuclear field.
