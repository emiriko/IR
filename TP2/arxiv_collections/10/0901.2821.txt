We examine the contribution of general Z*ZH and gamma*ZH three-point
interactions arising from new physics to the Higgs production process e+e- ->
HZ. From Lorentz covariance, each of these vertices may be written in terms of
three (complex) form factors, whose real and imaginary parts together make six
independent couplings. We take into account possible longitudinal or transverse
beam polarization likely to be available at a linear collider. We show how
partial cross sections and angular asymmetries in suitable combinations with
appropriate beam polarizations, can be used to disentangle various couplings
from one another. A striking result is that using transverse polarization, one
of the gammaZH couplings, not otherwise accessible, can be determined
independently of all other couplings. Transverse polarization also helps in the
independent determination of a combination of two other couplings, in contrast
to a combination of four accessible with unpolarized or longitudinally
polarized beams. We also obtain the sensitivity of the various observables in
constraining the new-physics interactions at a linear collider operating at a
centre-of-mass energy of 500 GeV with longitudinal or transverse polarization.
