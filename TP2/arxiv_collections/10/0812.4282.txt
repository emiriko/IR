Magnetic properties in a magnetically textured ferrofluid made out of
interacting maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) nanoparticles suspended in glycerin have
been investigated. Despite the loss of uniform distribution of anisotropy axes,
a superspin glass state exists at low temperature in a concentrated, textured
ferrofluid as in the case of its non-textured counterpart. The onset of
superspin glass state was verified from the sample's AC susceptibility. The
influence of the anisotropy axis orientation on the aging behavior in the
glassy states is also discussed.
