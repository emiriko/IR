Inspired by the recent developments in the field of Spectrum Auctions, we
have tried to provide a comprehensive framework for the complete procedure of
Spectrum Licensing. We have identified the various issues the Governments need
to decide upon while designing the licensing procedure and what are the various
options available in each issue. We also provide an in depth study of how each
of this options impact the overall procedure along with theoretical and
practical results from the past. Lastly we argue as to how we can combine the
positives two most widely used Spectrum Auctions mechanisms into the Hybrid
Multiple Round Auction mechanism being proposed by us.
