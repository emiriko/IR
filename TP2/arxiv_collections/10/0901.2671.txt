We raise the possibility that the chiral degeneracy of the magnons in
ultrathin films can be lifted due to the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions. By using simple symmetry arguments, we discuss under which
conditions such a chiral asymmetry occurs. We then perform relativistic first
principles calculations for an Fe monolayer on W(110) and explicitly reveal the
asymmetry of the spin-wave spectrum in case of wave-vectors parallel to the
(001) direction. Furthermore, we quantitatively interpret our results in terms
of a simplified spin-model by using calculated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vectors.
Our theoretical prediction should inspire experiments to explore the asymmetry
of spin-waves, with a particular emphasis on the possibility to measure the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in ultrathin films.
