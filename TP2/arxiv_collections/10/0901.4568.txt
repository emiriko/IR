This article reviews recent progress on the geometry dependence of Casimir
interactions and presents some applications to nanosystems. The article
consists of three parts: (i) Some examples for geometry dependence: structured
surfaces, cylinders, and spheres. (ii) Material dependence: Casimir interaction
between nano-spheres. (iii) Casimir force induced non-linear dynamics, ratchet
effects.
