We present schemes to prepare two-dimensional cluster states [H. J. Briegel
and R. Raussendorf, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86}, 910 (2001)] with atomic ions
confined in a micro-structured linear ion trap and coupled by an engineered
spin-spin interaction. In particular, we show how to prepare a $n \times 2$
cluster state by creating a linear cluster state and adding third-neighbor
entanglement using selective recoupling techniques. The scheme is based on the
capabilities provided by segmented linear Paul traps to confine ions in local
potential wells and to separate and transport ions between these wells.
Furthermore, we consider creating 3 and 4-qubit cluster states by engineering
the coupling matrix such that through the periodicity of the time evolution
unwanted couplings are canceled. All entangling operations are achieved by
switching of voltages and currents, and do not require interaction with laser
light.
