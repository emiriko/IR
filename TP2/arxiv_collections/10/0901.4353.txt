We report observation of an inverse energy cascade in second sound acoustic
turbulence in He II. Its onset occurs above a critical driving energy and it is
accompanied by giant waves that constitute an acoustic analogue of the rogue
waves that occasionally appear on the surface of the ocean. The theory of the
phenomenon is developed and shown to be in good agreement with the experiments.
