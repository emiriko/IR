Bounds on the exchange-correlation energy of many-electron systems are
derived and tested. By using universal scaling properties of the
electron-electron interaction, we obtain the exponent of the bounds in three,
two, one, and quasi-one dimensions. From the properties of the electron gas in
the dilute regime, the tightest estimate to date is given for the numerical
prefactor of the bound, which is crucial in practical applications. Numerical
tests on various low-dimensional systems are in line with the bounds obtained,
and give evidence of an interesting dimensional crossover between two and one
dimensions.
