We give a very brief overview of collective effects in neutrino oscillations
in core collapse supernovae where refractive effects of neutrinos on themselves
can considerably modify flavor oscillations, with possible repercussions for
future supernova neutrino detection. We discuss synchronized and bipolar
oscillations, the role of energy and angular neutrino modes, as well as
three-flavor effects. We close with a short summary and some open questions.
