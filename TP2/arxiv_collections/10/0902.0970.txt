A phylogenetic birth-and-death model is a probabilistic graphical model for a
so-called phylogenetic profile, i.e., the size distribution for a homolog gene
family at the terminal nodes of a phylogeny. Profile datasets are used in
bioinformatics analyses for the inference of evolutionary trees, and of
functional associations between gene families, as well as for the
quantification of various processes guiding genome evolution. Here we describe
the mathematical formalism for phylogenetic birth-and-death models. We also
present an algorithm for computing the likelihood in a gain-loss-duplication
model.
