Neutron stars are the most dense objects in the observable Universe and
conventionally one uses nuclear theory to obtain the equation of state (EOS) of
dense hadronic matter and the global properties of these stars. In this work,
we review various aspects of nuclear matter within an effective Chiral model
and interlink fundamental quantities both from nuclear saturation as well as
vacuum properties and correlate it with the star properties.
