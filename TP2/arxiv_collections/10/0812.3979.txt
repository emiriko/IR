Searching for and potential discovery of Higgs boson(s) both within and
beyond the standard model is perhaps the most visible physics goal of the
current Fermilab Tevatron program. In this proceeding, recent results from both
the CDF and D\O experiments based on analyses of datasets with integrated
luminosities between 1.7 and 3.0 fb$^{-1}$ are summarized. The combined
Tevatron cross section upper limits on the production of a standard model Higgs
boson are fast approaching the expected standard model values for a wide mass
range. Particularly, the Tevatron has now excluded a standard model Higgs boson
with a mass of 170 GeV at 95% C.L.
