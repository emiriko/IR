The nearby high-mass star binary system Theta 1 Orionis C is the brightest
and most massive of the Trapezium OB stars at the core of the Orion Nebula
Cluster, and it represents a perfect laboratory to determine the fundamental
parameters of young hot stars and to constrain the distance of the Orion
Trapezium Cluster. Between January 2007 and March 2008, we observed T1OriC with
VLTI/AMBER near-infrared (H- and K-band) long-baseline interferometry, as well
as with bispectrum speckle interferometry with the ESO 3.6m and the BTA 6m
telescopes (B'- and V'-band). Combining AMBER data taken with three different
3-telescope array configurations, we reconstructed the first VLTI/AMBER
closure-phase aperture synthesis image, showing the T1OriC system with a
resolution of approx. 2 mas. To extract the astrometric data from our
spectrally dispersed AMBER data, we employed a new algorithm, which fits the
wavelength-differential visibility and closure phase modulations along the H-
and K-band and is insensitive to calibration errors induced, for instance, by
changing atmospheric conditions. Our new astrometric measurements show that the
companion has nearly completed one orbital revolution since its discovery in
1997. The derived orbital elements imply a short-period (P=11.3 yrs) and
high-eccentricity orbit (e=0.6) with periastron passage around 2002.6. The new
orbit is consistent with recently published radial velocity measurements, from
which we can also derive the first direct constraints on the mass ratio of the
binary components. We employ various methods to derive the system mass
(M_system=44+/-7 M_sun) and the dynamical distance (d=410+/-20 pc), which is in
remarkably good agreement with recently published trigonometric parallax
measurements obtained with radio interferometry.
