The semiclassical path integral method has been applied for studying spin
relaxation in a narrow 2D strip with the Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our
numerical calculations show a good agreement with the experimental data,
although some features of experimental results are not clear yet. We also
calculated the relaxation of a uniform spin-density distribution in the
ballistic regime of very narrow wires. With the decreasing wire width, the spin
polarization exhibits a transition from the exponential decay to the
oscillatory Bessel-like relaxation. The SPI method has been also employed to
calculate the relaxation of the particularly long-lived helix mode. A good
agreement has been found with calculations based on the diffusion theory.
