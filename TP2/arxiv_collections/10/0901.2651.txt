Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) with AlOx barrier were fabricated by a
deposition tool called Biased Target Ion Beam Deposition (BTIBD) using low
energy ion source (0-50 eV) and voltage biased targets. The BTIBD system
applies bias voltage directly and only on the desired targets, providing enough
sputtering energy and avoiding "overspill" contamination during film
deposition. The successful deposition of AlOx-MTJs demonstrated the capability
of BTIBD to make multilayer structures with good film quality. MTJ thin film
surface roughness and intermixing between layers are among the key problems
leading to low TMR performance. Here by studying the bias voltage effect on MTJ
properties via the measurement of Neel coupling field and TMR, we suggest that
the lower bias voltage reduces the intermixing that occurs when top CoFe free
layer is deposited on AlOx barrier, but produces relatively high surface
roughness. On the other hand, higher energy deposition enhances both interlayer
mixing and surface flattening. Such understanding of bias voltage effects on
film properties could be used to optimize the MTJ performances.
