Cosmological simulations of dark matter structures have shown that the
equilibrated dark matter structures have a fairly small angular momentum. It
appears from these N-body simulations that the radial profile of the angular
momentum has an almost universal behavior, even if the different dark matter
structures have experienced very different formation and merger histories. We
suggest a perturbed Jeans equation, which includes a rotational term. This is
done under a reasonable assumed form of the change in the distribution
function. By conjecturing that the (new) subdominant rotation term must be
proportional to the (old) dominant mass term, we find a clear connection, which
is in rather good agreement with the results of recent high resolution
simulations. We also present a new connection between the radial profiles of
the angular momentum and the velocity anisotropy, which is also in fair
agreement with numerical findings. Finally we show how the spin parameter
$\lambda$ increases as a function of radius.
