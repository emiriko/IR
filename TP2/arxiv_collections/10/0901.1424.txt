Based on Takahashi-Umezawa thermo field dynamics and the order-invariance of
Weyl ordered operators under similar transformations, we present a new approach
to deriving the exact Wigner functions of thermo number state, photon
subtracted and added thermo vacuum state. We find that these Wigner functions
are related to the Gaussian-Laguerre type functions of temperature, whose
statistical properties are then analysed.
