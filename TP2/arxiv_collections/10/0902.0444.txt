A package for pattern recognition and PID by COMPASS RICH-1 has been
developed and used for the analysis of COMPASS data collected in the years 2002
to 2004, and 2006-2007 with the upgraded RICH-1 photon detectors. It has
allowed the full characterization of the detector in the starting version and
in the upgraded one, as well as the PID for physics results. We report about
the package structure and algorithms, and the detector characterization and PID
results.
