We carry out a detailed numerical study of the three-band Hubbard model in
the underdoped region both in the hole- as well as in the electron-doped case
by means of the variational cluster approach. Both the phase diagram and the
low-energy single-particle spectrum are very similar to recent results for the
single-band Hubbard model with next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. In particular,
we obtain a mixed antiferromagnetic+superconducting phase at low doping with a
first-order transition to a pure superconducting phase accompanied by phase
separation. In the single-particle spectrum a clear Zhang-Rice singlet band
with an incoherent and a coherent part can be seen, in which holes enter upon
doping around $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$. The latter is very similar to the coherent
quasi-particle band crossing the Fermi surface in the single-band model. Doped
electrons go instead into the upper Hubbard band, first filling the regions of
the Brillouin zone around $(\pi,0)$. This fact can be related to the enhanced
robustness of the antiferromagnetic phase as a function of electron doping
compared to hole doping.
