The paper addresses the construction of the Standard Model with massive
fermions without introduction of the Yukawa interaction between Higgs bosons
and fermions. With such approach, Higgs bosons are responsible only for the
gauge invariance of the theory's boson sector and interact only with gauge
bosons W+-, Z, gluons and photons.
