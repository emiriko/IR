Plasma-boundaries floating in an ionized gas are usually negatively charged.
They accumulate electrons more efficiently than ions which leads to the
formation of a quasi-stationary electron film at the boundaries. We propose, in
a colloquial manner, a physisorption-inspired quantum-kinetic description of
the build-up of surface charges at inert plasma boundaries and calculate the
electron sticking coefficient and the electron desorption time, which play an
important role in determining the quasi-stationary surface charge, and about
which little is empirically and theoretically known, from a microscopic model
for the electron-wall interaction. In an exploratory calculation we
specifically consider a metallic boundary. But thereby we identify quite
generally what we believe are the key issues of the electronic microphysics at
inert plasma boundaries in the hope to inspire other groups to join us on our
journey.
