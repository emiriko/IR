We compute the full O(alpha_s) supersymmetric (SUSY) QCD corrections for
neutralino annihilation into massive quarks through gauge or Higgs bosons and
squarks in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), including the
known resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms. The numerical impact of
the corrections on the extraction of SUSY mass parameters from cosmological
data is analyzed for gravity-mediated SUSY breaking scenarios and shown to be
sizable, so that these corrections must be included in common analysis tools.
