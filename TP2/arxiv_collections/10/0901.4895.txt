The Standard Model predicts the value of the Higgs self-coupling but it
cannot be measured at LHC. This measurement requires a machine such as the
proposed International Linear Collider. Here, the sensitivity to the Higgs
self-coupling is evaluated using the ZHH to six jets channel for a Higgs mass
of 120GeV/c^{2}. Full simulation has been carried out for an integrated
luminosity of 500fb^{-1}. Several analyses are presented and all evaluate the
cross section resolution to be about 180% . Potential areas for improvement are
identified.
