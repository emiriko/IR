We have developed a sophisticated statistical model for predicting the
hitting performance of Major League baseball players. The Bayesian paradigm
provides a principled method for balancing past performance with crucial
covariates, such as player age and position. We share information across time
and across players by using mixture distributions to control shrinkage for
improved accuracy. We compare the performance of our model to current
sabermetric methods on a held-out season (2006), and discuss both successes and
limitations.
