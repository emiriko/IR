We investigate the interplay between crossed channel final state interactions
and the constraints from two--particle unitarity for the reactions J/psi->V pi
pi and VK\bar K, where V is either omega or phi. Using a model where the
parameters are largely constrained by other sources, we find that, although
small, crossed channel final state interaction can influence the amplitudes
considerably, in special areas of phase space. These results cast doubt on the
inapplicability of unitarity constraints on production amplitudes as recently
claimed in the literature.
