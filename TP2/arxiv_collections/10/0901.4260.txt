During the past ten years, the predictions of the cannonball (CB) model of
gamma ray bursts (GRBs) were repeatedly confronted with the mounting data from
space- and ground-based observations of GRBs and their afterglows (AGs). The
two underlying radiation mechanisms of the model, inverse Compton scattering
(ICS) and synchrotron radiation (SR), provided an accurate description of the
prompt and afterglow emission in all of the many well-sampled GRBs that were
studied. Simple as they are, these two mechanisms and the burst environment
were shown to generate the observed rich structure of the GRB light-curves at
all observed frequencies and times.
