We find explicit models for the PSL(2,C)- and SL(2,C)-character varieties of
the fundamental groups of complements in S^3 of an infinite family of
two-bridge knots that contains the twist knots. We compute the genus of the
components of these character varieties, and deduce upper bounds on the degree
of the associated trace fields. We also show that these knot complements are
fibered if and only if they are commensurable to a fibered knot complement in a
Z/2Z-homology sphere, resolving a conjecture of Hoste and Shanahan.
