We present the results of a Suzaku monitoring campaign of the Seyfert 2
galaxy, NGC7582. The source is characterized by very rapid (on timescales even
lower than a day) changes of the column density of an inner absorber, together
with the presence of constant components arising as reprocessing from a
Compton-thick material. The best fitting scenario implies important
modifications to the zeroth order view of Unified Models. While the existence
of a pc-scale torus is needed in order to produce a constant Compton reflection
component and an iron K$\alpha$ emission line, in this Seyfert 2 galaxy this is
not viewed along the line of sight. On the other hand, the absorption of the
primary continuum is due to another material, much closer to the BH, roughly at
the distance of the BLR, which can produce the observed rapid spectral
variability. On top of that, the constant presence of a $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$
column density can be ascribed to the presence of a dust lane, extended on a
galactic scale, as previously confirmed by Chandra. There is now mounting
evidence that complexity in the obscuration of AGN may be the rule rather than
the exception. We therefore propose to modify the Unification Model, adding to
the torus the presence of two further absorbers/emitters. Their combination
along the line of sight can reproduce all the observed phenomenology.
