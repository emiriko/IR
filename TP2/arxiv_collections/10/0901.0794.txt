In a recent paper, the authors have constructed a large class of operators in
the Cowen-Douglas class Cowen-Douglas class of the unit disc $\mathbb D$ which
are {\em homogeneous} with respect to the action of the group M\"{o}b -- the
M\"{o}bius group consisting of bi-holomorphic automorphisms of the unit disc
$\mathbb{D}$. The {\em associated representation} for each of these operators
is {\em multiplicity free}. Here we give a different independent construction
of all homogeneous operators in the Cowen-Douglas class with multiplicity free
associated representation and verify that they are exactly the examples
constructed previously.
