We present a calculation of the two-photon and two-gluon widths for the equal
mass quarkonium states $^1S_0$, $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$ of the charmonium and
upsilon systems. The approach taken is based on using the full relativistic
$q\bar{q}\to\ga\ga$ amplitude together with a wave function derived from the
instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation. Momentum space radial wave functions
obtained from an earlier fit of the charmonium and upsilon spectra are used to
evaluate the necessary integrals.
