ALE and Taub-NUT (or ALF) hyper-Kahler four-manifolds can be naturally
constructed as hyper-Kahler quotients. In the ALE case, this construction has
long been understood in terms of D-branes; here we give a D-brane derivation in
the Taub-NUT case. Likewise, instantons on ALE spaces and on Taub-NUT spaces
have ADHM-like constructions related to hyper-Kahler quotients. Here we refine
the analysis in the Taub-NUT case by making use of a D-brane probe, and give an
application to M-theory.
