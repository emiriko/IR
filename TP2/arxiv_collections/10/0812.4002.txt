We stduy radial Dunkl processes associated with dihedral systems: we derive
the semi group, the generalized Bessel function, the Dunkl-Hermite polynomials.
Then we give a skew product decomposition by means of independent Bessel
processes and we compute the tail distribution of the first hitting time of the
boundary of Weyl chamber.
