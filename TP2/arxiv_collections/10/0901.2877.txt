An approach to stabilization of control systems with ultimately wide ranges
of uncertainly disturbed parameters is offered. The method relies on using of
nonlinear structurally stable functions from catastrophe theory as controllers.
Analytical part presents an analysis of designed nonlinear second-order control
systems. As more important the integrators in series, canonical controllable
form and Jordan forms are considered. The analysis resumes that due to added
controllers systems become stable and insensitive to any disturbance of
parameters. Experimental part presents MATLAB simulation of design of possible
control systems on the examples of epidemic spread, angular motion of aircraft
and submarine depth. The results of simulation confirm the efficiency of
offered method of design.
