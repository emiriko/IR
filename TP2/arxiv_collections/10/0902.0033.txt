By applying a magnetic field whose Zeeman energy exceeds the Kondo energy by
an order of magnitude the ground state of the Friedel-Anderson impurity is a
magnetic state. In recent years the author introduced the Friedel Artificially
Inserted Resonance (FAIR) method to investigate impurity properties. Within
this FAIR approach the magnetic ground state is derived. Its full excitation
spectrum and the composition of the excitations is calculated and numerically
evaluated. From the excitation spectrum the electron density of states is
calculated. Majority and minority d-resonances are obtained. The width of the
resonances is about twice as wide as the mean field theory predicts. This
broadening is due to the fact that any change of the occupation of the d-state
in one spin band changes the eigenstates in the opposite spin band and causes
transitions in both spin bands. This broadening reduces the height of the
resonance curve and therefore the density of states by a factor of two. This
yields an intuitive understanding for a previous result of the FAIR approach
that the critical value of the Coulomb interaction for the formation of a
magnetic moment is twice as large as the mean field theory predicts.
