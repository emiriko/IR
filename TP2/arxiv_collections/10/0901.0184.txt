We address the issue of the scaling behavior of the nucleon electromagnetic
form factors (FFs). We propose a consistent Lagrangian of the electromagnetic
N\Delta(1232)-interaction possessing all the internal symmetries of the
spin-3/2 baryon resonance, point and gauge invariance. The point and gauge
invariant FFs may exhibit quasi-scaling behavior--while the FFs do not reach
asymptotic scaling domain, the ratios thereof do. The hypothesis of the
quasi-scaling is in good agreement with the experimental data available at Q^2
> 0.4 GeV^2.
