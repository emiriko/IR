In this paper we present two efficient implementations of the diffusion
approximation to be employed in Monte Carlo computations of radiative transfer
in dusty media of massive circumstellar disks. The aim is to improve the
accuracy of the computed temperature structure and to decrease the computation
time. The accuracy, efficiency and applicability of the methods in various
corners of parameter space are investigated. The effects of using these methods
on the vertical structure of the circumstellar disk as obtained from
hydrostatic equilibrium computations are also addressed. Two methods are
presented. First, an energy diffusion approximation is used to improve the
accuracy of the temperature structure in highly obscured regions of the disk,
where photon counts are low. Second, a modified random walk approximation is
employed to decrease the computation time. This modified random walk ensures
that the photons that end up in the high-density regions can quickly escape to
the lower density regions, while the energy deposited by these photons in the
disk is still computed accurately. A new radiative transfer code, MCMax, is
presented in which both these diffusion approximations are implemented. These
can be used simultaneously to increase both computational speed and decrease
statistical noise. We conclude that the diffusion approximations allow for fast
and accurate computations of the temperature structure, vertical disk structure
and observables of very optically thick circumstellar disks.
