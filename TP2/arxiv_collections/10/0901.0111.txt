We present new developments on the Cosmic--Ray driven, galactic dynamo,
modeled by means of direct, resistive CR--MHD simulations, performed with ZEUS
and PIERNIK codes. The dynamo action, leading to the amplification of
large--scale galactic magnetic fields on galactic rotation timescales, appears
as a result of galactic differential rotation, buoyancy of the cosmic ray
component and resistive dissipation of small--scale turbulent magnetic fields.
Our new results include demonstration of the global--galactic dynamo action
driven by Cosmic Rays supplied in supernova remnants. An essential outcome of
the new series of global galactic dynamo models is the equipartition of the gas
turbulent energy with magnetic field energy and cosmic ray energy, in saturated
states of the dynamo on large galactic scales.
