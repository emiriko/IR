A first principle reciprocating quantum refrigerator is investigated with the
purpose of determining the limitations of cooling to absolute zero. We find
that if the energy spectrum of the working medium possesses an uncontrollable
gap, then there is a minimum achievable temperature above zero. The reason is
that such a gap, combined with a negligible amount of noise, prevents adiabatic
following during the expansion stage which is necessary condition for reaching
T_c --> 0.
