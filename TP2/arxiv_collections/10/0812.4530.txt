We report the Bragg spectroscopy of interacting one-dimensional Bose gases
loaded in optical lattices across the superfluid to Mott-insulator phase
transition. Elementary excitations are created with a non-zero momentum and the
response of the correlated 1D gases is in the linear regime. The complexity of
the strongly correlated quantum phases is directly displayed in the spectra
which exhibit novel features. This work paves the way for a precise
characterization of the state of correlated atomic phases in optical lattices.
