We compare different gravitational-wave extraction methods used in
three-dimensional nonlinear simulations against linear simulations of
perturbations of spherical spacetimes with matter. We present results from
fully general-relativistic simulations of a system composed by an oscillating
and non-rotating star emitting gravitational radiation. Results about the onset
of non-linear effects are also shown.
