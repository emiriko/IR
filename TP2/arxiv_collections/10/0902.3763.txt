We investigate the black hole thermodynamics in a "deformed" relativity
framework where the energy-momentum dispersion law is Lorentz-violating and the
Schwarzchild-like metric is momentum-dependent with a Planckian cut-off. We
obtain net deviations of the basic thermodynamical quantities from the
Hawking-Bekenstein predictions: actually, the black hole evaporation is
expected to quit at a nonzero critical mass value (of the order of the Planck
mass), leaving a zero temperature remnant, and avoiding a spacetime
singularity. Quite surprisingly, the present semiclassical corrections to black
hole temperature, entropy, and heat capacity turn out to be identical to the
ones obtained within some quantum approaches.
