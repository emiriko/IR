The Standard Model is in good shape, apart possibly from g_\mu - 2 and some
niggling doubts about the electroweak data. Something like a Higgs boson is
required to provide particle masses, but theorists are actively considering
alternatives. The problems of flavour, unification and quantum gravity will
require physics beyond the Standard Model, and astrophysics and cosmology also
provide reasons to expect physics beyond the Standard Model, in particular to
provide the dark matter and explain the origin of the matter in the Universe.
Personally, I find supersymmetry to be the most attractive option for new
physics at the TeV scale. The LHC should establish the origin of particle
masses has good prospects for discovering dark matter, and might also cast
light on unification and even quantum gravity. Important roles may also be
played by lower-energy experiments, astrophysics and cosmology in the searches
for new physics beyond the Standard Model.
