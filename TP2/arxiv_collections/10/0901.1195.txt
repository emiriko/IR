The thermalization rate of a heavy quark is related to its momentum diffusion
coefficient. Starting from a Kubo relation and using the framework of the heavy
quark effective theory, we argue that in the large-mass limit the momentum
diffusion coefficient can be defined through a certain Euclidean correlation
function, involving color-electric fields along a Polyakov loop. Furthermore,
carrying out a perturbative computation, we demonstrate that the spectral
function corresponding to this correlator is relatively flat at small
frequencies. Therefore, unlike in the case of several other transport
coefficients, for which the narrowness of the transport peak makes analytic
continuation from Euclidean lattice data susceptible to severe systematic
uncertainties, it appears that the determination of the heavy quark
thermalization rate could be relatively well under control.
