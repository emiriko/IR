The modular representation theory of the queer Lie superalgebra q(n) over
characteristic p>2 is developed. We obtain a criterion for the irreducibility
of baby Verma modules with semisimple p-characters and a criterion for the
semisimplicity of the corresponding reduced enveloping algebras. A (2p)-power
divisibility of dimensions of q(n)-modules with nilpotent p-characters is
established. The representation theory of q(2) is treated in detail. We
formulate a Morita super-equivalence conjecture for q(n) with general
p-characters which is verified for n=2.
