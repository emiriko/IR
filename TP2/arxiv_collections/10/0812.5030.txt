Alexandrov's Theorem states that every metric with the global topology and
local geometry required of a convex polyhedron is in fact the intrinsic metric
of a unique convex polyhedron. Recent work by Bobenko and Izmestiev describes a
differential equation whose solution leads to the polyhedron corresponding to a
given metric. We describe an algorithm based on this differential equation to
compute the polyhedron to arbitrary precision given the metric, and prove a
pseudopolynomial bound on its running time. Along the way, we develop
pseudopolynomial algorithms for computing shortest paths and weighted Delaunay
triangulations on a polyhedral surface, even when the surface edges are not
shortest paths.
