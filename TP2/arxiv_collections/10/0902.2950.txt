We calculate the total energy deposited into the medium per unit length by
fast partons traversing a quark-gluon plasma. The medium excitation due to
collisions is taken to be given by the well known expression for the
collisional drag force. The radiative energy loss of the parton contributes to
the energy deposition because each radiated gluon acts as an additional source
of collisional energy loss in the medium. We derive a differential equation
which governs how the spectrum of radiated gluons is modified when this energy
loss is taken into account. This modified spectrum is then used to calculate
the additional energy deposition due to the interactions of radiated gluons
with the medium. Numerical results are presented for the medium response for
the case of two energetic back-to-back partons created in a hard interaction.
