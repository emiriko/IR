We generate a 200-nm optical frequency comb at 1.5 microns by injecting two
single-frequency lasers into a highly nonlinear fiber, and explore its spectral
phase properties and high power to demonstrate full nonlinear conversion into
its second harmonic. Combs of optical frequencies with 100-nm (~ 48 THz)
bandwidths, centered at 790-800 nm and spaced by 0.8-1 nm (380-470 GHz) were
produced by second harmonic and multiple sum frequency generation simply by
focusing into a 2-mm long nonlinear crystal. Conventional birefringence phase
matching was used in normal incidence configuration without tilting the
crystal.
