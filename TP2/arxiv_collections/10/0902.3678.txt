(LaNiO3)n/(SrMnO3)2 superlattices were grown using ozone-assisted molecular
beam epitaxy. In situ reflection high energy electron diffraction and x-ray
scattering has been used to characterize the structural properties of the
superlattices, which are strained to the SrTiO3 substrates. The superlattices
exhibit excellent crystallinity and interfacial roughness of less than one unit
cell. A metal-insulator transition is observed as $n$ is decreased from 4 to 1.
Analysis of the transport data suggests an evolution from gapped insulator
(n=1) to hopping conductor (n=2) to metal (n=4) with increasing LaNiO3
concentration.
