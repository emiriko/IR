We determine the global star formation rate density at 0.7<z<1.9 using
emission-line selected galaxies identified in Hubble Space Telescope Near
Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrograph (HST-NICMOS) grism spectroscopy
observations. Observing in pure parallel mode throughout HST Cycles 12 and 13,
our survey covers ~104 arcmin2 from which we select 80 galaxies with likely
redshifted Ha emission lines. In several cases, a somewhat weaker [OIII]
doublet emission is also detected. The Ha luminosity range of the emission-line
galaxy sample is 4.4 x 10^41 < L(Ha) < 1.5 x 10^43 erg/s. In this range, the
luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with phi* =
(4.24\pm3.55) x 10^-3 Mpc^-3, L* = (2.88\pm1.58) x 10^42 erg/s, and alpha =
-1.39\pm0.43. We derive a volume-averaged star formation rate density of
0.138\pm0.058 Msun/yr/Mpc3 at z=1.4 without an extinction correction.
Subdividing the redshift range, we find star formation rate densities of
0.088\pm0.056 Msun/yr/Mpc3 at z=1.1 and 0.265\pm0.174 Msun/yr/Mpc3 at z=1.6.
The overall star formation rate density is consistent with previous studies
using Ha when the same average extinction correction is applied, confirming
that the cosmic peak of star formation occurs at z>1.5.
