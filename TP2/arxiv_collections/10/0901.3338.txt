The structural and electrical characterizations of mechanically-milled (MM)
amorphous fast ionic conductors (a-FICs), viz. xAgI (100-x)[0.67 Ag\_2
O-0.33V\_2O\_5] (x = 40, 50, 55 and 70) have been reported. The amorphisation
is restricted only to the compositions which are well within the glass forming
region and all samples are found to be highly agglomerated and X-ray amorphous
in nature. The frequency dependent ac conductivity, \sigma'(\omega), of the
amorphous samples investigated in the frequency range 5Hz -13 MHz and
temperature range 100- 350 K shows a dc conductivity regime at low frequencies
and a dispersive regime at higher frequencies. The spectra can be described by
the Jonscher power law (JPL), \simga'(\omega) = \sigma\_dc +A(T) \omega\_n.
However, the values \sigma\_dc (T) and A(T) both show two distinct Arrhenius
regions and n (< 1) is found to be temperature dependent, i.e., decreasing with
increasing temperature.
