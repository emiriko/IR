In this note we first set up an analogy between spin and vorticity of a
perfect 2d-fluid flow, based on the Borel-Weil contruction of the irreducible
unitary representations of SU(2), and looking at the Madelung-Bohm velocity
attached to the ensuing spin wave functions. We also show that, in the
framework of finite dimensional geometric quantum mechanics, the Schr\"odinger
velocity field on projective Hilbert space is divergence-free (being Killing
with respect to the Fubini-Study metric) and fulfils the stationary Euler
equation, with pressure proportional to the Hamiltonian uncertainty (squared).
We explicitly compute the pressure gradient of this "Schr\"odinger fluid" and
determine its critical points. Its vorticity is also calculated and shown to
depend on the spacings of the energy levels. These results follow from
hydrodynamical properties of Killing vector fields valid in any (finite
dimensional) Riemannian manifold, of possible independent interest.
