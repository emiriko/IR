Direct nuclear reactions $\vec{d}+A$ and $\vec{p}+(An)$ are described in the
framework of three-body Faddeev-type equations. Differential cross section and
analyzing powers are calculated using several optical potential models and
compared with the experimental data. Quite satisfactory agreement is found
except for few systematic discrepancies.
