We investigate the structural parameters, i.e. bond lengths and bond angles
of chiral tubes of various chiralities. The procedure used is based on helical
and rotational symmetries and Tersoff potential. The results indicate that at
ambient condition, there are equal bond lengths and three unequal bond angles
in the structure of chiral tubes. The bond length depends much more on the
chirality and very slightly on the tube radius. Length of the tubes does not
play very significant role on bond length and bond angles. These C-C bonds were
recalculated under hydrostatic pressure. The bond length compresses with
pressure while the bond angles remain practically unchanged. We also carry out
analysis regarding the cross sectional shape of chiral tubes and its pressure
dependence. It is found that at some pressures, transition from circular to
oval cross section takes place. The transition pressure is found to strongly
depend on the radius and chirality of tube. At this transition, corresponding
to given elliptical cross section, the bond length for all chiral tubes is
identical. This behavior of bond length is different from achiral tubes.
