In this work the preseismic "strange attractor like" precursor is studied, in
the domain of the Earth's oscillating electric field for T = 6 months. It is
assumed that the specific oscillating electric field is generated by the
corresponding lithospheric oscillation, triggered by the Ssa tidal wave of the
same wave length (6 months) under excess strain load conditions met in the
focal area of a future large earthquake. The analysis of the recorded Earth's
oscillating electric field by the two distant monitoring sites of PYR and HIO
and for a period of time of 26 months (October 1st, 2006 - December 2nd, 2008)
suggests that the specific precursor can successfully resolve the predictive
time window in terms of months and for a "swarm" of large EQs (Ms > 6.0R), in
contrast to the resolution obtained by the use of electric fields of shorter (T
= 1, 14 days, single EQ identification) wave length. More over, the fractal
character of the "strange attractor like" precursor in the frequency domain is
pointed out. Finally, a proposal is made that concerns the continuous
monitoring of the specific preseismic attractor in distinct different wave
lengths of the oscillating Earth's electric field so that an early warning
system can be utilized. As a refinement of the "strange attractor like"
methodology, the guide lines of a generalized inversion scheme are presented so
that the epicenter of the driving mechanism (seismic epicentral area) can be
estimated in a least squares sense.
