We use the semi-classical (Doppler shift) approximation to calculate magnetic
field angle-dependent density of states and thermal conductivity kappa_zz for a
superconductor with a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface and line nodes along
k_x=0 and k_y=0. The results are shown to be in good quantitative agreement
with experimental results obtained for YNi2B2C.
