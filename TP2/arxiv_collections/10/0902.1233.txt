We put forward a strategy to achieve synthetic nonlinearities where local and
nonlocal contributions compete on similar footing, thus yielding intermediate
tunable responses ranging from fully local to strongly nonlocal. The physical
setting addressed is a semiconductor material with both Kerr and thermal
nonlinearities illuminated by a pulse train with suitable single-pulse width
and repetition rate. We illustrate the potential of the scheme by showing that
it supports soliton properties that are not accessible in either limit of
purely local or purely nonlocal media.
