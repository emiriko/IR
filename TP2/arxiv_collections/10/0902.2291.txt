Let n be a positive integer and let p be a prime. Suppose that we take a
partition of n, and obtain another partition by moving a node from one row to a
shorther row. Carter and Payne showed that if the p-residue of the removed and
added positions is the same, then there is a non-zero homomorphism between the
corresponding Specht modules for the symmetric group of degree n, defined over
a field of characteristic p. In this paper we give a very simple description of
such a homomorphism, as a map between polytabloids, using the action of a
Murphy-Jucys element.
  We also present a proof that in this context the homomorphism space is
1-dimensional. S. Lyle has already proved the more general result for
Iwahori-Hecke algebras. In the process we give a formula for the Carter-Payne
homomorphism as a linear combination of semi-standard homomorphisms. Our
methods allow us to compute a lower bound for where the image of this
homomorphism lies in the Jantzen filtration of the codomain Specht module.
  As an application, we show that the endomorphism ring of the restriction of a
Specht module to the symmetric group of degree n-1 is an explicit direct
product of truncated polynomial rings. A. Kleshchev proved the analogous result
for the restriction of irreducible modules.
