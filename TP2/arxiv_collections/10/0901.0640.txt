A new solution of the Einstein equations for the point mass immersed in the
de Sitter Universe is presented. The properties of the metric are very
different from both the Schwarzschild black hole and the de Sitter Universe: it
is everywhere smooth, light can propagate outward through the horizon, there is
an antitrapped surface enclosing the point mass and there is necessarily an
initial singularity. The solution for any positive cosmological constant is
qualitatively different from the Schwarzschild solution and is not its
continuous deformation.
