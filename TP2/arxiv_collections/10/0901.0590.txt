We show how using a special relativistic kinetic equation with a BGK- like
collision operator the ensuing expression for the heat flux can be casted in
the form required by Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics. Indeed, it is
linearly related to the temperature and number density gradients and not to the
acceleration as the so-called "first order in the gradients theories" contend.
Here we calculate explicitly the ensuing transport coefficients and compare
them with the results obtained by other authors.
