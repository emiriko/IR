We discuss the existence of stable topological quantum memory at finite
temperature. At stake here is the fundamental question of whether it is, in
principle, possible to store quantum information for macroscopic times without
the intervention from the external world, that is, without error correction. We
study the toric code in two dimensions with an additional bosonic field that
couples to the defects, in the presence of a generic environment at finite
temperature: the toric-boson model. Although the coupling constants for the
bare model are not finite in the thermodynamic limit, the model has a finite
spectrum. We show that in the topological phase, there is a finite temperature
below which open strings are confined and therefore the lifetime of the memory
can be made arbitrarily (polynomially) long in system size. The interaction
with the bosonic field yields a long-range attractive force between the end
points of open strings but leaves closed strings and topological order intact.
