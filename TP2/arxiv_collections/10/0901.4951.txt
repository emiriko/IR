A perturbation theory for the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation (NLSE) in 1D on
a lattice was developed. The small parameter is the strength of the
nonlinearity. For this purpose secular terms were removed and a probabilistic
bound on small denominators was developed. It was shown that the number of
terms grows exponentially with the order. The results of the perturbation
theory are compared with numerical calculations. An estimate on the remainder
is obtained and it is demonstrated that the series is asymptotic.
