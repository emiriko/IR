We investigate the quantum-state transfer on spin-chian channels with random
imperfections.Through combining the advantages of two known schemes, the
dual-rail spin-chain channels[9] and the particular ihhomogenous spin-chain
channel[10], we propose a protocol that can avoid the quantum noises introduced
by many unnecessary measurements and can enhance the anti-decoherence ability.
The results show that our protocol is more efficient to transfer an arbitrary
quantum state than the original one. In particular, we discuss the effects of
couplings fluctuations and imperfect initialization on both of the improved
scheme and original one.
