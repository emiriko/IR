We develop a Monte-Carlo technique based on L.B. Lucy's indivisible photon
packets method to calculate X-ray continuum spectra of comptonized thermal
plasma in arbitrary geometry and apply it to describe the broadband X-ray
continuum of the galactic superaccreting microquasar SS433 observed by
INTEGRAL. A physical model of the X-ray emitting region is proposed that
includes thermal emission from the accretion disk, jets and hot corona where
the photons of different origin are comptonized. From comparison with INTEGRAL
observations, we estimate physical parameters of the complex X-ray emitting
region in SS433 and present model spectra for different viewing angles of the
object.
