We consider a spinor condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms in F=1 hyperfine state
confined in an optical dipole trap. Putting initially all atoms in $m_F=0$
component we find that the system evolves towards a state of thermal
equilibrium with kinetic energy equally distributed among all magnetic
components. We show that this process is dominated by the dipolar interaction
of magnetic spins rather than spin mixing contact potential. Our results show
that because of a dynamical separation of magnetic components the spin mixing
dynamics in $^{87}$Rb condensate is governed by dipolar interaction which plays
no role in a single component rubidium system in a magnetic trap.
