The observed X-ray source temperature distributions in OB stellar winds, as
determined from high energy resolution Chandra observations, show that the
highest temperatures occur near the star, and then steadily decrease outward
through the wind. To explain this unexpected behavior, we propose a shock model
concept that utilizes a well-known magnetic propulsion mechanism; the surface
ejection of "diamagnetic plasmoids" into a diverging external magnetic field.
This produces rapidly accelerating self-contained structures that plow through
an ambient wind and form bow shocks that generate a range in X-ray temperatures
determined by the plasmoid-wind relative velocities. The model free parameters
are the plasmoid initial Alfven speed, the initial plasma-beta of the external
medium, and the divergence rate of the external field. These are determined by
fitting the predicted bow shock temperatures with the observed OB supergiant
X-ray temperature distribution. We find that the initial external plasma-beta
has a range between 0 and 2, and the assumed radially-decreasing external
magnetic field strength that scales as r^{-S} has a value of S lying between 2
and 3. Most importantly, the initial plasmoid Alfven speed is found to be
well-constrained at a value of 0.6 times the terminal velocity, which appears
to represent an upper limit for all normal OB stars. This intriguing new limit
on OB magnetic properties, as derived from Chandra observations, emphasizes the
need for further studies of magnetic propulsion mechanisms in these stars.
