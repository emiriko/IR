The methods of lattice gauge theory may be applied to gauge theories besides
QCD, in fact to any gauge group and any representation of matter fields (as
long as the coupling is not chiral). Such theories are useful for model
building beyond the Standard Model, for instance in technicolor models. We have
carried out Monte Carlo simulations of the SU(3) gauge theory with color sextet
fermions. Our result for its discrete beta function indicate an infrared fixed
point that makes the theory conformal rather than confining. The lattice
theory's phase diagram shows no separation of chiral and confinement scales,
measured when the quark mass is nonzero.
