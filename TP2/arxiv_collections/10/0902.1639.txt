The profiles of local density of states (LDOS) around different vortex
configurations in mesoscopic superconductors are studied taking account of the
interference of quasiparticle waves experiencing Andreev reflection within the
vortex cores and normal reflection at the boundaries or defects. For subgap
energy levels these interference effects reveal themselves in a nontrivial
dependence of the positions of the LDOS peaks on the intervortex distance and
sample size: the peak positions generally do not coincide with the
superconducting phase singularity points. The LDOS profiles are calculated for
three generic examples: (i) vortex-vortex pair; (ii) vortex positioned near a
flat boundary; (iii) vortex positioned in the center of a superconducting disk.
The resulting evolution of the Andreev interference patterns could be
observable by scanning tunneling spectroscopy techniques.
