We present the design of a quantum carry-lookahead adder using
measurement-based quantum computation. The quantum carry-lookahead adder (QCLA)
is faster than a quantum ripple-carry adder; QCLA has logarithmic depth while
ripple adders have linear depth. Our design is evaluated in terms of number of
time steps and the total number of qubits used.
