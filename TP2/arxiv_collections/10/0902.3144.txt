We show that the stochastic background of gravitational waves, produced in
the early cosmological epochs, strictly depends on the assumed theory of
gravity. In particular, the specific form of the function f(R), where R is the
Ricci scalar, is related to the evolution and the production mechanism of
gravitational waves. Using a neural network algorithm which only requires
non-Gaussian nature and independence of the input signals we conclude that, in
order to detect a CSB signal, the interferometric sensitivity of detector like
VIRGO will be improved.
