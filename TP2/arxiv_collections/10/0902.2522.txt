To prevent the loss of K in growing single crystals of Ba1-x Kx Fe2 As2 we
developed a rapid heating Sn-flux method. Large single crystals with the
optimal superconducting transition temperature TC about 38K were obtained and
their structural, chemical and superconducting properties were investigated.
Additionally, the effect of post growth annealing at different temperatures
were also examined on these crystals. Scanning electron microscopy microprobe
studies on a samples with the composition goal of Ba.25 K.75 Fe2 As2 revealed a
sharp separation of two phases with compositions that are suggestive rational
ratios of the K and Ba content.
