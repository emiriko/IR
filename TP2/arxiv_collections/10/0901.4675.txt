The results of a development of a scintillator counter with wavelength
shifting (WLS) fibre and a multi-pixel Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode readout
are presented. The photodiode has a metal-resistor-semiconductor layered
structure and operates in the limited Geiger mode. The scintillator counter has
been developed for the EMMA underground cosmic ray experiment.
