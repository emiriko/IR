We investigate a model in which an ensemble of chemically identical Brownian
particles are continuously growing by condensation and at the same time undergo
irreversible aggregation whenever two particles come into contact upon
collision. We solved the model exactly by using scaling theory for the case
whereby a particle, say of size $x$, grows by an amount $\alpha x$ over the
time it takes to collide with another particle of any size. It is shown that
the particle size spectra of such system exhibit transition to dynamic scaling
$c(x,t)\sim t^{-\beta}\phi(x/t^z)$ accompanied by the emergence of fractal of
dimension $d_f={{1}\over{1+2\alpha}}$. One of the remarkable feature of this
model is that it is governed by a non-trivial conservation law, namely, the
$d_f^{th}$ moment of $c(x,t)$ is time invariant regardless of the choice of the
initial conditions. The reason why it remains conserved is explained by using a
simple dimensional analysis. We show that the scaling exponents $\beta$ and $z$
are locked with the fractal dimension $d_f$ via a generalized scaling relation
$\beta=(1+d_f)z$.
