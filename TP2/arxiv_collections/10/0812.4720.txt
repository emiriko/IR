By considering the eigenratio of the Laplacian of the connection graph as
synchronizability measure, we propose a procedure for weighting dynamical
networks to enhance theirsynchronizability. The method is based on node and
edge betweenness centrality measures and is tested on artificially const ructed
scale-free, Watts-Strogatz and random networks as well as on some real-world
graphs. It is also numerically shown that the same procedure could be used to
enhance the phase synchronizability of networks of nonidentical oscillators.
