We investigate light scalar mesons and glueballs in the $Dp-Dq$ hard-wall
models, including $D3-Dq$, $D4-Dq$, and $D6-Dq$ systems. It is found that only
in the $D4-D6$ and $D4-D8$ hard wall models, the predicted masses of the ${\bar
q} q$ scalar meson $f_0$, scalar glueball are consistent with their
experimental or lattice results. This indicates that $D4-D6$ and $D4-D8$
hard-wall models are favorite candidates of the realistic holographic QCD
model.
