A new formula for elastic bending modulus of monolayer graphene is derived
analytically from an empirical potential for solid-state carbon-carbon bonds.
Two physical origins are identified for the non-vanishing bending modulus of
the atomically thin graphene sheet, one due to the bond angle effect and the
other resulting from the bond order term associated with dihedral angles. The
analytical prediction compares closely with ab initio energy calculations. Pure
bending of graphene monolayers are simulated by a molecular mechanics approach,
showing slight nonlinearity and anisotropy in the tangent bending modulus as
the bending curvature increases. An intrinsic coupling between bending and
in-plane strain is noted for graphene monolayers rolled into carbon nanotubes.
