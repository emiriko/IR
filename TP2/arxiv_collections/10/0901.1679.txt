We address a number of conjectures about the ground state O(1) loop model,
computing in particular two infinite series of partial sums of its entries and
relating them to the enumeration of plane partitions. Our main tool is the use
of integral formulae for a polynomial solution of the quantum
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation.
