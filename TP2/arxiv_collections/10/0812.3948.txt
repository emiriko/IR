We suggest an alternative mathematical model for the electron in which the
dynamical variables are a coframe (field of orthonormal bases) and a density.
The electron mass and external electromagnetic field are incorporated into our
model by means of a Kaluza-Klein extension. Our Lagrangian density is
proportional to axial torsion squared. The advantage of our approach is that it
does not require the use of spinors, Pauli matrices or covariant
differentiation. The only geometric concepts we use are those of a metric,
differential form, wedge product and exterior derivative. We prove that in the
special case with no dependence on the third spatial coordinate our model is
equivalent to the Dirac equation. The crucial element of the proof is the
observation that our Lagrangian admits a factorisation.
