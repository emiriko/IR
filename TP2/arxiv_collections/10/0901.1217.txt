We show that a simple, modified version of the Magnetorotational Instability
(MRI) can develop in the outer liquid core of the Earth, in the presence of a
background shear. It requires either thermal wind, or a primary instability,
such as convection, to drive a weak differential rotation within the core. The
force balance in the Earth's core is very unlike classical astrophysical
applications of the MRI (such as gaseous disks around stars). Here, the weak
differential rotation in the Earth core yields an instability by its
constructive interaction with the planet's much larger rotation rate. The
resulting destabilising mechanism is just strong enough to counteract
stabilizing resistive effects, and produce growth on geophysically interesting
timescales. We give a simple physical explanation of the instability, and show
that it relies on a force balance appropriate to the Earth's core, known as
magnetostrophic balance.
