In this paper, the non-Markovian dissipative dynamics of the phase damped
Jaynes-Cummings model in the presence of a classical homogeneous gravitational
field will be analyzed. The model consists of a moving two-level atom
simultaneously exposed to the gravitational field and a single-mode traveling
radiation field in the presence of a non-Markovian phase damping mechanism.
First, the non-Markovian master equation for the reduced density operator of
the system in terms of a Hamiltonian describing the atom-field interaction in
the presence of a homogeneous gravitational field will be presented. Then, the
super-operator technique will be generalized and an exact solution of the
non-Markovian master equation will be obtained. Assuming that initially the
radiation field is prepared in a Glauber coherent state and the two-level atom
is in the excited state, the non-Markovian effects on the temporal evolution of
collapses and revivals of the atomic population inversion and photon counting
statistics of the radiation field in the presence of both the phase damping and
a homogeneous gravitational field will be investigated.
