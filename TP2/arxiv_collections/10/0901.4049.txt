Recent measurements of processes involving the electroweak bosons, Z and W,
performed at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider are summarized. The large
integrated luminosities collected by both the D0 and CDF Collaborations enable
precise measurements of differential single boson production cross sections,
the determination of the W mass with unprecedented precision, and the
observation of diboson production including ZZ.
