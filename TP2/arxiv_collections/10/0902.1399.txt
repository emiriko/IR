We investigate the Wigner rotation for photons, which governs the change in
the polarization of the photon as it propagates through an arbitrary
gravitational field. We give explicit examples in Schwarzschild spacetime, and
compare with the corresponding flat spacetime results, which by the equivalence
principle, holds locally at each spacetime point. We discuss the implications
of the Wigner rotation for entangled photon states in curved spacetime, and
lastly develop a sufficient condition for special (Fermi-Walker) frames in
which the observer would detect no Wigner rotation.
