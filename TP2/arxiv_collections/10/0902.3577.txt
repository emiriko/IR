This is the users manual of the black-hole event generator BlackMax, which
simulates the experimental signatures of microscopic and Planckian black-hole
production and evolution at proton-proton, proton-antiproton and
electron-positron colliders in the context of brane world models with low-scale
quantum gravity. The generator is based on phenomenologically realistic models
free of serious problems that plague low-scale gravity. It includes all of the
black-hole gray-body factors known to date and incorporates the effects of
black-hole rotation, splitting between the fermions, non-zero brane tension and
black-hole recoil due to Hawking radiation (although not all simultaneously).
