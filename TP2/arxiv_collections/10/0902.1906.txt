The canonical transformation that maps light-cone Yang-Mills theory to a
Lagrangian description of the MHV rules is non-local, consequently the two sets
of fields do not necessarily generate the same S-matrix. By deriving a new
recursion relation for the canonical transformation expansion coefficients, we
find a direct map between these coefficients and tree level light-cone
diagrams. We use this to show that, at least up to one-loop with dimensionally
regularised MHV vertices, the only difference is the omission of the one-loop
amplitudes in which all gluons have positive helicity.
