We study in an effective operator approach how the effects of new physics
from various scenarios that contain an extra $Z'$ neutral gauge boson or doubly
charged scalars, can affect and thus be tested by the precision polarized
M\o{}ller scattering experiments. We give Wilson coefficients for various
classes of generic models, and we deduce constraints on the parameter space of
the relevant coupling constants or mixing angles from the results of the SLAC
E158 experiment where applicable. We give also constraints projected from the
upcoming 1 ppb JLAB experiment. In the scenario where the extra $Z'$ is light
($M_{Z'} \ll M_W$), we obtain further constraints on the parameter space using
the BNL $g-2$ result where it is useful. We find that the BNL deviation from
the Standard Model cannot be attributed to a light extra $Z'$ neutral gauge
boson.
