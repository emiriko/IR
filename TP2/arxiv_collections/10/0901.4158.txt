We investigate the design, fabrication and experimental characterization of
high Quality factor photonic crystal nanobeam cavities in silicon. Using a
five-hole tapered 1D photonic crystal mirror and precise control of the cavity
length, we designed cavities with theoretical Quality factors as high as 14
million. By detecting the cross-polarized resonantly scattered light from a
normally incident laser beam, we measure a Quality factor of nearly 750,000.
The effect of cavity size on mode frequency and Quality factor was simulated
and then verified experimentally.
