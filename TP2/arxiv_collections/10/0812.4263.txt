We consider the critical spin-spin correlation function of the Ashkin-Teller
and Baxter models. By using path-integral techniques in the continuum
description of these models in terms of fermion fields, we show that the
correlation decays with distance with the same critical exponent as the Ising
model. The procedure is straightforwardly extended to take into account the
presence of a line defect. Thus we find that in these altered models the
critical index of the magnetic correlation on the defect coincides with the one
of the defective 2D Ising or Bariev's model.
