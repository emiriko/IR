Establishing the emergence of evolutionary behavior as a defining
characteristic of 'life' is a major step in the Artificial life (ALife)
studies. We present here an abstract formal framework for this aim based upon
the notion of high-level observations made on the ALife model at hand during
its simulations. An observation process is defined as a computable
transformation from the underlying dynamic structure of the model universe to a
tuple consisting of abstract components needed to establish the evolutionary
processes in the model. Starting with defining entities and their evolutionary
relationships observed during the simulations of the model, the framework
prescribes a series of definitions, followed by the axioms (conditions) that
must be met in order to establish the level of evolutionary behavior in the
model. The examples of Cellular Automata based Langton Loops and Lambda
calculus based Algorithmic Chemistry are used to illustrate the framework.
Generic design suggestions for the ALife research are also drawn based upon the
framework design and case study analysis.
