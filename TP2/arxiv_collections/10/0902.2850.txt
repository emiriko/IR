MPFIT is a port to IDL of the non-linear least squares fitting program
MINPACK-1. MPFIT inherits the robustness of the original FORTRAN version of
MINPACK-1, but is optimized for performance and convenience in IDL. In addition
to the main fitting engine, MPFIT, several specialized functions are provided
to fit 1-D curves and 2-D images; 1-D and 2-D peaks; and interactive fitting
from the IDL command line. Several constraints can be applied to model
parameters, including fixed constraints, simple bounding constraints, and
"tying" the value to another parameter. Several data weighting methods are
allowed, and the parameter covariance matrix is computed. Extensive diagnostic
capabilities are available during the fit, via a call-back subroutine, and
after the fit is complete. Several different forms of documentation are
provided, including a tutorial, reference pages, and frequently asked
questions. The package has been translated to C and Python as well. The full
IDL and C packages can be found at http://purl.com/net/mpfit
