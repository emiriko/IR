The Wronskian associates to d linearly independent polynomials of degree at
most n, a non-zero polynomial of degree at most d(n-d). This can be viewed as
giving a flat, finite morphism from the Grassmannian Gr(d,n) to projective
space of the same dimension. In this paper, we study the monodromy groupoid of
this map. When the roots of the Wronskian are real, we show that the monodromy
is combinatorially encoded by Schutzenberger's jeu de taquin; hence we obtain
new geometric interpretations and proofs of a number of results from jeu de
taquin theory, including the Littlewood-Richardson rule.
