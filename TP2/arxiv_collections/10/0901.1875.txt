This paper concerns the propagation of particles through a quenched random
medium. In the one- and two-dimensional models considered, the local dynamics
is given by expanding circle maps and hyperbolic toral automorphisms,
respectively. The particle motion in both models is chaotic and found to
fluctuate about a linear drift. In the proper scaling limit, the cumulative
distribution function of the fluctuations converges to a Gaussian one with
system dependent variance while the density function shows no convergence to
any function. We have verified our analytical results using extreme precision
numerical computations.
