Concentration invariance of cyclic species in the irreversible polymerization
is examined. The simulation shows that the invariance theorem holds in good
approximation for the irreversible process also. The physical soundness of the
underlying simulation equations is confirmed through comparison with the recent
experimental observations carried out by the Nagoya university group.
