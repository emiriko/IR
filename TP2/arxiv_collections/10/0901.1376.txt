Recently Beccattini and Cleymamns have proposed a model to understand the
p-pbar data obtained at RHIC and SPS. We have shown that this model has a much
greater applicability and can very well be used to describe the rapidity
spectra of protons and antiprotons separately measured at the highest energy of
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider i.e., 200 GeV/A by BRAHMS Collaboration. We
have also determined that the contribution of the decay products of the heavier
resonances like delta, lambda etc. actually dominate over the protons
(antiprotons) of pure thermal origin. We have also imposed the criteria of
exact strangeness conservation in each fireball separately. It is shown that it
is possible to explain not only the p-pbar data but the complete set of data
viz. the rapidity distributions of protons, antiprotons and the ratio pbar/p
simultaneously quite well with a single set of model parameters which includes
a single value of the temperature parameter T chosen for all the fireballs. We
have also fitted the Kaon rapidity spectra obtained by BRAHMS collaboration in
the same experiment. This is unlike the previous analyses wherein a varying
temperature has been assumed for the fireballs formed along the rapidity axis.
The chemical potentials are however assumed to be dependent on the fireball
rapidity yfb.
