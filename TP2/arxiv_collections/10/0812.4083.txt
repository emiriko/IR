We report on the criterion for the dynamic transformation of the internal
structure of moving domain walls (DWs) in soft magnetic thin-film nanostripes
above the Walker threshold field, Hw. In order for the process of
transformation from transverse wall (TW) to vortex wall (VW) or antivortex wall
(AVW) occurs, the edge-soliton core of the TW-type DW should grow sufficiently
to the full width at half maximum of the out-of-plane magnetizations of the
core area of the stabilized vortex (or antivortex) by moving inward along the
transverse (width) direction. Upon completion of the nucleation of the vortex
(antivortex) core, the VW (AVW) is stabilized, and then its core accompanies
the gyrotropic motion in a potential well (hill) of a given nanostripe. Field
strengths exceeding the Hw, which is the onset field of DW velocity breakdown,
are not sufficient but necessary conditions for dynamic DW transformation.
