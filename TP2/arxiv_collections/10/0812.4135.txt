In this paper we establish a relation between the spread of infectious
diseases and the dynamics of so called M/G/1 queues with processor sharing. The
in epidemiology well known relation between the spread of epidemics and
branching processes and the in queueing theory well known relation between
M/G/1 queues and birth death processes will be combined to provide a framework
in which results from queueing theory can be used in epidemiology and vice
versa.
  In particular, we consider the number of infectious individuals in a standard
SIR epidemic model at the moment of the first detection of the epidemic, where
infectious individuals are detected at a constant per capita rate. We use a
result from the literature on queueing processes to show that this number of
infectious individuals is geometrically distributed.
