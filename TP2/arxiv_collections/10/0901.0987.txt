Instantons at finite temperature consist of dyons, with their masses
depending on the asymptotic Polyakov loop. It is shown that the suppression of
heavy dyons can explain qualitatively the behavior of the periodic and
antiperiodic chiral condensate and the topological susceptibility above the
phase transition.
