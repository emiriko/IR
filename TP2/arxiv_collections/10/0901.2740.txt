The amplitude and phase of the cosmic ray anisotropy are well established
experimentally between 10^{11} eV and 10^{14} eV. The study of their evolution
into the energy region 10^{14}-10^{16} eV can provide a significant tool for
the understanding of the steepening ("knee") of the primary spectrum. In this
letter we extend the EAS-TOP measurement performed at E_0 around 10^{14} eV, to
higher energies by using the full data set (8 years of data taking). Results
derived at about 10^{14} and 4x10^{14} eV are compared and discussed. Hints of
increasing amplitude and change of phase above 10^{14} eV are reported. The
significance of the observation for the understanding of cosmic ray propagation
is discussed.
