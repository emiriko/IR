Group theoretic methods to construct all N-particle singlet states by
iterative recursion are presented. These techniques are applied to the quantum
correlations of four spin one-half particles in their singlet states.
Multipartite quantized systems can be partitioned, and their observables
grouped and redefined into condensed correlations.
