My talk was dedicated to the memory of Jan Stern. The brief account given
below focuses on the progress achieved in the determination of the $\pi\pi$
S-wave scattering lengths, both experimentally and with light dynamical quarks
on a lattice. In view of the excellent agreement, we can conclude that (a) the
expansion in powers of the two lightest quark masses represents a very
efficient tool for the analysis of the low energy structure of QCD and (b) the
size of the energy gap of QCD is governed by the order parameter of lowest
dimension, the quark condensate.
