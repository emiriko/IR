AGN exhibit complex hard X-ray spectra. Our current understanding is that the
emission is dominated by inverse Compton processes which take place in the
corona above the accretion disk, and that absorption and reflection in a
distant absorber play a major role. These processes can be directly observed
through the shape of the continuum, the Compton reflection hump around 30 keV,
and the iron fluorescence line at 6.4 keV. We demonstrate the capabilities of
Simbol-X to constrain complex models for cases like MCG-05-23-016, NGC 4151,
NGC 2110, and NGC 4051 in short (10 ksec) observations. We compare the
simulations with recent observations on these sources by INTEGRAL, Swift and
Suzaku. Constraining reflection models for AGN with Simbol-X will help us to
get a clear view of the processes and geometry near to the central engine in
AGN, and will give insight to which sources are responsible for the Cosmic
X-ray background at energies above 20 keV.
