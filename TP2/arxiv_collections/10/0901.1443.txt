We present the proceedings of the lectures given at the 2008 Helmholtz
International Summer School Heavy Quark Physics at the Bogoliubov Laboratory of
Theoretical Physics in Dubna. In two lectures we present recent results from
the existing $B$-factories experiments, Belle and BaBar. The discussed topics
include short phenomenological motivation, experimental methods and results on
$B$ meson oscillations, selected rare $B$ meson decays (leptonic, $b\to
s\gamma$ and $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$), mixing and CP violation in the system of
$D^0$ mesons, and leptonic decays of $D_s$ mesons.
