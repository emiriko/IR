Being able to quickly select among gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) seen by the Swift
satellite those which are high-z candidates would give ground-based observers a
better chance to determine a redshift for such distant GRBs. Information about
these high-z GRBs is important in helping to resolve questions about the early
universe such as the formation rate of high-z GRBs, the re-ionization period of
the universe, the metallicity of the early universe, and the Hubble expansion.
Initially using a sample of 51 GRBs with previously measured redshifts, we have
developed high-z screening criteria employing the GRB spectral as well as
temporal characteristics of the prompt emission from the Burst Alert Telescope
(BAT) on Swift. Now that the sample has increased to 81 GRBs, we have revisited
the screening criteria and our methodology. Our updated high-z screening
criteria are presented in this paper.
