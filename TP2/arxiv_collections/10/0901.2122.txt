Combining a recent derivation of the CMB evolution equations for homogeneous
but anisotropic (Bianchi) cosmologies with an account of the full linearized
dynamical freedoms available in such models, I calculate and discuss the
various temperature and polarisation anisotropy patterns which may be formed.
Certain anisotropies can be hidden in superhorizon modes at early times, thus
avoiding any constraints from nucleosynthesis while nevertheless producing
non-trivial redshift-zero temperature patterns in flat and open universes. The
results are likely to be more of pedagogical than observational interest, but
future work will assess whether such patterns can be matched to anomalies in
WMAP results.
