We show that the effective theory of long wavelength low energy behavior of a
dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate(BEC) with large dipole moments (treated as a
classical spin) can be modeled using an extended Non-linear sigma model (NLSM)
like energy functional with an additional non-local term that represents long
ranged anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction. Minimizing this effective energy
functional we calculate the density and spin-profile of the dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensate in the mean-field regime for various trapping
geometries. The resulting configurations show strong intertwining between the
spin and mass density of the condensate, transfer between spin and orbital
angular momentum in the form of Einstein-de Hass effect, and novel topological
properties. We have also described the theoretical framework in which the
collective excitations around these mean field solutions can be studied and
discuss some examples qualitatively.
