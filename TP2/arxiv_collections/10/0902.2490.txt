In this paper we consider tensor perturbations produced at a bounce phase in
presence of the holonomy corrections. Here bounce phase and holonomy
corrections originate from Loop Quantum Cosmology. We re-derive formulas for
the corrections for the model with a scalar field content. Background dynamics
with a free scalar field and multi-fluid potential are considered. Since the
considerations are semi-classical effects of quantum fluctuations of the
background dynamics are not taken into account. Quantum and classical
back-reaction effects are also neglected. To find spectrum of the gravitational
waves both analytical approximations as well as numerical investigations were
performed. We have found analytical solutions on super-horizontal and
sub-horizontal regimes and derived corresponding tensor power spectra. Also
occupation number $n_{\bf k}$ and parameter $\Omega_{\text{gw}}$ were derived
in sub-horizontal limit, leading to its extremely low present value. Final
results are numerical power spectra of the gravitational waves produced in
presence of quantum holonomy corrections. The obtained spectrum has two UV and
IR branches where $\mathcal{P}_T \propto k^2$, however with the different
prefactors. Spectrum connecting these regions is in the form of oscillations.
We have found good agreement between numerical spectrum and this obtained from
the analytical model. Obtained spectrum can be directly applied as initial
conditions for the inflationary modes. We mention possible resulting
observational features of the CMB in particular B-type polarization.
