Numerical results on the translocation of long biopolymers through mid-sized
and wide pores are presented. The simulations are based on a novel methodology
which couples molecular motion to a mesoscopic fluid solvent. Thousands of
events of long polymers (up to 8000 monomers) are monitored as they pass
through nanopores. Comparison between the different pore sizes shows that wide
pores can host a larger number of multiple biopolymer segments, as compared to
smaller pores. The simulations provide clear evidence of folding quantization
in the translocation process as the biopolymers undertake multi-folded
configurations, characterized by a well-defined integer number of folds.
Accordingly, the translocation time is no longer represented by a
single-exponent power law dependence on the length, as it is the case for
single-file translocation through narrow pores. The folding quantization
increases with the biopolymer length, while the rate of translocated beads at
each time step is linearly correlated to the number of resident beads in the
pore. Finally, analysis of the statistics over the translocation work unravels
the importance of the hydrodynamic interactions in the process.
