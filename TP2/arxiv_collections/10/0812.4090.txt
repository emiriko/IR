In order to clarify whether the odd-frequency superconductivity can be
realized or not, we study a quasi-one-dimensional triangular lattice in the
Hubbard model using the random phase approximation (RPA) and the fluctuation
exchange (FLEX) approximation. We find that odd-frequency spin-singlet p-wave
pairing can be enhanced on a quasi-one-dimensional isosceles triangular
lattice.
