We present a unified framework for accelerating edit-distance computation
between two compressible strings using straight-line programs. For two strings
of total length $N$ having straight-line program representations of total size
$n$, we provide an algorithm running in $O(n^{1.4}N^{1.2})$ time for computing
the edit-distance of these two strings under any rational scoring function, and
an $O(n^{1.34}N^{1.34})$ time algorithm for arbitrary scoring functions. This
improves on a recent algorithm of Tiskin that runs in $O(nN^{1.5})$ time, and
works only for rational scoring functions. Also, in the last part of the paper,
we show how the classical four-russians technique can be incorporated into our
SLP edit-distance scheme, giving us a simple $\Omega(\lg N)$ speed-up in the
case of arbitrary scoring functions, for any pair of strings.
