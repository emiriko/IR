n this paper I introduce a new description of the crystal $B(\Lambda_0)$ of
$\hat{\mathfrak{sl}_\ell}$. As in the Misra-Miwa model of $B(\Lambda_0)$, the
nodes of this crystal are indexed by partitions and the $i$-arrows correspond
to adding a box of residue $i$. I then show that the two models are equivalent
by interpreting the operation of regularization introduced by James as a
crystal isomorphism.
