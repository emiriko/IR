Following the recent successful formation and manipulation of entangled
$C^{13}$ atoms on the surface of Diamond we calculate the decoherence of the
electron spin polarization in Diamond via a nonperturbative treatment of the
time-dependent Greens function of the Central-Spin model, describing the phonon
and Hyperfine couplings of the electron to a bath of $C^{13}$ atoms, for
arbitrary initial polarizations, applied field strengths, and for up to eight
entangled $C^{13}$ atoms. We compare these numerical results with the exact
treatment available in the fully initially polarized limit of the non-Markovian
dynamics regime, and comment on the role of dangerously irrelevant scaling in
the meta-stability of $C^{13}$ flip-flop processes.
