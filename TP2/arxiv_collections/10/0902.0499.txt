An efficient finite element method (FEM) for calculating eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of quantum billiard systems is presented. We consider the FEM
based on triangular $C_1$ continuity quartic interpolation. Various shapes of
quantum billiards including an integrable unit circle are treated. The
numerical results show that the applied method provides accurate set of
eigenvalues exceeding a thousand levels for any shape of quantum billiards on a
personal computer. Comparison with the results from the FEM based on well-known
$C_0$ continuity quadratic interpolation proves the efficiency of the method.
