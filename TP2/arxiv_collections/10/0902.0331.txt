A self-consistent calculation of nuclear matrix elements of the neutrinoless
double beta decays (0nbb) of 76Ge, 82Se, 96Zr, 100Mo, 116Cd, 128Te, 130Te and
130Xe is presented in the framework of the renormalized quasiparticle random
phase approximation (RQRPA) and the standard QRPA. The pairing and residual
interactions as well as the two-nucleon short-range correlations are for the
first time derived from the same modern realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials,
namely from charge-dependent Bonn potential (CD-Bonn) and the Argonne V18
potential. In a comparison with the traditional approach of using the
Miller-Spencer Jastrow correlations matrix elements for the 0nbb-decay are
obtained, which are larger in magnitude. We analyze the differences among
various two-nucleon correlations including those of the unitary correlation
operator method (UCOM) and quantify the uncertainties in the calculated
0nbb-decay matrix elements.
