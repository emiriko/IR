In this paper we investigate expanding Bianchi type I models with two tilted
fluids with the same linear equation of state, characterized by the equation of
state parameter w. Individually the fluids have non-zero energy fluxes w.r.t.
the symmetry surfaces, but these cancel each other because of the Codazzi
constraint. We prove that when w=0 the model isotropizes to the future. Using
numerical simulations and a linear analysis we also find the asymptotic states
of models with w>0. We find that future isotropization occurs if and only if $w
\leq 1/3$. The results are compared to similar models investigated previously
where the two fluids have different equation of state parameters.
