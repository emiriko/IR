Nanomaterials hold much promise for biological applications, but they require
appropriate functionalization to provide biocompatibility in biological
environments. For non-covalent functionalization with biocompatible polymers,
the polymer must also remain attached to the nanomaterial after removal of its
excess to mimic the high dilution conditions of administration in vivo.
Reported here are the synthesis and utilization singly-substituted conjugates
of dextran and a phospholipid (Dextran-DSPE) as stable coatings for
nanomaterials. Suspensions of single walled carbon nanotubes were found not
only to be stable to phosphate buffered saline (PBS), serum, and a variety of
pHs after excess polymer removal, but also provide brighter photoluminescence
than carbon nanotubes suspended by poly(ethylene glycol)-DSPE. In addition,
both gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and gold nanorods (AuNRs) were found to
maintain their dispersion and characteristic optical absorbance after transfer
into Dextran-DSPE, and were obtained in much better yield than similar
suspensions with PEG-phospholipid and commonly used thiol-PEG. These
suspensions were also stable to PBS, serum, and a variety of pHs after removal
of excess polymer. Dextran-DSPE thus shows great promise as a general
surfactant material for the functionalization of a variety of nanomaterials,
which could facilitate future biological applications.
