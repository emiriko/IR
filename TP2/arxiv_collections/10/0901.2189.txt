We present the high resolution spectra of the youn and compact planerary
nebula NGC 6790 obtained with the echelle spectrograph at Bohyunsan Optical
Astronomy Observatory and report the discovery of Raman scattered He II 6545 in
this object. This line feature is formed in a thick neutral region surrounding
the hot central star, where He II 1025 line photons are scattered inelastically
by hydrogen atoms. A Monte Carlo technique is adopted to compute the line
profile with a simple geometric model, in which the neutral region is in the
form of a cylindrical shell that is expanding from the central star. From our
line profile analysis, the expansion velocity of the HI region lies in the
range V_exp = 15- 19 Km/s. Less stringent constraints are put on the HI column
density N_HI and covering factor C, where the total flux of Raman He II 6545 is
consistent with the product of N_HI and C being CN_HI ~ 0.5 X 10^20 cm^-2. The
Monte Carlo profiles from stationary emission models exhibit deficit in the
wing parts. A much better fit is obtained when the He II emission region is
assumed to take the form of a ring that slowly rotates with a rotation speed ~
18Km/s. Brief discussions are presented regarding the mass loss processes and
future observations.
