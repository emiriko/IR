The presence of a strong magnetic background can modify the nature and the
dynamics of the chiral phase transition at finite temperature. We compute the
modified effective potential in the linear sigma model with quarks to one loop
in the $\bar{MS}$ scheme for $N_{f}=2$. For fields $eB\sim 5 m_{\pi}^{2}$ and
larger a crossover is turned into a weak first-order transition. We discuss
possible implications for non-central heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, and
for the primordial QCD transition.
