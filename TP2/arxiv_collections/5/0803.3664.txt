In this paper we describe a method for evolving the projected
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (PGPE) for a Bose gas in a harmonic oscillator
potential. The central difficulty in solving this equation is the requirement
that the classical field is restricted to a small set of prescribed modes that
constitute the low energy classical region of the system. We present a scheme,
using a Hermite-polynomial based spectral representation, that precisely
implements this mode restriction and allows an efficient and accurate solution
of the PGPE. We show equilibrium and non-equilibrium results from the
application of the PGPE to an anisotropic trapped three-dimensional Bose gas.
