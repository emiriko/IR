An evolution partial differential equation for the surface of a non-wetting
single-crystal film in an attractive substrate potential is derived and used to
study the dynamics of a pinhole for the varying initial depth of a pinhole and
the strengths of the potential and the surface energy anisotropy. The results
of the simulations demonstrate how the corresponding parameters may lead to
complete or partial dewetting of the film. Anisotropy of the surface energy,
through faceting of the pinhole walls, is found to most drastically affect the
time to film rupture. In particular, the similations support the conjecture
that the strong anisotropy is capable of the complete suppression of dewetting
even when the attractive substrate potential is strong.
