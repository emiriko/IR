We study the response of a spin glass system with respect to the rescaling of
its interaction random variables and investigate numerically the behaviour of
the correlation functions with respect to the volume. While for a ferromagnet
the local energy correlation functions increase monotonically with the scale
and, by consequence, with respect to the volume of the system we find that in a
general spin glass model those monotonicities are violated.
