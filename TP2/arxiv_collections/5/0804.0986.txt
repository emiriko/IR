We propose a variant of Cauchy's Lemma, proving that when a convex chain on
one sphere is redrawn (with the same lengths and angles) on a larger sphere,
the distance between its endpoints increases. The main focus of this work is a
comparison of three alternate proofs, to show the links between Toponogov's
Comparison Theorem, Legendre's Theorem and Cauchy's Arm Lemma.
