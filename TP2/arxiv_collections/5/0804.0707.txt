We present a novel flow instability that can arise in thin films of
cytoskeletal fluids if the friction with the substrate on which the film lies
is sufficiently strong. We consider a two dimensional, membrane-bound fragment
containing actin filaments that is perturbed from its initially circular state,
where actin polymerizes at the edge and flows radially inward while
depolymerizing in the fragment. Performing a linear stability analysis of the
initial state due to perturbations of the fragment boundary, we find, in the
limit of very large friction, that the perturbed actin velocity and pressure
fields obey the very same laws governing the viscous fingering instability of
an interface between immiscible fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell. A feature of this
instability that is remarkable in the context of cell motility, is that its
existence is independent of the strength of the interaction between
cytoskeletal filaments and myosin motors, and moreover that it is completely
driven by the free energy of actin polymerization at the fragment edge.
