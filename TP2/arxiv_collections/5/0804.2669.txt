We study the transitions between neighboring energy levels in a
quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor quantum dot with two interacting electrons
in it, when it is subject to a linearly time-dependent electric field. We
analyze the applicability of simple two-level Landau-Zener model to describe
the evolution of the probability amplitudes in this realistic system. We show
that the Landau-Zener model works very well when it is viewed in the adibatic
basis, but it is not as robust in the diabatic basis.
