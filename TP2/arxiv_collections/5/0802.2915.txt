Bismuth ferrite, BiFeO3, is the only known room-temperature 'multiferroic'
material. We demonstrate here, using neutron scattering measurements in high
quality single crystals, that the antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric orders
are intimately coupled. Initially in a single ferroelectric state, our crystals
have a canted antiferromagnetic structure describing a unique cycloid. Under
electrical poling, polarisation re-orientation induces a spin flop. We argue
here that the coupling between the two orders may be stronger in the bulk than
that observed in thin films where the cycloid is absent.
