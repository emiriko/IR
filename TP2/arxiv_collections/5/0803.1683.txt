We summarize the top-quark mass measurements from the CDF and D0 experiments
at Fermilab. We combine published RunI (1992-1996) measurements with the most
recent RunII (2001-present) measurements using up to 2/fb of data. Taking
correlated uncertainties properly into account the resulting preliminary world
average mass of the top quark is Mt=172.6 +/- 0.8(sta) +/- 1.1(sys) GeV/c2,
assuming Gaussian systematic uncertainties. Adding in quadrature yields a total
uncertainty of 1.4 GeV/c2, corresponding to a relative precision of 0.8% on the
top-quark mass.
