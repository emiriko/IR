We studied the energy dependence of the 2D skew scattering from strong
potential, for which the Born approximation is not applicable. Since the skew
scattering cross section is zero both at low and at high energies, it exhibits
a maximum as a function of energy of incident electron. We found analytically
the shape of the maximum for an exactly solvable model of circular-barrier
potential. Within a rescaling factor, this shape is universal for strong
potentials. If the repulsive potential has an attractive core, the discrete
levels of the core become quasilocal due to degeneracy with continuum. For
energy of incident electron close to the quasilocal state with zero angular
momentum, the enhancement of the net cross section is accompanied by resonant
enhancement of the skew scattering. By contrast, near the resonance with
quasilocal states having momenta $\pm 1$, the skew scattering cross section is
an odd function of energy deviation from the resonance, and passes through
zero, i.e., it exhibits a sign reversal. In the latter case, in the presence of
the Fermi sea, the Kondo resonance manifests itself in strong temperature
dependence of the skew scattering.
