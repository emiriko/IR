We study the effect of effective mass on pairing correlations in the ground
states of superfluid nuclei $^{124}$Sn and $^{136}$Sn. Various parameter sets
of Skyrme interactions and relativistic Lagrangians are adopted to study
pairing correlations across a wide range of effective mass. It is shown that
surface-type pairing interaction gives an almost constant pairing gap as a
function of the effective mass, while volume-type pairing interaction shows
rather strong dependence of the pairing gap upon the effective mass. The local
pair potentials of various effective interactions are also examined in relation
to the effective mass.
