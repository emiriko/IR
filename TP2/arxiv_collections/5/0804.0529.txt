Quantum Fano inequality (QFI) in quantum information theory provides an upper
bound to the entropy exchange by a function of the entanglement fidelity. We
give various Fano-like upper bounds to the entropy exchange and QFI is a
special case of these bounds. These bounds also give an alternate derivation of
the QFI.
