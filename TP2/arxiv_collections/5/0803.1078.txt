Electrical resistivity rho, magnetic susceptibility chi, magnetization M and
specific heat measurements are reported on a singlecrystalline sample of
CePd5Al2, showing successive antiferromagnetic orderings at T_N1=4.1 K and
T_N2=2.9 K. The temperature dependence of T_N1 shows a Kondo metal behavior
with large anisotropy, rho_c/rho_a=3.2 at 20 K, and opening of a superzone gap
along the tetragona c-direction below T_N1. Both T_N1 and T_N2 gradually
increase with applying pressure up to 2.5 GPa. The data of chi(T) and M(B) in
the paramagnetic state were analyzed using a crystalline electric field (CEF)
model. It led to a Kramers doublet ground state with wave functions consisting
primarily of |+-5/2>, whose energy level is isolated from the excited states by
230 and 300 K. This CEF effect gives rise to the large anisotropy in the
paramagnetic state. In the ordered state, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is
manifested as M_c/M_a=20 in B=5 T and at 1.9 K, and chi_c/chi_a=25 in B=0.1 T
and at 4 K. This huge uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the antiferromagnetic
states can be interpreted in terms of isotropic magnetic interaction among the
Ce^{3+} moments governed by the strong CEF. In powder neutron diffraction
experiments, magnetic reflections were observed owing to the antiferromagnetic
ordered states below T_N1, however, no additional reflection was found below
T_N2.
