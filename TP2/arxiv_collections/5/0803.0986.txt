We report the observation of imaging beyond the diffraction limit due to
bound surface states in negative refraction photonic crystals. We achieve an
effective negative index figure-of-merit [-Re(n)/Im(n)] of at least 380, ~125x
improvement over recent efforts in the near-infrared, with a 0.4 THz bandwidth.
Supported by numerical and theoretical analyses, the observed near-field
resolution is 0.47 lambda, clearly smaller than the diffraction limit of 0.61
lambda. Importantly, we show this sub-diffraction imaging is due to the
resonant excitation of surface slab modes, allowing refocusing of
non-propagating evanescent waves.
