We have studied the physics of atoms with permanent electric dipole moment
and non vanishing magnetic moment interacting with an electric field and
inhomogeneous magnetic field. This system can be demonstrated as the atomic
analogue of Landau quantization of charged particles in a uniform magnetic
field. This Landau-like atomic problem is also studied with space-space
noncommutative coordinates.
