The dihadron spectra in high energy $AA$ collisions are studied within the
NLO pQCD parton model with jet quenching taken into account. The high $p_T$
dihadron spectra are found to be contributed not only by jet pairs close and
tangential to the surface of the dense matter but also by punching-through jets
survived at the center while the single hadron high $p_T$ spectra are only
dominated by surface emission. Consequently, the suppression factor of such
high-$p_T$ hadron pairs is found to be more sensitive to the initial gluon
density than the single hadron suppression factor.
