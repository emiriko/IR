For quantum systems with high purity, we find all observables that, when
continuously monitored, maximize the instantaneous reduction in the von Neumann
entropy. This allows us to obtain all locally optimal feedback protocols with
strong feedback, and explicit expressions for the best such protocols for
systems of size N <= 4. We also show that for a qutrit the locally optimal
protocol is the optimal protocol for a given range of control times, and derive
an upper bound on all optimal protocols with strong feedback.
