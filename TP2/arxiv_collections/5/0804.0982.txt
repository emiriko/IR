Several works investigated the connection between Cooper pair pumping and the
geometric and topological properties of the pumping cycle in the parameters
space. Recently the predicted connection between Berry's phase and pumped
charge was observed experimentally. In the present work we analyze the effects
of noise on Cooper pair pumping. We show that dissipation induces a new
geometric contribution in the transferred charge and we propose an experiment
where the theory can be probed.
