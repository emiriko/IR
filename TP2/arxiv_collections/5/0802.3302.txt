We report on the storage and non-resonant parametric recovery of microwave
signals carried by a dipolar surface spin-wave pulse in a thin ferrimagnetic
film. The information about the intensity of the spectral components of the
signal within a narrow frequency band is saved due to the excitation of a
dipolar-exchange standing spin-wave mode across the film thickness and is
afterwards restored by means of parametric amplification of this mode. The
intensity of the restored signal measured for varying shifts between the signal
carrier frequency and half of the pumping frequency, which is equal to the
frequency of the standing mode, reveals information about the entire frequency
spectrum of the input microwave signal.
