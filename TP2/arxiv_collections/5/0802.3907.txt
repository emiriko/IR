Two barrier RF systems were fabricated, tested and installed in the Fermilab
Main Injector. Each can provide 8 kV rectangular pulses (the RF barriers) at 90
kHz. When a stationary barrier is combined with a moving barrier, injected
beams from the Booster can be continuously deflected, folded and stacked in the
Main Injector, which leads to doubling of the beam intensity. This paper gives
a report on the beam experiment using this novel technology.
