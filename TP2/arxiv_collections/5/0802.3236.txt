Nanowire heterostructures define high-quality few-electron quantum dots for
nanoelectronics, spintronics and quantum information processing. We use a
cooled scanning probe microscope (SPM) to image and control an InAs quantum dot
in an InAs/InP nanowire, using the tip as a movable gate. Images of dot
conductance vs. tip position at T = 4.2 K show concentric rings as electrons
are added, starting with the first electron. The SPM can locate a dot along a
nanowire and individually tune its charge, abilities that will be very useful
for the control of coupled nanowire dots.
