de Sitter spacetime and Bunch-Davies vacuum are a solution to the
semiclassical Einstein-Schroedinger equations describing the evolution of
spacetime geometry and a massive scalar quantum field with arbitrary coupling
to curvature. The stability of this solution is proven by calculating the
renormalized energy momentum tensor expectation value for small spatially
homogeneous deviations from the de Sitter - Bunch-Davies system and solving the
linearized backreaction problem. A renormalization scheme is developed. All
momentum integrations are carried out analytically. The general solution is
given in terms of its Laplace transform. It contains only two artificial
instabilities: a constant gauge mode and an instability on the Planck time
scale lying outside of the scope of our semiclassical theory.
