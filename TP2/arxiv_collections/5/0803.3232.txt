The codeword stabilized ("CWS") quantum codes formalism presents a unifying
approach to both additive and nonadditive quantum error-correcting codes
(arXiv:0708.1021). This formalism reduces the problem of constructing such
quantum codes to finding a binary classical code correcting an error pattern
induced by a graph state. Finding such a classical code can be very difficult.
Here, we consider an algorithm which maps the search for CWS codes to a problem
of identifying maximum cliques in a graph. While solving this problem is in
general very hard, we prove three structure theorems which reduce the search
space, specifying certain admissible and optimal ((n,K,d)) additive codes. In
particular, we find there does not exist any ((7,3,3)) CWS code though the
linear programming bound does not rule it out. The complexity of the CWS search
algorithm is compared with the contrasting method introduced by Aggarwal and
Calderbank (arXiv:cs/0610159).
