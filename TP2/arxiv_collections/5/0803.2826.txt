This article concerns numerical simulations of the dynamics of particles
immersed in a continuum solvent. As prototypical systems, we consider colloidal
dispersions of spherical particles and solutions of uncharged polymers. After a
brief explanation of the concept of hydrodynamic interactions, we give a
general overview over the various simulation methods that have been developed
to cope with the resulting computational problems. We then focus on the
approach we have developed, which couples a system of particles to a lattice
Boltzmann model representing the solvent degrees of freedom. The standard D3Q19
lattice Boltzmann model is derived and explained in depth, followed by a
detailed discussion of complementary methods for the coupling of solvent and
solute. Colloidal dispersions are best described in terms of extended particles
with appropriate boundary conditions at the surfaces, while particles with
internal degrees of freedom are easier to simulate as an arrangement of mass
points with frictional coupling to the solvent. In both cases, particular care
has been taken to simulate thermal fluctuations in a consistent way. The
usefulness of this methodology is illustrated by studies from our own research,
where the dynamics of colloidal and polymeric systems has been investigated in
both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.
