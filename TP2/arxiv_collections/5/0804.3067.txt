Generalizing some results from R. Leung's thesis, we compute, in rational
cohomology, the Poincare dual of the degeneracy locus of the family of Dirac
operators parameterized by the moduli space of projectively anti-self-dual
$\SO(3)$ connections. This is the first step in a program to derive a relation
between the Donaldson and spin invariants.
