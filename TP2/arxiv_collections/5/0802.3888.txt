Episturmian morphisms constitute a powerful tool to study episturmian words.
Indeed, any episturmian word can be infinitely decomposed over the set of pure
episturmian morphisms. Thus, an episturmian word can be defined by one of its
morphic decompositions or, equivalently, by a certain directive word. Here we
characterize pairs of words directing a common episturmian word. We also
propose a way to uniquely define any episturmian word through a normalization
of its directive words. As a consequence of these results, we characterize
episturmian words having a unique directive word.
