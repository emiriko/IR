Nonlinear current voltage characteristics and in some cases also step like
characteristics were observed in diamond like carbon films. We suggest that the
transport mechanism is tunneling between conducting nanoparticles in the films
and the observation of step like structures is a manifestation of Coulomb
blockade found for the first time in these films. We point out that the origin
of similar current voltage characteristics observed in other carbon structures
can be also Coulomb blockade phenomenon.
