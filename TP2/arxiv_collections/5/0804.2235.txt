We study the scaling of two-dimensional crack roughness using large scale
beam lattice systems. Our results indicate that the crack roughness obtained
using beam lattice systems does not exhibit anomalous scaling in sharp contrast
to the simulation results obtained using scalar fuse lattices. The local and
global roughness exponents ($\zeta_{loc}$ and $\zeta$, respectively) are equal
to each other, and the two-dimensional crack roughness exponent is estimated to
be $\zeta_{loc} = \zeta = 0.64 \pm 0.02$. Removal of overhangs (jumps) in the
crack profiles eliminates even the minute differences between the local and
global roughness exponents. Furthermore, removing these jumps in the crack
profile completely eliminates the multiscaling observed in other studies. We
find that the probability density distribution $p(\Delta h(\ell))$ of the
height differences $\Delta h(\ell) = [h(x+\ell) - h(x)]$ of the crack profile
obtained after removing the jumps in the profiles follows a Gaussian
distribution even for small window sizes ($\ell$).
