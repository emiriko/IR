The possibility of using CCD detectors in a low threshold direct detection
dark matter search experiment is discussed. We present the main features of the
DECam detectors that make them a good alternative for such an experiment,
namely their low noise and their large depleted volume. The performance of the
DECam CCDs for the detection of nuclear recoils is discussed, and a measurement
of the ionization efficiency for these events is presented. Finally the plans
and expected reach for the CCD Experiment at Low Background (CELB) are
discussed.
