We investigate the existence of secure bit commitment protocols in the convex
framework for probabilistic theories. The framework makes only minimal
assumptions, and can be used to formalize quantum theory, classical probability
theory, and a host of other possibilities. We prove that in all such theories
that are locally non-classical but do not have entanglement, there exists a bit
commitment protocol that is exponentially secure in the number of systems used.
