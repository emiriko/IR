A model of statistical quark-gluon plasma formation is considered.We look the
dilepton production at critical temperature $T_{c}\sim170 Mev $ and completely
free out temperature $T=150 MeV$ with the initial temperature as $T_{0}=570,400
(250) MeV$. Now we consider that quark mass is depending on the coupling value
through parameterisation factor of the fireball formation and temperature. The
rate of production is shown for invariant mass $M$ at the particular value of $
E=2.0,3.0 GeV$.It shows the significant production of leptons in this process
for small value of invariant mass. However, the quark-hadron phase transition
is a very weakly changed in the entropy of the system during this process of
hadronisation.
