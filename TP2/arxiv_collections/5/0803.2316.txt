The three-input TOFFOLI gate is the workhorse of circuit synthesis for
classical logic operations on quantum data, e.g., reversible arithmetic
circuits. In physical implementations, however, TOFFOLI gates are decomposed
into six CNOT gates and several one-qubit gates. Though this decomposition has
been known for at least 10 years, we provide here the first demonstration of
its CNOT-optimality.
  We study three-qubit circuits which contain less than six CNOT gates and
implement a block-diagonal operator, then show that they implicitly describe
the cosine-sine decomposition of a related operator. Leveraging the canonicity
of such decompositions to limit one-qubit gates appearing in respective
circuits, we prove that the n-qubit analogue of the TOFFOLI requires at least
2n CNOT gates. Additionally, our results offer a complete classification of
three-qubit diagonal operators by their CNOT-cost, which holds even if ancilla
qubits are available.
