A complete approach for the determination of the complex constitutive
behaviour of textile composites through finite element simulation is presented
in this paper. In this work, simulations of different loading cases are carried
out on small samples of textile composites, taking into account all individual
fibers of the fabric and interactions taking place between them. The most
delicate issue is related to the modelling of contact-friction interactions
between fibers,and the solution of the nonlinear problem that follows up by the
means of robust algorithms. The efficiency of these algorithms, and the
increase of capacities of high performance computing, allow to simulate samples
made of several hundreds of interlocked fibers.
