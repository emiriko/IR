A primary motivation for our research in Digital Ecosystems is the desire to
exploit the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems. Ecosystems are
thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve
complex, dynamic problems. Self-organisation is perhaps one of the most
desirable features in the systems that we engineer, and it is important for us
to be able to measure self-organising behaviour. We investigate the
self-organising aspects of Digital Ecosystems, created through the application
of evolutionary computing to Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), aiming to determine a
macroscopic variable to characterise the self-organisation of the evolving
agent populations within. We study a measure for the self-organisation called
Physical Complexity; based on statistical physics, automata theory, and
information theory, providing a measure of information relative to the
randomness in an organism's genome, by calculating the entropy in a population.
We investigate an extension to include populations of variable length, and then
built upon this to construct an efficiency measure to investigate clustering
within evolving agent populations. Overall an insight has been achieved into
where and how self-organisation occurs in our Digital Ecosystem, and how it can
be quantified.
