We propose to use the phenomenon of resonant tunneling for the detection of
noise. The main idea of this method relies on the effect of homogeneous
broadening of the resonant tunneling peak induced by the emission and
absorption of collective charge excitations in the measurement circuit. In
thermal equilibrium, the signal to noise ratio of the detector as a function of
the detector bandwidth (the detector function) is given by the universal
hyperbolic tangent, which is the statement of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. The universality breaks down if non-equilibrium processes take place
in the measurement circuit. We propose the theory of this phenomenon and make
predictions for the detector function in case when non-equilibrium noise is
created by a mesoscopic conductor. We investigate measurement circuit effects
and prove the universality of the classical noise detection. Finally, we
evaluate the contribution of the third cumulant of current and make suggestions
of how it can be measured.
