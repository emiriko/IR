Symmetries are intrinsic to many combinatorial problems including Boolean
Satisfiability (SAT) and Constraint Programming (CP). In SAT, the
identification of symmetry breaking predicates (SBPs) is a well-known, often
effective, technique for solving hard problems. The identification of SBPs in
SAT has been the subject of significant improvements in recent years, resulting
in more compact SBPs and more effective algorithms. The identification of SBPs
has also been applied to pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, showing that symmetry
breaking can also be an effective technique for PB constraints. This paper
extends further the application of SBPs, and shows that SBPs can be identified
and used in Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), as well as in its most well-known
variants, including partial MaxSAT, weighted MaxSAT and weighted partial
MaxSAT. As with SAT and PB, symmetry breaking predicates for MaxSAT and
variants are shown to be effective for a representative number of problem
domains, allowing solving problem instances that current state of the art
MaxSAT solvers could not otherwise solve.
