This chapter reviews the mechanisms by which sensors gather information from
the physical world and transform it into the electronic signals that are used
in today's information and control systems. It introduces a new methodology for
describing sensing mechanisms based on the process of information flow and
applies it to the broad spectrum of sensors, instruments and data input devices
in current use. We identify four distinct elemental transduction processes:
energy conversion, energy dispersion, energy modulation and modulation of a
material property. We posit that these four mechanisms form a complete set for
describing information transduction in sensing systems.
