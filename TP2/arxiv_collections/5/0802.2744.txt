We report on strong dipole transitions to 3d orbitals of neighboring Co atoms
in the Co 1s x-ray absorption pre-edge. They are revealed by applying
high-resolution resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) to compounds
containing CoO6 clusters. When contrasted to quadrupole local 1s3d excitations,
these non-local 1s3d transitions are identified by their energy dispersion and
angular dependence, their sensitivity to second-shell effects (i.e. the
connection mode of the CoO6 octahedra and the bond lengths), and an upwards
energy shift of 2.5 eV due to the poorer screening of the core hole. The
experiment reveals that the intensity of the non-local transitions gauges the
oxygen-mediated 4p-O-3d intersite hybridization. We propose a revised
interpretation of the pre-edges of transition metal compounds. Detailed
analysis of these new features in the pre-edge offers a unique insight in the
oxygen mediated metal-metal interactions in transition metal-based systems,
which is a crucial aspect in orbital ordering and related electronic and
magnetic properties. In addition, the exceptional resolving power of the
present 1s2p RXES experiment allows us to demonstrate the coherent second-order
nature of the underlying scattering process.
