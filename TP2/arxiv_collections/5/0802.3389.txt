We revise imposition of various constraints in spin foam models of
4-dimensional general relativity. We argue that the usual simplicity constraint
must be supplemented by a constraint on holonomies and together they must be
inserted explicitly into the discretized path integral. At the same time, the
closure constraint must be relaxed so that the new constraint expresses
covariance of intertwiners assigned to tetrahedra by spin foam quantization. As
a result, the spin foam boundary states are shown to be realized in terms of
projected spin networks of the covariant loop approach to quantum gravity.
