Horn's problem asks for the conditions on sets of integers mu, nu and lambda
that ensure the existence of Hermitian operators A, B and A+B with spectra mu,
nu and lambda, respectively. It has been shown that this problem is equivalent
to deciding whether the irreducible representation of GL(d) with highest weight
lambda is contained in the tensor product of irreducible representations with
highest weight mu and nu. In this paper we present a quantum
information-theoretic proof of the relation between the two problems that is
asymptotic in one direction. This result has previously been obtained by
Klyachko using geometric invariant theory. The work presented in this paper
does not, however, touch upon the non-asymptotic equivalence between the two
problems, a result that rests on the recently proven saturation conjecture for
GL(d).
