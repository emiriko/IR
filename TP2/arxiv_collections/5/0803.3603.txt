Since the discovery of high-transition temperature ($T_c$) superconductivity
in layered copper oxides, extensive efforts have been devoted to explore the
higher $T_c$ superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ higher than 40 K can be
obtained only in the copper oxide superconductors so far. The highest reported
value of $T_c$ for non-copper-oxide bulk superconductivity is 39 K in
$MgB_2$.\cite{jun} The $T_c$ of about 40 K is close to or above the theoretical
value predicted from BCS theory.\cite{mcmillan} Therefore, it is very
significant to search for non-copper oxide superconductor with the transition
temperature higher than 40 K to understand the mechanism of high-$T_c$
superconductivity. Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in
samarium-arsenide oxides $SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_x$ with ZrCuAiAs type structure.
Resistivity and magnetization measurements show strong evidences for transition
temperature as high as 43 K. $SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_x$ is the first non-copper oxide
superconductor with $T_c$ higher than 40 K. The $T_c$ higher than 40 K may be a
strong argument to consider $SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_x$ as an unconventional
superconductor.
