Since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe, it was
necessary to introduce a new component of matter distribution called dark
energy. The standard cosmological model considers isotropy of the pressure and
assumes an equation of state $p=\omega \rho$, relating the pressure $p$ and the
energy density $\rho$. The interval of the parameter $\omega$ defines the kind
of matter of the universe, related to the fulfillment, or not, of the energy
conditions of the fluid. The recent interest in this kind of fluid with
anisotropic pressure, in the scenario of the gravitational collapse and star
formation, imposes a carefull analysis of the energy conditions and the role of
the components of the pressure. Here, in this work, we show an example where
the classification of dark energy for isotropic pressure fluids is used
incorrectly for anisotropic fluids. The correct classification and its
consequences are presented.
