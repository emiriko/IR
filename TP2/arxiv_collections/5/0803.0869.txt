This paper investigates a scheme for quantized charge pumping based on
single-parameter modulation. The device was realized in an AlGaAs-GaAs gated
nanowire. We find a remarkable robustness of the quantized regime against
variations in the driving signal, which increases with applied rf power. This
feature together with its simple configuration makes this device a potential
module for a scalable source of quantized current.
