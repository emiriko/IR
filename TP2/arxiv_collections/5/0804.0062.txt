Contact between an elastic manifold and a rigid substrate with a self-affine
fractal surface is reinvestigated with Green's function molecular dynamics.
Stress and contact autocorrelation functions (ACFs) are found to decrease
algebraically. A rationale is provided for the observed similarity in the
exponents for stress and contact ACFs. Both exponents differ substantially from
analytic predictions over the range of Hurst roughness exponents studied. The
effect of increasing the range of interactions from a hard sphere repulsion to
exponential decay is analyzed. Results for exponential interactions are
accurately described by recent systematic corrections to Persson's contact
mechanics theory. The relation between the area of simply connected contact
patches and the normal force is also studied. Below a threshold size the
contact area and force are consistent with Hertzian contact mechanics, while
area and force are linearly related in larger contact patches.
