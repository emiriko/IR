The exclusive channel polarized proton(polarized e,e prime p)pi0 was studied
in the first and second nucleon resonance regions in the Q2 range from 0.187 to
0.770 GeV2 at Jefferson Lab using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer
(CLAS). Longitudinal target and beam-target asymmetries were extracted over a
large range of center-of-mass angles of the pi0 and compared to the unitary
isobar model MAID, the dynamic model by Sato and Lee, and the dynamic model
DMT. A strong sensitivity to individual models was observed, in particular for
the target asymmetry and in the higher invariant mass region. This data set,
once included in the global fits of the above models, is expected to place
strong constraints on the electrocoupling amplitudes A_{1/2} and S_{1/2} for
the Roper resonance N(1400)P11, and the N(1535)S11 and N(1520)D13 states.
