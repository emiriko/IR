We show that fractional decay may be observable in experiments using quantum
dots and photonic crystals with parameters that are currently achievable. We
focus on the case of inverse opal photonic crystals and locate the position in
the crystal where the effect is most pronounced. Furthermore, we quantify the
influence of absorptive loss and show that it is a limiting but not prohibitive
effect.
