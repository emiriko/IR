The design of sensor networks capable of reaching a consensus on a globally
optimal decision test, without the need for a fusion center, is a problem that
has received considerable attention in the last years. Many consensus
algorithms have been proposed, with convergence conditions depending on the
graph describing the interaction among the nodes. In most works, the graph is
undirected and there are no propagation delays. Only recently, the analysis has
been extended to consensus algorithms incorporating propagation delays. In this
work, we propose a consensus algorithm able to converge to a globally optimal
decision statistic, using a wideband wireless network, governed by a fairly
simple MAC mechanism, where each link is a multipath, frequency-selective,
channel. The main contribution of the paper is to derive necessary and
sufficient conditions on the network topology and sufficient conditions on the
channel transfer functions guaranteeing the exponential convergence of the
consensus algorithm to a globally optimal decision value, for any bounded delay
condition.
