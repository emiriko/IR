We prove that the self-interacting scalar field on the four-dimensional
degenerate Moyal plane is renormalisable to all orders when adding a suitable
counterterm to the Lagrangean. Despite the apparent simplicity of the model, it
raises several non trivial questions. Our result is a first step towards the
definition of renormalisable quantum field theories on a non-commutative
Minkowski space.
