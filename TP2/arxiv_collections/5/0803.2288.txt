Within our thick brane approach previously used to obtain the cosmological
evolution equations on a thick brane embedded in a five-dimensional
Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter spacetime it is explicitly shown that the
consistency of these equations with the energy conservation equation requires
that, in general, the thickness of the brane evolves in time. This varying
brane thickness entails the possibility that both Newton's gravitational
constant $G$ and the effective cosmological constant $\Lambda_4$ are time
dependent.
