While achiral Bohr atom theory cannot generate Hbar signatures, achiral
Heitler-London bond theory can but its Hbar signatures must be detected. We
show that the largest spectral signature to probe Hbar is the singlet-triplet
splitting of 9,5 eV at r(0)=0,74 Angstrom, observed in the dihydrogen band
spectrum. This large Hbar-signature, overlooked for nearly a century, is
confirmed with the observed HH potential energy curve. Hbar claims by
CERN-based collaborations, seemingly important for the fate and future of Hbar,
are premature and must be examined critically.
