The zero temperature Mott transition region in antiferromagnetic, spin S=5/2
MnO is probed using the correlated band theory LSDA+U method. The first
transition encountered is an insulator-insulator volume collapse within the
rocksalt structure that is characterized by an unexpected Hund's rule violating
`spin-flip' moment collapse. This spin-flip to S=1/2 takes fullest advantage of
the anisotropy of the Coulomb repulsion, allowing gain in the kinetic energy
(which increases with decreasing volume) while retaining a sizable amount of
the magnetic exchange energy. While transition pressures vary with the
interaction strength, the spin-flip state is robust over a range of interaction
strengths and for both B1 and B8 structures.
