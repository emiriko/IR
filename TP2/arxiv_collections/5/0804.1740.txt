We define a pseudo quasi-3 design as a symmetric design with the property
that the derived and residual designs with respect to at least one block are
quasi-symmetric. Quasi-symmetric designs can be used to construct optimal self
complementary codes. In this article we give a construction of an infinite
family of pseudo quasi-3 designs whose residual designs allow us to construct a
family of codes with a new parameter set that meet the Grey Rankin bound.
