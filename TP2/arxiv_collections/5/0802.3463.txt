Accurate nuclear reaction rates are needed for primordial nucleosynthesis and
hydrostatic burning in stars. The relevant reactions are extremely difficult to
measure directly in the laboratory at the small astrophysical energies. In
recent years direct reactions have been developed and applied to extract
low-energy astrophysical S-factors. These methods require a combination of new
experimental techniques and theoretical efforts, which are the subject of this
presentation.
