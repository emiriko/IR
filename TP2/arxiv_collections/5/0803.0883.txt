In this paper we describe Herwig++ version 2.3, a general-purpose Monte Carlo
event generator for the simulation of hard lepton-lepton, lepton-hadron and
hadron-hadron collisions. A number of important hard scattering processes are
available, together with an interface via the Les Houches Accord to specialized
matrix element generators for additional processes. The simulation of Beyond
the Standard Model (BSM) physics includes a range of models and allows new
models to be added by encoding the Feynman rules of the model. The
parton-shower approach is used to simulate initial- and final-state QCD
radiation, including colour coherence effects, with special emphasis on the
correct description of radiation from heavy particles. The underlying event is
simulated using an eikonal multiple parton-parton scattering model. The
formation of hadrons from the quarks and gluons produced in the parton shower
is described using the cluster hadronization model. Hadron decays are simulated
using matrix elements, where possible including spin correlations and off-shell
effects.
