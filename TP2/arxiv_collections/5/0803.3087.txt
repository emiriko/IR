We propose a global symmetry-breaking mechanism based on an extension of the
vibronic (cooperative Jahn-Teller) effects (comprising electron-phonon
superpartners) to generalize them into fermion-boson superpartners. Examples of
superpairs are constructed by combining phonons, photons, pi-mesons, etc. with
electrons, holes, nucleons, etc. in condensed and nuclear matter. The obtained
symmetry-breaking mechanism operating amidst the superpartner pairs may be just
what is needed to justify the status of supersymmetry as a broken-symmetry
phenomenon. Following the extended vibronic mixing of fermion states by the
appropriate heavy boson superpartner, the latter propagates along a helical
path away from the mixing site.
