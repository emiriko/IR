We present a spectrally accurate numerical method for finding non-trivial
time-periodic solutions of non-linear partial differential equations. The
method is based on minimizing a functional (of the initial condition and the
period) that is positive unless the solution is periodic, in which case it is
zero. We solve an adjoint PDE to compute the gradient of this functional with
respect to the initial condition. We include additional terms in the functional
to specify the free parameters, which, in the case of the Benjamin-Ono
equation, are the mean, a spatial phase, a temporal phase and the real part of
one of the Fourier modes at $t=0$.
  We use our method to study global paths of non-trivial time-periodic
solutions connecting stationary and traveling waves of the Benjamin-Ono
equation. As a starting guess for each path, we compute periodic solutions of
the linearized problem by solving an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem in
closed form. We then use our numerical method to continue these solutions
beyond the realm of linear theory until another traveling wave is reached. By
experimentation with data fitting, we identify the analytical form of the
solutions on the path connecting the one-hump stationary solution to the
two-hump traveling wave. We then derive exact formulas for these solutions by
explicitly solving the system of ODE's governing the evolution of solitons
using the ansatz suggested by the numerical simulations.
