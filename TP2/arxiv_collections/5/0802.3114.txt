The methods of mathematical control theory are widely used in the modern
physics, but still they are less popular in quantum science. We will discuss
the aspects of control theory, which are the most useful in applications to the
real problems of quantum optics. We apply this technique to control the
behavior of the two-level quantum particles (atoms) in the modulated external
optical field in the frame of the so called "semi classical model", where
quantum two-level atomic system (all other levels are neglected) interacts with
classical electromagnetic field. In this paper we propose a simple model of
feedforward (open-loop) control for the quantum particle system, which is a
basement for further investigation of two-level quantum particle in the
external one-dimensional optical field.
