An abstract mathematical framework is presented in this paper as a
unification of several deformed or generalized algebra proposed recently in the
context of generalized statistical theories intended to treat certain complex
thermodynamic or statistical systems. It is shown that, from mathematical point
of view, any bijective function can be used in principle to formulate an
algebra in which the conventional algebraic rules are generalized.
