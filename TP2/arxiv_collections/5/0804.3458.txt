Space-time evolution and subsequent particle production from minimally
viscous ($\eta/s$=0.08) QGP fluid is studied using the 2nd order
Israel-Stewart's theory of dissipative relativistic fluid. Compared to ideal
fluid, energy density or temperature evolves slowly in viscous dynamics.
Particle yield at high $p_T$ is increased. Elliptic flow on the other hand
decreases in viscous dynamics. Minimally viscous QGP fluid found to be
consistent with a large number of experimental data.
