We report incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering experiments on the
thermotropic liquid crystal 4-n-cyano-4'-octylbiphenyl. The combination of
time-of-flight and backscattering data allows analyzing the intermediate
scattering function over about three decades of relaxation times. Translational
diffusion and uniaxial molecular rotations are clearly identified as the major
relaxation processes in respectively the nanosecond and picosecond time scales.
The comparison with literature data obtained by other techniques is discussed.
