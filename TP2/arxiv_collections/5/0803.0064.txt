The Orlik-Solomon algebra of a matroid can be considered as a quotient ring
over the exterior algebra E. At first we study homological properties of
E-modules as e.g. complexity, depth and regularity. In particular, we consider
modules with linear injective resolutions. We apply our results to
Orlik-Solomon algebras of matroids and give formulas for the complexity, depth
and regularity of such rings in terms of invariants of the matroid. Moreover,
we characterize those matroids whose Orlik-Solomon ideal has a linear
projective resolution and compute in these cases the Betti numbers of the
ideal.
