Cylinder-shaped perfect lens deduced from the coordinate transformation
method is proposed. The previously reported perfect slab lens is noticed to be
a limiting form of the cylindrical lens when the inner radius approaches
infinity with respect to the lens thickness. Connaturality between a
cylindrical lens and a slab lens is affirmed by comparing their eigenfield
transfer functions. We numerically confirm the subwavelength focusing
capability of such a cylindrical lens with consideration of material
imperfection. Compared to a slab lens, a cylindrical lens has several
advantages, including finiteness in cross-section, and ability in lensing with
magnification or demagnification. Immediate applications of such a cylindrical
lens can be in high-resolution imaging and lithography technologies. In
addition, its invisibility property suggests that it may be valuable for
non-invasive electromagnetic probing.
