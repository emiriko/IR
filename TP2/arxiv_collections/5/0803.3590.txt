We propose a simple model for the behaviour of longterm investors on a stock
market, consisting of three particles, which represent the current price of the
stock and the opinion of the buyers, respectively sellers, about the right
trading price. As time evolves, both groups of traders update their opinions
with respect to the current price. The update speed is controled by a parameter
$\gamma$, the price process is described by a geometric Brownian motion. We
consider the stability of the market in terms of the distance between the
buyers' and sellers' opinion, and prove that the distance process is
recurrent/transient in dependence on $\gamma$.
