The aim of the paper is to propose one paradigm change of CKM global fits on
experimental data from electroweak sector. The change refers to using in fits
the exact unitarity constraints expressed in terms of four invariant
parameters, such as moduli of the CKM matrix, and to take into account an
important set of the available experimental data. In the paper we use data from
nuclear beta decays, and from leptonic and semileptonic decays, in order to
find the most probable numerical form of the CKM matrix, as well as the
determination of decay constants, $f_{P}$, and of various form factors
$f_+^{Pp}(0)$, directly from experimental results.
