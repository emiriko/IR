We study analytically and numerically the problem of two qubits with fixed
coupling irradiated with quantum or classical fields. In the classical case, we
derive an effective Hamiltonian, and construct composite pulse sequences
leading to a CNOT gate. In the quantum case, we show that qubit-qubit-photon
multiparticle entanglement and maximally entangled two-qubit state can be
obtained by driving the system at very low powers (one quanta of excitation).
Our results can be applied to a variety of systems of two superconducting
qubits coupled to resonators.
