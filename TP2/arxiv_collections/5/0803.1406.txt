We report on the first direct observation of coherent control of single
particle tunneling in a strongly driven double well potential. In our setup
atoms propagate in a periodic arrangement of double wells allowing the full
control of the driving parameters such as frequency, amplitude and even the
space-time symmetry. Our experimental findings are in quantitative agreement
with the predictions of the corresponding Floquet theory and are also compared
to the predictions of a simple two mode model. Our experiments reveal directly
the critical dependence of coherent destruction of tunneling on the generalized
parity symmetry.
