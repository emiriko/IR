At the present thesis a prototype antenna is studied. In chapter 1 the
antenna's geometry is selected with the supervisor's assistance and its
geometrical and dimensional characteristics are outlined. In chapter 2 an
extensive theoretical analysis is carried out and the final mathematical
formulas of the antenna's radiation pattern are extracted. In chapter 3 a
computational study - simulation is carried out utilizing the computer program
RICHWIRE which is capable of dividing the antenna in many segments. The study's
results illustrate the variations of the most important antenna's
characteristic quantities as a function of the number of segments. Finally, a
study of the antenna's behavior as a function of the frequency follows at the
range from 900 to 1300 [MHz]. In chapter 4 the antenna's behavior as a function
of frequency is studied at a more extensive range, approximately from 200 to
2850 [MHz]. In chapter 5 an improvement of the antenna's characteristics is
attempted by modifying its geometrical shape utilizing three distinct
geometrical models. Then follow comparative results between the original and
the improved antenna's dispositions and eventually the final conclusions.
