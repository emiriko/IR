We report on the observation of an interaction blockade effect for ultracold
atoms in optical lattices, analogous to Coulomb blockade observed in mesoscopic
solid state systems. When the lattice sites are converted into biased double
wells, we detect a discrete set of steps in the well population for increasing
bias potentials. These correspond to tunneling resonances where the atom number
on each side of the barrier changes one by one. This allows us to count and
control the number of atoms within a given well. By evaluating the amplitude of
the different plateaus, we can fully determine the number distribution of the
atoms in the lattice, which we demonstrate for the case of a superfluid and
Mott insulating regime of 87Rb.
