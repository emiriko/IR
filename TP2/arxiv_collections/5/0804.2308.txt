Characteristics of magnetic transitions in NpTGa$_5$ with T=Co, Ni, Rh are
explained in a unified way with use of a crystalline electric field (CEF) model
of localized 5$f^4$ electrons. The model takes a CEF doublet and a singlet as
local states, and includes dipolar and quadrupolar intersite interactions in
the mean-field theory. Diverse ordering phenomena are derived depending on the
magnitude of interaction parameters, which qualitatively reproduce the
experimentally observed magnetic behaviors in NpTGa$_5$. The quadrupole degrees
of freedom are essential to the diverse magnetic orders. It is argued that
NpRhGa$_5$ is close to a multicritical point where quadrupoles and dipoles with
different directions are competing to order.
