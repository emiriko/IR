We report the results of a search for a narrow resonance decaying into two
photons in 1.1 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab
Tevatron Collider during the period 2002-2006. We find no evidence for such a
resonance and set a lower limit on the mass of a fermiophobic Higgs boson of
$m_{h_f}>100$ GeV at the 95% C.L. This exclusion limit exceeds those obtained
in previous searches at the Tevatron and covers a significant region of the
parameter space $B(h_{f}\to\gamma\gamma)$ vs. $m_{h_f}$ which was not
accessible at the CERN LEP Collider.
