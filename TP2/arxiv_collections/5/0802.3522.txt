This technical report details a family of time warp distances on the set of
discrete time series. This family is constructed as an editing distance whose
elementary operations apply on linear segments. A specific parameter allows
controlling the stiffness of the elastic matching. It is well suited for the
processing of event data for which each data sample is associated with a
timestamp, not necessarily obtained according to a constant sampling rate. Some
properties verified by these distances are proposed and proved in this report.
