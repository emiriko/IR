Deep-elastic pp scattering at c.m. energy 14 TeV at LHC in the momentum
transfer range 4 GeV*2 < |t| < 10 GeV*2 is planned to be measured by the TOTEM
group. We study this process in a model where the deep-elastic scattering is
due to a single hard collision of a valence quark from one proton with a
valence quark from the other proton. The hard collision originates from the
low-x gluon cloud around one valence quark interacting with that of the other.
The low-x gluon cloud can be identified as color glass condensate and has size
~0.3 F. Our prediction is that pp differential cross section in the large |t|
region decreases smoothly as momentum transfer increases. This is in contrast
to the prediction of pp differential cross section with visible oscillations
and smaller cross sections by a large number of other models.
