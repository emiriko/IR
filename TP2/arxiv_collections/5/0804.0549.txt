The CP-violating effects in the neutralino sector of the MSSM can be observed
in event-counting type experiments, i.e. without the need of exploiting
variables sensitive to beam or neutralino polarization. On the other hand, such
CP-odd effects in the chargino sector can be generated only at the loop level.
We contrast the two sectors and present results of full one-loop analysis of
the CP-odd asymmetry in the non-diagonal chargino pair production in e+e-
collisions.
