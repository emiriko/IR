A new random geometric graph model, the so-called secrecy graph, is
introduced and studied. The graph represents a wireless network and includes
only edges over which secure communication in the presence of eavesdroppers is
possible. The underlying point process models considered are lattices and
Poisson point processes. In the lattice case, analogies to standard bond and
site percolation can be exploited to determine percolation thresholds. In the
Poisson case, the node degrees are determined and percolation is studied using
analytical bounds and simulations. It turns out that a small density of
eavesdroppers already has a drastic impact on the connectivity of the secrecy
graph.
