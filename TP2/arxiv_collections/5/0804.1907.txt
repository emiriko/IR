In supersymmetric models the lightest Higgs boson may decay with a sizable
branching ratio into a pair of light neutralinos. We analyze such decays within
the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with R-parity
violation, where the neutralino itself is unstable and decays into Standard
Model fermions. We show that the R-parity violating couplings induce novel
Higgs decay signals that might facilitate the discovery of the Higgs boson at
colliders. At the LHC, the Higgs may be observed, for instance, through its
decay -via two neutralinos- into final states containing missing energy and
isolated charged leptons such as $l^\pm l^\mp, l^\pm l^\pm, 3l$, and $4l$.
Another promising possibility is the search for the displaced vertices
associated with the neutralino decay. We also point out that Higgs searches at
the LHC might additionally provide the first evidence of R-parity violation.
