Multiple sequence alignment is a key process in today's biology, and finding
a relevant alignment of several sequences is much more challenging than just
optimizing some improbable evaluation functions. Our approach for addressing
multiple sequence alignment focuses on the building of structures in a new
graph model: the factor graph model. This model relies on block-based
formulation of the original problem, formulation that seems to be one of the
most suitable ways for capturing evolutionary aspects of alignment. The
structures are implicitly built by a colony of ants laying down pheromones in
the factor graphs, according to relations between blocks belonging to the
different sequences.
