This writing has been prepared on the occasion of the 75th birthday of
E.C.George Sudarshan, who (besides the originator of the V-A theory for
weak-forces, of quantum optics --the quantum representation of coherent
light--, of dynamical maps for open quantum systems, of the Zeno effect, etc.)
was a pioneer, already in the sisties, also of the theory of the so-called
"tachyons".
  This paper wishes to be a homage to E.C.G.Sudarshan, in connection with the
last-mentioned pioneering work of his. After a brief theoretical introduction
(based on the standard postulates of Special Relativity, and therefore
extending it --or rather non-restricting it-- without any violations: for
example, without any violations of the so-called Einstein causality), the main
aim of this article is an updated presentation of the status-of-the-art of the
"superluminal" experiments. In particular, we devote such a review to the
phenomena met in tunneling through quantum (and classical) barriers [e.g.,
referring to the Genelalized Hartman Effect]; and in connection with the
"Localized (nondiffracting) Solutions" of the wave equantions [e.g., of Maxwell
equations]: especially of the "X-shaped" ones.
  The interested reader is provided with an extended Bibliography.
