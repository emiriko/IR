The competition between the Zeeman energy and the Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit couplings is studied for fractional quantum Hall states by including
correlation effects. A transition of the direction of the spin-polarization is
predicted at specific values of the Zeeman energy. We show that these values
can be expressed in terms of the pair-correlation function, and thus provide
information about the microscopic ground state. We examine the particular
examples of the Laughlin wavefunctions and the 5/2-Pfaffian state. We also
include effects of the nuclear bath.
