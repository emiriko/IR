The implementation of a proof-of-concept Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics
kernel on the Cell processor is described in detail, illustrating issues
encountered in the porting process. The resulting code performs up to 45GFlop/s
per socket, indicating that the Cell processor is likely to be a good platform
for future Lattice QCD calculations.
