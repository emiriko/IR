The generating function which counts partitions with the Plancherel measure
(and its q-deformed version), can be rewritten as a matrix integral, which
allows to compute its asymptotic expansion to all orders. There are
applications in statistical physics of growing/melting crystals, T.A.S.E.P.,
and also in algebraic geometry. In particular we compute the Gromov-Witten
invariants of the X_p Calabi-Yau 3-fold, and we prove a conjecture of M.
Marino, that the generating functions F_g of Gromov--Witten invariants of X_p,
come from a matrix model, and are the symplectic invariants of the mirror
spectral curve.
