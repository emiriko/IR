In a superconductor with magnetic impurities, Kondo scattering results in the
formation of localized states inside the superconducting gap. We show that
inelastic electronic transitions involving quasiparticle scattering into and
out of the localized states may result in significant changes in the non
equilibrium properties of the superconductor. Using the model of
Muller-Hartmann and Zittartz for the extreme dilute limit, and including both
deformation potential and spin-lattice coupling we have calculated the rates of
such inelastic transitions between continuum and discrete states, and shown
that they may greatly modify quasiparticle interactions. The individual
processes are: quasiparticle trapping into discrete states, enhanced
recombination with localized quasiparticles, and pair breaking and detrapping
of localized quasiparticles by sub-gap phonons. We find that all these
processes give rise to clearly distinguishable temperature dependences of the
kinetic parameters.
