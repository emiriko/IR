Laser cooling of a mechanical mode of a resonator by the radiation pressure
of a detuned optical cavity mode has been recently demonstrated by various
groups in different experimental configurations. Here we consider the effect of
a second mechanical mode with a close, but different resonance frequency. We
show that the nearby mechanical resonance is simultaneously cooled by the
cavity field, provided that the difference between the two mechanical
frequencies is not too small. When this frequency difference becomes smaller
than the effective mechanical damping of the secondary mode, the two cooling
processes interfere destructively and cavity cooling is suppressed in the limit
of identical mechanical frequencies. We show that also the entanglement
properties of the steady state of the tripartite system crucially depend upon
on the difference between the two mechanical frequencies. If the latter is
larger than the effective damping of the second mechanical mode, the state
shows fully tripartite entanglement and each mechanical mode is entangled with
the cavity mode. If instead the frequency difference is smaller, the steady
state is a two-mode biseparable state, inseparable only when one splits the
cavity mode from the two mechanical modes. In this latter case, the
entanglement of each mechanical mode with the cavity mode is extremely fragile
with respect to temperature.
