We present a new analysis of the helicity parton distributions of the
nucleon. The analysis takes into account the available data from inclusive and
semi-inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering, as well as from polarized
pp scattering at RHIC. For the first time, all theoretical calculations are
performed fully at next-to-leading order (NLO) of perturbative QCD, using a
method that allows to incorporate the NLO corrections in a very fast and
efficient way in the analysis. We find evidence for a rather small gluon
polarization in the nucleon, over a limited region of momentum fraction, and
for interesting flavor patterns in the polarized sea.
