The propagation of a head-to-head magnetic domain-wall (DW) or a tail-to-tail
DW in a magnetic nanowire under a static field along the wire axis is studied.
Relationship between the DW velocity and DW structure is obtained from the
energy consideration. The role of the energy dissipation in the field-driven DW
motion is clarified. Namely, a field can only drive a domain-wall propagating
along the field direction through the mediation of a damping. Without the
damping, DW cannot propagate along the wire. Contrary to the common wisdom, DW
velocity is, in general, proportional to the energy dissipation rate, and one
needs to find a way to enhance the energy dissipation in order to increase the
propagation speed. The theory provides also a nature explanation of the
wire-width dependence of the DW velocity and velocity oscillation beyond Walker
breakdown field.
