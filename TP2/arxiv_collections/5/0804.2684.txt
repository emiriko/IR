We propose a scheme to generate arbitrary Fock states |N> in a cavity QED
using N resonant Rydberg atoms. The atom-field interaction times are controlled
via Stark-shifts adjusted in a way that each atom transfers a photon to the
cavity, turning atomic detections useless. Fluctuations affecting the control
of the atom-field interactions are also considered.
