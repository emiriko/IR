Using powerful tools of harmonic maps and integrable systems, all the Gribov
copies in the Coulomb gauge in 3D Chern-Simons theory are constructed. Some
issues about the Gribov and the modular re- gions are shortly discussed. The
Gribov copies of the vacuum in 3D QCD in the Coulomb gauge are described. An
interesting implication of the presence of Gribov copies is briefy pointed out.
