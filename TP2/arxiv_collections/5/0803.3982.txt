In the present paper, we propose the parity even,orbital singlet and spin
triplet pairing state as the ground state of the newly discovered
super-conductor $LaO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$.The pairing mechanism involves both the
special shape of the electron fermi surface and the strong ferromagnetic
fluctuation induced by Hund's rule coupling.The special behavior of the
Bogoliubov quasi-particle spectrum may leads to "Fermi arc" like anisotropy
super-conducting gap, which can be detected by angle resolved photo
emission(ARPES).The impurity effects are also discussed.
