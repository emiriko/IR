In this paper we propose a generalization of the concept of symmetric fuzzy
measure based in a decomposition of the universal set in what we have called
subsets of indifference. Some properties of these measures are studied, as well
as their Choquet integral. Finally, a degree of interaction between the subsets
of indifference is defined.
