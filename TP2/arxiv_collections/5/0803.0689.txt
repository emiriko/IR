We extend the analysis of a thermal Brownian motor reported in Phys. Rev.
Lett. 93, 090601 (2004) by C. Van den Broeck, R. Kawai, and P. Meurs to a
three-dimensional configuration. We calculate the friction coefficient,
diffusion coefficient, and drift velocity as a function of shape and present
estimates based on physically realistic parameter values.
