We use the Gutzwiller variational theory to investigate the electronic and
the magnetic properties of fcc-Nickel. Our particular focus is on the effects
of the spin-orbit coupling. Unlike standard relativistic band-structure
theories, we reproduce the experimental magnetic moment direction and we
explain the change of the Fermi-surface topology that occurs when the magnetic
moment direction is rotated by an external magnetic field. The Fermi surface in
our calculation deviates from early de-Haas--van-Alphen (dHvA) results. We
attribute these discrepancies to an incorrect interpretation of the raw dHvA
data.
