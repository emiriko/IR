We have obtained the quantum phase diagram of one dimensional extended
Bose-Hubbard model using the density-matrix renormalization group and Abelian
bosonization methods for different commensurabilities. We describe the nature
of different quantum phases at the charge degeneracy point. We find a direct
phase transition from Mott insulating phase to superconducting phase for
integer band fillings of bosons. We predict explicitly the presence of two
kinds of repulsive Luttinger liquid phases, apart from the charge density wave
and superconducting phases for half-integer band fillings. Our study reveals
that extended range interactions are necessary to get the correct phase
boundary of an one-dimensional interacting bosons system.
