According to the Bell theorem, local hidden variable theories cannot
reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics. An important consequence is
that under physically reasonable assumptions quantum mechanics predicts
correlations that seem impossible to obtain from a realistic system. In this
paper, two simple binary apparatuses are discussed that can accurately mimic
correlations predicted by quantum mechanics \textit{if} the correlations are
determined by a coincidence measurement as is commonly done. It is argued that
in order to exclude local hidden variables, coincidence monitors should be
avoided.
