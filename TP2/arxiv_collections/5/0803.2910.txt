The channel $D_s^+\to p\bar n$ is the only kinematically allowed baryonic D
decay. It proceeds solely through the W-annihilation topology. Hence, a recent
observation of this mode by CLEO will shed light on the dynamics of
W-annihilation. At the short-distance level, its branching ratio is very small,
of order $10^{-6}$, owing to chiral suppression. It receives long-distance
contributions through final-state scattering of the leading tree and
color-suppressed amplitudes. Assuming that the long-distance enhancement of
W-annihilation in the baryonic D decay is similar to that in the mesonic
$D_s^+$ decay, where the latter can be obtained from the analysis of the
diagrammatic approach, we find that $D_s^+\to p\bar n$ becomes visible. The
observation of this baryonic D decay implies the dynamical enhancement of the
W-annihilation topology in the $D_s^+$ decay.
