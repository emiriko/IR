We discuss existence, uniqueness, and space-time H\"older regularity for
solutions of the parabolic stochastic evolution equation dU(t) = (AU(t) +
F(t,U(t))) dt + B(t,U(t)) dW_H(t), t\in [0,\Tend], U(0) = u_0, where $A$
generates an analytic $C_0$-semigroup on a UMD Banach space $E$ and $W_H$ is a
cylindrical Brownian motion with values in a Hilbert space $H$. We prove that
if the mappings $F:[0,T]\times E\to E$ and $B:[0,T]\times E\to
\mathscr{L}(H,E)$ satisfy suitable Lipschitz conditions and $u_0$ is
$\F_0$-measurable and bounded, then this problem has a unique mild solution,
which has trajectories in $C^\l([0,T];\D((-A)^\theta)$ provided $\lambda\ge 0$
and $\theta\ge 0$ satisfy $\l+\theta<\frac12$. Various extensions of this
result are given and the results are applied to parabolic stochastic partial
differential equations.
