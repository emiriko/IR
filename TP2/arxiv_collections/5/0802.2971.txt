Myron Mathisson (1897-1940) was a Polish Jew known for his work on the
equations of motion of bodies in general relativity and for developing a new
method to analyze the properties of fundamental solutions of linear hyperbolic
differential equations. In particular, he derived the equations for a spinning
body moving in a gravitational field and proved, in a special case, the
Hadamard conjecture on the class of equations that satisfy the Huygens
principle. His work still exerts influence on current research. Drawing on
various archival and secondary sources, in particular his correspondence with
Einstein, we outline Mathisson's biography and scientific career.
