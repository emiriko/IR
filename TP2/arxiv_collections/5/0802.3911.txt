A two-year Large Aperture Quadrupole (WQB) Project was completed in the
summer of 2006 at Fermilab. Nine WQBs were designed, fabricated and
bench-tested by the Technical Division. Seven of them were installed in the
Main Injector and the other two for spares. They perform well. The aperture
increase meets the design goal and the perturbation to the lattice is minimal.
The machine acceptance in the injection and extraction regions is increased
from 40pi to 60pi mm-mrad. This paper gives a brief report of the operation and
performance of these magnets.
