We investigate the influence of impurities and vacancies in the formation of
magnetic moment in CaB6 using full potential ab initio band structure
calculations. CaB6 is found to be a band insulator with a band gap of about 0.2
eV. The calculated results indicate that carbon and oxygen substitution in
boron sublattice, usually expected as impurity in low purity borons, do not
play significant role in the local moment formation. Boron vacancy in the boron
sublattice, on the other hand, leads to the formation of an impurity band in
the vicinity of the Fermi level, which exhibit finite exchange splitting and
magnetic moment. All these results provide remarkable representation of the
experimental results. This finding of the role of vacancies in the sublattice
responsible for electronic conduction is an important revelation in the
understanding of ferromagnetism in the diluted electron system.
