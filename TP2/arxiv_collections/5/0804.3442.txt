A quantum network is an open system consisting of several component Markovian
input-output subsystems interconnected by boson field channels carrying quantum
stochastic signals. Generalizing the work of Chebotarev and Gregoratti, we
formulate the model description by prescribing a candidate Hamiltonian for the
network including details the component systems, the field channels, their
interconnections, interactions and any time delays arising from the geometry of
the network. (We show that the candidate is a symmetric operator and proceed
modulo the proof of self-adjointness.) The model is non-Markovian for finite
time delays, but in the limit where these delays vanish we recover a Markov
model and thereby deduce the rules for introducing feedback into arbitrary
quantum networks. The type of feedback considered includes that mediated by the
use of beam splitters. We are therefore able to give a system-theoretic
approach to introducing connections between quantum mechanical state-based
input-output systems, and give a unifying treatment using non-commutative
fractional linear, or Mobius, transformations.
