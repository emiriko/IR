When moving from native to light activated bacteriorhodopsin, modification of
charge transport consisting of an increase of conductance is correlated to the
protein conformational change. A theoretical model based on a map of the
protein tertiary structure into a resistor network is implemented to account
for a sequential tunneling mechanism of charge transfer through neighbouring
amino acids. The model is validated by comparison with current-voltage
experiments. The predictability of the model is further tested on bovine
rhodopsin, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) also sensitive to light. In this
case, results show an opposite behaviour with a decrease of conductance in the
presence of light.
