We review the status of QCD at hadron colliders with emphasis on precision
predictions and the latest theoretical developments for cross sections
calculations to higher orders. We include an overview of our current
information on parton distributions and discuss various Standard Model
reactions such as W/Z-boson, Higgs boson or top quark production.
