We have trapped large numbers of copper and silver atoms using buffer gas
cooling. Up to 3x10^12 copper atoms and 4x10^13 silver atoms are trapped.
Lifetimes are as long as 5 s, limited by collisions with the buffer gas. Ratios
of elastic to inelastic collision rates with He are >~ 10^6, suggesting copper
and silver are favorable for use in ultracold applications. The temperature
dependence of the silver-helium-3 collision rate varies as T^5.8. We find that
this temperature dependence is inconsistent with the behavior predicted for
relaxation arising from the spin-rotation interaction, and conclude that the
silver-helium-3 system displays anomalous collisional behavior in the
multiple-partial wave regime. Lifetimes of laser ablated gold in helium-3
buffer gas are too short to permit trapping.
