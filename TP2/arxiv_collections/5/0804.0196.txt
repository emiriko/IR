We present how a worm hole bridge from a prior to the present universe allows
us to use symmetry arguments which allow us to generate relic gravity waves,
and also non massless gravitons. The relic gravitons are produced due to
thermal / vacuum energy transferral from a prior universe using a pseudo time
dependent version of the Wheeler De Witt equation as presented by Crowell
(2005)
