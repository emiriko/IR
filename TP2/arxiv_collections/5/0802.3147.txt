We use a continued fraction approximation to calculate the RPA response
function of nuclear matter. The convergence of the approximation is assessed by
comparing with the numerically exact response function obtained with a typical
effective finite-range interaction used in nuclear physics. It is shown that
just the first order term of the expansion can give reliable results at
densities up to the saturation density value.
