A nearly unstable sequence of stationary spatial autoregressive processes is
investigated, when the sum of the absolute values of the autoregressive
coefficients tends to one. It is shown that after an appropriate norming the
least squares estimator for these coefficients has a normal limit distribution.
If none of the parameters equals zero than the typical rate of convergence is
n.
