Spreadsheets often need changing in ways made tedious and risky by Excel. For
example: simultaneously altering many tables' size, orientation, and position;
inserting cross-tabulations; moving data between sheets; splitting and merging
sheets. A safer, faster restructuring tool is, we claim, Excelsior. The result
of a research project into reducing spreadsheet risk, Excelsior is the first
ever tool for modularising spreadsheets; i.e. for building them from components
which can be independently created, tested, debugged, and updated. It
represents spreadsheets in a way that makes these components explicit,
separates them from layout, and allows both components and layout to be changed
without breaking dependent formulae. Here, we report experiments to test that
this does indeed make such changes easier. In one, we automatically generated a
cross-tabulation and added it to a spreadsheet. In the other, we generated new
versions of a 10,000-cell housing-finance spreadsheet containing many
interconnected 20*40 tables. We varied table sizes from 5*10 to 200*2,000;
moved tables between sheets; and flipped table orientations. Each change
generated a spreadsheet with different structure but identical outputs; each
change took just a few minutes.
