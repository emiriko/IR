We consider the Langevin equation describing a stochastically perturbed by
uniform noise non-viscous Burgers fluid and introduce a deterministic function
that corresponds to the mean of the velocity when we keep the value of position
fixed. We study interrelations between this function and the solution of the
non-perturbed Burgers equation. Especially we are interested in the property of
the solution of the latter equation to develop unbounded gradients within a
finite time. We study the question how the initial distribution of particles
for the Langevin equation influences this blowup phenomenon. It is shown that
for a wide class of initial data and initial distributions of particles the
unbounded gradients are eliminated. The case of a linear initial velocity is
particular. We show that if the initial distribution of particles is uniform,
then the mean of the velocity for a given position coincides with the solution
of the Burgers equation and in particular does not depend on the constant
variance of the stochastic perturbation. Further, for a one space space
variable we get the following result: if the decay rate of the power-behaved
initial particles distribution at infinity is greater or equal $|x|^{-2},$ then
the blowup is suppressed, otherwise, the blowup takes place at the same moment
of time as in the case of the non-perturbed Burgers equation.
