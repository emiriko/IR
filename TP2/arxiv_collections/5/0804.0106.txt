In this paper we present an analysis of the multiple hadron production
induced by primary heavy quarks in e+e- annihilation with the account of most
complete and corrected experimental data. In the framework of perturbative QCD,
new theoretical bounds on the asymptotically constant differences of the
multiplicities in processes with light and heavy quarks are given.
