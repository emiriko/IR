Starting from positive and negative helicity Maxwell equations expressed in
Riemann-Silberstein vectors, we derive the ten usual and ten additional
Poincar{\'e} invariants, the latter being related to the electromagnetic spin,
i.e., the intrinsic rotation, or state of polarization, of the electromagnetic
fields. Some of these invariants have apparently not been discussed in the
literature before.
