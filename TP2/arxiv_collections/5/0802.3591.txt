A new method to determine the low-energy couplings of the $\Delta S=1$ weak
Hamiltonian is presented. It relies on a matching of the topological poles in
$1/m^2$ of three-point correlators of two pseudoscalar densities and a
four-fermion operator, measured in lattice QCD, to the same observables
computed in the $\epsilon$-regime of chiral perturbation theory. We test this
method in a theory with a light charm quark, i.e. with an SU(4) flavour
symmetry. Quenched numerical measurements are performed in a 2 fm box, and
chiral perturbation theory predictions are worked out up to next-to-leading
order. The matching of the two sides allows to determine the weak low-energy
couplings in the SU(4) limit. We compare the results with a previous
determination, based on three-point correlators containing two left-handed
currents, and discuss the merits and drawbacks of the two procedures.
