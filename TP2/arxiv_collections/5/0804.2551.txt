Let $\Delta\subsetneq\V$ be a proper subset of the vertices $\V$ of the
defining graph of an aperiodic shift of finite type $(\Sigma_{A}^{+},\S)$. Let
$\Delta_{n}$ be the union of cylinders in $\Sigma_{A}^{+}$ corresponding to the
points $x$ for which the first $n$-symbols of $x$ belong to $\Delta$ and let
$\mu$ be an equilibrium state of a H\"older potential $\phi$ on
$\Sigma_{A}^{+}$. We know that $\mu(\Delta_{n})$ converges to zero as $n$
diverges. We study the asymptotic behaviour of $\mu(\Delta_{n})$ and compare it
with the pressure of the restriction of $\phi$ to $\Sigma_{\Delta}$. The
present paper extends some results in \cite{CCC} to the case when
$\Sigma_{\Delta}$ is irreducible and periodic. We show an explicit example
where the asymptotic behaviour differs from the aperiodic case.
