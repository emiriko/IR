The status and plans of a research program on the development of
ultra-low-energy germanium detectors with sub-keV sensitivities are reported.
We survey the scientific goals which include the observation of
neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering, the studies of neutrino magnetic moments,
as well as the searches of WIMP dark matter. In particular, a threshold of
100-200 eV and a sub-keV background comparable to underground experiments were
achieved with prototype detectors. New limits were set for WIMPs with mass
between 3-6 GeV. The prospects of the realization of full-scale experiments are
discussed.
