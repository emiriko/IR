The Pauli Exclusion Principle is one of the basic principles of modern
physics and is at the very basis of our understanding of matter: thus it is
fundamental importance to test the limits of its validity. Here we present the
VIP (Violation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle) experiment, where we search
for anomalous X-rays emitted by copper atoms in a conductor: any detection of
these anomalous X-rays would mark a Pauli-forbidden transition. ] VIP is
currently taking data at the Gran Sasso underground laboratories, and its
scientific goal is to improve by at least four orders of magnitude the previous
limit on the probability of Pauli violating transitions, bringing it into the
10**-29 - 10**-30 region. First experimental results, together with future
plans, are presented.
