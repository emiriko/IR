The commonly accepted description of transition to turbulence in shear flows
requires the presence of an external source of disturbances that get amplified
by an essentially linear mechanism up to the point where breakdown to
turbulence occurs. Microscopic fluctuations are shown here to provide just the
right amount of initial disturbances to match the predictions of linear
stability theory.
