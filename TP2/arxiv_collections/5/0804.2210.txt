We consider the application of a small in-plane magnetic field to electrons
on a helium surface in a perpendicular magnetic field. Certain states that were
bound to the helium surface then dissolve into the continuum turning into
long-lived resonances. As a result microwave absorption lines acquire an
asymmetric Fano lineshape that is tunable by varying the microwave polarisation
or the in-plane magnetic field. Electrons trapped in a formerly bound state
will tunnel off the surface of helium; we show that under suitable
circumstances this ``radioactive decay'' can show damped oscillations rather
than a simple exponential decay. The mechanism for oscillatory exponential
decay is not specific to electrons on Helium and this effect may also be
relevant elsewhere in physics.
