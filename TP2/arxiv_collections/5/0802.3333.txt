We calculate all the 2 to 2 scattering process in Yang-Mills theory in the
Light Cone gauge, with the dimensional regulator as the UV regulator. The IR is
regulated with a cutoff in $q^+$. It supplements our earlier work, where a
Lorentz non-covariant regulator was used and the final results bear some
problems in gauge fixing. Supersymmetry relations among various amplitudes are
checked using the light cone superfields.
