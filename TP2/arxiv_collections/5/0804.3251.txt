Interpretation of D-meson decay-dynamics has revealed itself to be strongly
dependent on our understanding of the light-meson sector. The interplay becomes
particularly evident in Dalitz plot analyses to study physics within and beyond
the Standard Model. Experience and results from FOCUS are presented and
discussed. A brief update of the pentaquark search in the experiment is also
reported.
