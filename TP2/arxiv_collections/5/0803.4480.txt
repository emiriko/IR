ARCH and GARCH models assume either i.i.d. or (what economists lable as)
white noise as is usual in regression analysis while assuming memory in a
conditional mean square fluctuation with stationary increments. We will show
that ARCH/GARCH is inconsistent with uncorrelated increments, violating the
i.i.d. and white assumptions and finance data and the efficient market
hypothesis as well.
