As a limiting case of ultracold atoms trapped in deep optical lattices, we
consider two interacting atoms trapped in a general anisotropic harmonic
oscillator potential, and obtain exact solutions of the Schrodinger equation
for this system. The energy spectra for different geometries of the trapping
potential are compared.
