We study the SO(8) superconformal theory proposed recently by Bagger and
Lambert as a possible worldvolume theory for multiple M2-branes. For their
explicit example with gauge group SO(4), we rewrite the theory (originally
formulated in terms of a three-algebra) as an ordinary SU(2) \times SU(2) gauge
theory with bifundamental matter. In this description, the parity invariance of
the theory, required for a proper description of M2-branes, is clarified. We
describe the subspace of scalar field configurations on which the potential
vanishes, and note that this does not coincide with the moduli space for a
stack of M2-branes. Finally, we point out a difficulty in constructing the
required set of superconformal primary operators which should be present in the
correct theory describing multiple M2-branes.
