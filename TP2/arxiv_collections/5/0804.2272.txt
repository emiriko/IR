We present new nonlinear differential equations for spacetime correlation
functions of Fermi gas in one spatial dimension. The correlation functions we
consider describe non-stationary processes out of equilibrium. The equations we
obtain are integrable equations. They generalize known nonlinear differential
equations for correlation functions at equilibrium and provide vital tools to
study non-equilibrium dynamics of electronic systems. The method we developed
is based only on Wick's theorem and the hydrodynamic description of the Fermi
gas. Differential equations appear directly in bilinear form.
