Wave-breaking is studied analytically first and the results are compared with
accurate numerical simulations of 3D wave-breaking. We focus on the time
dependence of various quantities becoming singular at the onset of breaking.
The power laws derived from general arguments and the singular behavior of
solutions of nonlinear hyperbolic differential equations are in excellent
agreement with the numerical results. This shows the power of the analysis by
methods using generic concepts of nonlinear science.
