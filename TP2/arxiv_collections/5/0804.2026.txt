This case study of a typical U.S. particle physics experiment explores the
issues of gender bias and how it affects the academic career advancement
prospects of women in the field of physics beyond the postdoctoral level; we
use public databases to study the career paths of the full cohort of 57 former
postdoctoral researchers on the Run II Dzero experiment to examine if males and
females were treated in a gender-blind fashion on the experiment.
  The study finds that the female researchers were on average significantly
more productive compared to their male peers, yet were allocated only 1/3 the
amount of conference presentations based on their productivity. The study also
finds that the dramatic gender bias in allocation of conference presentations
appeared to have significant negative impact on the academic career advancement
of the females.
