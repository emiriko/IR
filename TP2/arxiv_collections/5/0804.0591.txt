We study the out-of-equilibrium current through a multilevel quantum dot
contacted to two superconducting leads and in the presence of Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings, in the regime of strong dot-lead coupling.
The multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) subgap peaks in the current voltage
characteristics are found to be modified (but not suppressed) by the spin-orbit
interaction, in a way that strongly depends on the shape of the dot confining
potential. In a perfectly isotropic dot the MAR peaks are enhanced when the
strength $\alpha_R$ and $\alpha_D$ of Rashba and Dresselhaus terms are equal.
When the anisotropy of the dot confining potential increases the dependence of
the subgap structure on the spin-orbit angle
$\theta=\arctan(\alpha_D/\alpha_R)$ decreases. Furthermore, when an in-plane
magnetic field is applied to a strongly anisotropic dot, the peaks of the
non-linear conductance oscillate as a function of the magnetic field angle, and
the location of the maxima and minima allows for a straightforward read-out of
the spin-orbit angle $\theta$.
