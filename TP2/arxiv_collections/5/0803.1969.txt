Using the real-time diagrammatic technique and taking into account both the
sequential and cotunneling processes, we analyze the transport properties of
single-wall metallic carbon nanotubes coupled to nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic
leads in the full range of parameters. In particular, considering the two
different shell filling schemes of the nanotubes, we discuss the behavior of
the differential conductance, tunnel magnetoresistance and the shot noise. We
show that in the Coulomb diamonds corresponding to even occupations, the shot
noise becomes super-Poissonian due to bunching of fast tunneling processes
resulting from the dynamical channel blockade, whereas in the other diamonds
the noise is roughly Poissonian, in agreement with recent experiments. The
tunnel magnetoresistance is very sensitive to the number of electrons in the
nanotube and exhibits a distinctively different behavior depending on the shell
filling sequence of the nanotube.
