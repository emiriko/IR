A new analysis of the precise experimental astrophysical S-factors for the
direct capture $^7Be(p,\gamma)$ $^8B$ reaction [A.J.Junghans et al.Phys.Rev. C
68 (2003) 065803 and L.T. Baby et al. Phys.Rev. C 67 (2003) 065805] is carried
out based on the modified two - body potential approach in which the direct
astrophysical S-factor, $ {\rm S_{17}(E)}$, is expressed in terms of the
asymptotic normalization constants for $p+^7Be\to ^8B$ and two additional
conditions are involved to verify the peripheral character of the reaction
under consideration. The Woods-Saxon potential form is used for the bound
($p+^7Be$)- state wave function and for the $p^7Be$- scattering wave function.
New estimates are obtained for the $^{\glqq}$indirectly measured\grqq values of
the asymptotic normalization constants (the nuclear vertex constants) for the
$p+^7Be\to ^8B$ and $S_{17}(E)$ at E$\le$ 115 keV, including $E$=0. These
values of $S_{17}(E)$ and asymptotic normalization constants have been used for
getting information about the $^{\glqq}$indirectly measured\grqq values of the
$s$ wave average scattering length and the $p$ wave effective range parameters
for $p^7Be$- scattering.
