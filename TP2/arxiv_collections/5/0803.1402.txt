The layer interdependence of transport in an undoped electron-hole bilayer
(uEHBL) device was studied as a function of carrier density, interlayer
electric field, and temperature. The uEHBL device consisted of a density
tunable, independently contacted two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and
two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) induced via field effect in distinct GaAs
quantum wells separated by a 30 nm Al$_{0.9}$Ga$_{0.1}$As barrier. Transport
measurements were made simultaneously on each layer using the van der Pauw
method. An increase in 2DHG mobility with increasing 2DEG density was observed,
while the 2DEG mobility showed negligible dependence on the 2DHG density.
Decreasing the interlayer electric-field and thereby increasing interlayer
separation also increased the 2DHG mobility with negligible effects on the 2DEG
mobility. The change in interlayer separation as interlayer electric-field
changed was estimated using 2DHG Coulomb drag measurements. The results were
consistent with mobility of each layer being only indirectly dependent on the
adjacent layer density and dominated by background impurity scattering.
Temperature dependencies were also determined for the resistivity of each
layer.
