Recently, the theory of quantum error control codes has been extended to
subsystem codes over symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels -- qubit-flip
and phase-shift errors may have equal or different probabilities. Previous work
in constructing quantum error control codes has focused on code constructions
for symmetric quantum channels. In this paper, we develop a theory and
establish the connection between asymmetric quantum codes and subsystem codes.
We present families of subsystem and asymmetric quantum codes derived, once
again, from classical BCH and RS codes over finite fields. Particularly, we
derive an interesting asymmetric and symmetric subsystem codes based on
classical BCH codes with parameters $[[n,k,r,d]]_q$, $[[n,k,r,d_z/d_x]]_q$ and
$[[n,k',0,d_z/d_x]]_q$ for arbitrary values of code lengths and dimensions. We
establish asymmetric Singleton and Hamming bounds on asymmetric quantum and
subsystem code parameters; and derive optimal asymmetric MDS subsystem codes.
Finally, our constructions are well explained by an illustrative example.
  This paper is written on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the
discovery of classical BCH codes and their quantum counterparts were derived
nearly 10 years ago.
