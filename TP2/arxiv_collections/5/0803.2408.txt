We investigate theoretically the spin transport in two-terminal mesoscopic
rings in the presence of both the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI) and the
Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction (DSOI). We find that the interplay between
the RSOI and DSOI breaks the original cylindric symmetry of mesoscopic ring and
consequently leads to the anisotropic spin transport, i.e., the conductance is
sensitive to the positions of the incoming and outgoing leads. The anisotropic
spin transport can survive even in the presence of disorder caused by impurity
elastic scattering in a realistic system.
