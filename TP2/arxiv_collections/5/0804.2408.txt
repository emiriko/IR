A collection of results is presented relevant for the analysis of azimuthal
asymmetries in inclusive two-hadron production at BELLE. The aim of this
overview is to provide theoretical ingredients necessary to extract the Collins
effect fragmentation function. The latter arises within the Collins-Soper
factorization formalism, which describes both the transverse momentum and Q^2
dependence of the cross section and its angular dependences at low and moderate
transverse momentum. Since the Collins effect is not the only source of angular
dependences, a discussion of various other effects is included. This concerns
higher twist contributions, photon-Z-boson interference effects, radiative
corrections, beam polarization and weak decays. Furthermore, different frames,
transverse momentum weighting and ratios of asymmetries are discussed. These
issues are all of relevance for the unambiguous measurement of the Collins
effect.
