We experimentally prepare a new type of continuous variable genuine
four-partite entangled states, the quantum correlation property of which is
different from that of the four-mode GHZ and cluster states, and which has not
any qubit counterpart to be proposed at present. In the criterion inequalities
for the full inseparability of the genuine four-partite entangled states, the
amplitude and phase quadrature correlation variances totally consisting of
three-party combination from the four entangled modes are involved. The
measured correlation variances among the quadratures of the prepared entangled
states satisfy the sufficient requirements for the full inseparability. The
type of entangled states has especially potential application in quantum
information with continuous quantum variables.
