We investigate the magnetic properties of nano-holes (NHs) patterned in
graphene using first principles calculations. We show that superlattices
consisting of a periodic array of NHs form a new family of 2D crystalline
"bulk" magnets whose collective magnetic behavior is governed by inter-NH
spin-spin interaction. They exhibit long-range magnetic order well above room
temperature. Furthermore, magnetic semiconductors can be made by doping
magnetic NHs into semiconducting NH superlattices. Our findings offer a new
material system for fundamental studies of spin-spin interaction and magnetic
ordering in low dimensions, and open up the exciting opportunities of making
engineered magnetic materials for storage media and spintronics applications.
