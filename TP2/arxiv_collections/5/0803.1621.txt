Agent-based modelling and simulation offers a new and exciting way of
understanding the world of work. In this paper we describe the development of
an agent-based simulation model, designed to help to understand the
relationship between human resource management practices and retail
productivity. We report on the current development of our simulation model
which includes new features concerning the evolution of customers over time. To
test some of these features we have conducted a series of experiments dealing
with customer pool sizes, standard and noise reduction modes, and the spread of
the word of mouth. Our multi-disciplinary research team draws upon expertise
from work psychologists and computer scientists. Despite the fact we are
working within a relatively novel and complex domain, it is clear that
intelligent agents offer potential for fostering sustainable organisational
capabilities in the future.
