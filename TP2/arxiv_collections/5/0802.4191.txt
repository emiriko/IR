The HyperCarte research group wishes to offer a new cartographic tool for
spatial analysis of social data, using the potential smoothing method. The
purpose of this method is to view the spreading of phenomena's in a continuous
way, at a macroscopic scale, basing on data sampled on administrative areas. We
aim to offer an interactive tool, accessible via the Web, but guarantying the
confidentiality of data. The major difficulty is induced by the high complexity
of the calculus, working on a great amount of data. We present our solution to
such a technical challenge, and our perspectives of enhancements.
