This research report introduces the generation of textual entailment within
the project CSIEC (Computer Simulation in Educational Communication), an
interactive web-based human-computer dialogue system with natural language for
English instruction. The generation of textual entailment (GTE) is critical to
the further improvement of CSIEC project. Up to now we have found few
literatures related with GTE. Simulating the process that a human being learns
English as a foreign language we explore our naive approach to tackle the GTE
problem and its algorithm within the framework of CSIEC, i.e. rule annotation
in NLML, pattern recognition (matching), and entailment transformation. The
time and space complexity of our algorithm is tested with some entailment
examples. Further works include the rules annotation based on the English
textbooks and a GUI interface for normal users to edit the entailment rules.
