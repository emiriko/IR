We consider the Dirac equation on the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole background.
We first perform the variable separation for the Dirac equation and define the
Hamiltonian operator $\hat H$. Then we show that for a massive Dirac field with
mass $\mu\geq \frac{1}{2l}$ essential selfadjointness of $\hat H$ on
$C_0^{\infty} ((r_+,\infty) \times S^2)^4$ is obtained even in presence of the
boundary-like behavior of infinity in an asymptotically AdS black hole
background. Furthermore qualitative spectral properties of the Hamiltonian are
taken into account and in agreement with the existing results concerning the
case of stationary axi-symmetric asymptotically flat black holes we infer the
absence of time-periodic and normalizable solutions of the Dirac equation
around the black hole in the non-extremal case.
