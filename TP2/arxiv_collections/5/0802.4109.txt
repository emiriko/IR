We study the process of low-energy electron capture by the SF6 molecule. Our
approach is based on the model of Gauyacq and Herzenberg [J. Phys. B 17, 1155
(1984)] in which the electron motion is coupled to the fully symmetric
vibrational mode through a weakly bound or virtual s state. By tuning the two
free parameters of the model, we achieve an accurate description of the
measured electron attachment cross section and good agreement with vibrational
excitation cross sections of the fully symmetric mode. An extension of the
model provides a limit on the characteristic time of intramolecular vibrational
relaxation in highly-excited SF6-. By evaluating the total vibrational spectrum
density of SF6-, we estimate the widths of the vibrational Feshbach resonances
of the long-lived negative ion. We also analyse the possible distribution of
the widths and its effect on the lifetime measurements, and investigate
nonexponential decay features in metastable SF6-.
