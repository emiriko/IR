By using cocycle deformation, we construct a certain class of Hopf algebras,
containing the quantized enveloping algebras and their analogues, from what we
call pre-Nichols algebras. Our construction generalizes in some sense the known
construction by (generalized) quantum doubles, but unlike in the known
situation, it saves us from difficulties in checking complicated defining
relations.
