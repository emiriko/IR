The interlace polynomial q was introduced by Arratia, Bollobas, and Sorkin.
It encodes many properties of the orbit of a graph under edge local
complementation (ELC). The interlace polynomial Q, introduced by Aigner and van
der Holst, similarly contains information about the orbit of a graph under
local complementation (LC). We have previously classified LC and ELC orbits,
and now give an enumeration of the corresponding interlace polynomials of all
graphs of order up to 12. An enumeration of all circle graphs of order up to 12
is also given. We show that there exist graphs of all orders greater than 9
with interlace polynomials q whose coefficient sequences are non-unimodal,
thereby disproving a conjecture by Arratia et al. We have verified that for
graphs of order up to 12, all polynomials Q have unimodal coefficients. It has
been shown that LC and ELC orbits of graphs correspond to equivalence classes
of certain error-correcting codes and quantum states. We show that the
properties of these codes and quantum states are related to properties of the
associated interlace polynomials.
