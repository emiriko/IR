Axigluons are colored heavy neutral gauge boson that are predicted by some
theories. The most important model-independent manifestation of axigluons is
the generation of a forward--backward asymmetry in top-antitop quark production
at $p\bar{p}$ collisions which originates from the charge asymmetry. We update
our previous analysis for the inclusive QCD induced forward--backward asymmetry
and define a new observable which is more sensitive to the effect than the
forward--backward asymmetry. We find a lower limit of 1.4 TeV at 90% C.L. on
the axigluon mass from recent measurements of the asymmetry at Tevatron, and
extend the analysis to LHC in suitably selected samples. Like at Tevatron, the
charge asymmetry can probe larger values of the axigluon mass than the dijet
mass distribution.
