Tunneling spectroscopy was performed on Nb pieces prepared by the same
processes used to etch and clean superconducting radio frequency (SRF)
cavities. Air exposed, electropolished Nb exhibited a surface superconducting
gap delta=1.55 meV, characteristic of clean, bulk Nb. However the tunneling
density of states (DOS) was broadened significantly. The Nb pieces treated with
the same mild baking used to improve the Q-slope in SRF cavities, reveal a
sharper DOS. Good fits to the DOS were obtained using Shiba theory, suggesting
that magnetic scattering of quasiparticles is the origin of the gapless surface
superconductivity and a heretofore unrecognized contributor to the Q-slope
problem of Nb SRF cavities.
