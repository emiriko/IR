We study the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an attractive delta function
potential and show that in the high velocity limit an incident soliton is split
into reflected and transmitted soliton components plus a small amount of
dispersion. We give explicit analytic formulas for the reflected and
transmitted portions, while the remainder takes the form of an error. Although
the existence of a bound state for this potential introduces difficulties not
present in the case of a repulsive potential, we show that the proportion of
the soliton which is trapped at the origin vanishes in the limit.
