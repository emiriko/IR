In this note we clarify the dictionary between pure quantum gravity on the
bulk in the presence of a cosmological constant and a CFT on the boundary. We
show for instance that there is a general correspondence between quantum
gravity ``radial states'' and a pair of CFT's. Restricting to one CFT is argued
to correspond to states possessing an asymptotic infinity. This point of view
allows us to address the problem of reconstructing the bulk from the boundary.
And in the second part of this paper we present an explicit formula which
gives, from the partition function of any 2 dimensional conformal field theory,
a wave functional solution to the 3-dimensional Wheeler-DeWitt equation. This
establishes at the quantum level a precise dictionary between 2d CFT and pure
gravity.
