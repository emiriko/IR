Tensile tests were carried out by deforming polycrystalline samples of
substitutional Al-2.5%Mg alloy at room temperature for a range of strain rates.
The Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was observed throughout the strain rate
regime. The deformation bands in this region are found to be of type A in
nature. From the analysis of the experimental stress time series data we could
infer that the dynamics of type A dislocation band propagation is a Markov
process.
