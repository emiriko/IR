We discuss a semiclassical calculation of low energy charge transport in
one-dimensional (1d) insulators with a focus on Mott insulators, whose charge
degrees of freedom are gapped due to the combination of short range
interactions and a periodic lattice potential. Combining RG and instanton
methods, we calculate the nonlinear ac conductivity and interpret the result in
terms of multi-photon absorption. We compare the result of the semiclassical
calculation for interacting systems to a perturbative, fully quantum mechanical
calculation of multi-photon absorption in a 1d band insulator and find good
agreement when the number of simultaneously absorbed photons is large.
