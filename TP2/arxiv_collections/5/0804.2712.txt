The electronic structures of the Heusler type compounds Fe$_{3-x}V$_x$Si in
the concentration range between x = 0 and x = 1 have been probed by
photoemission spectroscopy (PES). The observed shift of Si 2p core- level and
the main valence band structres indicate a chemical potential shift to higher
energy with increasing x. It is also clarified that the density of state at
Fermi edge is owing to the collaboration of V 3d and Fe 3d derived states.
Besides the decrease of the spectral intensity near Fermi edge with increasing
x suggests the formation of pseudo gap at large x.
