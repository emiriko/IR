This report presents the implementation of a protein sequence comparison
algorithm specifically designed for speeding up time consuming part on parallel
hardware such as SSE instructions, multicore architectures or graphic boards.
Three programs have been developed: PLAST-P, TPLAST-N and PLAST-X. They provide
equivalent results compared to the NCBI BLAST family programs (BLAST-P,
TBLAST-N and BLAST-X) with a speed-up factor ranging from 5 to 10.
