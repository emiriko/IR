We show that Andreev reflection in a junction between ferromagnetic (F) and
superconducting (S) graphene regions is fundamentally different from the common
FS junctions. For a weakly doped F graphene with an exchange field $h$ larger
than its Fermi energy $E_{\rm F}$, Andreev reflection of massless Dirac
fermions is associated with a Klein tunneling through an exchange field p-n
barrier between two spin-split conduction and valence subbands. We find that
this Andreev-Klein process results in an enhancement of the subgap conductance
of a graphene FS junction by $h$ up to the point at which the conductance at
low voltages $eV\ll \Delta$ is greater than its value for the corresponding
non-ferromagnetic junction. We also demonstrate that the Andreev reflection can
be of retro or specular types in both convergent and divergent ways with the
reflection direction aligned, respectively, closer to and farther from the
normal to the junction as compared to the incidence direction.
