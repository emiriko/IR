In the phase space of the integrable Hamiltonian system with three degrees of
freedom used to describe the motion of a Kowalevski-type top in a double
constant force field, we point out the four-dimensional invariant manifold. It
is shown that this manifold consists of critical motions generating a smooth
sheet of the bifurcation diagram, and the induced dynamic system is Hamiltonian
with certain subset of points of degeneration of the symplectic structure. We
find the transformation separating variables in this system. As a result, the
solutions can be represented in terms of elliptic functions of time. The
corresponding phase topology is completely described.
