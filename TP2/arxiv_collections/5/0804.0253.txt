The authors of this paper studied Schrodinger wave equation to investiagate
the chaotic behavior of atomic energy levels in relation with three quantum
numbers n, l, m by means of derived inequality. It could give rise to the
siplitting of atomic spectral lines. Keywords: Chaos, Schrodinger wave
equation, atomic energy levels
