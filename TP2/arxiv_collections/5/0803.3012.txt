A new mechanism of the production of hypothetical $\Theta(ud\bar{s}ud)^+$
pentaquark state is suggested. The considered mechanism is based on the
exchange by exotic Regge trajectories in the $t$ channel. It is shown that the
momentum distributions of $\Theta^+$ baryons can differ significantly from the
ones of the ordinary hyperons.
