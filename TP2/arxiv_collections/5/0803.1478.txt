We propose a scheme for a ground-code measurement-based quantum computer,
which enjoys two major advantages. First, every logical qubit is encoded in the
gapped degenerate ground subspace of a spin-1 chain with nearest-neighbor
two-body interactions, so that it equips built-in robustness against noise.
Second, computation is processed by single-spin measurements along multiple
chains dynamically coupled on demand, so as to keep teleporting only logical
information into a gap-protected ground state of the residual chains after the
interactions with spins to be measured are turned off. We describe
implementations using trapped atoms or polar molecules in an optical lattice,
where the gap is expected to be as large as 0.2 kHz or 4.8 kHz respectively.
