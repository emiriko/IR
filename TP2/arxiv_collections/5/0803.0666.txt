Companies that collaborate within the product development processes need to
implement an effective management of their collaborative activities. Despite
the implementation of a PLM system, the collaborative activities are not
efficient as it might be expected. This paper presents an analysis of the
problems related to the collaborative work using a PLM system. From this
analysis, we propose an approach for improving collaborative processes within a
PLM system, based on monitoring indicators. This approach leads to identify and
therefore to mitigate the brakes of the collaborative work.
