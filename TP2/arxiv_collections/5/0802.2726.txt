Spin measurements are crucial in distinguishing major scenarios of TeV scale
new physics once it is discovered at the LHC. We give a brief survey of methods
of measuring the spin of new physics particles at the LHC. We focus on the case
in which a long lived massive neutral particle is produced at the end of every
cascade decay and escape detection. This is the case for R-parity preserving
supersymmetry, Little Higgs models with T-parity, extra-dimensional models with
KK-parity, and a large class of similar models and scenarios. After briefly
commenting on measuring spin by combining mass and rate information, we
concentrate on direct measurement by observing angular correlations among decay
products of the new physics particles. We survey a wide range of possible
channels, discuss the construction of possible correlation variables, and
outline experimental challenges. We also briefly survey the Monte-Carlo tools
which are useful in studying such correlations.
