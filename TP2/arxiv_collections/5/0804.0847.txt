We considered spin-two gauge boson production in the fermion pair
annihilation process and calculated the polarized cross sections for each set
of helicity orientations of initial and final particles. The angular dependence
of these cross sections is compared with the similar annihilation cross
sections in QED with two photons in the final state, with two gluons in QCD and
W-pair in Electroweak theory.
