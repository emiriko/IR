We compare medium induced energy loss and $p_{\perp}$-broadening in
perturbative QCD with that of the trailing string picture of SYM theory. We
consider finite and infinite extent matter as well as relativistic heavy quarks
which correspond to those being produced in the medium or external to it. When
expressed in terms of the appropriate saturation momentum, we find identical
parametric forms for energy loss in perturbative QCD and SYM theory. We find
simple correspondences between $p_{\perp}$-broadening in QCD and in SYM theory
although $p_{\perp}$-broadening is radiation dominated in SYM theory and
multiple scattering dominated in perturbative QCD.
