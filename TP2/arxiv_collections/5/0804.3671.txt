We consider a component of the word statistics known as clump; starting from
a finite set of words, clumps are maximal overlapping sets of these
occurrences. This parameter has first been studied by Schbath with the aim of
counting the number of occurrences of words in random texts. Later work with
similar probabilistic approach used the Chen-Stein approximation for a compound
Poisson distribution, where the number of clumps follows a law close to
Poisson. Presently there is no combinatorial counterpart to this approach, and
we fill the gap here. We emphasize the fact that, in contrast with the
probabilistic approach which only provides asymptotic results, the
combinatorial approach provides exact results that are useful when considering
short sequences.
