The main scope of this research consists in evaluating the energy-momentum
(gravitational field plus matter) and gravitational angular momentum densities
in the universe with global rotation, considering the Godel-Obukhov metric. For
this, we use the Hamiltonian formalism of the Teleparallel Equivalent of
General Relativity (TEGR), which is justified for presenting covariant
expressions for the considered quantities. We found that the total energy
density calculated by the TEGR method is in agreement with the results reported
by other authors in the literature using pseudotensors. The result found for
the angular momentum density depends on the rotational parameter as expected.
We also show explicitly the equivalence among the field equations of the TEGR
and Einstein equations (RG), considering a perfect fluid and Godel-Obukhov
metric.
