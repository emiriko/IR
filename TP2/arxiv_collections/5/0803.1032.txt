We extend the former matrix rearrangement approach of the entangling power to
the general cases, without the requirement of the same dimensions of the
subsystems. The entangling power of a unitary operator is completely determined
by its realignment and partial transposition. As applications, we calculate the
entangling power for the Ising interaction and the isotropic Heisenberg
interaction in the mixed qudit system.
