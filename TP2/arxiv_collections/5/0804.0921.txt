A simple Langevin approach is used to study stationary properties of the
Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model for DNA, allowing known properties to be recovered
in an easy way. Results are shown for the denaturation transition in
homogeneous samples, for which some implications, so far overlooked, of an
analogy with equilibrium wetting transitions are highlighted. This analogy
implies that the order-parameter, asymptotically, exhibits a second order
transition even if it may be very abrupt for non-zero values of the stiffness
parameter. Not surprisingly, we also find that for heterogeneous DNA, within
this model the largest bubbles in the pre-melting stage appear in
adenine-thymine rich regions, while we suggest the possibility of some sort of
not strictly local effects owing to the merging of bubbles.
