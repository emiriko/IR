Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed to analyze a recent neutron
diffraction experiment on a distorted triangular lattice compound RbCoBr$_3$.
We consider a spin-lattice model, where both spin and lattice are Ising
variables. This model explains well successive magnetic and dielectric
transitions observed in the experiment. The exchange interaction parameters and
the spin-lattice coupling are estimated. It is found that the spin-lattice
coupling is important to explain the slow growth of a ferrimagnetic order. The
present simulations were made possible by developing a new Monte Carlo
algorithm, which accelerates slow Monte Carlo dynamics of quasi-one-dimensional
frustrated systems.
