We report extraordinary effects in the transmission of sound through
periodically perforated plates, supported by both measurements and theory. In
agreement with recent observations in slit arrays [M. H. Lu et al. Phys. Rev.
Lett. 99, 174301 (2007)], nearly full transmission is observed at certain
resonant frequencies, pointing out at similarities of the acoustic phenomena
and their optical counterpart. However, acoustic screening well beyond that
predicted by the mass law is achieved over a wide range of wavelengths in the
vicinity of the period of the array, resulting in fundamentally unique behavior
of the sound as compared to light. The randomness of the hole distribution and
the impedance contrast between the fluid and the solid plate are found to play
a crucial role.
