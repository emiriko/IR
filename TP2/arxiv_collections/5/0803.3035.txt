Candidates for renormalisable gauge theory models on Moyal spaces constructed
recently have non trivial vacua. We show that these models support vacuum
states that are invariant under both global rotations and symplectic
isomorphisms which form a global symmetry group for the action. We compute the
explicit expression in the position space for these vacuum configurations in
two and four dimensions.
