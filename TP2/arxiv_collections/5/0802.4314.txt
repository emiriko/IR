Quantum computation can proceed solely through single-qubit measurements on
an appropriate quantum state, such as the ground state of an interacting
many-body system. We investigate a simple spin-lattice system based on the
cluster-state model, and by using nonlocal correlation functions that quantify
the fidelity of quantum gates performed between distant qubits, we demonstrate
that it possesses a quantum (zero-temperature) phase transition between a
disordered phase and an ordered "cluster phase" in which it is possible to
perform a universal set of quantum gates.
