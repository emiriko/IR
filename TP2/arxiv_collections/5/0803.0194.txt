This paper draws a proposal of a set of parameters and methods for accuracy
evaluation of visual inspection systems. The case of a monochrome board is
treated, but practically all conclusions and methods may be extended for colour
acquisition. Basically, the proposed parameters are grouped in five sets as
follows:Internal noise;Video ADC cuantisation parameters;Analogue processing
section parameters;Dominant frequencies;Synchronisation (lock-in) accuracy. On
basis of this set of parameters was developed a software environment, in
conjunction with a test signal generator that allows the "test" images. The
paper also presents conclusions of evaluation for two types of video
acquisition boards
