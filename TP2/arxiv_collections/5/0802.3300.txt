Motivated by several classic decision-theoretic paradoxes, and by analogies
with the paradoxes which in physics motivated the development of quantum
mechanics, we introduce a projective generalization of expected utility along
the lines of the quantum-mechanical generalization of probability theory. The
resulting decision theory accommodates the dominant paradoxes, while retaining
significant simplicity and tractability. In particular, every finite game
within this larger class of preferences still has an equilibrium.
