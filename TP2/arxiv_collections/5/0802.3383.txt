A dynamical coupled channel approach is used to study $\pi$ and
$\omega$--meson production induced by pions and photons scattering from the
proton. Six intermediate channels including $\pi N$, $\eta N$, $\pi\Delta$,
$\sigma N$, $\rho N$ and $\omega N$ are employed to describe unpolarized and
polarized data. Bare parameters in an effective hadronic Lagrangian are
determined in a fit to data for $\pi N \to \pi N$, $\gamma N \to \pi N$, $\pi^-
p \to \omega n$, and $\gamma p \to \omega p$ reactions at center-of-mass
energies from threshold to $W < 2.0$ GeV. The $T$ matrix determined in these
fits is used to calculate the photon beam asymmetry for $\omega$-meson
production and the $\omega N \to\omega N$ total cross section and $\omega N$
scattering lengths.
