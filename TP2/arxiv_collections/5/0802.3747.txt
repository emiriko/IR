In this paper we present a self-contained combinatorial proof of the lower
bound theorem for normal pseudomanifolds, including a treatment of the cases of
equality in this theorem. We also discuss McMullen and Walkup's generalised
lower bound conjecture for triangulated spheres in the context of the lower
bound theorem. Finally, we pose a new lower bound conjecture for non-simply
connected triangulated manifolds.
