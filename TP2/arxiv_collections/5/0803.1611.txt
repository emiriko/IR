This is an introduction to the study of strongly interacting matter. We
survey its different possible states and discuss the transition from hadronic
matter to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons. Following this, we
summarize the results provided by lattice QCD finite temperature and density,
and then investigate the nature of the deconfinement transition. Finally we
give a schematic overview of possible ways to study the properties of the
quark-gluon plasma.
