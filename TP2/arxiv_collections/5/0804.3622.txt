We consider the harmonic chain of oscillators with self-consistent stochastic
reservoirs and give a new proof for the finitude of its thermal conductivity in
the steady state. The approach, with involves an integral representation for
the correlations (heat flow)and a perturbative analysis, is quite general and
extendable to the study of anharmonic systems.
