We consider the construction of the basic bundle gerbe on SU(n) introduced by
Meinrenken and show that it extends to a range of groups with unitary actions
on a Hilbert space including U(n), diagonal tori and the Banach Lie group of
unitary operators differing from the identity by an element of a Schatten
ideal. In all these cases we give an explicit connection and curving on the
basic bundle gerbe and calculate the real Dixmier-Douady class. Extensive use
is made of the holomorphic functional calculus for operators on a Hilbert
space.
