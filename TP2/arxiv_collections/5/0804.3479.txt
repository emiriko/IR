We show that the Flatte formula is not adequate to interpret precision data
on a resonance production near an inelastic threshold. A unitary
parameterization, satisfying generalized Watson's theorem for the production
amplitudes, is proposed to replace the Flatte parameterization in
phenomenological analyses of experimental data.
