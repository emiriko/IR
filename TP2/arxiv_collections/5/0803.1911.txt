Finite group extensions offer a natural language to quantum computing. In a
nutshell, one roughly describes the action of a quantum computer as consisting
of two finite groups of gates: error gates from the general Pauli group P and
stabilizing gates within an extension group C. In this paper one explores the
nice adequacy between group theoretical concepts such as commutators, normal
subgroups, group of automorphisms, short exact sequences, wreath products...
and the coherent quantum computational primitives. The structure of the single
qubit and two-qubit Clifford groups is analyzed in detail. As a byproduct, one
discovers that M20, the smallest perfect group for which the commutator
subgroup departs from the set of commutators, underlies quantum coherence of
the two-qubit system. One recovers similar results by looking at the
automorphisms of a complete set of mutually unbiased bases.
