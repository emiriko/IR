Parity-violating nuclear force, as may be accessed from parity violation
studies in nuclear systems, represents an area of nonleptonic weak interactions
which has been the subject of experimental investigations for several decades.
In the simple meson-exchange picture, parity-violating nuclear force may be
parameterized as arising from exchange of \pi, \rho, \omega, or other meson(s)
with strong meson-nucleon coupling at one vertex and weak parity-violating
meson-nucleon coupling at the other vertex. The QCD sum rule method allows for
a fairly complicated, but nevertheless straightforward, leading-order
loop-contribution determination of the various parity-violating MNN couplings
starting from QCD (with the nontrivial vacuum) and Glashow-Salam-Weinberg
electroweak theory. We continue our earlier investigation of parity-violating
\pi NN coupling (by Henley, Hwang, and Kisslinger) to other parity-violating
couplings. Our predictions are in reasonable overall agreement with the results
estimated on phenomenological grounds, such as in the now classic paper of
Desplanques, Donoghue, and Holstein (DDH), in the global experimental fit of
Adelberger and Haxton (AH), or the effective field theory (EFT) thinking of
Ramsey-Musolf and Page (RP).
