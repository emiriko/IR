We study the interplay of hydrodynamic mesoscale structures and the growth of
plankton in the wake of an island, and its interaction with a coastal
upwelling. Our focus is on a mechanism for the emergence of localized plankton
blooms in vortices. Using a coupled system of a kinematic flow mimicking the
mesoscale structures behind the island and a simple three component model for
the marine ecosystem, we show that the long residence times of nutrients and
plankton in the vicinity of the island and the confinement of plankton within
vortices are key factors for the appearance of localized plankton blooms
