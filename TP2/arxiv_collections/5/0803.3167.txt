Recently in the authors' country Japan, the unpopularity of natural science
among children has been a serious problem. Especially, physics is unpopular
because physics requires mathematics. One of the reasons of this problem is
that teachers themselves do not like physics. We focus our attention on the
``teachers in embryo'', namely the undergraduate students in a course for
school teachers. We conducted a questionnaire and a quiz on the undergraduate
students in the first grade of the Department of Science Education, Ibaraki
University. We report the result of the questionnaire and the quiz, and also
make suggestions to improve the present situation.
