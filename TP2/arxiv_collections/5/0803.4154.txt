Electronic transport through a triple quantum dot system, with only a single
dot coupled directly to external leads, is considered theoretically. The model
includes Coulomb correlations in the central dot, while such correlations in
the two side-coupled dots are omitted. The infinite-U mean-field slave-boson
approach is used to obtain basic transport characteristics in the Kondo regime.
When tuning position of the side-coupled dots' levels, transition from
subradiant to superradiant like mode (and vice versa) has been found in the
spectral function, in analogy to the Dicke effect in atomic physics. Bias
dependence of the differential conductance and zero frequency shot noise is
also analysed.
