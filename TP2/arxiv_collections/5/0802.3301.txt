We show that the condensation of exciton-polaritons in semiconductor
microcavities in an applied magnetic field manifests itself in the quenching of
the Zeeman splitting of an elliptically polarized condensate. The circular
polarization degree of a localized condensate with a finite number of particles
increases as a function of the magnetic field with a step-like behavior. The
width of each polarization step is fixed by the polariton-polariton interaction
constants and the number of steps is fixed by the number of polaritons in the
condensate. The magnetic susceptibility of the condensate depends qualitatively
on the parity of the number of polaritons.
