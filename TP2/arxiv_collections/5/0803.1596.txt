This paper introduces two ongoing research projects which seek to apply
computer modelling techniques in order to simulate human behaviour within
organisations. Previous research in other disciplines has suggested that
complex social behaviours are governed by relatively simple rules which, when
identified, can be used to accurately model such processes using computer
technology. The broad objective of our research is to develop a similar
capability within organisational psychology.
