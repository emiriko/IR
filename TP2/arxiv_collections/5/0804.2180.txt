We report on our recent evaluation of the two-photon width of the
pseudoscalar quarkonia, eta_c(nS) and eta_b(nS) in an approach based on
Heavy-Quark Spin Symmetry (HQSS). To what concerns the 1S state eta_c, our
parameter-free computation agrees with experiments, as well as most of other
theoretical works. On the other hand, our computation for the 2S-state looks 2S
like a confirmation that there may exist an anomaly related to the decay of
eta_c(2S), especially in the light of the new preliminary result of the Belle
collaboration. We also point out that the essentially model-independent ratio
of eta_b two-photon width to the Upsilon leptonic width and the eta_b
two-photon width could be used to extract the strong coupling constant alpha_s.
