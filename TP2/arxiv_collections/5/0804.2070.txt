We review some computer algorithms for the simulation of off-lattice clusters
grown from a seed, with emphasis on the diffusion-limited aggregation,
ballistic aggregation and Eden models. Only those methods which can be
immediately extended to distinct off-lattice aggregation processes are
discussed. The computer efficiencies of the distinct algorithms are compared.
