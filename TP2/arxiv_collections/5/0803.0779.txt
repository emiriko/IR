The ultimate electric and magnetic energy densities that can be attained by
bandlimited electromagnetic pulses in free space are calculated using an ab
initio quantized treatment, and the quantum states of electromagnetic fields
that achieve the ultimate energy densities are derived. The ultimate energy
densities also provide an experimentally accessible metric for the degree of
localization of polychromatic photons.
