In the article, on a new definition of quantum entropy, Campisi has explained
an operator for entropy based on quantum number operator. It has been claimed
that the expectation values for this operator increases for every
non-quasi-static time dependent perturbations. We have found an example for a
case that entropy with this definition does not increase through a spontaneous
process.
