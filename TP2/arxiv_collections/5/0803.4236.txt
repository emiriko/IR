We investigate experimentally the statistical properties of active and
passive scalar fields in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection in water, at
$Ra\sim10^{10}$. Both the local concentration of fluorescence dye and the local
temperature are measured near the sidewall of a rectangular cell. It is found
that, although they are advected by the same turbulent flow, the two scalars
distribute differently. This difference is twofold, i.e. both the quantities
themselves and their small-scale increments have different distributions. Our
results show that there is a certain buoyant scale based on time domain, i.e.
the Bolgiano time scale $t_B$, above which buoyancy effects are significant.
Above $t_B$, temperature is active and is found to be more intermittent than
concentration, which is passive. This suggests that the active scalar possesses
a higher level of intermittency in turbulent thermal convection. It is further
found that the mixing of both scalar fields are isotropic for scales larger
than $t_B$ even though buoyancy acts on the fluid in the vertical direction.
Below $t_B$, temperature is passive and is found to be more anisotropic than
concentration. But this higher degree of anisotropy is attributed to the higher
diffusivity of temperature over that of concentration. From the simultaneous
measurements of temperature and concentration, it is shown that two scalars
have similar autocorrelation functions and there is a strong and positive
correlation between them.
