In this paper we will construct the Schrodinger representation for the
linearly polarized Gowdy $S^1\times S^2$ and $S^3$ models coupled to massless
scalar fields. Here the quantum states belong to a $L^2$-space for a suitable
quantum configuration space endowed with a Gaussian measure, whose support is
analyzed. This study completes the quantization of these systems previously
performed in the Fock scheme, and provides a specially useful framework to
address physically relevant questions.
