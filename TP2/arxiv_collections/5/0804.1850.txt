We design an ingenious scheme to realize the Haldane's quantum Hall model
without Landau level by using ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice.
Three standing-wave laser beams are used to construct a wanted honeycomb
lattice, where different on-site energies in two sublattices required in the
Haldane's model can be implemented through tuning the phase of one of the laser
beams. The staggered magnetic field is generated from the Berry phase
associated with the atom moving in a region with other three standing-wave
laser beams. Moreover, we establish a relation between the Hall conductivity
and the equilibrium atomic density upon turning on a stimulated uniform
magnetic field, which enables us to detect the topological Chern number with
the density profile measurement technique that is typically used in ultracold
atoms experiments.
