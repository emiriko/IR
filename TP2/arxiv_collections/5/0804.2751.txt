In this paper we propose a mechanism for the induction of energy gaps in the
spectrum of graphene and its bilayer, when both these materials are covered
with water and ammonia molecules. The energy gaps obtained are within the range
20-30 meV, values compatible to those found in experimental studies of graphene
bilayer. We further show that the binding energies are large enough for the
adsorption of the molecules to be maintained even at room temperature.
