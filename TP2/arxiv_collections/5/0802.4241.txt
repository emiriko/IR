Recent Raman scattering data in B_{1g} and B_{2g} geometries in the
superconducting state of underdoped cuprates were interpreted as evidence for
two distinct energy gaps. We argue that these data can be equally well
explained within a one gap scenario if final state interactions are taken into
account. In particular, we show that they can account for the differing doping
dependences of the Raman peaks in these two geometries.
