Time-resolved absorption of zinc sulfide (ZnS) and aluminum in the XUV-range
has been measured. Thin foils in conditions close to local thermodynamic
equilibrium were heated by radiation from laser-irradiated gold spherical
cavities. Analysis of the aluminum foil radiative hydrodynamic expansion, based
on the detailed atomic calculations of its absorption spectra, showed that the
cavity emitted flux that heated the absorption foils corresponds to a radiation
temperature in the range 55 60 eV. Comparison of the ZnS absorption spectra
with calculations based on a superconfiguration approach identified the
presence of species Zn6+ - Zn8+ and S5+ - S6+. Based on the validation of the
radiative source simulations, experimental spectra were then compared to
calculations performed by post-processing the radiative hydrodynamic
simulations of ZnS. Satisfying agreement is found when temperature gradients
are accounted for.
