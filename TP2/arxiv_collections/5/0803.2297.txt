Here we show that every compact smooth 4-manifold X has a structure of a
Broken Lefschetz Fibration (BLF in short). Furthermore, if b_{2}^{+}(X)> 0 then
it also has a Broken Lefschetz Pencil structure (BLP) with nonempty base locus.
This imroves a Theorem of Auroux, Donaldson and Katzarkov, and our proof is
topological (i.e. uses 4-dimensional handlebody theory).
