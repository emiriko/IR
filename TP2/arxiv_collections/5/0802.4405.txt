A three-component nonlinear Schrodinger-type model which describes spinor
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is considered. This model is integrable by the
inverse scattering method and using Zakharov-Shabat dressing method we obtain
three types of soliton solutions. The multi-component nonlinear Schrodinger
type models related to symmetric spaces C.I Sp(4)/U(2) is studied.
