We investigate Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relaying models. Firstly, we
propose a novel quasi-trusted QKD relaying model. The quasi-trusted relays are
defined as follows: (i) being honest enough to correctly follow a given
multi-party finite-time communication protocol; (ii) however, being under the
monitoring of eavesdroppers. We develop a simple 3-party quasi-trusted model,
called Quantum Quasi-Trusted Bridge (QQTB) model, to show that we could
securely extend up to two times the limited range of single-photon based QKD
schemes. We also develop the Quantum Quasi-Trusted Relay (QQTR) model to show
that we could securely distribute QKD keys over arbitrarily long distances. The
QQTR model requires EPR pair sources, but does not use entanglement swapping
and entanglement purification schemes. Secondly, we show that our quasi-trusted
models could be improved to become untrusted models in which the security is
not compromised even though attackers have full controls over some relaying
nodes. We call our two improved models the Quantum Untrusted Bridge (QUB) and
Quantum Untrusted Relay (QUR) ones. The QUB model works on single photons and
allows securely extend up to two times the limited QKD range. The QUR model
works on entangled photons but does not use entanglement swapping and
entanglement purification operations. This model allows securely transmit
shared keys over arbitrarily long distances without dramatically decreasing the
key rate of the original QKD schemes.
