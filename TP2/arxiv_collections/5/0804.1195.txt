We present an exact solution for the electrostatic field between a metallic
hemi-ellipsoidal needle on a plate (as a cathode) and a flat anode. The basic
idea is to replace the cathode by a linearly charged thread in a uniform
electric field and to use a set of "image" charges to reproduce the anode. We
calculate the field enhancement factor on the needle surface and ponderomotive
force acting on the needle. Using the Fowler-Nordheim theory we obtain an exact
analytical formula for the total current.
