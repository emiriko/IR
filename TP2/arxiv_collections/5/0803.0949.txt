Magneto-gyrotropic photogalvanic effects in quantum wells are reviewed. We
discuss experimental data, results of phenomenological analysis and microscopic
models of these effects. The current flow is driven by spin-dependent
scattering in low-dimensional structures gyrotropic media resulted in asymmetry
of photoexcitation and relaxation processes. Several applications of the
effects are also considered.
