The paper discusses two-photon Rabi oscillations between the ground state of
a quantum dot and the biexciton state, as well as two-photon oscillations
between the two single-exciton states with different circular or linear
polarizations. The effect of phonon-induced decoherence on these processes is
described and optimal system properties and optical driving conditions for
coherent control are identified. It is shown that proper optimalization allows
one to control the biexciton system via two-photon transitions with a high
fidelity.
