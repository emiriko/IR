We study the dynamics of a pair of atoms, resonantly interacting with a
single mode cavity, in the situation where the atoms enter the cavity with a
time delay between them. Using time dependent coupling functions to represent
the spatial profile of the mode, we considered the adiabatic limit of the
system. Although the time evolution is mostly adiabatic, energy crossings play
an important role in the system dynamics. Following from this, entanglement,
and a procedure for cavity state teleportation are considered. We examine the
behaviour of the system when we introduce decoherence, a finite detuning, and
potential asymmetries in the coupling profiles of the atoms.
