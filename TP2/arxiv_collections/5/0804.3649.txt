Kapustin and Witten associate a Hecke modification of a holomorphic bundle
over a Riemann surface to a singular monopole on a Riemannian surface times an
interval satisfying prescribed boundary conditions. We prove existence and
uniqueness of singular monopoles satisfying prescribed boundary conditions for
any given Hecke modification data confirming the underlying geometric invariant
theory principle.
