Spin polarized current may transfer angular momentum to a ferromagnet,
resulting in a spin-torque phenomenon. At the same time the shot noise,
associated with the current, leads to a non-equilibrium stochastic force acting
on the ferromagnet. We derive stochastic version of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation for a magnetization of a ''free'' ferromagnetic layer in contact with
a ''fixed'' ferromagnet. We solve the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and
show that the non-equilibrium noise yields to a non-monotonous dependence of
the precession spectrum linewidth on the current.
