Employing the Noether charge technique and Visser's Euclidean approach the
entropy of the nonlinear black hole described by the perturbative solution of
the system of coupled equations of the quadratic gravity and nonlinear
electrodynamics is constructed. The solution is parametrized by the exact
location of the event horizon and charge. Special emphasis in put on the
extremal configuration. Consequences of the second choice of the boundary
conditions, in which the solution is paramerized by the charge and the total
mass as seen by a distant observer is briefly examined.
