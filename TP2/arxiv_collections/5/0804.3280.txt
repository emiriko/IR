We study a gas of strongly polarized cold fermions in an optical lattice when
the excited p-bands are populated. We derive the relevant Hamiltonian and
discuss the expected phase diagram for both repulsive and attractive
interactions. In the parameter regime covered here, checkerboard
anti-ferromagnetic ordering is found to be possible for repulsive interactions
while for attractive interactions, transitions between different types of
paired phases are predicted.
