Neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet powders (Nd:YAG or
(Y{1-x}Nd{x})3Al5O12, x=0.15, 0.25, or 0.30, respectively) were prepared by a
sol-gel technique. By DTA measurements up to 2000 deg C eutectic and liquidus
temperatures could be determined. Exothermal peaks in the second and subsequent
DTA heating runs indicate that the crystallized DTA samples are not in
equilibrium. The section Y3Al5O12-Nd3Al5O12 of the concentration triangle
Al2O3-Nd2O3-Y2O3 is proposed on the basis of thermodynamic calculations that
allows to explain the experimental results by the balance of metastable phase
states in the previously crystallized DTA samples.
