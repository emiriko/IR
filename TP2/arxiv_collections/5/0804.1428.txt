These are the notes for a course on representations of quivers for second
year students in Paderborn in summer 2007. My aim was to provide a basic
introduction without using any advanced methods. It turns out that a good
knowledge of linear algebra is sufficient for proving Gabriel's theorem. Thus
we classify the quivers of finite representation type and study their
representations using reflection functors. Further material has been added
after giving this course in Bielefeld in summer 2010. This includes a
discussion of regular representations and wild phenomena. In particular, two
classical examples are covered: representations of the Kronecker quiver and
representations of the Klein four group.
