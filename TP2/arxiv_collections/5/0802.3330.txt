We study the near horizon geometry of extremal black holes in five
dimensional gauged supergravity using Sen's entropy function formalism. Special
attention is paid to the large black hole limit where the near horizon solution
exhibits a universal dependence on the rotation. The physical properties of the
large black hole solution are shown to agree with predictions from fluid
mechanical description of the dual conformal field theory.
