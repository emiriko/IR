We discuss the necessary symmetry conditions and the different ways in which
they can be physically realized for the occurrence of ferromagnetism
accompanying the loop current orbital magnetic order observed by polarized
neutron-diffraction experiments or indeed any other conceivable principal order
in the under-doped phase of cuprates. We contrast the Kerr effect experiments
in single crystals observing ferromagnetism with the direct magnetization
measurements in large powder samples, which do not observe it. We also suggest
experiments to resolve the differences among the experiments, all of which we
believe to be correct.
