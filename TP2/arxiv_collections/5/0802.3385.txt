We report a method for the efficient evaluation of analytic infrared (IR)
intensities within generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory using
Gaussian orbitals and periodic boundary conditions. A discretized form of the
Berry phase is used to evaluate a periodic dipole moment and its derivatives
with respect to in-phase nuclear coordinate displacements. Benchmark
calculations are presented for one-dimensional chains of water molecules and
poly(paraphenylenevinylene).
