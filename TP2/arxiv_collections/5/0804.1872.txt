We consider a massive inelastic piston, whose opposite faces have different
coefficients of restitution, moving under the action of an infinitely dilute
gas of hard disks maintained at a fixed temperature. The dynamics of the piston
is Markovian and obeys a continuous Master Equation: however, the asymmetry of
restitution coefficients induces a violation of detailed balance and a net
drift of the piston, as in a Brownian ratchet. Numerical investigations of such
non-equilibrium stationary state show that the velocity fluctuations of the
piston are symmetric around the mean value only in the limit of large piston
mass, while they are strongly asymmetric in the opposite limit. Only taking
into account such an asymmetry, i.e. including a third parameter in addition to
the mean and the variance of the velocity distribution, it is possible to
obtain a satisfactory analytical prediction for the ratchet drift velocity.
