This book is dedicated to Grassmannians associated with buildings of
classical types: usual, polar, and half-spin Grassmannians. Grassmannians of
vector spaces and Grassmannians consisting of totally isotropic subspaces of
non-degenerate alternating, Hermitian, and symmetric forms are special cases of
these "building" Grassmannians.
