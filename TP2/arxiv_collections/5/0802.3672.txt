This collection of studies on new physics at the LHC constitutes the report
of the supersymmetry working group at the Workshop `Physics at TeV Colliders',
Les Houches, France, 2007. They cover the wide spectrum of phenomenology in the
LHC era, from alternative models and signatures to the extraction of relevant
observables, the study of the MSSM parameter space and finally to the interplay
of LHC observations with additional data expected on a similar time scale. The
special feature of this collection is that while not each of the studies is
explicitely performed together by theoretical and experimental LHC physicists,
all of them were inspired by and discussed in this particular environment.
