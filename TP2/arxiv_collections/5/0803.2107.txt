A number of basic scientific questions relating to ion conduction in
homogeneously disordered solids are discussed. The questions deal with how to
define the mobile ion density, what can be learned from electrode effects, what
is the ion transport mechanism, the role of dimensionality, and what are the
origins of the mixed-alkali effect, of time-temperature superposition, and of
the nearly-constant loss. Answers are suggested to some of these questions, but
the main purpose of the paper is to draw attention to the fact that this field
of research still presents several fundamental challenges.
