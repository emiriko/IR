We introduce a duality construction for toric Landau-Ginzburg models,
applicable to complete intersections in toric varieties via the sigma model /
Landau-Ginzburg model correspondence. This construction is shown to reconstruct
those of Batyrev-Borisov, Berglund-H"ubsch, Givental, and Hori-Vafa. It can be
done in more general situations, and provides partial resolutions when the
above constructions give a singular mirror. An extended example is given: the
Landau-Ginzburg models dual to elliptic curves in (P^1)^2 .
