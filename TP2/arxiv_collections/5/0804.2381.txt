High $p_T$ single and dihadron production is studied within a NLO pQCD parton
model with jet quenching in high energy $A+A$ collisions at the RHIC/LHC
energy. A simultaneous $\chi^2$-fit to both single and dihadron spectra can be
achieved within a narrow range of energy loss parameter. Punch-through jets are
found to result in the dihadron suppression factor slightly more sensitive to
medium than the single hadron suppression factor at RHIC. Such jets at LHC are
found to dominate high $p_T$ dihadron production and the resulting dihadron
spectra are more sensitive to the initial parton distribution functions than
the single hadron spectra.
