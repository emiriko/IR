We detected the formation of p-wave Feshbach molecules for all three
combinations of the two lowest atomic spin states of 6Li. By creating a pure
molecular sample in an optical trap, we measured the inelastic collision rates
of p-wave molecules. The elastic collision rate was measured from the
thermalization rate of a breathing mode excited spontaneously upon molecular
formation.
