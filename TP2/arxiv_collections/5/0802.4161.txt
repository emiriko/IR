Theoretical estimates for the half lives of about 1700 isotopes of heavy
elements with Z from 100 to 130 are tabulated using theoretical Q-values. The
quantum mechanical tunneling probabilities are calculated within a WKB
framework using microscopic nuclear potentials. The microscopic nucleus-nucleus
potentials are obtained by folding the densities of interacting nuclei with a
density dependent M3Y (DDM3Y) effective nucleon-nucleon interaction. The
alpha-decay half lives calculated in this formalism using the experimental
Q-values were found to be in good agreement over a wide range of experimental
data spanning about twenty orders of magnitude. The theoretical Q-values used
for the present calculations are extracted from three different mass estimates
viz. Myers-Swiatecki [MS], Muntian-Hofmann-Patyk-Sobiczewski [M] and
Koura-Tachibana-Uno-Yamada [KUTY].
