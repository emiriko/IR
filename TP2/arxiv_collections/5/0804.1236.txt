We have studied the effect of Fe addition on the structural and magnetic
transitions in the magnetic shape memory alloy Ni-Mn-Ga by substituting
systematically each atomic species by Fe. Calorimetric and AC susceptibility
measurements have been carried out in order to study the magnetic and
structural transformation properties. We find that the addition of Fe modifies
the structural and magnetic transformation temperatures. Magnetic transition
temperatures are displaced to higher values when Fe is substituted into
Ni-Mn-Ga, while martensitic and premartensitic transformation temperatures
shift to lower values. Moreover, it has been found that the electron per atom
concentration essentially governs the phase stability in the quaternary system.
However, the observed scaling of transition temperatures with $e/a$ differs
from that reported in the related ternary system Ni-Mn-Ga.
