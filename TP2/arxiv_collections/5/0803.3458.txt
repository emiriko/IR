In contrast to previous analyses, we demonstrate a Bayesian approach to the
estimation of the CKM phase $\alpha$ that is invariant to parameterization. We
also show that in addition to {\em computing} the marginal posterior in a
Bayesian manner, the distribution must also be {\em interpreted} from a
subjective Bayesian viewpoint. Doing so gives a very natural interpretation to
the distribution. We also comment on the effect of removing information about
$\mathcal{B}^{00}$.
