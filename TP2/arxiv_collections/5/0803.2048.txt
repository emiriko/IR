We show that the deformation space of complex parallelisable nilmanifolds can
be described by polynomial equations but is almost never smooth. This is
remarkable since these manifolds have trivial canonical bundle and are
holomorphic symplectic in even dimension. We describe the Kuranishi space in
detail in several examples and also analyse when small deformations remain
complex parallelisable
