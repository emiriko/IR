We investigated Dirac Particles' Hawking radiation from event horizon of Kerr
black hole in terms of the tunneling formalism. Applying WKB approximation to
the general covariant Dirac equation in Kerr spacetime background, we obtain
the tunneling probability for fermions and Hawking temperature of Kerr black
hole. The result obtained by taking the fermion tunneling into account is
consistent with the previous literatures.
