We study the flavor structure of 5D warped models that provide a dual
description of a composite pseudo-Goldstone Higgs. We first carefully
re-examine the flavor constraints on the mass scale of new physics in the
standard Randall-Sundrum-type scenarios, and find that the KK gluon mass should
generically be heavier than about 21 TeV. We then compare the flavor structure
of the composite Higgs models to those in the RS model. We find new
contributions to flavor violation, which while still are suppressed by the
RS-GIM mechanism, will enhance the amplitudes of flavor violations. In
particular, there is a kinetic mixing term among the SM fields which (although
parametrically not enhanced) will make the flavor bounds even more stringent
than in RS. This together with the fact that in the pseudo-Goldstone scenario
Yukawa couplings are set by a gauge coupling implies the KK gluon mass to be at
least about 33 TeV. For both the RS and the composite Higgs models the flavor
bounds could be stronger or weaker depending on the assumption on the value of
the gluon boundary kinetic term. These strong bounds seem to imply that the
fully anarchic approach to flavor in warped extra dimensions is implausible,
and there have to be at least some partial flavor symmetries appearing that
eliminate part of the sources for flavor violation. We also present complete
expressions for the radiatively generated Higgs potential of various 5D
implementations of the composite Higgs model, and comment on the 1-5 percent
level tuning needed in the top sector to achieve a phenomenologically
acceptable vacuum state.
