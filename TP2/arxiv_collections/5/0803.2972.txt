The cross section of reaction e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^- is calculated for
energies 0.65\leq \sqrt{s}\leq1 GeV in the framework of the generalized hidden
local symmetry model. The calculations are compared with the data of CMD-2 and
BaBaR. It is shown that the inclusion of heavy isovector resonances \rho(1450)
and \rho(1700) is necessary for reconciling calculations with the data. It is
found that at \sqrt{s}\approx1 GeV the contributions of above resonances are
much larger, by the factor of 30, than the \rho(770) one, and are amount to a
considerable fraction \sim0.3-0.6 of the latter at \sqrt{s}\sim m_\rho.
