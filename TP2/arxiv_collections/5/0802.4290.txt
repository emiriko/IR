Many beyond the Standard Model theories include a stable dark matter
candidate that yields missing / invisible energy in collider detectors. If
observed at the Large Hadron Collider, we must determine if its mass and other
properties (and those of its partners) predict the correct dark matter relic
density. We give a new procedure for determining its mass with small error.
