We study the coupling between a quantum dot and the edge of a non-Abelian
fractional quantum Hall state which is spatially separated from it by an
integer quantum Hall state. Near a resonance, the physics at energy scales
below the level spacing of the edge states of the dot is governed by a
$k$-channel Kondo model when the quantum Hall state is a Read-Rezayi state at
filling fraction $\nu=2+k/(k+2)$ or its particle-hole conjugate at
$\nu=2+2/(k+2)$. The $k$-channel Kondo model is channel isotropic even without
fine tuning in the former state; in the latter, it is generically channel
anisotropic. In the special case of $k=2$, our results provide a new venue,
realized in a mesoscopic context, to distinguish between the Pfaffian and
anti-Pfaffian states at filling fraction $\nu=5/2$.
