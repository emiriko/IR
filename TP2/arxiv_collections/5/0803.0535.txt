A quantum Markovian activated atom-surface diffusion model with interacting
adsorbates is proposed for the intermediate scattering function, which is shown
to be complex-valued and factorizable into a classical-like and a
quantum-mechanical factor. Applications to the diffusion of Na atoms on flat
(weakly corrugated) and corrugated-Cu(001) surfaces at different coverages and
surface temperatures are analyzed. Quantum effects are relevant to diffusion at
low surface temperatures and coverages even for relatively heavy particles,
such as Na atoms, where transport by tunneling is absent.
