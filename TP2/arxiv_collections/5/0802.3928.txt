We have investigated the dynamics of bound particles in multilevel
current-carrying quantum dots. We look specifically in the regime of resonant
tunnelling transport, where several channels are available for transport.
Through a non-Markovian formalism under the Born approximation, we investigate
the real-time evolution of the confined particles including transport-induced
decoherence and relaxation. In the case of a coherent superposition between
states with different particle number, we find that a Fock-space coherence may
be preserved even in the presence of tunneling into and out of the dot.
Real-time results are presented for various asymmetries of tunneling rates into
different orbitals.
