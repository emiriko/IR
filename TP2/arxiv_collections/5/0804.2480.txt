We consider the iron pnictides in terms of a proximity to a Mott insulator.
The superexchange interactions contain competing nearest-neighbor and
next-nearest-neighbor components. In the undoped parent compound, these
frustrated interactions lead to a two-sublattice collinear antiferromagnet
(each sublattice forming a Neel ordering), with a reduced magnitude for the
ordered moment. Electron or hole doping, together with the frustration effect,
suppresses the magnetic ordering and allows a superconducting state. The
exchange interactions favor a d-wave superconducting order parameter; in the
notation appropriate for the Fe square lattice, its orbital symmetry is
$d_{xy}$. A number of existing and future experiments are discussed in light of
the theoretical considerations.
