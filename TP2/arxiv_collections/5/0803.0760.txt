We show that entanglement monotones can characterize the pronounced
enhancement of entanglement at a quantum phase transition if they are sensitive
to long-range high order correlations. These monotones are found to develop a
sharp peak at the critical point and to exhibit universal scaling. We
demonstrate that similar features are shared by noise correlations and verify
that these experimentally accessible quantities indeed encode entanglement
information and probe separability.
