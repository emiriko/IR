Quantum computer programming is emerging as a new subject domain from
multidisciplinary research in quantum computing, computer science, mathematics
(especially quantum logic, lambda calculi, and linear logic), and engineering
attempts to build the first non-trivial quantum computer. This paper briefly
surveys the history, methods, and proposed tools for programming quantum
computers circa late 2007. It is intended to provide an extensive but
non-exhaustive look at work leading up to the current state-of-the-art in
quantum computer programming. Further, it is an attempt to analyze the needed
programming tools for quantum programmers, to use this analysis to predict the
direction in which the field is moving, and to make recommendations for further
development of quantum programming language tools.
