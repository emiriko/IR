Based on a microscopic derivation of the emission spectra of a bulk
semiconductor we arrive at a clear physical interpretation of the noise current
operators in macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. This opens the possibility to
study medium effects on nonclassical radiation propagating through an absorbing
or amplifying semiconductor. As an example, the propagation of an incident
squeezed vacuum is analyzed.
