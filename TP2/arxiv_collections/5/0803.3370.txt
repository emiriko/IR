We propose and computationally analyze a nonvolatile static random access
memory (NV-SRAM) cell using magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with
magnetic-field-free current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS)
architecture. A pair of MTJs connected to the storage nodes of a standard SRAM
cell with CIMS architecture enables fully electrical store and restore
operations for nonvolatile logic information. The proposed NV-SRAM is expected
to be a key component of next-generation power-gating logic systems with
extremely low static-power dissipation.
