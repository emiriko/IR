The momentum spectrum and the polarization of charginos and neutralinos in
squark decays are affected by gluon radiation in the decay process \tilde{q}
\to q \tilde{\chi} (g). We determine these corrections and study their impact
on the [ql] invariant mass distributions for leptonic \tilde{\chi} decays. The
higher-order corrections, though small in general, can be sizeable near
pronounced edges of the final-state distributions.
