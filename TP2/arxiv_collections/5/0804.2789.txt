A phenomenological kinetic energy theory of buoyant multiphase plumes is
constructed, being general enough to incorporate the dissolution of the
dispersive phase. We consider an axisymmetric plume, and model the dissolution
by means of the Ranz-Marshall equation in which there occurs a mass transfer
coefficient dependent on the plume properties. Our kinetic energy approach is
moreover generalized so as to take into account variable slip velocities.
  The theoretical model is compared with various experiments, and satisfactory
agreement is found. One central ingredient in the model is the turbulent
correlation parameter, called I, playing a role analogous to the conventional
entrainment coefficient \alpha in the more traditional plume theories. We use
experimental data to suggest a relationship between I, the initial gas flux at
the source, and the depth of the gas release. This relationship is used to make
predictions for five distinct case studies.
  Comparison with various experimental data shows that the kinetic energy
approach built upon use of the parameter I in practice has the order of
predictive power as the conventional entrainment-coefficient models. Moreover,
an advantage of the present model is that its predictions are very quickly
worked out numerically.
  Finally, we give a sensitivity analysis of the kinetic energy approach. It
turns out that the model is relatively stable with respect to most of the input
parameters. It is shown that the dissolution is of little influence on the
dynamics of the dispersed phase as long as the dissolution is moderate.
