The relationship between the quantum bit commitment (QBC) and quantum seal
(QS) is studied. It is elaborated that QBC and QS are not equivalent, but QS
protocols satisfying a stronger unconditional security requirement can lead to
an unconditionally secure QBC. In this sense, QS is strictly stronger than QBC
in security requirements. Based on an earlier proposal on sealing a single bit,
a feasible QBC protocol is also put forward, which is secure in practice even
if the cheater has a strong quantum computational power.
