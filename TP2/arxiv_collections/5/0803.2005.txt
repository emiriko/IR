In this paper we study the accretion of dark energy onto a black hole in the
cases that dark energy is equipped with a positive cosmological constant and
when the space-time is described by a Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric. It is
shown that, if confronted with current observational data, the results derived
when no cosmological constant is present are once again obtained in both cases.
