A model for the simulation of Kirkendall voiding in metallic materials is
presented based on vacancy diffusion, elastic-plastic and rate-dependent
deformation of spherical voids. Starting with a phenomenological explanation of
the Kirkendall effect we briefly discuss the consequences on the reliability of
microelectronics. A constitutive model for void nucleation and growth is
presented, which can be used to predict the temporal development of voids in
solder joints during thermal cycling. We end with exemplary numerical studies
and discuss the potential of the results for the failure analysis of joining
connections.
