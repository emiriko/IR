We propose a protocol for quantum energy teleportation which transports
energy in spin chains to distant sites only by local operations and classical
communication. By utilizing ground-state entanglement and notion of negative
energy density region, energy is teleported without breaking any physical laws
including causality and local energy conservation. Because not excited physical
entity but classical information is transported in the protocol, the
dissipation rate of energy in transport is expected to be strongly suppressed.
