As the need for advanced, interactive mathematical models has increased,
user/programmers are increasingly choosing the MatLab scripting language over
spreadsheets. However, applications developed in these tools have high error
risk, and no best practices exist. We recommend that advanced, highly
mathematical applications incorporate these tools with spreadsheets into hybrid
applications, where developers can apply EuSpRIG best practices. Development of
hybrid applications can reduce the potential for errors, shorten development
time, and enable higher level operations. We believe that hybrid applications
are the future and over the course of this paper, we apply and extend
spreadsheet best practices to reduce or prevent risks in hybrid Excel/MatLab
applications.
