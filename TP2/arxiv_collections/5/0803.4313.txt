One of the important features of the littlest Higgs model with T-parity,
called the $LHT$ model, is that it introduces the mirror fermions, which are
the T-parity partners of the standard model fermions. In this paper, we discuss
production of the mirror quark associated with mirror neutrino via $e\gamma$
and $ep$ collisions. We find that, in wide range of the parameter space, the
mirror quark can be copiously produced at the International $e^{+}e^{-}$ Linear
Collider $(ILC)$ and $ep$ collider $(THERA)$ experiments. The production rates
of certain signal events, which are related the main two-body decay modes of
the mirror quark, are also calculated.
