A linear theory of whistler wave is developed wihtin the paradigm of a two
dimensional incompressible electron magnetohydrodynamics model. Exact analytic
wave solutions are obtained for a small amplitude whistler wave that exhibit
magnetic field topological structures consistent with the observations and our
simulations in linear regime. In agreement with experiment, we find that the
parallel group velocity of the wave is large compared to its perpendicular
counterpart. Numerical simulations of collisional interactions demonstrate that
the wave magnetic field either coalesces or repels depending upon the polarity
of the associated current. In the nonlinear regime, our simulations demonstrate
that the evolution of wave magnetic field is governed essentially by the
nonlinear Hall force.
