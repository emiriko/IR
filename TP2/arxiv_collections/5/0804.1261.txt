For quantum information processing (QIP) with trapped ions, the isotope 43Ca+
offers the combined advantages of a quantum memory with long coherence time, a
high fidelity read out and the possibility of performing two qubit gates on a
quadrupole transition with a narrow-band laser. Compared to other ions used for
quantum computing, 43Ca+ has a relatively complicated level structure. In this
paper we discuss how to meet the basic requirements for QIP and demonstrate
ground state cooling, robust state initialization and efficient read out for
the hyperfine qubit with a single 43Ca+ ion. A microwave field and a Raman
light field are used to drive qubit transitions, and the coherence times for
both fields are compared. Phase errors due to interferometric instabilities in
the Raman field generation do not limit the experiments on a time scale of 100
ms. We find a quantum information storage time of many seconds for the
hyperfine qubit.
