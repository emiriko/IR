We consider navigation or search schemes on networks which have a degree
distribution of the form $P(k) \propto \exp(-k^\gamma)$. In addition, the
linking probability is taken to be dependent on social distances and is
governed by a parameter $\lambda$. The searches are realistic in the sense that
not all search chains can be completed. An estimate of $\mu=\rho/s_d$, where
$\rho$ is the success rate and $s_d$ the dynamic path length, shows that for a
network of $N$ nodes, $\mu \propto N^{-\delta}$ in general. Dynamic small world
effect, i.e., $\delta \simeq 0$ is shown to exist in a restricted region of the
$\lambda-\gamma$ plane.
