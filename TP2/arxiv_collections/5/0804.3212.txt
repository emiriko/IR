The general and explicit relation between the phase time and the dwell time
for quantum tunneling of a relativistically propagating particle is
investigated and quantified. In analogy with previously obtained
non-relativistic results, it is shown that the group delay can be described in
terms of the dwell time and a self-interference delay. Lessons concerning the
phenomenology of the relativistic tunneling are drawn.
