A first-principles investigation of the electron-phonon interaction in the
recently synthesized osmium dinitride (OsN$_2$) compound predicts that the
material is a superconductor. Superconductivity in OsN$_2$ would originate from
the stretching of covalently bonded dinitrogen units embedded in the
transition-metal matrix, thus adding dinitrides to the class of superconductors
containing covalently bonded light elements. The dinitrogen vibrations are
strongly coupled to the electronic states at the Fermi level and generate
narrow peaks in the Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2F(\omega)$. The total
electron-phonon coupling of OsN$_2$ is $\lambda=0.37$ and the estimated
superconducting temperature T$_c \approx 1$ K. We suggest that the
superconducting temperature can be substantially increased by hole doping of
the pristine compound and show that T$_c$ increases to 4 K with a doping
concentration of 0.25 holes/OsN$_2$ unit.
