Using coarse grained models we investigate the behavior of water adjacent to
an extended hydrophobic surface peppered with various fractions of hydrophilic
patches of different sizes. We study the spatial dependence of the mean
interface height, the solvent density fluctuations related to drying the patchy
substrate, and the spatial dependence of interfacial fluctuations. We find that
adding small uniform attractive interactions between the substrate and solvent
cause the mean position of the interface to be very close to the substrate.
Nevertheless, the interfacial fluctuations are large and spatially
heterogeneous in response to the underlying patchy substrate. We discuss the
implications of these findings to the assembly of heterogeneous surfaces.
