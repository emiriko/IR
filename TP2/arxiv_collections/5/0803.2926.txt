A simple cubic matrix model is presented, which has truncations that, it is
argued, lead at the classical level to a variety of theories of gauge fields
and gravity. These include Chern-Simons theory in d=3, and BF theory and
general relativity in d=4. General relativity coupled to Yang-mills theory for
any SU(N) may also arise from quantum corrections.
  On the basis of these results we conjecture that there are large universality
classes of cut-off gauge and gravity theories, connected by transformations
that mix up local and spacetime symmetries. If our universe is described by one
of these theories then the question of the choice of the laws of physics is to
a large extent subsumed in the problem of the choice of initial conditions in
cosmology.
