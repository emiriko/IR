An abelian gauge symmetry can be spontaneously broken near a black hole
horizon in anti-de Sitter space using a condensate of non-abelian gauge fields.
There is a second order phase transition between Reissner-Nordstrom-anti-de
Sitter solutions, which are preferred at high temperatures, and symmetry
breaking solutions, which are preferred at low temperatures.
