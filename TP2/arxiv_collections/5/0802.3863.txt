We report on the growth and characterization of a new Diluted Magnetic
Semiconductor (DMS) heterostructure that presents a Two-Dimensional Electron
Gas (2DEG) with a carrier density $n \sim 1.08 \times 10^{12} cm^{-2}$ and a
mobility $\mu \sim 600 cm^{2} / (Vs)$ at T $\sim$ 4.2K. As far as we know this
is the highest mobility value reported in the literature for GaMnAs systems. A
novel technique was developed to make Ohmic contact to the buried 2DEG without
destroying the magnetic properties of our crystal.
