We report experimental results of parallel measurement of spectral components
of the light. The temporal fluctuations of an optical field mixed with a
separate reference are recorded with a high throughput complementary metal
oxide semi-conductor camera (1 Megapixel at 2 kHz framerate). A numerical
Fourier transform of the time-domain recording enables wide-field coherent
spectral imaging. Qualitative comparisons with frequency-domain wide-field
laser Doppler imaging are provided.
