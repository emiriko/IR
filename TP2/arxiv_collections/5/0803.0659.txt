We combine all the available experimental information on Bs mixing, including
the very recent tagged analyses of Bs to J/Psi phi by the CDF and D0
collaborations. We find that the phase of the Bs mixing amplitude deviates more
than 3 sigma from the Standard Model prediction. While no single measurement
has a 3 sigma significance yet, all the constraints show a remarkable agreement
with the combined result. This is a first evidence of physics beyond the
Standard Model. This result disfavours New Physics models with Minimal Flavour
Violation with the same significance.
