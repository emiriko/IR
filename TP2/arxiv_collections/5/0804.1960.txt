We study the $\nu=\frac{2}{k+2}$ quantum Hall states which are particle-hole
conjugates of the $\nu=\frac{k}{k+2}$ Read-Rezayi states. We find that
equilibration between the different modes at the edge of such a state leads to
an emergent SU(2)$_k$ algebra in the counter-propagating neutral sector. Heat
flow along the edges of these states will be in the opposite direction of
charge flow. In the $k=3$ case, which may be relevant to $\nu=2+{2/5}$, the
thermal Hall conductance and the exponents associated with quasiparticle and
electron tunneling distinguish this state from competing states such as the
hierarchy/Jain state.
