We investigate space- and time-like form factors for $\omega\to\pi\gamma^*$
and $K^*\to K\gamma^*$ decays using the light-front quark model constrained by
the variational principle for the QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian. The
momentum dependent space-like form factors are obtained in the $q^+=0$ frame
and then analytically continued to the time-like region. Our prediction for the
time-like form factor $F_{\omega\pi}(q^2)$ is in good agreement with the
experimental data. We also find that the space-like form factor
$F_{K^{*\pm}K^{\pm}}(Q^2)$ for charged kaons encounters a zero because of the
negative interference between the two currents to the quark and the antiquark.
