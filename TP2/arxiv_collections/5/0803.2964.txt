In this contribution to the special issue on multiferroics we focus on
multiferroicity driven by different forms of charge ordering. We will present
the generic mechanisms by which charge ordering can induce ferroelectricity in
magnetic systems. There is a number of specific classes of materials for which
this is relevant. We will discuss in some detail $(i)$ perovskite manganites of
the type (PrCa)MnO$_3$, $(ii)$ the complex and interesting situation in
magnetite Fe$_3$O$_4$, $(iii)$ strongly ferroelectric frustrated LuFe$_2$O$_4$,
$(iv)$ an example of a quasi one-dimensional organic system. All these are
"type-I" multiferroics, in which ferroelectricity and magnetism have different
origin and occur at different temperatures. In the second part of this article
we discuss "type-II" multiferroics, in which ferroelectricity is completely
{\it due to} magnetism, but with charge ordering playing important role, such
as $(v)$ the newly-discovered multiferroic Ca$_3$CoMnO$_6$, $(vi)$ possible
ferroelectricity in rare earth perovskite nickelates of the type RNiO$_3$,
$(vii)$ multiferroic properties of manganites of the type RMn$_2$O$_5$,
$(viii)$ of perovskite manganites with magnetic E-type ordering and $(ix)$ of
bilayer manganites.
