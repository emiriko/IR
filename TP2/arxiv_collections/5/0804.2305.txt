In this paper we obtain a closed form expression of the zeta function
$Z(X_\Gamma, u)$ of a finite quotient $X_\Gamma = \Gamma \backslash
PGL_3(F)/PGL_3(O_F)$ of the Bruhat-Tits building of $PGL_3$ over a
nonarchimedean local field $F$. Analogous to a graph zeta function,
$Z(X_\Gamma, u)$ is a rational function and it satisfies the Riemann hypothesis
if and only if $X_\Gamma$ is a Ramanujan complex.
