We propose a deconvolution algorithm for images blurred and degraded by a
Poisson noise. The algorithm uses a fast proximal backward-forward splitting
iteration. This iteration minimizes an energy which combines a
\textit{non-linear} data fidelity term, adapted to Poisson noise, and a
non-smooth sparsity-promoting regularization (e.g $\ell_1$-norm) over the image
representation coefficients in some dictionary of transforms (e.g. wavelets,
curvelets). Our results on simulated microscopy images of neurons and cells are
confronted to some state-of-the-art algorithms. They show that our approach is
very competitive, and as expected, the importance of the non-linearity due to
Poisson noise is more salient at low and medium intensities. Finally an
experiment on real fluorescent confocal microscopy data is reported.
