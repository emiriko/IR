The collective ground-state correlations stemming from low-lying quadrupole
excitations are computed microscopically. To that end, the self-consistent
mean-field model is employed on the basis of the Skyrme-Hartre-Fock (SHF)
functional augmented by BCS pairing. The microscopic-macroscopic mapping is
achieved by quadrupole-constrained mean-field calculations which are processed
further in the generator-coordinate method (GCM) at the level of the Gaussian
overlap approximation (GOA).
  We study the correlation effects on energy, charge radii, and surface
thickness for a great variety of semi-magic nuclei. A key issue is to work out
the influence of variations of the SHF functional. We find that collective
ground-state correlations (GSC) are robust under change of nuclear bulk
properties (e.g., effective mass, symmetry energy) or of spin-orbit coupling.
Some dependence on the pairing strength is observed. This, however, does not
change the general conclusion that collective GSC obey a general pattern and
that their magnitudes are rather independent of the actual SHF parameters.
