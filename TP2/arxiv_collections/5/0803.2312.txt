Using the Bethe-ansatz density-functional theory, we study a one-dimensional
Hubbard model of confined attractively interacting fermions in the presence of
a uniformly distributed disorder. The strongly-correlated Luther-Emery nature
of the attractive one-dimensional Hubbard model is fully taken into account as
the reference system in the density-functional theory. The effects of the
disorder are investigated on the atomic-density waves in the
weak-to-intermediate attractive interaction and on the spin-singlet dimers of
doubly occupied sites in the strongly attractive regime. It is found that
atomic density waves are sensitive to the disorder and the spin-singlet dimers
of doubly occupied sites are quite unstable against the disorder. We also show
that very weak disorder could smear the singularities in the stiffness, thus
suppress the spin-singlet pairs.
