The frequency spectrum of the Casimir force between two plates separated by
vacuum as it appears in the Lifshitz formalism is reexamined and generalised as
compared to previous works to allow for imperfectly reflecting plates. As
previously reported by Ford [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{48} (1993) 2962], the highly
oscillatory nature of the frequency dependence of the Casimir force points to
possibilities for very large and indeed negative Casimir forces if the
frequency-dependent dielectric response, $\epsilon(\omega)$, of the materials
could be tuned. A paradox occurs, however, because an alternative calculation
of the effect of a perturbation of $\epsilon(\omega)$ involving a Wick rotation
to imaginary frequencies indicate only very modest effects. A recent experiment
appears to convincingly rule out the reality of Ford's optimistic predictions,
although given the enormous technological promise of such frequency effects,
further theoretical and experimental study is called for.
