In both molecular physics and condensed matter theory, deeper understanding
of the correlation energy density epsilon_c (r) remains a high priority. By
adopting Loewdin's definition of correlation energy as the difference between
the exact and the Hartree-Fock values, here we propose two alternative routes
to define this. One of these involves both exact and Hartree-Fock (HF)
wavefunctions, while the second requires a coupling constant integration. As an
exact analytical example of the first route, we treat the two-electron model
atom of Moshinsky, for which both confinement potential and interactions are
harmonic. Though the correlation energy density epsilon_c (r) is known
analytically, we also investigate numerically its relation to the exact
ground-state density in this example.
