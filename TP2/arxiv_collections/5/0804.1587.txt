For any polynomial representation of the special linear group, the nodes of
the corresponding crystal may be indexed by semi-standard Young tableaux. Under
certain conditions, the standard Young tableaux occur, and do so with weight 0.
Standard Young tableaux also parametrize the vertices of dual equivalence
graphs. Motivated by the underlying representation theory, in this paper, we
explainthis connection by giving a combinatorial manifestation of Schur-Weyl
duality. In particular, we put a dual equivalence graph structure on the
0-weight space of certain crystal graphs, producing edges combinatorially from
the crystal edges. The construction can be expressed in terms of the local
characterizations given by Stembridge for crystal graphs and the author for
dual equivalence graphs.
