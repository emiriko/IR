This paper proposes new derivations of three well-known sorting algorithms,
in their functional formulation. The approach we use is based on three main
ingredients: first, the algorithms are derived from a simpler algorithm, i.e.
the specification is already a solution to the problem (in this sense our
derivations are program transformations). Secondly, a mixture of inductive and
coinductive arguments are used in a uniform, algebraic style in our reasoning.
Finally, the approach uses structural invariants so as to strengthen the
equational reasoning with logical arguments that cannot be captured in the
algebraic framework.
