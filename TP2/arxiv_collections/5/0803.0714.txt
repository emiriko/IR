Using the angular dependence of the planar Hall effect in GaMnAs
ferromagnetic films, we were able to determine the distribution of magnetic
domain pinning fields in this material. Interestingly, there is a major
difference between the pinning field distribution in as-grown and in annealed
films, the former showing a strikingly narrower distribution than the latter.
This conspicuous difference can be attributed to the degree of non-uniformity
of magnetic anisotropy in both types of films. This finding provides a better
understanding of the magnetic domain landscape in GaMnAs that has been the
subject of intense debate.
