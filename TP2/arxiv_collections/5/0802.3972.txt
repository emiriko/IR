A new extended Dicke model, which includes atom-atom interactions and a
driving classical laser field, is established for a Bose-Einstein condensate
inside an ultrahigh-finesse optical cavity. A feasible experimental setup with
a strong atom-field coupling is proposed, where most parameters are easily
controllable and thus the predicted second-order superradiant-normal phase
transition may be detected by measuring the ground-state atomic population.
More intriguingly, a novel second-order phase transition from the superradiant
phase to the \textquotedblleft Mott" phase is also revealed. In addition, a
rich and exotic phase diagram is presented.
