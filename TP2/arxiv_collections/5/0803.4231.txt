We discuss certain homological properties of graded algebras whose trivial
modules admit non-pure resolutions. Such algebras include both of
Artin-Schelter regular algebras of types (12221) and (13431). Under certain
conditions, a module with non-pure resolution is decomposed to form an
extension by two modules with pure resolutions.
