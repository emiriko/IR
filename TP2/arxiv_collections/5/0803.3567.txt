Using diamagnetically levitated particles we investigate the dynamics of the
freely cooling granular gas. At early times we find good agreement with Haff's
law, where the time scale for particle collisions can be determined from
independent measurements. At late times, clustering of particles occurs. This
can be included in a Haff-like description taking into account the decreasing
number of free particles. With this a good description of the data is possible
over the whole time range.
