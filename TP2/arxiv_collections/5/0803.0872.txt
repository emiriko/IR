Based on statistical approach we described possible formation of spatially
inhomogeneous distribution in the system of interacting Fermi particles by
long-rage forces, and we demonstrated nonperturbative calculation of the
partition function in this case. It was shown, that particles interacting with
an attractive $1/r$ potential form clusters. Cluster is equilibrium structure,
if we suppose that average energy of interaction of two particles is much less
than their average kinetic energy $kT$. The analogy between self-gravitation
gas and plasma was shown. The dynamics of cluster formation was considered with
help hydrodynamical and statistical approaches, and time of relaxation to
equilibrium state was found.
