We observe the dynamics of waves propagating on the surface of a ferrofluid
under the influence of a spatially and temporarily modulated field. In
particular, we excite plane waves by a travelling lamellar modulation of the
magnetization. By this external driving both the wavelength and the propagation
velocity of the waves can be controlled. The amplitude of the excited waves
exhibits a resonance phenomenon similar to that of a forced harmonic
oscillator. Its analysis reveals the dispersion relation of the free surface
waves, from which the critical magnetic field for the onset of the Rosensweig
instability can be extrapolated.
