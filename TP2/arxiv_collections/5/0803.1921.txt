We present a study of phase transitions of the Curie--Weiss Potts model at
(inverse) temperature $\beta$, in presence of an external field $h$. Both
thermodynamic and topological aspects of these transitions are considered. For
the first aspect we complement previous results and give an explicit equation
of the thermodynamic transition line in the $\beta$--$h$ plane as well as the
magnitude of the jump of the magnetization (for $q \geqslant 3)$. The signature
of the latter aspect is characterized here by the presence or not of a giant
component in the clusters of a Fortuin--Kasteleyn type representation of the
model. We give the equation of the Kert\'esz line separating (in the
$\beta$--$h$ plane) the two behaviours. As a result, we get that this line
exhibits, as soon as $q \geqslant 3$, a very interesting cusp where it
separates from the thermodynamic transition line.
