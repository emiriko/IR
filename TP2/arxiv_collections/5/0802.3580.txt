We demonstrate that absorbing phase transitions in one dimension may be
induced by the dynamics of a single site. As an example we consider a
one-dimensional model of diffusing particles, where a single site at the
boundary evolves according to the dynamics of a contact process. As the rate
for offspring production at this site is varied, the model exhibits a phase
transition from a fluctuating active phase into an absorbing state. The
universal properties of the transition are analyzed by numerical simulations
and approximation techniques.
