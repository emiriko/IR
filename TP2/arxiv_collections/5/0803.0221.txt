Heavy flavour baryons containing one or two charm quarks with light flavour
combinations are studied using the hyper central description of the three-body
system. The confinement potential is assumed as hyper central coulomb plus
power potential with power index $\nu$. The ground state masses and the
magnetic moments of charmed, $J^P={1/2}^+$ and ${3/2}^+$ baryons are computed
for different power index, $ \nu$ starting from 0.5 to 2.0.
