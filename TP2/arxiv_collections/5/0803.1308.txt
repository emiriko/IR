Based on the concepts of the mechanics of unsaturated soils where capillary
phenomena arise between the wetting fluid (water) and the non-wetting one
(air), the subsidence of chalks containing oil (non-wetting fluid) during water
injection (wetting fluid) is analysed. It is shown that the collapse phenomenon
of unsaturated soils under wetting provides a physical explanation and a
satisfactory prediction of the order of magnitude of the subsidence of the
chalk. The use of a well established constitutive model for unsaturated soils
allows a description of the hydro-mechanical history of the chalk, from its
deposition to the oil exploitation.
