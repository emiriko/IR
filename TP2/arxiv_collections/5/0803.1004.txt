The braneworld theory appear with the purpose of solving the problem of the
hierarchy of the fundamental interactions. The perspectives of the theory
emerge as a new physics, for example, deviation of the law of Newton's gravity.
One of the principles of the theory is to suppose that the braneworld is local
submanifold in a space of high dimension, the bulk, solution of Einstein's
equations in high dimension. In this paper we approach the mathematical
consistency of this theory with a new proof of the fundamental theorem of
submanifolds for case of semi-Riemannian manifolds. This theorem consist an
essential mathematical support for this new theory. We find the integrability
conditions for the existence of space-time submanifolds in a pseudo-Euclidean
space.
