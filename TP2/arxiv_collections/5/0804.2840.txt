Utilizing time-resolved Kerr rotation techniques, we have investigated the
spin dynamics of a high mobility, low density two dimensional electron gas in a
GaAs/Al0:35Ga0:65As heterostructure in dependence on temperature from 1.5 K to
30 K. It is found that the spin relaxation/dephasing time under a magnetic
field of 0.5 T exhibits a maximum of 3.12 ns around 14 K, superimposed on an
increasing background with rising temperature. The appearance of the maximum is
ascribed to that at the temperature where the crossover from the degenerate to
the nondegenerate regime takes place, electron-electron Coulomb scattering
becomes strongest, and thus inhomogeneous precession broadening due to
D'yakonov-Perel'(DP) mechanism becomes weakest. These results agree with the
recent theoretical predictions [Zhou et al., PRB 75, 045305 (2007)], verifying
the importance of electron-electron Coulomb scattering to electron spin
relaxation/dephasing.
