We obtain the primitively divergent diagrams in $\kappa$-deformed scalar
field in four-dimensional spacetime with quartic self-interaction in order to
investigate the effect of the fundamental length $q=1/(2\kappa)$ on such
diagrams. Thanks to $\kappa$-deformation, we find that the dimensionally
regularized forms of the diagrams lead to finite results in the limit of
space-time dimension four. The effect of the deformation appears as a
displacement of the poles in the complex plane.
