We study theoretically the magnetic and electric properties of the interface
between two antiferromagnetic and insulating manganites: La0.5Ca0.5MnO3, a
strong correlated insulator, and CaMnO3, a band-insulator. We find that a
ferromagnetic and metallic electron gas is formed at the interface between the
two layers. We confirm the metallic character of the interface by calculating
the in-plane conductance. The possibility of increasing the electron gas
density by selective doping is also discussed.
