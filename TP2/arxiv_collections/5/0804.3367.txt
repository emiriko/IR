The paper presents a new method of trend extraction in the framework of the
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) approach. This method is easy to use, does not
need specification of models of time series and trend, allows to extract trend
in the presence of noise and oscillations and has only two parameters (besides
basic SSA parameter called window length). One parameter manages scale of the
extracted trend and another is a method specific threshold value. We propose
procedures for the choice of the parameters. The presented method is evaluated
on a simulated time series with a polynomial trend and an oscillating component
with unknown period and on the seasonally adjusted monthly data of unemployment
level in Alaska for the period 1976/01-2006/09.
