A sufficiently large species imbalance (polarization) in a two-component
Feshbach resonant Fermi gas is known to drive the system into its normal state.
We show that the resulting strongly-interacting state is a conventional Fermi
liquid, that is, however, strongly renormalized by pairing fluctuations. Using
a controlled 1/N expansion, we calculate the properties of this state with a
particular emphasis on the atomic spectral function, the momentum distribution
functions displaying the Migdal discontinuity, and the radio frequency (RF)
spectrum. We discuss the latter in the light of the recent experiments of
Schunck et al. (cond-mat/0702066) on such a resonant Fermi gas, and show that
the observations are consistent with a conventional, but strongly renormalized
Fermi-liquid picture.
