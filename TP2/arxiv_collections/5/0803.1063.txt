The Csisz\'ar f-divergence, which is a class of information distances, is
known to offer a useful tool for analysing the classical counterpart of the
cloning operations that are quantum mechanically impossible for the factorized
and marginality classical probability distributions under Liouville dynamics.
We show that a class of information distances that does not belong to this
divergence class also allows for the formulation of a classical analogue of the
quantum no-cloning theorem. We address a family of nonlinear Liouville-like
equations, and generic distances, to obtain constraints on the corresponding
functional forms, associated with the formulation of classical analogue of the
no-cloning principle.
