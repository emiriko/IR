E. Cartan proved that conformally flat hypersurfaces in S^{n+1} for n>3 have
at most two distinct principal curvatures and locally envelop a one-parameter
family of (n-1)-spheres. We prove that the Gauss-Codazzi equation for
conformally flat hypersurfaces in S^4 is a soliton equation, and use a dressing
action from soliton theory to construct geometric Ribaucour transforms of these
hypersurfaces. We describe the moduli of these hypersurfaces in S^4 and their
loop group symmetries. We also generalise these results to conformally flat
n-immersions in (2n-2)-spheres with flat normal bundle and constant
multiplicities.
