We introduce a dispersionless integrable system which interpolates between
the dispersionless Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation and the hyper-CR equation.
The interpolating system arises as a symmetry reduction of the anti--self--dual
Einstein equations in (2, 2) signature by a conformal Killing vector whose
self--dual derivative is null. It also arises as a special case of the
Manakov-Santini integrable system. We discuss the corresponding Einstein--Weyl
structures.
