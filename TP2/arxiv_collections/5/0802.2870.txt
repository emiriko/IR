In February 2007, the fourth stage of the Mainz Microtron, MAMI-C, started
operations with a first experiment. The new Harmonic Double-Sided Microtron
delivers an electron beam with energies up to 1.5 GeV while preserving the
excellent beam quality of the previous stages. The experimental program at MAMI
is focused on studies of the hadron structure in the domain of non-perturbative
QCD. In this paper, a few prominent selections of the extensive physics program
at MAMI-C will be presented.
