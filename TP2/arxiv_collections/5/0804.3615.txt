Presented approach in polynomial time calculates large number of invariants
for each vertex, which won't change with graph isomorphism and should fully
determine the graph. For example numbers of closed paths of length k for given
starting vertex, what can be though as the diagonal terms of k-th power of the
adjacency matrix. For k=2 we would get degree of verities invariant, higher
describes local topology deeper. Now if two graphs are isomorphic, they have
the same set of such vectors of invariants - we can sort theses vectors
lexicographically and compare them. If they agree, permutations from sorting
allow to reconstruct the isomorphism. I'm presenting arguments that these
invariants should fully determine the graph, but unfortunately I can't prove it
in this moment. This approach can give hope, that maybe P=NP - instead of
checking all instances, we should make arithmetics on these large numbers.
