[Spreadsheet] Models are invaluable tools for strategic planning. Models help
key decision makers develop a shared conceptual understanding of complex
decisions, identify sensitivity factors and test management scenarios.
Different modelling approaches are specialist areas in themselves. Model
development can be onerous, expensive, time consuming, and often bewildering.
It is also an iterative process where the true magnitude of the effort, time
and data required is often not fully understood until well into the process.
This paper explores the traditional approaches to strategic planning modelling
commonly used in organisations and considers the application of a real-options
approach to match and benefit from the increasing uncertainty in today's
rapidly changing world.
