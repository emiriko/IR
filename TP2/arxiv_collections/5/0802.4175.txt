We report on low-temperature magnetotransport measurements on InN nanowires,
grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The characteristic fluctuation
pattern observed in the conductance was employed to obtain information on
phase-coherent transport. By analyzing the root-mean-square and the correlation
field of the conductance fluctuations at various temperatures the
phase-coherence length was determined.
