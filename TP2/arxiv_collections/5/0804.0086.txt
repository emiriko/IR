This paper ("Two-Level Chromophore and Irreversibility", which can be found
at arXiv:0804.0086) has been withdrawn by the author due to too many errors and
misleading statements. This paper has been superseded by Section 2.11 and
Chapter 7 (and other sections) of my Ph.D. dissertation ("Pressure Broadening
and Pressure Shift of Diatomic Iodine at 675 nm"), which can be found at
arXiv:0910.5053.
