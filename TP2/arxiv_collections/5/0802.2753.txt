We propose "conformal supersymmetry breaking" models, which tightly relate
the conformal breaking scale (i.e. R-symmetry breaking scale) and the
supersymmetry breaking scale. The both scales are originated from the constant
term in the superpotential through the common source of the R-symmetry
breaking. We show that dynamical tuning between those mass scales significantly
reduces the degree of fine-tuning necessary for generating the almost vanishing
cosmological constant.
