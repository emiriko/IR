We study entanglement dynamics in a system consisting of a qubit dispersively
coupled to a finite-temperature, dissipative, driven oscillator. We show that
there are two generic ways to generate entanglement: one can entangle the qubit
either with the phase or the amplitude of the oscillator's motion. Using an
exact solution of the relevant quantum master equation, we study the robustness
of both these kinds of entanglement against the effects of dissipation and
temperature; in the limit of zero temperature (but finite damping), a simple
analytic expression is derived for the logarithmic negativity. We also discuss
how the generated entanglement may be detected via dephasing revivals, being
mindful that revivals can occur even in the absence of any useful entanglement.
Our results have relevance to quantum electromechanics, as well as to circuit
QED systems.
