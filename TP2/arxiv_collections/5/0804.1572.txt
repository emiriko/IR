We study the line shapes of radiative $\phi$-decays involving virtual
$f_{0}(980)$ and $a_{0}(980)$ mesons which decay, via derivative couplings, to
$\pi^{0}\pi^{0}$ and $\pi^{0}\eta$ respectively. After developing the formalism
for derivative interactions at one-loop level, we show that they can reproduce
the measured peaked line shapes of $\phi$-decays without including kaon loops.
