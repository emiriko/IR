A top-gated single wall carbon nanotube is used to define three coupled
quantum dots in series between two electrodes. The additional electron number
on each quantum dot is controlled by top-gate voltages allowing for current
measurements of single, double and triple quantum dot stability diagrams.
Simulations using a capacitor model including tunnel coupling between
neighboring dots captures the observed behavior with good agreement.
Furthermore, anti-crossings between indirectly coupled levels and higher order
cotunneling are discussed.
