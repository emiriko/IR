We consider the problem of self-healing in peer-to-peer networks that are
under repeated attack by an omniscient adversary. We assume that the following
process continues for up to n rounds where n is the total number of nodes
initially in the network: the adversary deletes an arbitrary node from the
network, then the network responds by quickly adding a small number of new
edges.
  We present a distributed data structure that ensures two key properties.
First, the diameter of the network is never more than $O(\log \Delta)$ times
its original diameter, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the network
initially. We note that for many peer-to-peer systems, $\Delta$ is
polylogarithmic, so the diameter increase would be a O(log log n)
multiplicative factor. Second, the degree of any node never increases by more
than 3 over its original degree. Our data structure is fully distributed, has
O(1) latency per round and requires each node to send and receive O(1) messages
per round. The data structure requires an initial setup phase that has latency
equal to the diameter of the original network, and requires, with high
probability, each node v to send O(log n) messages along every edge incident to
v. Our approach is orthogonal and complementary to traditional topology-based
approaches to defending against attack.
