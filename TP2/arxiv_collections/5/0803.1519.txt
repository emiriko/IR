We classify all torsion-free derived arithmetic Fuchsian groups of genus two
by commensurability class. In particular, we show that there exist no such
groups arising from quaternion algebras over number fields of degree greater
than 5. We also prove some results on the existence and form of maximal orders
for a class of quaternion algebras related to these groups. Using these results
in conjunction with a computer program, one can determine an explicit set of
generators for each derived arithmetic Fuchsian group containing a torsion-free
subgroup of genus two. We show this for a number of examples.
