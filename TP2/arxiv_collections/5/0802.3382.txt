The metal-insulator transition, and the associated magnetic transition, in
the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) regime of the one-orbital model for
manganites is here studied using Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. Both cooperative
oxygen lattice distortions and a finite superexchange coupling among the
$t_{\rm 2g}$ spins are included in our investigations. Charge and spin
correlations are studied. In the CMR regime, a strong competition between the
ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic charge-ordered insulating states
is observed. This competition is shown to be important to understand the
resistivity peak that appears near the critical temperature. Moreover, it is
argued that the system is dynamically inhomogeneous, with short-range charge
and spin correlations that slowly evolve with MC time, producing the glassy
characteristics of the CMR state. The local density-of-states (LDOS) is also
investigated, and a pseudogap (PG) is found to exist in the CMR temperature
range. The width of the PG in the LDOS is calculated and directly compared with
recent scanning-tunneling-spectroscopy (STS) experimental results. The
agreement between our calculation and the experiment suggests that the
depletion of the conductance at low bias observed experimentally is a
reflection on the existence of a PG in the LDOS spectra, as opposed to a hard
gap. The apparent homogeneity observed via STS techniques could be caused by
the slow time characteristics of this probe. Faster experimental methods should
unveil a rather inhomogeneous state in the CMR regime, as already observed in
neutron scattering experiments.
