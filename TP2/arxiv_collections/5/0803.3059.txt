We consider a repeated quantum interaction model describing a small system
$\Hh_S$ in interaction with each one of the identical copies of the chain
$\bigotimes_{\N^*}\C^{n+1}$, modeling a heat bath, one after another during the
same short time intervals $[0,h]$. We suppose that the repeated quantum
interaction Hamiltonian is split in two parts: a free part and an interaction
part with time scale of order $h$. After giving the GNS representation, we
establish the relation between the time scale $h$ and the classical low density
limit. We introduce a chemical potential $\mu$ related to the time $h$ as
follows: $h^2=e^{\beta\mu}$. We further prove that the solution of the
associated discrete evolution equation converges strongly, when $h$ tends to 0,
to the unitary solution of a quantum Langevin equation directed by Poisson
processes.
