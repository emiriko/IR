For symplectic Lie algebras $\mathfrak{sp}(2n,\mathbb{C})$, denote by
$\mathfrak{b}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$ its Borel subalgebra and maximal nilpotent
subalgebra, respectively. We construct a relationship between the abelian
ideals of $\mathfrak{b}$ and the cohomology of $\mathfrak{n}$ with trivial
coefficients. By this relationship, we can enumerate the number of abelian
ideals of $\mathfrak{b}$ with certain dimension via the Poincare polynomials of
Weyl groups of type $A_{n-1}$ and $C_n$.
