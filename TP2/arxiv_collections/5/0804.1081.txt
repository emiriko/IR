The Digamma and Polygamma functions are important tools in mathematical
physics, not only for its many properties but also for the applications in
statistical mechanics and stellar evolution. In many textbooks is found its
develop almost by the same procedure. In this paper expressions for the Digamma
and Polygamma functions, in terms of hypergeometric functions, are found
through the derivative definition.
