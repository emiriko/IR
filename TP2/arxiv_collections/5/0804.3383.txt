We report on a scaling test of several mesonic observables in the
non-perturbatively O(a) improved Wilson theory with two flavors of dynamical
quarks. The observables are constructed in a fixed volume of 2.4fm x (1.8fm)^3
with Schroedinger functional boundary conditions. No significant scaling
violations are found. Using the kaon mass determined in \cite{cernI}, we update
our estimate of the Lambda parameter to Lambda^(2)_{msbar}/m_K = 0.52(6).
