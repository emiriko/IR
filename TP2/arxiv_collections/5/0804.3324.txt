The control on the distribution of magnetic ions into a semiconducting host
is crucial for the functionality of magnetically doped semiconductors. Through
a structural analysis at the nanoscale, we give experimental evidence that the
aggregation of Fe ions in (Ga,Fe)N and consequently the magnetic response of
the material are affected by growth rate and co-doping with shallow impurities.
