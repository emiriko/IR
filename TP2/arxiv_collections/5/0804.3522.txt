We use the Mandelbrot-Zipfs power law for the description of the inhomogenity
of the spin system. We describe the statistical distributions of the domain's
masses in the Ising model near the phase transition induced by the temperature.
The statistical distribution near the critical point appears to be of the
Pareto type.
