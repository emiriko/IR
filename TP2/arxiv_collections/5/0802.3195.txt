We present a model system that might serve as a blueprint for the controlled
layout of graphene based nanodevices. The systems consists of chains of B7
clusters implanted in a graphene matrix, where the boron clusters are not
directly connected. We show that the graphene matrix easily accepts these
alternating boron chains, and that the implanted boron components may
dramatically modify the electronic properties of graphene based nanomaterials.
This suggests a functionalization of graphene nanomaterials, where the
semiconducting properties might be supplemented by parts of the graphene matrix
itself, but the basic wiring will be provided by alternating chains of
implanted boron clusters that connect these areas.
