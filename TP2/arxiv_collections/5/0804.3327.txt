We report interferometric schemes to prepare arbitrary states of
four-dimensional qudits (ququarts) based on biphoton states of ultrafast-pumped
frequency-nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Preparation and
tomographic characterization of a few examples of general single-ququart
states, a pure state, a completely mixed state, and a partially-mixed state,
are experimentally demonstrated.
