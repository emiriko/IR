We have discussed a consistency condition of Berry phases defined by a local
gauge twist and spatial symmetries of the many body system. It imposes a non
trivial gap closing condition under the gauge twist in both finite- and
infinite-size systems. It also implies a necessary condition for the gapped and
unique ground state. As for the simplest case, it predicts an inevitable gap
closing in the Heisenberg chain of half integer spins. Its relation to the
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem is discussed based on the symmetries of the twisted
Hamiltonian. The discussion is also extended to the (approximately) degenerated
multiplet and fermion cases. It restricts the number of the states in the low
energy cluster of the spectrum by the filling of the fermions. Constraints by
the reflection symmetry are also discussed.
