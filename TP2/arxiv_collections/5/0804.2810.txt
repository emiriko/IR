The effect of non periodic boundary conditions on decaying two-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is investigated. We consider a circular domain
with no-slip boundary conditions for the velocity and where the normal
component of the magnetic field vanishes at the wall. Different flow regimes
are obtained by starting from random initial velocity and magnetic fields with
varying integral quantities. These regimes, equivalent to the ones observed by
Ting, Matthaeus and Montgomery [Phys. Fluids {\bf 29}, 3261, (1986)] in
periodic domains, are found to subsist in confined domains. We examine the
effect of solid boundaries on the energy decay and alignment properties. The
final states are characterized by functional relationships between velocity and
magnetic field.
