Martensitic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic shape memory alloys are
known to depend up on structural modulations and associated changes in the
Fermi surface. These modulations although periodic and spanning over multiple
unit cells, involve movement of atoms typically of the order of 0.01A.
Therefore X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) is an ideal tool to map both,
local atomic movements and changes in density of states (DOS) due to changing
hybridization as the system transforms from austenitic to martensitic phase.
This paper presents a compilation of our XAFS studies on the Ni-Mn based shape
memory alloys. A complete description of the changes in local structure around
the constituent metal ions in the following alloy compositions: Ni2+xMn1-xGa,
Ni2Mn1.4Sn0.6 and Ni2Mn1.4In0.6 in the austenitic and martensitic phases have
been obtained. The results give the new experimental evidence for the crucial
hybridization component that influences and leads to structural transition in
these Ni-Mn based Heusler alloys.
