Nuclei with $A>282$ have been studied in the Relativistic Mean Field approach
using the force FSU Gold and a zero range pairing interaction. The
Euler-Lagrange equations have been solved in the co-ordinate space. Alpha
nucleus potential has been constructed with the DDM3Y1 interaction, which has
an exponential density dependence, in the double folding model using the
nucleon densities in the daughter nucleus and the $\alpha$ particle. Half lives
of $\alpha$ decay have been calculated for tunneling of the $\alpha$ particle
through the potential barrier in the WKB approximation and assuming a constant
preformation probability. The resulting values agree well with experimental
measurements.
