We investigate the influence of spin-orbit coupling in a non-centrosymmetric
superconductor on its ground state properties near a surface. We determine the
spectrum of Andreev bound states due to surface-induced mixing of bands with
opposite spin helicities for a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. We find a
qualitative change of the Andreev spectrum when we account for the suppression
of the order parameter near the surface, leading to clear signatures in the
surface density of states. We also compute the spin current at the surface,
which has spin polarization normal to that of the bulk current. The magnitude
of the current at the surface is enhanced in the normal state compared to the
bulk, and even further enlarged in the superconducting phase. The particle and
hole coherence amplitudes show Faraday-like rotations of the spin along
quasiparticle trajectories.
