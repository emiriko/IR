The influence of speed limits on roadway safety is an extremely important
social issue and is subject to an extensive debate in the State of Indiana and
nationwide. With around 800-900 fatalities and thousands of injuries annually
in Indiana, traffic accidents place an incredible social and economic burden on
the state. Still, speed limits posted on highways and other roads are routinely
exceeded as individual drivers try to balance safety and mobility (speed). This
research explores the relationship between speed limits and roadway safety.
Namely, the research focuses on the influence of the posted speed limit on the
causation and severity of accidents. Data on individual accidents from the
Indiana Electronic Vehicle Crash Record System is used in the research, and
appropriate statistical models are estimated for causation and severity of
different types of accidents on all road classes. The results of the modeling
show that speed limits do not have a statistically significant adverse effect
on unsafe-speed-related causation of accidents on all roads, but generally
increase the severity of accidents on the majority of roads other than highways
(the accident severity on highways is unaffected by speed limits). Our findings
can perhaps save both lives and travel time by helping the Indiana Department
of Transportation determine optimal speed limit policies in the state.
