For a two-component Fermi gas in the unitarity limit (ie, with infinite
scattering length), there is a well-known virial theorem, first shown by J. E.
Thomas et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 120402 (2005). A few people rederived this
result, and extended it to few-body systems, but their results are all
restricted to the unitarity limit. Here I show that there is a generalized
virial theorem for FINITE scattering lengths. I also generalize an exact result
concerning the pressure, first shown in cond-mat/0508320, to the case of
imbalanced populations.
