The low energy scattering of gravitons from a composite extended system,
which is made of classical massive bodies, is considered; by using the Feynman
rules of effective quantum gravity, the corresponding cross-section is computed
to lowest order in powers of the gravitational coupling constant. For the
gravitons scattering from a rotating planet or a star, it is shown that the
classical limit of the matter-gravitons coupling in the effective quantum
gravity lagrangian leads to a low energy scattering amplitude which coincides
with the expression obtained in classical general relativity.
