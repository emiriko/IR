Let $\lambda$ be a positive number, and let $(x_j:j\in\mathbb
Z)\subset\mathbb R$ be a fixed Riesz-basis sequence, namely, $(x_j)$ is
strictly increasing, and the set of functions $\{\mathbb R\ni t\mapsto
e^{ix_jt}:j\in\mathbb Z\}$ is a Riesz basis ({\it i.e.,} unconditionalbasis)
for $L_2[-\pi,\pi]$. Given a function $f\in L_2(\mathbb R)$ whose Fourier
transform is zero almost everywhere outside the interval $[-\pi,\pi]$, there is
a unique square-summable sequence $(a_j:j\in\mathbb Z)$, depending on $\lambda$
and $f$, such that the function$$I_\lambda(f)(x):=\sum_{j\in\mathbb
Z}a_je^{-\lambda(x-x_j)^2}, \qquad x\in\mathbb R, $$ is continuous and square
integrable on $(-\infty,\infty)$, and satisfies the interpolatory conditions
$I_\lambda (f)(x_j)=f(x_j)$, $j\in\mathbb Z$. It is shown that $I_\lambda(f)$
converges to $f$ in $L_2(\mathbb R)$, and also uniformly on $\mathbb R$, as
$\lambda\to0^+$. A multidimensional version of this result is also obtained. In
addition, the fundamental functions for the univariate interpolation process
are defined, and some of their basic properties, including their exponential
decay for large argument, are established. It is further shown that the
associated interpolation operators are bounded on $\ell_p(\mathbb Z)$ for every
$p\in[1,\infty]$.
