An unusual increase of the conductance with temperature is observed in clean
quantum point contacts for conductances larger than 2e^2/h. At the same time a
positive magnetoresistance arises at high temperatures. A model accounting for
electron-electron interactions mediated by bound- aries (scattering on Friedel
oscillations) qualitatively describes the observation. It is supported by
numerical simulation at zero magnetic field.
