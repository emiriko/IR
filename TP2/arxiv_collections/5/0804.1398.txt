Based on First-principles calculation, we have investigated electronic
structure of a ZrCuSiAs structured superconductor LaNiPO. The density of
states, band structures and Fermi surfaces have been given in detail. Our
results indicate that the bonding of the La-O and Ni-P is strongly covalent
whereas binding property between the LaO and NiP blocks is mostly ionic. It's
also found that four bands are across the Fermi level and the corresponding
Fermi surfaces all have a two-dimensional character. In addition, we also give
the band decomposed charge density, which suggests that orbital components of
Fermi surfaces are more complicated than cuprate superconductors.
