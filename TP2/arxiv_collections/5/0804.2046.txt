The Bousso entropy bound is investigated for static spherically symmetric
configurations of ideal gas with Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distribution
function. Gas of massive particles is considered. The paper is continuation of
the previous work concerning the massless case. Special attention is devoted to
lightsheets generated by spheres. Conditions under which the Bousso bound can
be violated are discussed and it is shown that a possible violating region
cannot be arbitrarily large and that it is contained inside a sphere of unit
Planck radius if the number of independent spin states $g_s$ is small enough.
It is also shown that the central temperature must exceed the Planck
temperature in order to get a violation of the Bousso bound for $g_s$ not too
large. The situation for higher-dimensional spacetimes is also discussed and
the FMW conditions are investigated.
