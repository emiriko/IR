We show the potential for classifying images of mixtures of aggregate, based
themselves on varying, albeit well-defined, sizes and shapes, in order to
provide a far more effective approach compared to the classification of
individual sizes and shapes. While a dominant (additive, stationary) Gaussian
noise component in image data will ensure that wavelet coefficients are of
Gaussian distribution, long tailed distributions (symptomatic, for example, of
extreme values) may well hold in practice for wavelet coefficients. Energy (2nd
order moment) has often been used for image characterization for image
content-based retrieval, and higher order moments may be important also, not
least for capturing long tailed distributional behavior. In this work, we
assess 2nd, 3rd and 4th order moments of multiresolution transform -- wavelet
and curvelet transform -- coefficients as features. As analysis methodology,
taking account of image types, multiresolution transforms, and moments of
coefficients in the scales or bands, we use correspondence analysis as well as
k-nearest neighbors supervised classification.
