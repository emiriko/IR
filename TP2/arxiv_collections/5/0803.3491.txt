We investigate "chimera" states in a ring of identical phase oscillators
coupled in a time-delayed and spatially non-local fashion. We find novel
"clustered chimera" states that have spatially distributed phase coherence
separated by incoherence with adjacent coherent regions in anti-phase. The
existence of such time-delay induced phase clustering is further supported
through solutions of a generalized functional self-consistency equation of the
mean field. Our results highlight an additional mechanism for cluster formation
that may find wider practical applications.
