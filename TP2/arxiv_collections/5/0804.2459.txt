The density and excitation energy dependence of symmetry energy and symmetry
free energy for finite nuclei are calculated microscopically in a
microcanonical framework taking into account thermal and expansion effects. A
finite-range momentum and density dependent two-body effective interaction is
employed for this purpose. The role of mass, isospin and equation of state
(EoS) on these quantities is also investigated; our calculated results are in
consonance with the available experimental data.
