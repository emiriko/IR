Continuing in the steps of Jon Kleinberg's and others celebrated work on
decentralized search in small-world networks, we conduct an experimental
analysis of a dynamic algorithm that produces small-world networks. We find
that the algorithm adapts robustly to a wide variety of situations in realistic
geographic networks with synthetic test data and with real world data, even
when vertices are uneven and non-homogeneously distributed.
  We investigate the same algorithm in the case where some vertices are more
popular destinations for searches than others, for example obeying power-laws.
We find that the algorithm adapts and adjusts the networks according to the
distributions, leading to improved performance. The ability of the dynamic
process to adapt and create small worlds in such diverse settings suggests a
possible mechanism by which such networks appear in nature.
