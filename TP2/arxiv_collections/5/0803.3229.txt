We study a relation between the weak phase $\gamma$ and the rates and CP
asymmetries of several $K \pi$ decays of $B^+$, $B^0$, and $B_s$, emphasizing
the impact of the latter measurements. Current data indicate large SU(3)
breaking in the strong phases or failure of factorization (including its
application to penguin amplitudes) in $K \pi$ modes of $B^0$ and $B_s$. SU(3)
and factorization only remain approximately valid if the branching ratio for
$B_s \to K^- \pi^+$ exceeds its current value of $(5.27 \pm 1.17) \times
10^{-6}$ by at least 42%, or if a parameter $\xi$ describing ratios of form
factors and decay constants is shifted from its nominal value by more than
twice its estimated error.
