The nucleon electromagnetic form factors are calculated in light cone QCD sum
rules framework using the most general form of the nucleon interpolating
current. Using two forms of the distribution amplitudes (DA's), predictions for
the form factors are presented and compared with existing experimental data. It
is shown that our results describe remarkably well the existing experimental
data.
