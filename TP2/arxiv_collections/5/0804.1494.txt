In this letter a general method for expanding paraxial beams into multipolar
electromagnetic fields is presented. This method is applied to the expansion of
paraxial modes with orbital angular momentum (OAM), showing how the paraxial
OAM is related to the general angular momentum of an electromagnetic wave. This
method can be extended to quasi-paraxial beams, i.e. highly focused laser
beams. Some applications to the control of electronic transitions in atoms are
discussed.
