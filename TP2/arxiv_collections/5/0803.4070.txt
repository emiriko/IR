We describe a new scenario (first introduced in [G. Torrieri, B.
Tom\'a\v{s}ik and I. Mishustin, Phys. Rev. C \textbf{77}, 034903 (2008)]) for
freezeout in heavy ion collisions that could solve the lingering problems
associated with the so-called HBT puzzle. We argue that bulk viscosity
increases as $T$ approaches $T_c$. The fluid {then} becomes unstable against
small perturbations, and fragments into clusters of a size much smaller than
the total size of the system. These clusters maintain the pre-existing
outward-going flow, as a spray of droplets, but develop no flow of their own,
and hadronize by evaporation. We show that this scenario can explain HBT data
and suggest how it can be experimentally tested.
