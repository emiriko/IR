The internal structure of the tetrads in a Poincar\'e non linear gauge theory
of gravity is considered. Minkowskian coordinates becomes dynamical degrees of
freedom playing the role of Goldstone bosons of the translations. A critical
length allowing a covariant expansion similar to the weak field approach is
deduced, the zeroth order metric being maximally symmetric (Minkowskian in some
cases).
