The dielectric dispersion in the uniaxial nematic liquid crystals affects the
switching dynamics of the director, as the dielectric torque is determined by
not only the present values of the electric field and director but also by
their past values. We demonstrate that this dielectric memory leads to an
unusual contribution to the dielectric torque that is linear in the present
field and thus polarity-sensitive. This torque can be used to accelerate the
switch-off phase of director dynamics.
