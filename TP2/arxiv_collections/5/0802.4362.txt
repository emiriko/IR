We propose the use of bright matter-wave solitons formed from Bose-Einstein
condensates with attractive interactions to probe and study quantum reflection
from a solid surface at normal incidence. We demonstrate that the presence of
attractive interatomic interactions leads to a number of advantages for the
study of quantum reflection. The absence of dispersion as the soliton
propagates allows precise control of the velocity normal to the surface and for
much lower velocities to be achieved. Numerical modelling shows that the
robust, self-trapped nature of bright solitons leads to a clean reflection from
the surface, limiting the disruption of the density profile and permitting
accurate measurements of the reflection probability.
