Scandium nitride (ScN) is a semiconducting transition metal nitride for which
there are not identified dopants. We present local density functional
calculations, in supercell approach, for ScN doped with O and C in N-sites and
Ca and Ti in Sc-sites. Small additions of these atoms have the effect of
shifting the Fermi level within the electronic band structure. O and Ti bring
occupied states in bottom of conduction band, while C and Ca produces holes in
top of valence band. Based on the theory we propose that bipolar doping is
possible to scandium nitride.
