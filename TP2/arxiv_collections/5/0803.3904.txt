Multi-sample microarray experiments have become a standard experimental
method for studying biological systems. A frequent goal in such studies is to
unravel the regulatory relationships between genes. During the last few years,
regression models have been proposed for the de novo discovery of cis-acting
regulatory sequences using gene expression data. However, when applied to
multi-sample experiments, existing regression based methods model each
individual sample separately. To better capture the dynamic relationships in
multi-sample microarray experiments, we propose a flexible method for the joint
modeling of promoter sequence and multivariate expression data. In higher order
eukaryotic genomes expression regulation usually involves combinatorial
interaction between several transcription factors. Experiments have shown that
spacing between transcription factor binding sites can significantly affect
their strength in activating gene expression. We propose an adaptive model
building procedure to capture such spacing dependent cis-acting regulatory
modules. We apply our methods to the analysis of microarray time-course
experiments in yeast and in Arabidopsis. These experiments exhibit very
different dynamic temporal relationships. For both data sets, we have found all
of the well-known cis-acting regulatory elements in the related context, as
well as being able to predict novel elements.
