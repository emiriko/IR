In this work, a path integral Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulation of
liquid water is performed. It is found that the inclusion of nuclear quantum
effects systematically improves the agreement of first principles simulations
of liquid water with experiment. In addition, the proton momentum distribution
is computed utilizing a recently developed open path integral molecular
dynamics methodology. It is shown that these results are in good agreement with
neutron Compton scattering data for liquid water and ice.
