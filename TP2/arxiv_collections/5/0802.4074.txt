The purpose of the paper is two-fold: to introduce a multivariable creative
telescoping method, and to apply it in a problem of Quantum Topology: namely
the computation of the non-commutative $A$-polynomial of twist knots.
  Our multivariable creative telescoping method allows us to compute linear
recursions for sums of the form $J(n)=\sum_k c(n,k) \hatJ (k)$ given a
recursion relation for $(\hatJ(n))$ a the hypergeometric kernel $c(n,k)$. As an
application of our method, we explicitly compute the non-commutative
$A$-polynomial for twist knots with -8 and 11 crossings. The non-commutative
$A$-polynomial of a knot encodes the monic, linear, minimal order
$q$-difference equation satisfied by the sequence of colored Jones polynomials
of the knot. Its specialization to $q=1$ is conjectured to be the better-known
$A$-polynomial of a knot, which encodes important information about the
geometry and topology of the knot complement. Unlike the case of the Jones
polynomial, which is easily computable for knots with 50 crossings, the
$A$-polynomial is harder to compute and already unknown for some knots with 12
crossings.
