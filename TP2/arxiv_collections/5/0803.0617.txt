Strongly interacting bosonic particles in a tight-binding periodic potential
superimposed by a weak parabolic trap is a paradigm for many cold atom
experiments. Here, after revisiting the single particle problem, we study
interaction-bound dimers of bosonic atoms in the combined lattice and parabolic
potential. We consider both repulsively- and attractively-bound dimers and find
pronounced differences in their behaviour. We identify conditions under which
attractive and repulsive dimers exhibit analogous dynamics. Our studies reveal
that coherent transport and periodic oscillations of appropriately prepared
one- and two-atom wavepackets can be achieved, which may facilitate information
transfer in optical lattice based quantum computation schemes.
