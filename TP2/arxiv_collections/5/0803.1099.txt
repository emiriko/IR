The irreversibility in a statistical system is traced to its probabilistic
evolution, and the molecular chaos assumption is not its unique consequence as
is commonly believed. Under the assumption that the rate of change of the each
microstate probability vanishes only as time diverges, we prove that the
entropy of a system at constant energy cannot decrease with time.
