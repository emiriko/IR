There is increasing experimental evidence for fractional quantum Hall effect
at filling factor $\nu=2+3/8$. Modeling it as a system of composite fermions,
we study the problem of interacting composite fermions by a number of methods.
In our variational study, we consider the Fermi sea, the Pfaffian paired state,
and bubble and stripe phases of composite fermions, and find that the Fermi sea
state is favored for a wide range of transverse thickness. However, when we
incorporate interactions between composite fermions through composite-fermion
diagonalization on systems with up to 25 composite fermions, we find that a gap
opens at the Fermi level, suggesting that inter-composite fermion interaction
can induce fractional quantum Hall effect at $\nu=2+3/8$. The resulting state
is seen to be distinct from the Pfaffian wave function.
