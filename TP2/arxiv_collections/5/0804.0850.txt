We measure hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles confined in
a thin sheet of fluid. The reduced dimensionality, compared to a bulk fluid,
increases dramatically the range of couplings. Using optical tweezers we force
a two body system along the eigenmodes of the mobility tensor and find that
eigen-mobilities change logarithmically with particle separation. At a hundred
radii distance, the mobilities for correlated and anti-correlated motions
differ by a factor of two, whereas in bulk fluids, they would be practically
indistinguishable. We derive the two dimensional counterpart of the Oseen
hydrodynamic tensor which quantitatively reproduces the observed behavior.
These results highlight the importance of dimensionality for transport and
interactions in colloidal systems and proteins in biological membranes.
