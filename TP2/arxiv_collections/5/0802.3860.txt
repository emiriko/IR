We provide a non-explicit separation of the number-on-forehead communication
complexity classes RP and NP when the number of players is up to \delta log(n)
for any \delta<1. Recent lower bounds on Set-Disjointness [LS08,CA08] provide
an explicit separation between these classes when the number of players is only
up to o(loglog(n)).
