We use lattice Boltzmann simulations to investigate the formation of arrested
structures upon demixing of a binary solvent containing neutrally wetting
colloidal particles. Previous simulations for symmetric fluid quenches pointed
to the formation of `bijels': bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels.
These should be created when a glassy monolayer of particles forms at the
fluid-fluid interface, arresting further demixing, and rigidifying the
structure. Experimental work has broadly confirmed this scenario, but shows
that bijels can also be formed in volumetrically asymmetric quenches. Here we
present new simulation results for such quenches, compare these to the
symmetric case, and find a crossover to an arrested droplet phase at strong
asymmetry. We then make extensive new analyses of the post-arrest dynamics in
our simulated bijel and droplet structures, on time scales comparable to the
Brownian time for colloid motion. Our results suggest that, on these
intermediate time scales, the effective activation barrier to ejection of
particles from the fluid-fluid interface is smaller by at least two orders of
magnitude than the corresponding barrier for an isolated particle on a flat
interface.
