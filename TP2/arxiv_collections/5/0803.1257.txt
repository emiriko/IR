In a very recent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism experiment concerning with
Ru and Rh impurities and metal films on Ag(001) substrate, no local magnetic
momen ts were displayed in direct contradiction with previous theoretical
works. It is thought that there can be three main reasons for this
inconsistency: relaxation, alloying and many-body effects. Some of the
above-mentioned systems are studie d by using a first-principles method in
which relaxation and alloying are taken into account, even so magnetism is
still obtained. For low-coverage systems, hig h magnetic moments in both Ru
($\sim$ 2.49 $\mu_{B}$) and Rh ($\sim$ 2.00 $\mu_{B}$) are obtained. Naturally,
as the coverage is increased the magnetic moments are approached to zero. Also,
it is noticed that the relaxation distances are in creased by magnetism, which
in turn is decreased by alloying. The behavior of th e magnetic properties is
explained in terms of Stoner model.
