We discuss why the tunneling picture does not necessarily lead to Hawking
radiation from the de Sitter horizon. The experience with the condensed matter
analogs of event horizon suggests that the de Sitter vacuum is stable against
the Hawking radiation. On the other hand the detector immersed into the de
Sitter background will detect the radiation which looks as thermal with the
effective temperature twice larger than the Hawking temperature associated with
the cosmological horizon.
