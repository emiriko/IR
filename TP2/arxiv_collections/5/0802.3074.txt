In this research, we present a simple and cost effective soft lithographic
process to fabricate PLA scaffolds for tissue engineering. In which, the
negative photoresist JSR THB-120N was spun on a glass subtract followed by
conventional UV lithographic processes to fabricate the master to cast the PDMS
elastomeric mold. A thin poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) layer was used as a mode
release such that the PLA scaffold can be easily peeled off. The PLA precursor
solution was then cast onto the PDMS mold to form the PLA microstructures.
After evaporating the solvent, the PLA microstructures can be easily peeled off
from the PDMS mold. Experimental results show that the desired microvessels
scaffold can be successfully transferred to the biodegradable polymer PLA.
