This paper presents the fabrication process, characterization results and
basic functionality of silicon microneedles array with biodegradable tips. In
order to avoid the main problems related to silicon microneedles : broking of
the top part of the needles inside the skin, a simple solution can be
fabrication of microneedles array with biodegradable tips. The silicon
microneedles array was fabricated by using reactive ion etching while the
biodegradable tips were performed using and anodization process that generates
selectively porous silicon only on the top part of the skin. The paper presents
also the results of in vitro release of calcein using microneedles array with
biodegradable tips
