The first part of these lectures contains an introductory review of the
AdS/CFT duality and of its tests. Applications to thermal gauge theory are also
discussed briefly. The second part is devoted to a review of gauge-string
dualities based on various warped conifold backgrounds, and to their
cosmological applications.
