We present calculations of the magnetic ground states of Cr trimers in
different geometries on top of a Au(111) surface. By using a least square fit
method based on a fully relativistic embedded-cluster Green's function method
first we determined the parameters of a classical vector-spin model consisting
of second and fourth order interactions. The newly developed method requires no
symmetry constraints, therefore, it is throughout applicable for small
nanoparticles of arbitrary geometry. The magnetic ground states were then found
by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations. In all considered cases the
configurational energy of the Cr trimers is dominated by large
antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions, whilst biquadratic
spin-interactions have the second largest contributions to the energy. We find
that an equilateral Cr trimer exhibits a frustrated 120$^\circ$ N\'eel type of
ground state with a small out-of-plane component of the magnetization and we
show that the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions determine the chirality of the
magnetic ground state. In cases of a linear chain and an isosceles trimer
collinear antiferromagnetic ground states are obtained with a magnetization
lying parallel to the surface.
