Jacobi's action principle is known to lead to a problem of time. For example,
the timelessness of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be seen as resulting from
using Jacobi's principle to define the dynamics of 3-geometries through
superspace. In addition, using Jacobi's principle for non-relativistic
particles is equivalent classically to Newton's theory but leads to a
time-independent Schrodinger equation upon Dirac quantization. In this paper,
we study the mechanism for the disappearance of time as a result of using
Jacobi's principle in these simple particle models. We find that the path
integral quantization very clearly elucidates the physical mechanism for the
timeless of the quantum theory as well as the emergence of duration at the
classical level. Physically, this is the result of a superposition of clocks
which occurs in the quantum theory due to a sum over all histories.
Mathematically, the timelessness is related to how the gauge fixing functions
impose the boundary conditions in the path integral.
