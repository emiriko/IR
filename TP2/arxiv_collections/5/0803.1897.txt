We introduce an elementary optical gate for expanding polarization entangled
W states, in which every pair of photons are entangled alike. The gate is
composed of a pair of 50:50 beamsplitters and ancillary photons in the
two-photon Fock state. By seeding one of the photons in an $n$-photon W state
into this gate, we obtain an $(n+2)$-photon W state after post-selection. This
gate gives a better efficiency and a simpler implementation than previous
proposals for $\rm W$-state preparation.
