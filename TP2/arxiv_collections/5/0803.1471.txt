We consider two types of fluctuations in the mass-action equilibrium in
protein binding networks. The first type is driven by relatively slow changes
in total concentrations (copy numbers) of interacting proteins. The second
type, to which we refer to as spontaneous, is caused by quickly decaying
thermodynamic deviations away from the equilibrium of the system. As such they
are amenable to methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics used in our study.
We investigate the effects of network connectivity on these fluctuations and
compare them to their upper and lower bounds. The collective effects are shown
to sometimes lead to large power-law distributed amplification of spontaneous
fluctuations as compared to the expectation for isolated dimers. As a
consequence of this, the strength of both types of fluctuations is positively
correlated with the overall network connectivity of proteins forming the
complex. On the other hand, the relative amplitude of fluctuations is
negatively correlated with the abundance of the complex. Our general findings
are illustrated using a real network of protein-protein interactions in baker's
yeast with experimentally determined protein concentrations.
