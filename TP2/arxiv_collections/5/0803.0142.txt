In previous articles [J. Chem. Phys. 121 4501 (2004), J. Chem. Phys. 124
034115 (2006), J. Chem. Phys. 124 034116 (2006)] a bipolar counter-propagating
wave decomposition, Psi = Psi+ + Psi-, was presented for stationary states Psi
of the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation, such that the components Psi+-
approach their semiclassical WKB analogs in the large action limit. The
corresponding bipolar quantum trajectories are classical-like and well-behaved,
even when Psi has many nodes, or is wildly oscillatory. In this paper, the
method is generalized for multisurface scattering applications, and applied to
several benchmark problems. A natural connection is established between
intersurface transitions and (+/-) transitions.
