We study finiteness conditions on large tilting modules over arbitrary rings.
We then turn to a hereditary artin algebra R and apply our results to the
(infinite dimensional) tilting module L that generates all modules without
preprojective direct summands. We show that the behaviour of L over its
endomorphism ring determines the representation type of R. A similar result
holds true for the (infinite dimensional) tilting module W that generates the
divisible modules. Finally, we extend to the wild case some results on Baer
modules and torsion-free modules proven in [AHT] for tame hereditary algebras.
