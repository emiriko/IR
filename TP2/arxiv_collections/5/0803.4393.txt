We investigate initially the influence of thermomechanical and momentum
exchange noise on the limit to mass sensitivity of nanoresonators with random
rough surfaces, which are characterized by the roughness amplitude, the
correlation length, and the roughness exponent H. In fact, the limit to mass
sensitivity increases with increasing roughness (decreasing H and/or increasing
ratio roughness amplitude/correlation length) if the quality factor associated
with thermomechanical noise is larger than that due to momentum exchange noise.
Finally, the influence of adsorption-desorption noise, which is also influenced
by the surface morphology, is shown to play minimal role in presence of the
other two noise sources.
