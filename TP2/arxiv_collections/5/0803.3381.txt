Predictions and measurements of a multimode waveguide interferometer
operating in a fibre coupled, ``dual-mode'' regime are reported. With a 1.32
micrometer source, a complete switching cycle of the output beam is produced by
a 10.0 nanometer incremental change in the 8.0 micrometer width of the hollow
planar mirror waveguide. This equates to a fringe spacing of $\sim\lambda
/130$. This is an order of magnitude smaller than previously reported results
for this form of interferometer.
