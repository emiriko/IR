We present results on the charge dependence of the radiative recombination
lifetime, Tau, and the emission energy of excitons confined to single
self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots. There are significant dot-to-dot
fluctuations in the lifetimes for a particular emission energy. To reach
general conclusions, we present the statistical behavior by analyzing data
recorded on a large number of individual quantum dots. Exciton charge is
controlled with extremely high fidelity through an n-type field effect
structure, providing access to the neutral exciton (X0), the biexciton (2X0)
and the positively (X1+) and negatively (X1-) charged excitons. We find
significant differences in the recombination lifetime of each exciton such
that, on average, Tau(X1-) / Tau(X0) = 1.25, Tau(X1+) / Tau(X0) = 1.58 and
Tau(2X0) / Tau(X0) = 0.65. We attribute the change in lifetime to significant
changes in the single particle hole wave function on charging the dot, an
effect more pronounced on charging X0 with a single hole than with a single
electron. We verify this interpretation by recasting the experimental data on
exciton energies in terms of Coulomb energies. We show directly that the
electron-hole Coulomb energy is charge dependent, reducing in value by 5-10% in
the presence of an additional electron, and that the electron-electron and
hole-hole Coulomb energies are almost equal.
