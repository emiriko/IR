In this study the dynamic behaviour of perforated microplates oscillating
under the effect of squeeze film damping is analyzed. A numerical approach is
adopted to predict the effects of damping and stiffness transferred from the
surrounding ambient air to oscillating structures ; the effect of hole's cross
section and plate's extension is observed. Results obtained by F.E.M. models
are compared with experimental measurements performed by an optical
interferometric microscope.
