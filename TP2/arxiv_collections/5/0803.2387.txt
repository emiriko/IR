We propose a scheme for the generation of two-mode entangled states between
two spatially separated cavities. It utilizes a two-level atom sequentially
coupling to two high-Q cavities with a strong classical driving field. It is
shown that by suitably choosing the intensities and detunings of the fields and
coherent control of the dynamics, several different entangled states such as
entangled coherent states and Bell states can be produced between the modes of
the two cavities.
