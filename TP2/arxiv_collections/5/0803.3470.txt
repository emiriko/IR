Using confocal Raman and fluorescence spectroscopic imaging in 3-dimensions,
we show direct evidence for Nd3+-Nd3+ interactions across grain boundaries
(GBs) in Nd3+:YAG laser ceramics. It is clearly shown that Nd3+ segregation
takes place at GBs leading to self-fluorescence quenching which affects a
volume fraction as high as 20%. In addition, we show a clear trend of
increasing spatial inhomogeneities in Nd3+ concentration when the doping levels
exceeds 3 at%, which is not detected by standard spectrometry techniques. These
results could point the way to further improvements in what is already an
impressive class of ceramic laser materials.
