We study ground-state properties of interacting two-component boson gases in
a one-dimensional harmonic trap by using the exact numerical diagonalization
method. Based on numerical solutions of many-body Hamiltonians, we calculate
the ground-state density distributions in the whole interaction regime for
different atomic number ratio, intra- and inter-atomic interactions. For the
case with equal intra- and inter-atomic interactions, our results clearly
display the evolution of density distributions from a Bose condensate
distribution to a Fermi-like distribution with the increase of the repulsive
interaction. Particularly, we compare our result in the strong interaction
regime to the exact result in the infinitely repulsive limit which can be
obtained by a generalized Bose-Fermi mapping. We also discuss the general case
with different intra- and inter-atomic interactions and show the rich
configurations of the density profiles.
