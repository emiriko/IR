A brief review of experimental research of the influence of acceleration and
temperatures of test mass upon gravitation force, executed between the 1990s
and the beginning of 2000 is provided.Results of weighing a rotor of a
mechanical gyroscope with a horizontal axis, an anisotropic crystal with the
big difference of the speed of longitudinal acoustic waves, measurements of
temperature dependence of weight of metal bars of non-magnetic materials, and
also measurement of restitution coefficients at quasi-elastic impact of a steel
ball about a massive plate are given. A negative temperature dependence of the
weight of a brass core was measured. All observably experimental effects, have
probably a general physical reason connected with the weight change dependent
upon acceleration of a body or at thermal movement of its microparticles.
