It is claimed in another paper that the collapse of a quantum mechanical wave
function is more than invariant, it is trans-representational. It must occur
along a fully invariant surface. The obvious surface available for this purpose
is that of the backward time cone of the collapse event as proposed by Hellwig
and Kraus. This collapse is widely believed to result in paradoxical causal
loops that cannot be removed by special relativistic or standard quantum
mechanical considerations alone. However, the paradox is resolved when we apply
the qRule foundation theory that is developed in the other paper. The causal
and temporal orders of state reduction are then found to be in agreement with
one another, and the resulting boundaries in Minkowski space are shown to have
a novel architecture that limits the range of a Hellwig-Kraus reduction in
space and time. Although these boundaries have been worked out using the
qRules, they should be the same for any foundation theory that treats the
collapse of a wave in an invariant way, and requires that a collapse destroys
the possibility of any further influence on itself, as do the qRules.
