The crystal structure and numerous normal and superconducting state
properties of layered tetragonal (P4/nmm) LaFeAsO, with F-doping of 11 %, are
reported. Resistivity measurements give an onset transition temperature Tc =
28.2 K, and low field magnetic susceptibility data indicate bulk
superconductivity. In applied magnetic field, analysis of the resistive
transition results in a critical field Hc2 = 30 T and a coherence length 35 A.
An upper limit for the electron carrier concentration of 1 x 10^21 cm-3 is
inferred from Hall data just above Tc. Strong electron-electron correlations
are suggested from temperature-dependent resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and
thermal conductivity data. Anomalies near Tc are observed in both Seebeck
coefficient and thermal conductivity data.
