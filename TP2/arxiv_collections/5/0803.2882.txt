We compute the physical properties of non-Abelian Fractional Quantum Hall
(FQH) states described by Jack polynomials at general filling
$\nu=\frac{k}{r}$. For $r=2$, these states are identical to the $Z_k$
Read-Rezayi parafermions, whereas for $r>2$ they represent new FQH states. The
$r=k+1$ states, multiplied by a Vandermonde determinant, are a non-Abelian
alternative construction of states at fermionic filling $2/5, 3/7, 4/9...$. We
obtain the thermal Hall coefficient, the quantum dimensions, the electron
scaling exponent, and show that the non-Abelian quasihole has a well-defined
propagator falling off with the distance. The clustering properties of the Jack
polynomials, provide a strong indication that the states with $r>2$ can be
obtained as correlators of fields of \emph{non-unitary} conformal field
theories, but the CFT-FQH connection fails when invoked to compute physical
properties such as thermal Hall coefficient or, more importantly, the quasihole
propagator. The quasihole wavefuntion, when written as a coherent state
representation of Jack polynomials, has an identical structure for \emph{all}
non-Abelian states at filling $\nu=\frac{k}{r}$.
