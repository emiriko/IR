We analyze cellular dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) and the dynamical
cluster approximation (DCA). We derive exact sum-rules for the hybridization
functions and give examples for DMFT, CDMFT, and DCA. For impurity solvers
based on a Hamiltonian, these sum-rules can be used to monitor convergence of
the bath-parametrization. We further discuss how the symmetry of the cluster
naturally leads to a decomposition of the bath Green matrix into irreducible
components, which can be parametrized independently, and give an explicit
recipe for finding the optimal bath-parametrization. As a benchmark we revisit
the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We carefully analyze the evolution of the
density as a function of chemical potential and find that, close to the Mott
transition, convergence with cluster size is unexpectedly slow. In two
dimensions we find, that we need so many bath-sites to obtain a reliable
parametrization that Lanczos calculations are hardly feasible with current
computers. For such large baths our symmetry-adapted approach should prove
crucial for finding a reliable bath-parametrization.
