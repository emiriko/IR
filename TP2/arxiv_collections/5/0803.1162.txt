The interpretation of recent Jlab experimental data on the exclusive process
A(e,e'p)B off few-nucleon systems are analyzed in terms of realistic nuclear
wave functions and Glauber multiple scattering theory, both in its original
form and within a generalized eikonal approximation. The relevance of the
exclusive process 4He(e,e'p)^3H for possible investigations of QCD effects is
illustrated.
