Generalized Parton Distributions of the pion are evaluated in chiral quark
models with the help of double distributions. As a result the polynomiality
conditions are automatically satisfied. In addition, positivity constraints,
proper normalization and support, sum rules, and soft pion theorems are
fulfilled. We obtain explicit expressions holding at the low-energy quark-model
scale, which exhibit no factorization in the t-dependence. The crucial QCD
evolution of the quark-model distributions is carried out up to experimental or
lattice scales. The obtained results for the Parton Distribution Function and
the Parton Distribution Amplitude describe the available experimental and
lattice data, confirming that the quark-model scale is low, around 320 MeV.
