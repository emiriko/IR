Using the shift-operator technique, a compact formula for the Fourier
transform of a product of two Slater-type orbitals located on different atomic
centers is derived. The result is valid for arbitrary quantum numbers and was
found to be numerically stable for a wide range of geometrical parameters and
momenta. Details of the implementation are presented together with benchmark
data for representative integrals. We also discuss the assets and drawbacks of
alternative algorithms available and analyze the numerical efficiency of the
new scheme.
