Experimental techniques of testing the mechanical properties of unsaturated
soils are complex and difficult to conduct. As a consequence, complete sets of
parameters that characterise the behaviour of unsaturated soils remain scarce
and necessary. In this context, it has been found useful to gather the
information obtained after some years of practice of the osmotic technique of
controlling suction. As compared to the more documented axis-translation
technique, the osmotic technique has its own advantages and drawbacks that are
discussed in this paper, together with some potential future developments. The
osmotic method has been developed by soil scientists in the 1960s and adapted
to geotechnical testing in the early 1970s. This paper presents the osmotic
technique and comments on its advantages (including suction condition close to
reality and higher suctions easily attained) and drawbacks (including some
concern with the membrane resistance and some membrane effects in the
suction/concentration calibration). Various applications to geotechnical
testing are presented such as the determination of the water retention curve,
oedometer and triaxial testing procedures and the determination of the
permeability of unsaturated soils. Recent developments, that include the
extension of the method up to high suctions (10 MPa) are also described,
together with some recent and novel applications such as data from high
controlled suction oedometer compression test and the determination of the
oil/water retention properties of oil reservoir chalks.
