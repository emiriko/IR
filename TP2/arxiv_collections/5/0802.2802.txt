The value of the $N^*(1535)N\rho$ coupling constant $g_{N^*N\rho}$ derived
from the $N^*(1535) \to N\rho \to N \pi \pi$ decay is compared with that
deduced from the radiative decay $N^*(1535) \to N \gamma$ using the
vector-meson-dominance model. On the basis of an effective Lagrangian approach,
we show that the value of $g_{N^*N\rho}$ extracted from the available
experimental data on the two decays are consistent, though the error bars are
rather large.
