This paper is an addendum to [4], in which the authors constructed a simply
connected minimal complex surface of general type with p_g=0 and K^2=3. In this
paper we construct a new non-simply connected minimal surface of general type
with p_g=0, K^2=3 and H_1=Z/2Z using a rational blow-down surgery and
Q-Gorenstein smoothing theory.
