We study the quantum phase transitions in a two component bose-mixture in a
one-dimensional optical lattice. The calculations have been performed in the
framework of the extended Bose-Hubbard model using the finite size density
matrix renormalization group method. We obtain different phase transitions for
the system for integer filling. When the inter-species on-site and the nearest
neighbor interactions are larger than the intra-species on-site and also the
nearest neighbor interactions, the system exhibits a phase separated charge
density wave (PSCDW) order that is characterized by the two species being
spatially separated and existing in the density wave phases.
