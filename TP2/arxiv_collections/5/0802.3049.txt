The paper discusses the importance and the issues of interfacing capacitive
sensors. Two architectures applicable for interfacing capacitive sensors are
presented. The first solution was designed to interface a capacitive humidity
sensor designed and built for a humidity-dependent monolithic capacitor
developed at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The second case
presents the possible read-out solutions for a SOI-MEMS accelerometer. Both of
the architectures were built and tested in a discrete implementation to qualify
the methods before the integrated realization. The paper presents a detailed
comparison of the two methods
