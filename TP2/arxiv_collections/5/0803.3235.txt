The single-molecule magnet $\mathrm{[Ni(hmp)(MeOH)Cl]_4}$ is studied using
both density functional theory (DFT) and the DFT+U method, and the results are
compared. By incorporating a Hubbard-U like term for both the nickel and oxygen
atoms, the experimentally determined ground state is successfully obtained, and
the exchange coupling constants derived from the DFT+U calculation agree with
experiment very well. The results show that the nickel 3d and oxygen 2p
electrons in this molecule are strongly correlated, and thus the inclusion of
on-site Coulomb energies is crucial to obtaining the correct results.
