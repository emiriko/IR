We report on recent research on the properties of elementary particle matter
governed by the strong force at high temperatures, where QCD predicts hadrons
to dissolve into the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). After a short introduction to
the basic elements of QCD in the vacuum, most notably quark confinement and
mass generation, we discuss how these phenomena relate to phase changes in
strongly interacting matter at high temperature. We briefly review the main
experimental findings at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) which
provide strong evidence that a QGP has been produced, with unprecedentedly
small viscosity and large opacity. We discuss how heavy quarks (charm and
bottom) can be utilized to quantitatively probe the transport properties of a
strongly coupled QGP (sQGP). The large heavy-quark (HQ) mass allows to set up a
Brownian motion approach, which can serve to evaluate different approaches for
HQ interactions in the sQGP. The implementation of lattice QCD based HQ
potentials generates pre-hadronic resonance structures in HQ scattering in the
medium, leading to large interaction rates and small diffusion coefficients.
The resonance correlations are strongest close to the critical temperature
(T_c), suggesting an intimate connection to the hadronization of the QGP. The
implementation of HQ transport into Langevin simulations of an expanding QGP
fireball at RHIC enables quantitative comparisons with experiment. The
extracted HQ diffusion coefficients are employed for schematic estimates of the
shear viscosity, corroborating the notion of a strongly-coupled QGP in the
vicinity of T_c.
