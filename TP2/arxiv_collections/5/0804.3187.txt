We propose an efficient method to generate cluster states in spatially
separated double quantum dots with a superconducting transmission line
resonator (TLR). When the detuning between the double-dot qubits transition
frequency and the frequency of the full wave mode in the TLR satisfies some
conditions, an Ising-like operator between arbitrary two separated qubits can
be achieved. Even including the main noise sources, it's shown that the high
fidelity cluster states could be generated in this solid system in just one
step.
