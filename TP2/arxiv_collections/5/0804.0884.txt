Bell's theorem contains the proposition that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
(EPR) theory (hypothesis) of the existence of elements of reality together with
Einstein locality permits a mathematical description of EPR experiments by
functions that are all defined on one common probability space. This
proposition leads in turn to restrictions for possible experimental outcomes
that Bell expressed in terms of his well known inequalities and that Vorob'ev
and others had investigated before Bell. Summarizing several previous
publications and adding new material, the above proposition is refuted by
Einstein-local counterexamples from classical physics and shown to involve
additional assumptions that can not be justified for mutually exclusive
(incompatible) measurements and experiments. Moreover, criticism of our work by
Mermin who invoked "standard sampling arguments" is shown to be false.
