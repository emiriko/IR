We report development of generators for periodic, satellite-free fluxes of
mono-disperse drops with diameters down to 10 mikrometers from cryogenic
liquids like H_2, N_2, Ar and Xe (and, as reference fluid, water). While the
breakup of water jets can well be described by Rayleigh's linear theory, we
find jet regimes for H_2 and N_2 which reveal deviations from this behavior.
Thus, Rayleigh's theory is inappropriate for thin jets that exchange energy
and/or mass with the surrounding medium. Moreover, at high evaporation rates,
axial symmetry of the dynamics is lost. When the drops pass into vacuum, frozen
pellets form due to surface evaporation. The narrow width of the pellet flux
paves the way towards various industrial and scientific applications.
