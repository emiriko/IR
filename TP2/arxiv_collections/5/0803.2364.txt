We prove that the functions t -> (t^q-1)(t^p-1)^{-1} are operator monotone in
the positive half-axis for 0 < p < q < 1, and we calculate the two associated
canonical representation formulae. The result is used to find new monotone
metrics (quantum Fisher information) on the state space of quantum systems.
