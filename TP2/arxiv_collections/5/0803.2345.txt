This lecture will introduce the Support Vector algorithms for classification
and regression. They are an application of the so called kernel trick, which
allows the extension of a certain class of linear algorithms to the non linear
case. The kernel trick will be introduced and in the context of structural risk
minimization, large margin algorithms for classification and regression will be
presented. Current applications in high energy physics will be discussed.
