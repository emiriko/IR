Scanning tunneling spectra on single C60 molecules that are sufficiently
decoupled from the substrate exhibit a characteristic fine structure, which is
explained as due to the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect. Using electron-phonon
couplings extracted from density functional theory we calculate the tunneling
spectrum through the C60- anionic state and find excellent agreement with
measured data.
