The magnetic properties of the $Fe_{1-x}Ru_x$ alloy system for 0 $\leq$ x
$\leq$ 0.10 are studied by using a mean-field approximation based on the
Bogoliubov inequality. Ferromagnetic Fe-Fe spin correlations and
antiferromagnetic Fe-Ru and Ru-Ru exchanges have been considered to describe
the temperature dependence of the Curie temperature and low temperature
magnetization. A composition dependence has been imposed in the exchange
couplings, as indicated by experiments. From a least-square fitting procedure
to the experimental results an estimation of the interaction parameters was
obtained, which yielded the low temperature dependence of the magnetization and
of the ferromagnetic Curie temperature. A good agreement was obtained with
available experimental results.
