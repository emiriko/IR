Domain dynamics in the Piezoresponse Force Spectroscopy (PFS) experiment is
studied using the combination of local hysteresis loop acquisition with
simultaneous domain imaging. The analytical theory for PFS signal from domain
of arbitrary cross-section is developed and used for the analysis of
experimental data on Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 polycrystalline films. The results suggest
formation of oblate domain at early stage of the domain nucleation and growth,
consistent with efficient screening of depolarization field within the
material. The fine structure of the hysteresis loop is shown to be related to
the observed jumps in the domain geometry during domain wall propagation
(nanoscale Barkhausen jumps), indicative of strong domain-defect interactions.
