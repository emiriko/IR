A hybrid scheme obtained by combining 3DVar with the Assimilation in the
Unstable Subspace (3DVar-AUS) is tested in a QG model, under perfect model
conditions, with a fixed observational network, with and without observational
noise. The AUS scheme, originally formulated to assimilate adaptive
observations, is used here to assimilate the fixed observations that are found
in the region of local maxima of BDAS vectors (Bred vectors subject to
assimilation), while the remaining observations are assimilated by 3DVar.
  The performance of the hybrid scheme is compared with that of 3DVar and of an
EnKF. The improvement gained by 3DVar-AUS and the EnKF with respect to 3DVar
alone is similar in the present model and observational configuration, while
3DVar-AUS outperforms the EnKF during the forecast stage. The 3DVar-AUS
algorithm is easy to implement and the results obtained in the idealized
conditions of this study encourage further investigation toward an
implementation in more realistic contexts.
