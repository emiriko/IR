An optimal control approach based on multiple parameter genetic algorithms is
applied to the design of plasmonic nanoconstructs with pre-determined optical
properties and functionalities. We first develop nanoscale metallic lenses that
focus an incident plane wave onto a pre-specified, spatially confined spot. Our
results illustrate the role of symmetry breaking and unravel the principles
that favor dimeric constructs for optimal light localization. Next we design a
periodic array of silver particles to modify the polarization of an incident,
linearly-polarized plane wave in a desired fashion while localizing the light
in space. The results provide insight into the structural features that
determine the birefringence properties of metal nanoparticles and their arrays.
Of the variety of potential applications that may be envisioned, we note the
design of nanoscale light sources with controllable coherence and polarization
properties that could serve for coherent control of molecular or electronic
dynamics in the nanoscale.
