This paper describes a simple method for fabricating a variable-focus lens by
using PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) and filling with liquid for the
variable-focus lens. The lens diameter of 2-mm was designed in this experiment
and expected to reach the focal length in the range of 3 ~ 12 mm. The
theoretical value between the liquid volume and the lens contact angle at
different focal lengths were simulated and measured. The pumped-in volumes
ranged from 200 to 1400 $\mu$l, the contact angles ranged from 14.25 degrees to
49.02 degrees. Changing the deformation of PDMS film using different
micro-fluidic volume produces the variable focal length from 4 10 mm in this
experiment. The proposed method successfully fabricated a variable-focus lens.
Bonding PDMS only once using no expensive instrument such as oxygen plasma was
accomplished. The final objective is to insert the variable focus lens into
portable optical imagery products.
