In theories with large extra dimension and with low quantum gravity scale
near a TeV, it is expected that TeV-scale black holes to be produced in
proton-proton collisions at the LHC with the center of mass energy of 14 TeV.
Since the black holes temperature can be around 1 TeV, top quark production is
expected from them via Hawking radiation. Within the Standard Model of particle
physics top quarks are produced via strong interaction in $t\bar{t}$ pairs or
via electroweak interaction singly. Therefore, black holes can be the new
source of top quark production. In this article we present the total cross
sections and transverse momentum distributions of top quark production from
black holes at the LHC. We find that the top quarks from black holes tend to
reside at very high transverse momentum region so it can be a very useful
signature for the black holes at the LHC.
