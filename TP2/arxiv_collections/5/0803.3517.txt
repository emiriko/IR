The measurement of B->tau nu at the B factories provides important
constraints on the parameter tan beta/m_H^+- in the context of models with two
Higgs doublets. Limits on this decay from e+e- collisions at the Z peak were
sensitive to the sum of B->tau nu and B_c->tau nu. Due to the possibly sizeable
contribution from B_c->tau nu we suggest that a signal for this combination
might be observed if the LEP L3 Collaboration used their total data of ~3.6
10^6 hadronic decays of the Z boson. Moreover, we point out that a future
Linear Collider operating at the Z peak (Giga Z option) could constrain tan
beta/m_H^+- from the sum of these processes with a precision comparable to that
anticipated at proposed high luminosity B factories from B-> tau nu alone.
