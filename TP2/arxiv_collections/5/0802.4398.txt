A three- and five-component nonlinear Schrodinger-type models, which describe
spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC's) with hyperfine structures F=1 and F=2
respectively, are studied. These models for particular values of the coupling
constants are integrable by the inverse scattering method. They are related to
symmetric spaces of BD.I-type SO(2r+1)/(SO(2) x SO(2r-1)) for r=2 and r=3.
Using conveniently modified Zakharov-Shabat dressing procedure we obtain
different types of soliton solutions.
