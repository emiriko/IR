Self-propelled particles move along circles rather than along a straight line
when their driving force does not coincide with their propagation direction.
Examples include confined bacteria and spermatozoa, catalytically driven
nanorods, active, anisotropic colloidal particles and vibrated granulates.
Using a non-Hamiltonian rate theory and computer simulations, we study the
motion of a Brownian "circle swimmer" in a confining channel. A sliding mode
close to the wall leads to a huge acceleration as compared to the bulk motion,
which can further be enhanced by an optimal effective torque-to-force ratio.
