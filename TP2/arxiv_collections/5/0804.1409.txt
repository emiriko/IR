Web usage mining is a type of web mining, which exploits data mining
techniques to discover valuable information from navigation behavior of World
Wide Web users. As in classical data mining, data preparation and pattern
discovery are the main issues in web usage mining. The first phase of web usage
mining is the data processing phase, which includes the session reconstruction
operation from server logs. Session reconstruction success directly affects the
quality of the frequent patterns discovered in the next phase. In reactive web
usage mining techniques, the source data is web server logs and the topology of
the web pages served by the web server domain. Other kinds of information
collected during the interactive browsing of web site by user, such as cookies
or web logs containing similar information, are not used. The next phase of web
usage mining is discovering frequent user navigation patterns. In this phase,
pattern discovery methods are applied on the reconstructed sessions obtained in
the first phase in order to discover frequent user patterns. In this paper, we
propose a frequent web usage pattern discovery method that can be applied after
session reconstruction phase. In order to compare accuracy performance of
session reconstruction phase and pattern discovery phase, we have used an agent
simulator, which models behavior of web users and generates web user navigation
as well as the log data kept by the web server.
