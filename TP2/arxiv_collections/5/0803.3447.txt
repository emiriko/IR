We investigate the meaning of gravity-induced decoherence in quantum theory,
known as `intrinsic' or `fundamental' decoherence in the literature. We explore
a range of issues relevant to this problem, including the meaning of modified
uncertainty relations, the interpretations of the Planck scale, the distinction
between quantum and stochastic fluctuations and the role of the time variable
in quantum mechanics. We examine the specific physical assumptions that enter
into different approaches to the subject. In particular, we critique two
representative approaches that identify time fluctuations as the origin of
intrinsic or fundamental decoherence: one that models the fluctuations by
stochastic process and one that purports to derive decoherence from the quantum
fluctuations of real clocks.
