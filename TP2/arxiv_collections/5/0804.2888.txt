The interplay between disorder and interactions is a "leit-motiv" of
condensed matter physics, since it constitutes the driving mechanism of the
metal-insulator transition. Bose-Einstein condensates in optical potentials are
proving to be powerful tools to quantum simulate disordered systems. We will
review the main experimental and theoretical results achieved in the last few
years in this rapidly developing field.
