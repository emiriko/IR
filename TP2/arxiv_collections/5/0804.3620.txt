We study generalized concurrences as a tool to detect the entanglement of
bipartite quantum systems. By considering the case of 2 X 4 states of rank 2,
we prove that generalized concurrences do not, in general, give a necessary and
sufficient condition of separability. We identify a set of entangled states
which are undetected by this method.
