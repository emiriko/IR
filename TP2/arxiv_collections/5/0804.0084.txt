The equation of motion of an extended object in spacetime reduces to an
ordinary differential equation in the presence of symmetry. By properly
defining of the symmetry with notion of cohomogeneity, we discuss the method
for classifying all these extended objects. We carry out the classification for
the strings in the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space by the effective use
of the local isomorphism between $\SO(4,2)$ and $\SU(2,2)$. We present a
general method for solving the trajectory of the Nambu-Goto string and apply to
a case obtained by the classification, thereby find a new solution which has
properties unique to odd-dimensional anti-de Sitter spaces. The geometry of the
solution is analized and found to be a timelike helicoid-like surface.
