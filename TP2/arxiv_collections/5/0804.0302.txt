Using the theory of stochastic integration for processes with values in a UMD
Banach space developed recently by the authors, an Ito formula is proved which
is applied to prove the existence of strong solutions for a class of stochastic
evolution equations in UMD Banach spaces. The abstract results are applied to
prove regularity in space and time of the solutions of the Zakai equation.
