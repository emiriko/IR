This paper presents a measurement of the ratio of photon to electron
production and the scintillation spectrum in a popular gas for time pro jection
chambers, carbon tetrafluoride (CF4), over the range of 200 to 800 nm; the
ratio is measured to be 0.34+/-0.04. This result is of particular importance
for a new generation of dark matter time projection chambers with directional
sensitivity which use CF4 as a fill gas.
