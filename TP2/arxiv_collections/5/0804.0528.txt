This paper describes application of rough set theory, on the analysis of
hydrocyclone operation. In this manner, using Self Organizing Map (SOM) as
preprocessing step, best crisp granules of data are obtained. Then, using a
combining of SOM and rough set theory (RST)-called SORST-, the dominant rules
on the information table, obtained from laboratory tests, are extracted. Based
on these rules, an approximate estimation on decision attribute is fulfilled.
Finally, a brief comparison of this method with the SOM-NFIS system (briefly
SONFIS) is highlighted.
