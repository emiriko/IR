Stochastic models, based on random processes, may lead to power law
distributions, which provide long range correlations. The observation of power
law behavior and the presence of long range correlations in biological systems
has been demonstrated in various studies. The combination of the two just
mentioned results, theoretical and experimental, supports strongly the scenario
of biological evolution across different organisms. In the current Letter we
explore in a general way, using the algebra of Nonextensive Statistics
introduced by Tsallis and coworkers, if the processes which are described by a
class of stochastic models are really random and discuss the results with
regard to a possible biological evolution.
