New recent experimental $\alpha$ decay half-lives have been compared with the
results obtained from previously proposed formulas depending only on the mass
and charge numbers of the $\alpha$ emitter and the Q$\alpha$ value. For the
heaviest nuclei they are also compared with calculations using the
Density-Dependent M3Y (DDM3Y) effective interaction and the
Viola-Seaborg-Sobiczewski (VSS) formulas. The correct agreement allows us to
make predictions for the $\alpha$ decay half-lives of other still unknown
superheavy nuclei from these analytic formulas using the extrapolated Q$\alpha$
of G. Audi, A. H. Wapstra, and C. Thibault [Nucl. Phys. A729, 337 (2003)].
