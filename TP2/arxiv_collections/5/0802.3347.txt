Reaction-diffusion processes can be adopted to model a large number of
dynamics on complex networks, such as transport processes or epidemic
outbreaks. In most cases, however, they have been studied from a fermionic
perspective, in which each vertex can be occupied by at most one particle.
While still useful, this approach suffers from some drawbacks, the most
important probably being the difficulty to implement reactions involving more
than two particles simultaneously. Here we introduce a general framework for
the study of bosonic reaction-diffusion processes on complex networks, in which
there is no restriction on the number of interacting particles that a vertex
can host. We describe these processes theoretically by means of continuous time
heterogeneous mean-field theory and divide them into two main classes: steady
state and monotonously decaying processes. We analyze specific examples of both
behaviors within the class of one-species process, comparing the results
(whenever possible) with the corresponding fermionic counterparts. We find that
the time evolution and critical properties of the particle density are
independent of the fermionic or bosonic nature of the process, while
differences exist in the functional form of the density of occupied vertices in
a given degree class k. We implement a continuous time Monte Carlo algorithm,
well suited for general bosonic simulations, which allow us to confirm the
analytical predictions formulated within mean-field theory. Our results, both
at the theoretical and numerical level, can be easily generalized to tackle
more complex, multi-species, reaction-diffusion processes, and open a promising
path for a general study and classification of this kind of dynamical systems
on complex networks.
