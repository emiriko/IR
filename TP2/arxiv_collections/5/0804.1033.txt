Documents in scientific newspapers are often marked by attitudes and opinions
of the author and/or other persons, who contribute with objective and
subjective statements and arguments as well. In this respect, the attitude is
often accomplished by a linguistic modality. As in languages like english,
french and german, the modality is expressed by special verbs like can, must,
may, etc. and the subjunctive mood, an occurrence of modalities often induces
that these verbs take over the role of modality. This is not correct as it is
proven that modality is the instrument of the whole sentence where both the
adverbs, modal particles, punctuation marks, and the intonation of a sentence
contribute. Often, a combination of all these instruments are necessary to
express a modality. In this work, we concern with the finding of modal verbs in
scientific texts as a pre-step towards the discovery of the attitude of an
author. Whereas the input will be an arbitrary text, the output consists of
zones representing modalities.
