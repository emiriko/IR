We check a commonly used approximation in which a baryon with a heavy quark
is described as a heavy quark-light diquark system. The heavy quark influences
the diquark internal motion reducing the average distance between the two light
quarks. Besides, we show how the average distance between the heavy quark and
any of the light quarks, and that between the heavy quark and the center of
mass of the light diquark, are smaller than the distance between the two light
quarks, which seems to contradict the heavy quark-light diquark picture. This
latter result is in agreement with expectations from QCD sum rules and lattice
QCD calculations. Our results also show that the diquark approximations
produces larger masses than the ones obtained in a full calculation.
