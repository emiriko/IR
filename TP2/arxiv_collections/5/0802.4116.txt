Quantum Nanomechanics is the emerging field which pertains to the mechanical
behavior of nanoscale systems in the quantum domain. Unlike the conventional
studies of vibration of molecules and phonons in solids, quantum nanomechanics
is defined as the quantum behavior of the entire mechanical structure,
including all of its constituents--the atoms, the molecules, the ions, the
electrons as well as other excitations. The relevant degrees of freedom of the
system are described by macroscopic variables and quantum mechanics in these
variables is the essential aspect of quantum nanomechanics. In spite of its
obvious importance, however, quantum nanomechanics still awaits proper and
complete physical realization. In this article, I provide a conceptual
framework for defining quantum nanomechanical systems and their characteristic
behaviors, and chart out possible avenues for the experimental realization of
bona fide quantum nanomechanical systems.
