We perform Monte Carlo simulations of Ising spin-glass models in three and
four dimensions, as well as of Migdal-Kadanoff spin glasses on a hierarchical
lattice. Our results show strong evidence for universal scaling in the
spin-glass phase in all three models. Not only does this allow for a clean way
to compare results obtained from different coupling distributions, it also
suggests that a so far elusive renormalization group approach within the
spin-glass phase may actually be feasible.
