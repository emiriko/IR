An architecture to enable some blocks consisting of several nodes in a public
cluster connected to different grid collaborations is introduced. It is
realized by inserting a web-service in addition to the standard Globus Toolkit.
The new web-service performs two main tasks : authenticate the digital
certificate contained in an incoming requests and forward it to the designated
block. The appropriate block is mapped with the username of the block's owner
contained in the digital certificate. It is argued that this algorithm opens an
opportunity for any blocks in a public cluster to join various global grids.
