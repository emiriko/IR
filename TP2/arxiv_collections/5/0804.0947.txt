Let D be a connected graph. The Dynkin complex CD(A) of a D-algebra A was
introduced by the second author in [TL2] to control the deformations of
quasi-Coxeter algebra structures on A. In the present paper, we study the
cohomology of this complex when A is the group algebra of a Coxeter group W and
D is the Dynkin diagram of W. We compute this cohomology when W is finite and
prove in particular the rigidity of quasi-Coxeter algebra structures on kW. For
an arbitrary W, we compute the top cohomology group and obtain a number of
additional partial results when W is affine. Our computations are carried out
by filtering CD(A) by the number of vertices of subgraphs of D. The
corresponding graded complex turns out to be dual to the sum of the Coxeter
complexes of all standard, irreducible parabolic subgroups of W.
