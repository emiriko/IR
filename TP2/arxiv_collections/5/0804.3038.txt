The first measurement of pseudorapidity (Delta-eta) and azimuthal angle
(Delta-phi) correlations between high transverse momentum charged hadrons (p_T
> 2.5 GeV/c) and all associated particles is presented at both short- (small
Delta-eta) and long-range (large Delta-eta) over a continuous pseudorapidity
acceptance (-4<Delta-eta<2). In these proceedings, the various near- and
away-side features of the correlation structure are discussed as a function of
centrality in Au+Au collisions measured by PHOBOS at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV. In
particular, this measurement allows a much more complete determination of the
longitudinal extent of the ridge structure, first observed by the STAR
collaboration over a limited eta range. In central collisions the ridge
persists to at least Delta-eta=4, diminishing in magnitude as collisions become
more peripheral until it disappears around Npart=80.
