The investigation in the work of the reaction electron-positron to omega and
pi0 mesons in the 3P0 nonrelativistic quark model reveals that the reaction
electron-positron to omega and pi0 mesons process at the energy region from the
omega and pi mesons threshold to 2.0 GeV is dominated by the two-step process
in which the primary quark-antiquark pair first forms rho and rho' mesons and
then the vector mesons decay into omega and pi. With rho(1450) and rho(1700)
mainly in 2S and 1D states respectively, the experimental data for the cross
section of the reaction electron-positron to omega and pi0 mesons are well
produced in the 3P0 quark model. The work supports the argument that rho(1450)
is mainly a 2S meson and rho(1700) a 1D meson.
