The Pisano-Pleitez-Frampton 3-3-1 model is revisited here within the
framework of the general method for solving gauge models with high symmetries.
This exact algebraical approach - proposed several years ago by one of us - was
designed to include a minimal Higgs mechanism that spontaneously breaks the
gauge symmetry up to the universal $U(1)_{em}$ electromagnetic one and,
consequently, to supply the mass spectrum and the couplings of the currents for
all the particles in the model. We prove in this paper that this powerful tool,
when is applied to the PPF 3-3-1 model, naturally recovers the whole Standard
Model phenomenology and, in addition, predicts - since a proper parametrization
is employed - viable results such as: (i) the exact expressions for the boson
and fermion masses, (ii) the couplings of the charged and neutral currents and
(iii) a plausible neutrino mass pattern. A generalized Weinberg transformation
is implemented, while the mixing between the neutral bosons $Z$ and
$Z^{\prime}$ is performed as a necessary step by the method itself. Some
phenomenological consequences are also sketched, including the strange
possibility that simultaneously $m(Z)=m(Z^{\prime})$ and $m(W)=m(V)$ hold.
