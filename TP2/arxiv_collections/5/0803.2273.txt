Applying a modified version of the Gledzer-Ohkitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model,
the signatures of so-called two-dimensionalization effect of three-dimensional
incompressible, homogeneous, isotropic fully developed unforced turbulence have
been studied and reproduced. Within the framework of shell models we have
obtained the following results: (i) progressive steepening of the energy
spectrum with increased strength of the rotation, and, (ii) depletion in the
energy flux of the forward forward cascade, sometimes leading to an inverse
cascade. The presence of extended self-similarity and self-similar PDFs for
longitudinal velocity differences are also presented for the rotating 3D
turbulence case.
