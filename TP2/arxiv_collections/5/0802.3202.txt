Motivated by recent experiments in ultracold atomic gases that explore the
nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum many-body systems, we
investigate the opposite limit of Landau's Fermi liquid paradigm: We study a
Hubbard model with a sudden interaction quench, that is the interaction is
switched on at time t=0. Using the flow equation method, we are able to study
the real time dynamics for weak interaction U in a systematic expansion and
find three clearly separated time regimes: i) An initial buildup of
correlations where the quasiparticles are formed. ii) An intermediate
quasi-steady regime resembling a zero temperature Fermi liquid with a
nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution function. iii) The long time limit
described by a quantum Boltzmann equation leading to thermalization with a
temperature T proportional to U.
