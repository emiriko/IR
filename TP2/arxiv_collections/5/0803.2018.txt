We investigate the asymptotic behavior of spherically symmetric solutions to
scalar wave and Yang-Mills equations on a Schwarzschild background. The studies
demonstrate the astrophysical relevance of null infinity in predicting
radiation signals for gravitational wave detectors and show how test fields on
unbounded domains in black hole spacetimes can be simulated conveniently by
numerically solving hyperboloidal initial value problems.
