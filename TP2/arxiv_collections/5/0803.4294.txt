In the framework of various Glauber-like models we compute several
correlation observables in nuclear collisions at the SPS, RHIC, and LHC
energies. We analyze fluctuations of the eccentricity of the fireball created
in the collision, in particular the {variable-axes} harmonic moments
$\epsilon^\ast$, as well as the fluctuations of multiplicity of charged
particles. We find moderate model dependence of the scaled standard deviation
$\sigma(\epsilon^\ast)/\epsilon^\ast$ on the choice of the particular Glauber
model. For all considered models the values of
$\sigma(\epsilon^\ast)/\epsilon^\ast$ range from $\sim$~0.5 for central
collisions to $\sim$~0.3-0.4 for peripheral collisions. The results are
confronted to the recent measurement of the elliptic-flow fluctuations at RHIC.
We also find that the dependence of multiplicity fluctuations on the centrality
of the collision is too weak to explain the measurements at the SPS energies.
The magnitude of the Glauber multiplicity fluctuations increases by about 20%
from the RHIC to LHC energies.
