We study the properties of low-lying Dirac modes in quenched compact QED at
$\beta =1.01$, employing $12^3\times N_t$ ($N_t =4,6,8,10,12$) lattices and the
overlap formalism for the fermion action. We pay attention to the spatial
distributions of low-lying Dirac modes below and above the ``phase transition
temperature'' $T_c$. Near-zero modes are found to have universal
anti-correlations with monopole currents, and are found to lose their temporal
structures above $T_c$ exhibiting stronger spatial localization properties. We
also study the nearest-neighbor level spacing distribution of Dirac eigenvalues
and find a Wigner-Poisson transition.
