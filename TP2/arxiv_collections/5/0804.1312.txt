For a two-level quantum mechanical system, we derive microscopically the
exact expression for the fluctuation of microscopic work in a multi-step
non-equilibrium process, and we rigorously prove that in an isothermal process,
the fluctuation is vanishingly small, and the most probabilistic work just
equals to the difference of the free energy. Our study demonstrates that the
convergence of the microscopic work in the isothermal process is due to the
nature of isothermal process rather than usual thermodynamic limit condition.
Our investigation justifies the validity of "minimum work principle"
formulation of the second law even for a small system far from thermodynamic
limit.
