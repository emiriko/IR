We propose that a single mesoscopic ensemble of trapped polar molecules can
support a "holographic quantum computer" with hundreds of qubits encoded in
collective excitations with definite spatial phase variations. Each phase
pattern is uniquely addressed by optical Raman processes with classical optical
fields, while one- and two-qubit gates are accomplished by selectively
transferring the individual qubit states to a stripline microwave cavity field
and a Cooper pair box where controllable two-level unitary dynamics is governed
by classical microwave fields.
