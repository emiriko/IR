Reviewing the ideas developed in, the ground state life time of a finite size
atomic Bose Einstein condensate is studied for coherent, squeezed coherent and
thermal coherent ground states. Ground state evolution of coherent and squeezed
coherent states in a double well potential is studied. Effects of thin spectrum
on Bose-Einstein condensates is discussed and quasiparticle excitation
lifetimes are calculated. It is shown that the effect of the states we use on
the free energy vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Possible extension to a
double well potential and effect of a second broken symmetry is also discussed.
