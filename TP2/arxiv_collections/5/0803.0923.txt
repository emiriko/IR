The problem of the rigorous derivation of one-dimensional models for
nonlinearly elastic curved beams is studied in a variational setting.
Considering different scalings of the three-dimensional energy and passing to
the limit as the diameter of the beam goes to zero, a nonlinear model for
strings and a bending-torsion theory for rods are deduced.
