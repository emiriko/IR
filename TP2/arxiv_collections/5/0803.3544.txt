The study of a self-consistent system of interacting spinor and scalar fields
within the scope of a Bianchi type I (BI) gravitational field in presence of a
viscous fluid and $\Lambda$ term has been carried out. The system of equations
defining the evolution of the volume scale of BI universe, energy density and
corresponding Hubble constant has been derived. The system in question has been
thoroughly studied qualitatively. Corresponding solutions are graphically
illustrated. The system in question is also studied from the view point of blow
up. It has been shown that the blow up takes place only in presence of
viscosity.
