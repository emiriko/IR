We propose and demonstrate theoretically a method to achieve and design
optical nonlinear responses through a light-mediated spatial hybridization of
different standard nonlinearities. The mechanism is based on the fact that
optical propagation through a spatial composite of different nonlinear media is
governed by an effective nonlinear response if the spatial scale of the
sequence is much smaller than the light diffraction length. We apply our
general approach to the significant case of centrosymmetric photorefractive
crystal biased by a periodically modulated external voltage to predict strictly
bending-free miniaturized soliton propagation.
