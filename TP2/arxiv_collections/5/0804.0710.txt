In the present paper an influence of the anisotropic antisymmetric exchange
interaction, the Dzialoshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, on entanglement of two
qubits in various magnetic spin models, including the pure DM model and the
most general XYZ model are studied. We find that the time evolution generated
by DM interaction can implement the SWAP gate and discuss realistic
quasi-one-dimensional magnets where it can be realized. It is shown that
inclusion of the DM interaction to any Heisenberg model creates, when it does
not exist, or strengthens, when it exists, the entanglement. We give physical
explanation of these results by studying the ground state of the systems at
T=0. Nonanalytic dependence of the concurrence on the DM interaction and its
relation with quantum phase transition is indicated. Our results show that spin
models with the DM coupling have some potential applications in quantum
computations and the DM interaction could be an efficient control parameter of
entanglement.
