We experimentally demonstrate increased transmission of light through
strongly scattering materials. Wavefront shaping is used to selectively couple
light to the open transport channels in the material, resulting in an increase
of up to 44% in the total transmission. The results for each of several
hundreds of experimental runs are in excellent quantitative agreement with
random matrix theory. Extrapolating our measurements to the limit of perfect
wavefront shaping, we find a universal transmission of 2/3, regardless of the
thickness of the sample.
