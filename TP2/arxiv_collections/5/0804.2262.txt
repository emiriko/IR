The spacetime physics of bulk closed string tachyon condensation is studied
at the level of a two-derivative effective action. We derive the unique
perturbative tachyon potential consistent with a full class of linearized
tachyonic deformations of supercritical string theory. The solutions of
interest deform a general linear dilaton background by the insertion of purely
exponential tachyon vertex operators. In spacetime, the evolution of the
tachyon drives an accelerated contraction of the universe and, absent
higher-order corrections, the theory collapses to a cosmological singularity in
finite time, at arbitrarily weak string coupling. When the tachyon exhibits a
null symmetry, the worldsheet dynamics are known to be exact and well-defined
at tree level. We prove that if the two-derivative effective action is free of
non-gravitational singularities, higher-order corrections always resolve the
spacetime curvature singularity of the null tachyon. The resulting theory
provides an explicit mechanism by which tachyon condensation can generate or
terminate the flow of cosmological time in string theory. Additional particular
solutions can resolve an initial singularity with a tachyonic phase at weak
coupling, or yield solitonic configurations that localize the universe along
spatial directions.
