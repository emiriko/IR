In a categorification of tensor products of fundamental representations of
quantum sl(k) via highest weight categories, the indecomposable tilting modules
descend to the canonical basis. Since projective functors map tilting modules
to tilting modules, the coefficients of the canonical basis of tensor products
of finite dimensional, irreducible representations under the action of the
Chevalley generators are positive.
