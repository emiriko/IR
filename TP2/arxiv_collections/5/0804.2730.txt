We study the properties of the ground state of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger
Equations with spatially inhomogeneous interactions and show that it
experiences a strong localization on the spatial region where the interactions
vanish. At the same time, tunneling to regions with positive values of the
interactions is strongly supressed by the nonlinear interactions and as the
number of particles is increased it saturates in the region of finite
interaction values. The chemical potential has a cutoff value in these systems
and thus takes values on a finite interval. The applicability of the phenomenon
to Bose-Einstein condensates is discussed in detail.
