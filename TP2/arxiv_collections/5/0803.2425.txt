We report on a Bell experiment with space-like separation assuming that the
measurement time is related to gravity-induced state reduction. Two energy-time
entangled photons are sent through optical fibers and directed into unbalanced
interferometers at two receiving stations separated by 18 km. At each station,
the detection of a photon triggers the displacement of a macroscopic mass. The
timing ensures space-like separation from the moment a photon enters its
interferometer until the mass has moved. 2-photon interference fringes with a
visibility of up to 90.5% are obtained, leading to a violation of Bell
inequality.
