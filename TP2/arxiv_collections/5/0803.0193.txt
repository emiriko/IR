Recent years have seen increased interest in complexified Bohmian mechanical
trajectory calculations for quantum systems, both as a pedagogical and
computational tool. In the latter context, it is essential that trajectories
satisfy probability conservation, to ensure they are always guided to where
they are most needed. In this paper, probability conservation for complexified
Bohmian trajectories is considered. The analysis relies on time-reversal
symmetry considerations, leading to a generalized expression for the
conjugation of wavefunctions of complexified variables. This in turn enables
meaningful discussion of complexified flux continuity, which turns out not to
be satisfied in general, though a related property is found to be true. The
main conclusion, though, is that even under a weak interpretation, probability
is not conserved along complex Bohmian trajectories.
