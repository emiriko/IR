Using $\epsilon$ expansion proposed in \cite{Nishida:2006br} we calculate
density correlation function of the degenerate Fermi gas at infinite scattering
length to next-to-leading order in $\epsilon$ for excitation energies below
quasi particle threshold. An expression for the low energy dynamic structure
function is derived.
