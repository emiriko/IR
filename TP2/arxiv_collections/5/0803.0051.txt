The ordering of the Ising model on a pyrochlore lattice interacting via the
long-range RKKY interaction, which models a metallic pyrochlore magnet such as
Pr_2Ir_2O_7, is studied by Monte Carlo simulations. Depending on the parameter
k_F representing the Fermi wavevector, the model exhibits rich ordering
behaviors.
