In this brief note we show that the horizon entropy of the largest known
class of non-supersymmetric extremal black rings, with up to six parameters, is
exactly reproduced for all values of the ring radius using the same conformal
field theory of the four-charge four-dimensional black hole. A particularly
simple case is a dipole black ring without any conserved charges. The mass gets
renormalized, but the first corrections it receives can be easily understood as
an interaction potential energy. Finally, we stress that even if the entropy is
correctly reproduced, this only implies that one sector of chiral excitations
has been identified, but an understanding of excitations in the other sector is
still required in order to capture the black ring dynamics.
