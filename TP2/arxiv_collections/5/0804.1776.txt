When gas atoms or molecules collide with clean and ordered surfaces, under
many circumstances the energy-resolved scattering spectra exhibit two clearly
distinct features due to direct scattering and to trapping in the physisorption
well with subsequent desorption. James Clerk Maxwell is credited with being the
first to describe this situation by invoking the simple assumption that when an
impinging gas beam is scattered from a surface it can be divided into a part
that exchanges no energy and specularly reflects and another part that
equilibrates or accommodates completely and then desorbs with an equilibrium
distribution. In this paper a scattering theory is developed, using an
iterative algorithm and classical mechanics for the collision process, that
describes both direct scattering and trapping-desorption of the incident beam.
The initially trapped fraction of particles can be followed as they continue to
make further interactions with the surface until they are all eventually
promoted back into the positive energy continuum and leave the surface region.
Consequently, this theory allows a rigorous test of the Maxwell assumption and
determines the conditions under which it is valid. The theory also gives
quantitative explanations of recent experimental measurements which exhibit
both a direct scattering contribution and a trapping-desorption fraction in the
energy-resolved spectra.
