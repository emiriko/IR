We propose a new detection method for ultrasound-modulated optical tomography
that allows us to perform parallel speckle detection with optimum shot-noise
sensitivity, using a CCD camera. Moreover, we show that making use of a spatial
filter system allows us to fully filter out speckle decorrelation noise. This
method is confirmed by a test experiment
