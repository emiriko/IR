In supersymmetric models with R parity violation, constraints on superpartner
masses are significantly weaker than in models which conserve R parity. We find
in regions of parameter space where a neutral gaugino or third generation
scalar is decoupled from the Z and/or traditional gaugino mass relationships do
not hold allow some particles to be light enough to allow them to be the decay
products of the Higgs. For example, surprisingly a stau could be lighter than
30 GeV if it decays hadronically. We estimate the Higgs bounds when one of
these decays dominates and find allowed Higgs masses well below the current LEP
bound on the standard model Higgs. We also survey the rich variety of final
states in Higgs production.
