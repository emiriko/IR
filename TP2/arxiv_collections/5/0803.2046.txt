Recolliding electrons are responsible for many of the interesting phenomena
observed in the interaction of strong laser fields with atoms and molecules. We
show that in multielectron targets such as C60 a new important recollision
pathway opens up: the returning electron may excite collective modes even if
the laser frequency is far off-resonant. We formulate a simple analytical
theory which predicts that the recollision-induced excitation of collective
modes should dominate over the "usual" harmonic generation yield at 800nm
wavelength. In this case the tomographic imaging of complex multielectron
systems may be obscured. We employ a time-dependent density functional model of
C60 and show that with increasing laser wavelength the dynamics becomes more
and more single active electron-like, suggesting that long wavelengths are to
be preferred for imaging purposes.
