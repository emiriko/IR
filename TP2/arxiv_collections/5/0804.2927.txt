We investigate the proper projective collineation in non-static spherically
symmetric space-times using direct integration and algebraic techniques.
Studying projective collineation in the above space-times, it is shown that the
space-times which admit proper projective collineations turn out to be very
special classes of static spherically symmetric space-times.
