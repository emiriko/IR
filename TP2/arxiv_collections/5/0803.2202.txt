Properties of intermediate mass nuclei have been investigated within the
framework of the alpha-cluster model in combination with systematic
double-folding potentials. Previously, this alpha-cluster model has been widely
applied to light nuclei, in particular to 8Be = alpha \otimes alpha, 20Ne = 16O
\otimes alpha, and 44Ti = 40Ca \otimes alpha, and to heavy nuclei, in
particular to 212Po = 208Pb \otimes alpha. In the present work a wide range of
nuclei is investigated with the magic neutron number N = 50 in the mass range
around A \approx 80 - 100: (A+4,N=52) = (A,N=50) \otimes alpha. It is found
that excitation energies, decay properties, and transition strengths can be
described successfully within this model. The smooth and small variation of the
underlying parameters of the alpha-nucleus potential may be used for
extrapolations to predict experimentally unknown properties in the nuclei under
study.
