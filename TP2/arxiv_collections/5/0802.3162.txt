We investigate the possible form of ideal intersections for two-dimensional
rf trap networks suitable for quantum information processing with trapped ions.
We show that the lowest order multipole component of the rf field that can
contribute to an ideal intersection is a hexapole term uniquely determined by
the tangents of the intersecting paths. The corresponding ponderomotive
potential does not provide any confinement perpendicular to the paths if these
intersect at right angles, indicating that ideal right-angle X intersections
are impossible to achieve with hexapole fields. Based on this result, we
propose an implementation of an ideal oblique-X intersection using a
three-dimensional electrode structure.
