The purpose of this report is to present the Crossdock Door Assignment
Problem, which involves assigning destinations to outbound dock doors of
Crossdock centres such that travel distance by material handling equipment is
minimized. We propose a two fold solution; simulation and optimization of the
simulation model simulation optimization. The novel aspect of our solution
approach is that we intend to use simulation to derive a more realistic
objective function and use Memetic algorithms to find an optimal solution. The
main advantage of using Memetic algorithms is that it combines a local search
with Genetic Algorithms. The Crossdock Door Assignment Problem is a new domain
application to Memetic Algorithms and it is yet unknown how it will perform.
