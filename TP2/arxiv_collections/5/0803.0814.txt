The ground state fidelity per lattice site is shown to be able to detect
quantum phase transitions for the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, a
prototypical example of quantum lattice systems with topological order. It is
found that, in the thermodynamic limit, the ground state fidelity per lattice
site is non-analytic at the phase boundaries: the second-order derivative of
its logarithmic function with respect to a control parameter describing the
interaction between neighboring spins is logarithmically divergent. A finite
size scaling analysis is performed, which allows us to extract the correlation
length critical exponent from the scaling behaviors of the ground state
fidelity per lattice site.
