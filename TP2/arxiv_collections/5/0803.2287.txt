Asymmetric exclusion processes with locally reversible kinetic constraints
are introduced to investigate the effect of non-conservative driving forces in
athermal systems. At high density they generally exhibit rheological-like
behavior, negative differential resistance, two-step structural relaxation,
dynamical heterogeneity and, possibly, a jamming transition driven by the
external field.
