We derive the theory of the quantum (zero temperature) superconductor to
metal transition in disordered materials when the resistance of the normal
metal near criticality is small compared to the quantum of resistivity. This
can occur most readily in situations in which ``Anderson's theorem'' does not
apply. We explicitly study the transition in superconductor-metal composites,
in an s-wave superconducting film in the presence of a magnetic field, and in a
low temperature disordered d-wave superconductor. Near the point of the
transition, the distribution of the superconducting order parameter is highly
inhomogeneous. To describe this situation we employ a procedure which is
similar to that introduced by Mott for description of the temperature
dependence of the variable range hopping conduction. As the system approaches
the point of the transition from the metal to the superconductor, the
conductivity of the system diverges, and the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated.
In the case of d-wave (or other exotic) superconductors we predict the
existence of (at least) two sequential transitions as a function of increasing
disorder: a d-wave to s-wave, and then an s-wave to metal transition.
