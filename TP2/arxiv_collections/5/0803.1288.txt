By using a two-step method, we successfully synthesized the iron based new
superconductor LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1-\delta}$. The resistive transition curves
under different magnetic fields were measured, leading to the determination of
the upper critical field Hc2(T) of this new superconductor. The value of Hc2 at
zero temperature is estimated to be about 50 Tesla roughly. In addition, the
Hall effect and magnetoresistance were measured in wide temperature region. A
negative Hall coefficient R_H has been found, implying a dominant conduction
mainly by electron-like charge carriers in this material. The charge carrier
density determined at 100 K is about 9.8E20cm^{-3}, which is close to the
cuprate superconductors. It is further found that the magnetoresistance does
not follow Kohler's law. Meanwhile, the different temperature dependence
behaviors of resistivity, Hall coefficient, and magnetoresistance have
anomalous properties at about 230 K, which may be induced by some exotic
scattering mechanism.
