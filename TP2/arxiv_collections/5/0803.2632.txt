The non-vanishing of gluonic pole matrix elements can explain the appearance
of single spin asymmetries in high-energy scattering processes. We use a
spectator framework approach to investigate the spectral properties of
quark-quark-gluon correlators and use this to study gluonic pole matrix
elements. Such matrix elements appear in principle both for distribution
functions such as the Sivers function and fragmentation functions such as the
Collins function. We find that for a large class of spectator models, the
contribution of the gluonic pole matrix element in fragmentation functions
vanishes. This outcome is important in the study of universality for
fragmentation functions and confirms findings using a different approach.
