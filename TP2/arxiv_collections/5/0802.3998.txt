The characteristic results by different diagnostics on a typical hydrogenated
diamond like carbon (HDLC) film synthesized directly in a capacitatively
coupled RF (13.56 MHz) discharge are described. The results show some typical
charecteric features of Graphane as predicted theoretically. First experimental
observation of GRAPHANE/GRAPHANE like structure embedded in the HDLC film is
described.
