We discuss some of the drawbacks of using event horizons to define black
holes. The reasons are both practical, physical and theoretical. We argue that
locally defined trapping horizons can remedy many of these drawbacks. We
examine of the question of whether black hole thermodynamics should be
associated with event horizons or trapping horizons. To this end we discuss
what role trapping horizons may play in black hole thermodynamics. In addition,
we show how trapping horizons may give rise to Hawking radiation and discuss
the issue of gravitational entropy.
