Results for quantum mechanical calculations of the integral cross sections
and corresponding thermal rate coefficients for para-/ortho-H2+HD collisions
are presented. Because of significant astrophysical interest in regard to the
cooling of primodial gas the low temperature limit of para-/ortho-H2+HD is
investigated. Sharp resonances in the rotational state-resolved cross sections
have been calculated at low energies. These resonances are important and
significantly contribute to the corresponding rotational state-resolved thermal
rate coefficients, particularly at low temperatures, that is less than $T \sim
100$K. Additionally in this work, the cross sections for the elastic HD+HD
collision have also been calculated. We obtained quite satisfactory agreement
with the results of other theoretical works and experiments.
