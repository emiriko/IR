In this paper we study Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with two
reflecting right continuous with left limits obstacles (or barriers) when the
noise is given by Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure mutually
independent. The jumps of the obstacle processes could be either predictable or
inaccessible. We show existence and uniqueness of the solution when the
barriers are completely separated and the generator uniformly Lipschitz. We do
not assume the existence of a difference of supermartingales between the
obstacles. As an application, we show that the related mixed zero-sum
differential-integral game problem has a value.
