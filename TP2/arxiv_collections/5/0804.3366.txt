Spin-orbit coupling induced anisotropies of plasmon dynamics are investigated
in two-dimensional semiconductor structures. The interplay of the linear
Bychkov-Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions drastically affects the
plasmon spectrum: the dynamical structure factor exhibits variations over
several decades, prohibiting plasmon propagation in specific directions. While
this plasmon filtering makes the presence of spin-orbit coupling in plasmon
dynamics observable, it also offers a control tool for plasmonic devices.
Remarkably, if the strengths of the two interactions are equal, not only the
anisotropy, but all the traces of the linear spin-orbit coupling in the
collective response disappear.
