We define a natural ensemble of trace preserving, completely positive quantum
maps and present algorithms to generate them at random. Spectral properties of
the superoperator Phi associated with a given quantum map are investigated and
a quantum analogue of the Frobenius-Perron theorem is proved. We derive a
general formula for the density of eigenvalues of Phi and show the connection
with the Ginibre ensemble of real non-symmetric random matrices. Numerical
investigations of the spectral gap imply that a generic state of the system
iterated several times by a fixed generic map converges exponentially to an
invariant state.
