A scaling analysis is presented of the statistics of long DNA confined in
nanochannels and nanoslits. It is argued that there are several regimes in
between the de Gennes and Odijk limits introduced long ago. The DNA chain folds
back on itself giving rise to a global persistence length which may be very
large owing to entropic deflection. Moreover, there is an orientational
excluded-volume effect between the DNA segments imposed solely by the
nanoconfinement. These two effects cause the chain statistics to be intricate
leading to nontrivial power laws for the chain extension in the intermediate
regimes. It is stressed that DNA confinement within nanochannels differs from
that in nanoslits because the respective orientational excluded-volume effects
are not the same.
