The latches are simple circuits with feedback from the digital electrical
engineering. We have included in our work the C element of Muller, the RS
latch, the clocked RS latch, the D latch and also circuits containing two
interconnected latches: the edge triggered RS flip-flop, the D flip-flop, the
JK flip-flop, the T flip-flop. The purpose of this study is to model with
equations the previous circuits, considered to be ideal, i.e. non-inertial. The
technique of analysis is the pseudoboolean differential calculus.
