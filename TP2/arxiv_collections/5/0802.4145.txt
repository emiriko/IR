It is shown how the gauge of the ``regular finite initial value problem at
spacelike infinity'' can be used to construct a certain type of estimates for
the Maxwell field propagating on a Schwarzschild background. These estimates
are constructed with the objective of obtaining information about the
smoothness near spacelike and null infinity of a wide class of solutions to the
Maxwell equations.
