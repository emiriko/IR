In this proceedings, similarities between the structure of theories with
Lorentz violation and theories with constant torsion in flat spacetime are
exploited to place bounds on torsion components. An example is given showing
the analysis leading to bounds on the axial-vector and mixed-symmetry
components of torsion, based on a dual-maser experiment.
