We present a search for a narrow-width heavy resonance decaying into top
quark pairs X->ttbar in ppbar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96TeV using approximately
0.9fb^-1 of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider. This analysis considers ttbar candidate events in the lepton plus
jets channel with at least one identified b jet and uses the ttbar invariant
mass distribution to search for evidence of resonant production. We find no
evidence for a narrow resonance X decaying to ttbar. Therefore, we set upper
limits on sigma*B(X->ttbar) for different hypothesized resonance masses using a
Bayesian approach. For a Topcolor-assisted technicolor model, the existence of
a leptophobic Z' boson with mass M_Z'<700GeV and width Gamma_Z'=0.012 M_Z' can
be excluded at the 95% C.L.
