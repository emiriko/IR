Multipolar plasmon oscillation frequencies and corresponding damping rates
for nanospheres formed of the simplest free-electron metals are studied. The
possibility of controlling plasmon features by choosing the size and dielectric
properties of the sphere surroundings is discussed. Optical properties of the
studied metals are described within the Drude-Sommerfeld model of the
dielectric function with effective parameters acounting for the contribution of
conduction electrons and of interband transitions. No approximation is made in
respect of the size of a particle; plasmon size characteristics are described
rigorously. The results of our experiment on sodium nanodroplets [1] are
compared with the oscillation frequency size dependence of dipole and
quadrupole plasmon.
