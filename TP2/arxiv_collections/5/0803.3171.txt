The six quark state(uuddss) called H dibaryon($J^P=0^+$,$S=-2$) has been
calculated to study its existence and stability. The simulations are performed
in quenched QCD on $8^3 \times 24$ and $16^3 \times 48$ anisotropic lattices
with Symanzik improved gauge action and Clover fermion action. The gauge
coupling is $\beta=2.0$ and aspect ratio $\xi=a_s/a_t=3.0$. Preliminary results
indicate that mass of H dibaryon is 2134(100)Mev on $8^3 \times 24$ lattice and
2167(59)Mev on $16^3 \times 48$ respectively. It seems that the radius of H
dibaryon is very large and the finite size effect is very obvious.
