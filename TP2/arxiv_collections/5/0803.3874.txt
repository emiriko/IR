Low energy $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR) was used
to investigate the spatial dependence of the hyperfine magnetic fields induced
by Fe in the nonmagnetic Ag of an Au(40 \AA)/Ag(200 \AA)/Fe(140 \AA) (001)
magnetic multilayer (MML) grown on GaAs. The resonance lineshape in the Ag
layer shows dramatic broadening compared to intrinsic Ag. This broadening is
attributed to large induced magnetic fields in this layer by the magnetic Fe
layer. We find that the induced hyperfine field in the Ag follows a power law
decay away from the Ag/Fe interface with power $-1.93(8)$, and a field
extrapolated to $0.23(5)$ T at the interface.
