Blueprints of polyhedral cages with icosahedral symmetry made of circular DNA
molecules are provided. The basic rule is that every edge of the cage is met
twice in opposite directions by the DNA strand, and vertex junctions are
realised by a set of admissible junction types. As nanocontainers for cargo
storage and delivery, the icosidodecahedral cages are of special interest as
they have the largest volume per surface ratio of all cages discussed here.
