One of the most surprising results is to find that a consistent description
of all the experimental results on particle multiplicities and particle ratios
obtained from the lowest AGS to the highest RHIC energies is possible within
the framework of a thermal statistical model. We propose here a
thermodynamically consistent excluded-volume model involving an interacting
multi-component hadron gas. We find that the energy dependence of the total
multiplicities of strange and non-strange hadrons obtained in this model agrees
closely with the experimental results. It indicates that the freeze out volume
of the fireball is uniformly the same for all the particles. We have also
compared the variation of the particle ratios such as $<K^{+}>/<\pi^{+}>, <
K^{-}>/<\pi^{-}>, K^{-}/K^{+}, \bar{p}/p, \bar{\Lambda}/\Lambda, \bar{\Xi}/\Xi,
\bar{\Omega}/\Omega, < \Lambda>/<\pi>, <\Xi^{-}>/<\pi>,
<\Omega+\bar{\Omega}>/<\pi>$ and $<\Phi>/<\pi>$ with respect to the
center-of-mass energy as predicted by our model with the recent experimental
data.
