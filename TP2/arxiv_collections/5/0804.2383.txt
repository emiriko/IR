In this work we investigate the stability of synchronized states for the
Kuramoto model on scale-free and random networks in the presence of white noise
forcing. We show that for a fixed coupling constant, the robustness of the
globally synchronized state against the noise is dependent on the noise
intensity on both kinds of networks. At low noise intensities the random
networks are more robust against losing the coherency but upon increasing the
noise, at a specific noise strength the synchronization among the population
vanishes suddenly. In contrast, on scale-free networks the global
synchronization disappears continuously at a much larger critical noise
intensity respect to the random networks.
