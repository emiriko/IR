In this paper, we firstly present what is Interactive Evolutionary
Computation (IEC) and rapidly how we have combined this artificial intelligence
technique with an eye-tracker for visual optimization. Next, in order to
correctly parameterize our application, we present results from applying data
mining techniques on gaze information coming from experiments conducted on
about 80 human individuals.
