The project of the international Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research
(FAIR), co-located to the GSI facility in Darmstadt, has been officially
started on November 7, 2007. The current plans of the facility and the planned
research program will be described. An investment of about 1 billion euro will
permit new physics programs in the areas of low and medium energy antiproton
research, heavy ion physics complementary to LHC, as well as in nuclear
structure and astrophysics. The facility will comprise about a dozen
accelerators and storage rings, which will enable simultaneous operations of up
to four different beams.
