We report new measurements of the infrared emission spectrum of Xe$_{2}$
excimers produced by electron impact in dense gas at room temperature. These
measurements extend the density range previously explored by a factor of two.
We have now reached a pressure $P\approx 3.3 $MPa, corresponding to a gas
density $N\approx 8\cdot 10^{26} $m$^{-3}$ in both pure Xe gas and in a Ar--Xe
mixture. The analysis of the changes of the spectrum induced by the interaction
with the gaseous environment shows how cooperative-- and many-body effects
develop with increasing density. We %will also show that quantum effects
related to the indistinguishability of identical particles are observed even at
such high temperature.
