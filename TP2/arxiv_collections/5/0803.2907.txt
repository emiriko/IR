In a quantum dot with dozens of electrons, an approximation beyond
Tamm-Dankoff is used to construct the quantum states with an additional
electron-hole pair, i.e. the "excitonic" states. The lowest states mimic the
non-interacting spectrum, but with excitation gaps renormalized by Coulomb
interactions. At higher excitation energies, the computed density of energy
levels shows an exponential increase with energy. In the interband absorption,
we found a background level in the quasicontinuum of states rising linearly
with the excitation energy. Above this background, there are distinct peaks
related to single resonances or to groups of many states with small interband
dipole moments.
