We consider the asymptotics of the second-order correlation function of the
characteristic polynomial of a random matrix. We show that the known result for
a random matrix from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble essentially continues to
hold for a general Hermitian Wigner matrix. Our proofs rely on an explicit
formula for the exponential generating function of the second-order correlation
function of the characteristic polynomial.
