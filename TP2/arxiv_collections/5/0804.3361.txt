Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders that greatly impair
patient' daily lives. Traditional epileptic diagnosis relies on tedious visual
screening by neurologists from lengthy EEG recording that requires the presence
of seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many systems helping the
neurologists to quickly find interesting segments of the lengthy signal by
automatic seizure detection. However, we notice that it is very difficult, if
not impossible, to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities for
epilepsy patients in areas lack of medical resources and trained neurologists.
Therefore, we propose to study automated epileptic diagnosis using interictal
EEG data that is much easier to collect than ictal data. The authors are not
aware of any report on automated EEG diagnostic system that can accurately
distinguish patients' interictal EEG from the EEG of normal people. The
research presented in this paper, therefore, aims to develop an automated
diagnostic system that can use interictal EEG data to diagnose whether the
person is epileptic. Such a system should also detect seizure activities for
further investigation by doctors and potential patient monitoring. To develop
such a system, we extract four classes of features from the EEG data and build
a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) fed with these features. Leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOO-CV) on a widely used epileptic-normal data set reflects
an impressive 99.5% accuracy of our system on distinguishing normal people's
EEG from patient's interictal EEG. We also find our system can be used in
patient monitoring (seizure detection) and seizure focus localization, with
96.7% and 77.5% accuracy respectively on the data set.
