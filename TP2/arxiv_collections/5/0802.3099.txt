In the SPOT-NOSED European project, nanoscale sensing elements bearing
olfactory receptors and grafted onto functionalized gold substrates are used as
odorant detectors to develop a new concept of nanobioelectronic nose, through
sensitive impedancemetric measurement of single receptor conformational change
upon ligand binding, with a better specificity and lower detection threshold
than traditional physical sensors.
