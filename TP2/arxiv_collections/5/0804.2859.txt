Any nonlinear equation of the form y''=\sum_{n=0}^N a_n(z)y^n has a
(generally branched) solution with leading order behaviour proportional to
(z-z_0)^{-2/(N-1)} about a point z_0, where the coefficients a_n are analytic
at z_0 and a_N(z_0)\ne 0. We consider the subclass of equations for which each
possible leading order term of this form corresponds to a one-parameter family
of solutions represented near z_0 by a Laurent series in fractional powers of
z-z_0. For this class of equations we show that the only movable singularities
that can be reached by analytic continuation along finite-length curves are of
the algebraic type just described. This work generalizes previous results of S.
Shimomura. The only other possible kind of movable singularity that might occur
is an accumulation point of algebraic singularities that can be reached by
analytic continuation along infinitely long paths ending at a finite point in
the complex plane. This behaviour cannot occur for constant coefficient
equations in the class considered. However, an example of R. A. Smith shows
that such singularities do occur in solutions of a simple autonomous
second-order differential equation outside the class we consider here.
