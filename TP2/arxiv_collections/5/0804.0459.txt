Point splitting has been suggested as a way to deal with anomalous
commutators in quantum field theory. It has been pointed out by D.G.
Boulware[4] that in order to obtain a mathematically consistent theory the
Hamiltonian operator must be point split also. We will examine the effect of
point splitting the Hamiltonian for a free fermion field in 1-1D space-time. It
will be shown that when the Hamiltonian operator is point split then quantum
states will exist with less energy than the normal vacuum state. This requires
the vacuum state to be redefined.
