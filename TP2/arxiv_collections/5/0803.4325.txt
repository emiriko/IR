A \star-product is defined via a set of commuting vector fields X_a = e_a^\mu
(x) \partial_\mu, and used in a phi^*4 theory coupled to the e_a^\mu (x)
fields. The \star-product is dynamical, and the vacuum solution phi =0, e_a^\mu
(x)=delta_a^\mu reproduces the usual Moyal product. The action is invariant
under rigid translations and Lorentz rotations, and the conserved
energy-momentum and angular momentum tensors are explicitly derived.
