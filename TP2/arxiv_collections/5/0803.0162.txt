The objective of this paper is to develop a standardized methodology for
software development in the very unique industry and culture of financial
markets. The prototyping process we present allows the development team to
deliver for review and comment intermediate-level models based upon clearly
defined customer requirements. This spreadsheet development methodology is
presented within a larger business context, that of trading system development,
the subject of an upcoming book by the authors of this paper.
