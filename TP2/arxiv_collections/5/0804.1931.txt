Gauge fields frequently used as an independent construction additional to
so-called wave fields of matter. This artificial separation is of course useful
in some applications (like Berry's interactions between the "heavy" and "light"
sub-systems) but it is restrictive on the fundamental level of "elementary"
particles and entangled states. It is shown that the linear superposition of
action states and non-linear dynamics of the local dynamical variables form an
oscillons of energy representing non-local particles - "lumps" arising together
with their "affine gauge potential" agrees with Fubini-Study metric.
  I use the conservation laws of local dynamical variables (LDV's) during
affine parallel transport in complex projective Hilbert space $CP(N-1)$ for
twofold aim. Firstly, I formulate the variation problem for the ``affine gauge
potential" as system of partial differential equations \cite{Le1}. Their
solutions provide embedding quantum dynamics into dynamical space-time whose
state-dependent coordinates related to the qubit spinor subjected to Lorentz
transformations of "quantum boosts" and "quantum rotations". Thereby, the
problem of quantum measurement being reformulated as the comparison of LDV's
during their affine parallel transport in $CP(N-1)$, is inherently connected
with space-time emergences. Secondly, the important application of these fields
is the completeness of quantum theory. The EPR and Schr\"odinger's Cat
paradoxes are discussed from the point of view of the restored Lorentz
invariance due to the affine parallel transport of local Hamiltonian of the
soliton-like field.
