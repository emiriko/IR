Graph dynamical systems (GDSs) can be used to describe a wide range of
distributed, nonlinear phenomena. In this paper we characterize cycle
equivalence of a class of finite GDSs called sequential dynamical systems SDSs.
In general, two finite GDSs are cycle equivalent if their periodic orbits are
isomorphic as directed graphs. Sequential dynamical systems may be thought of
as generalized cellular automata, and use an update order to construct the
dynamical system map.
  The main result of this paper is a characterization of cycle equivalence in
terms of shifts and reflections of the SDS update order. We construct two
graphs C(Y) and D(Y) whose components describe update orders that give rise to
cycle equivalent SDSs. The number of components in C(Y) and D(Y) is an upper
bound for the number of cycle equivalence classes one can obtain, and we
enumerate these quantities through a recursion relation for several graph
classes. The components of these graphs encode dynamical neutrality, the
component sizes represent periodic orbit structural stability, and the number
of components can be viewed as a system complexity measure.
