We derive the set of inversion relations allowing to establish the link
between the dual parametrization of GPDs and a broad class of phenomenological
models for GPDs. As an example we consider the results of the calculation of
the pion GPD in the framework of nonlocal chiral quark model (NlCQM) to recover
the set of forward-like functions representing this GPD in the framework of
dual parametrization. We also argue that Abel tomography method overlooks
possible delta function like contributions to GPD quintessence function making
explicit contribution to the D from factor.
