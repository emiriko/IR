This paper presents a formalized proof of a discrete form of the Jordan Curve
Theorem. It is based on a hypermap model of planar subdivisions, formal
specifications and proofs assisted by the Coq system. Fundamental properties
are proven by structural or noetherian induction: Genus Theorem, Euler's
Formula, constructive planarity criteria. A notion of ring of faces is
inductively defined and a Jordan Curve Theorem is stated and proven for any
planar hypermap.
