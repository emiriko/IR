We derive the Free Differential Algebra for type IIA supergravity in 10
dimensions in the string frame. We provide all fermionic terms for all
curvatures. We derive the Green-Schwarz sigma model for type IIA superstring
based on the FDA construction and we check its invariance under kappa-symmetry.
Finally, we derive the pure spinor sigma model and we check the BRST
invariance. The present derivation has the advantage that the resulting sigma
model is constructed in terms of the superfields appearing in the FDA and
therefore one can directly relate a supergravity background with the
corresponding sigma model. The complete explicit form of the BRST
transformations is given and some new pure spinor constraints are obtained.
Finally, the explicit form of the action is given.
