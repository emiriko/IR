A corner-overgrown GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure is investigated with
transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopy, demonstrating
self-limiting growth of an extremely sharp corner profile of 3.5 nm width. In
the AlGaAs layers we observe self-ordered diagonal stripes, precipitating
exactly at the corner, which are regions of increased Al content measured by an
XEDS analysis. A quantitative model for self-limited growth is adapted to the
present case of faceted MBE growth, and the corner sharpness is discussed in
relation to quantum confined structures. We note that MBE corner overgrowth
maintains nm-sharpness even after microns of growth, allowing the realization
of corner-shaped nanostructures.
