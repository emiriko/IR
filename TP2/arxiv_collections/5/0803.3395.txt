In the first part of the paper we generalize a descent technique due to
Harish-Chandra to the case of a reductive group acting on a smooth affine
variety both defined over arbitrary local field F of characteristic zero. Our
main tool is Luna slice theorem.
  In the second part of the paper we apply this technique to symmetric pairs.
In particular we prove that the pair (GL(n,C),GL(n,R)) is a Gelfand pair. We
also prove that any conjugation invariant distribution on GL(n,F) is invariant
with respect to transposition. For non-archimedean F the later is a classical
theorem of Gelfand and Kazhdan.
  We use the techniques developed here in our subsequent work [AG3] where we
prove an archimedean analog of the theorem on uniqueness of linear periods by
H. Jacquet and S. Rallis.
