This study focuses on an alignment-free sequence comparison method: the
number of words of length k shared between two sequences, also known as the D_2
statistic. The advantages of the use of this statistic over alignment-based
methods are firstly that it does not assume that homologous segments are
contiguous, and secondly that the algorithm is computationally extremely fast,
the runtime being proportional to the size of the sequence under scrutiny.
Existing applications of the D_2 statistic include the clustering of related
sequences in large EST databases such as the STACK database. Such applications
have typically relied on heuristics without any statistical basis. Rigorous
statistical characterisations of the distribution of D_2 have subsequently been
undertaken, but have focussed on the distribution's asymptotic behaviour,
leaving the distribution of D_2 uncharacterised for most practical cases. The
work presented here bridges these two worlds to give usable approximations of
the distribution of D_2 for ranges of parameters most frequently encountered in
the study of biological sequences.
