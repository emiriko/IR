We propose a new method to study motions of mixtures in fluid interfaces. We
extend the equations of equilibrium in interfaces and the results associated
with travelling waves for van der Waals like fluids. Maxwell rule is extended
to interfaces of fluid mixtures out of equilibrium. Formulae like Clapeyron
relation are obtained for isothermal layers.
