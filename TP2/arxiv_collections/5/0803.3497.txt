The masses of S-wave bottom baryons are calculated in the framework of
coupled-channel formalism. The relativistic three-quark equations for the
bottom baryons using the dispersion relation technique are found. The
approximate solutions of these equations based on the extraction of leading
singularities of the amplitude are obtained. The calculated mass values of
S-wave bottom baryons are in good agreement with the experimental ones.
