Terahertz reflectance spectra of the Ca-intercalated graphite CaC6 reveal a
superconducting gap below 11K. The gap signature lacks a sharp onset to full
reflectivity at 2Delta, but rather shows a distribution of gap values
consistent with an anisotropic gap. The experimental data were successfully
fitted to the gap distribution obtained from density functional calculations by
Sanna et al. (Phys.Rev. B75, 020511, 2007). The temperature dependence of the
superconducting gap is characteristic for a BCS type superconductor.
