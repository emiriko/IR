The works of Poincare, Birkhoff, Witt and Cartier, Milnor, Moore on the
connected cocommutative Hopf algebras translated in the language of operads
means that the triple of operads (Com, As, Lie) endowed with the Hopf
compatiblity relation is good. In this paper, we focus on left dipterous (resp.
right dipterous) algebras which are associative algebras with an extra left
(resp. right) module on themselves and look for good triples were $As$ is
replaced by the dipterous operad Dipt. Since the work of Loday and Ronco, the
triple of operads (As, Dipt, B_\infty) endowed with the semi-Hopf compatibility
relations is known to be good. In this paper, we prove that the triple of
operads (As, Dipt, Grove) endowed with the so-called (nonunital)
semi-infinitesimal compatibility relations is good. For that, explicit
constructions of the free dipterous algebra and the free grove-algebra over a
K-vector space V are given. These constructions turn out to be related to
rooted planar trees and the little an large Schroeder numbers. Many examples of
dipterous algebras are given, notably the free L-dipterous algebras. As a
corollary of our results, we also recover that the triple of operads (2As,
Dipt, Vect) endowed both with the unital semi-Hopf and with the unital
semi-infinitesimal compatibility relations is good, where 2As denotes the
operad of 2-associative algebras. We also open this paper on a good triple,
related to the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra in quantum field theory, (Com, Dipt,
Prim_{Com} Dipt) endowed with the Hopf compatibility relations and also present
a general theorem giving good triples from entangled dipterous like operads
named associative molecules.
