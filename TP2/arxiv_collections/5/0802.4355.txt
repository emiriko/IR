In this letter, the results on the development and simulation of new
three-dimensional nanotraps for cold dressed atoms are considered. The traps
are the multi-cell structures built by crossed non-touching carbon nanotubes.
The trapping effect is tuned by the DC and RF currents to confine the strong-
or low-potential seeking atoms far enough from the areas of strong
Casimir-Polder and spin-flip forces. It is supposed that the developed and
simulated multi-cell structures are pertinent for catching the Bose-Einstein
condensates to demonstrate the Josephson effect, and to enable the study of the
entanglement of confined clouds in three-dimensional nano-cells.
