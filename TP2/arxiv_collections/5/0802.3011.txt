In the high dimension (mean field) limit the susceptibility and the second
moment correlation length of the Ising ferromagnet depend on temperature as
chi(T)=tau^{-1} and xi(T)=T^{-1/2}tau^{-1/2} exactly over the entire
temperature range above the critical temperature T_c, with the scaling variable
tau=(T-T_c)/T. For finite dimension ferromagnets temperature dependent
effective exponents can be defined over all T using the same expressions. For
the canonical two dimensional square lattice Ising ferromagnet it is shown that
compact "extended scaling" expressions analogous to the high dimensional limit
forms give accurate approximations to the true temperature dependencies, again
over the entire temperature range from T_c to infinity. Within this approach
there is no cross-over temperature in finite dimensions above which
mean-field-like behavior sets in.
