It has been suggested by Diosi and Penrose that the occurrence of quantum
state reduction in macroscopic objects is related to a manifestation of
gravitational effects in quantum mechanics. Although within Penrose's framework
the dynamics of the quantum state reduction is not prescribed, it was suggested
that the so called Schrodinger-Newton equation can be used to at least identify
the resulting classical end states. Here we analyze the extent to which the
Schrodinger-Newton equation can be used as a model to generate a full, time
dependent description of the quantum state reduction process. We find that when
supplied with an imaginary gravitational potential, the Schrodinger-Newton
equation offers a rationalisation for some of the hitherto unexplained
characteristics of quantum state reduction. The description remains incomplete
however, because it is unclear how to fully recover Born's rule.
