Fedosov's simple geometrical construction for deformation quantization of
symplectic manifolds is generalized in three ways without introducing new
variables: (1) The base manifold is allowed to be a supermanifold. (2) The star
product does not have to be of Weyl/symmetric or Wick/normal type. (3) The
initial geometric structures are allowed to depend on Planck's constant.
