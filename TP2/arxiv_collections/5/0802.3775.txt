We report on 3D time-domain parallel simulations of Anderson localization of
light in inverted disordered opals displaying a complete photonic band-gap. We
investigate dynamic diffusion processes induced by femtosecond laser
excitations, calculate the diffusion constant and the decay-time distribution
versus the strength of the disorder. We report evidence of the transition from
delocalized Bloch oscillations to strongly localized resonances in
self-starting laser processes.
