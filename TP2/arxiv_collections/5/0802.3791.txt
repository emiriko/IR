This paper is concerned with the Einstein equations in axisymmetric vacuum
spacetimes. We consider numerical evolution schemes that solve the constraint
equations as well as elliptic gauge conditions at each time step. We examine
two such schemes that have been proposed in the literature and show that some
of their elliptic equations are indefinite, thus potentially admitting
nonunique solutions and causing numerical solvers based on classical relaxation
methods to fail. A new scheme is then presented that does not suffer from these
problems. We use our numerical implementation to study the gravitational
collapse of Brill waves. A highly prolate wave is shown to form a black hole
rather than a naked singularity.
