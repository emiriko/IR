We demonstrate that in two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric s-wave
superconductors under applied magnetic fields for a particular electron
density, topological order emerges, and there exists a zero energy Majorana
fermion mode in a vortex core, which obeys non-Abelian statistics, in analogy
with p_x+ip_y superconductors, the Moore-Read Pfaffian quantum Hall state, and
the gapped non-Abelian spin liquid phase of the Kitaev model.
