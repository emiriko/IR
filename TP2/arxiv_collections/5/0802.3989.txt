In the two-dimensional superfluidity, the proliferation of the vortices and
the anti-vortices results in a new class of phase transition,
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This class of the phase
transitions is also anticipated in the two-dimensional magnetic systems.
However, its existence in the real magnetic systems still remains mysterious.
Here we propose a phenomenological model to illustrate that the novel
spin-freezing transition recently uncovered in the NMR experiment on the
NiGa_2S_4 compound is the BKT-type. The novel spin-freezing state observed in
the NiGa_2S_4 possesses the power-law decayed spin correlation.
