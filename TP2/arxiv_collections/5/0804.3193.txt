We introduce the C++ library Wedge, based on GiNaC, for symbolic computations
in differential geometry. We show how Wedge makes it possible to use the
language C++ to perform such computations, and illustrate some advantages of
this approach with explicit examples. In particular, we describe a short
program to determine whether a given linear exterior differential system is
involutive.
