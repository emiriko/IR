We define and construct efficient depth-universal and almost-size-universal
quantum circuits. Such circuits can be viewed as general-purpose simulators for
central classes of quantum circuits and can be used to capture the
computational power of the circuit class being simulated. For depth we
construct universal circuits whose depth is the same order as the circuits
being simulated. For size, there is a log factor blow-up in the universal
circuits constructed here. We prove that this construction is nearly optimal.
