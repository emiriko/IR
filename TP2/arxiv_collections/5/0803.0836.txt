We construct the type IIA nonsupersymmetric meta-stable brane configurations
corresponding to the various N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. The D6-branes
are both displaced and rotated where these deformations are described as the
mass term and quartic term for the fundamental flavors respectively. The
multiplicity of the NS5-branes occurs in the superpotential order for adjoint,
symmetric, or bifundamental matters. A rich pattern of nonsupersymmetric
meta-stable states as well as the supersymmetric stable states is found.
