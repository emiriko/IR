We present measurements of the binding energies of $^6$Li p-wave Feshbach
molecules formed in combinations of the (F = 1/2, m_F = +1/2), (1), and (F =
1/2, m_F = -1/2), (2), states. The binding energies scale linearly with
magnetic field detuning for all three resonances. The relative molecular
magnetic moments are found to be $113 \pm 7 \mu$K/G, $111 \pm 6 \mu$K/G and
$118 \pm 8 \mu$K/G for the (1)-(1), (1)-(2) and (2)-(2) resonances,
respectively, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Closed channel
amplitudes and the size of the p-wave molecules are obtained theoretically from
full closed-coupled calculations.
