We propose a novel notion of a quantum learning machine for automatically
controlling quantum coherence and for developing quantum algorithms. A quantum
learning machine can be trained to learn a certain task with no a priori
knowledge on its algorithm. As an example, it is demonstrated that the quantum
learning machine learns Deutsch's task and finds itself a quantum algorithm,
that is different from but equivalent to the original one.
