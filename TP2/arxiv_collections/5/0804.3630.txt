Merely rocking the temperature in one heat bath can direct a steady heat flux
from cold to hot against a non-zero thermal bias in stylized nonlinear lattice
junctions that are sandwiched between two heat baths. Likewise, for an average
zero-temperature difference between the two contacts a net, ratchet-like heat
flux emerges. Computer simulations show that this very heat flux can be
controlled and reversed by suitably tailoring the frequency ($\lesssim$ 100
MHz) of the alternating temperature field.
