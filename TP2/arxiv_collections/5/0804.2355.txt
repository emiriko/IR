The time-reversal mirror (TRM) of acoustic waves is used as a focusing
technique that is robust against disorder and chaos. The propagation of an
ultrasonic pulse from the focal point is detected and recorded by a surrounding
array of transducers that enclose the cavity region. The registered signals are
then played-back in the reverse temporal sequence and an imperfect Loschmidt
echo is obtained. A similar technique developed in the quantum domain, the
perfect inverse filter (PIF), ensures an exact reversion. Applied to the
acoustical case, it allows an improvement in the design of a minimally invasive
inverse filter. Although that version of PIF accounts for external source
condition, now we propose a generalization where the initial excitation is
created inside the cavity. We present the theoretical principles for this form
of PIF and perform a numerical test in a multichannel system that improves the
focalization quality compared to the TRM version.
