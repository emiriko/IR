We study models for surface growth with a wetting and a roughening transition
using simple and pair mean-field approximations. The simple mean-field
equations are solved exactly and they predict the roughening transition and the
correct growth exponents in a region of the phase diagram. The pair mean-field
equations, which are solved numerically, show a better accordance with
numerical simulation and correctly predicts a growing interface with constant
velocity at the moving phase. Also, when detailed balance is fulfilled, the
pair mean field becomes the exact solution of the model.
