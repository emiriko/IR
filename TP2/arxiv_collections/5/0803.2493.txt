An equation previously proposed to describe the evolution of vortex line
density in rotating counterflow turbulent tangles in superfluid helium is
generalized to incorporate nonvanishing barycentric velocity and velocity
gradients. Our generalization is compared with an analogous approach proposed
by Lipniacki, and with experimental results by Swanson et al. in rotating
counterflow, and it is used to evaluate the vortex density in plane Couette and
Poiseuille flows of superfluid helium.
