We refine the definition of universal ratio c/\tilde{c} obtained via AdS/CFT
correspondence as shown in arXiv:0801.2785 [hep-th], denoted as \gamma_c, and
apply it to non-CFTs whose dual gravitational theory have metric of asymptotic
AdS. We conjecture that \gamma_c=1 is the lower bound being saturated at high
temperature regime and serves as an ordering parameter as energy scale varies.
We test this conjecture with the hard wall AdS/QCD toy model and N=2*
Pilch-Warner solution and find the agreement. At last, we make a connection
with the C-Theorem and prove this conjecture in a general holographic
background with multi-kink geometry.
