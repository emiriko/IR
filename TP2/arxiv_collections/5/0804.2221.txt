We study the segmental dynamics of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) from
microscopic simulations in the neat polymer and a polymer electrolyte
(PEO/LiBF$_4$) by analyzing the normal modes. We verify the applicability of
the Rouse theory, specifically for the polymer electrolyte where dynamic
heterogeneities, arising from cation-polymer interactions, alter the mobility
non-uniformly along the chains. We find that the Rouse modes for both the
systems are orthogonal despite the presence of non-exponential relaxation of
the modes and violation of the Gaussian self-similarity of the chains. The
slowdown of the segmental dynamics in the polymer electrolyte is rationalised
by an order of magnitude increase in the friction coefficient for those
monomers which are bound by cations. In general, for the electrolyte the Rouse
predictions for the dynamics of segments (both free and/or bound) agree well
except for very short times.
