We analyze the problem of optimal adiabatic passage through a quantum
critical point. We show that to minimize the number of defects the tuning
parameter should be changed as a power-law in time. The optimal power is
proportional to the logarithm of the total passage time multiplied by universal
critical exponents characterizing the phase transition. We support our results
by the general scaling analysis and by explicit calculations for the transverse
field Ising model.
