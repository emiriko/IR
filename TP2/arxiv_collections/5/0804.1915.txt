Reversible reaction-diffusion systems display anomalous dynamics
characterized by a power-law relaxation toward stationarity. In this paper we
study in the aging regime the nonequilibrium dynamical properties of some model
systems with reversible reactions. Starting from the exact Langevin equations
describing these models, we derive expressions for two-time correlation and
autoresponse functions and obtain a simple aging behavior for these quantities.
The autoresponse function is thereby found to depend on the specific nature of
the chosen perturbation of the system.
