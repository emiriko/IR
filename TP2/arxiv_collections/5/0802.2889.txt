The claim that the large scale structure of the Universe is hierarchical has
a very long history going back at least to Charlier's papers of the early 20th
century. In recent years, the debate has centered largely on the works of Sylos
Labini, Joyce, Pietronero and others, who have made the quantative claim that
the large scale structure of the Universe is quasi-fractal with fractal
dimension $D\approx 2$. There is now a concensus that this is the case on
medium scales, with the main debate revolving around what happens on the scales
of the largest available modern surveys.
  This paper, which is a realization of a worldview which is deeply rooted in
the ideas of Leibniz and Mach shows, as a very special case of a general
formalism, that such a fractal $D\approx 2$ world is necessarily a world of
dynamical equilibrium.
  We use the cosmology to write down a simple galaxy model as an arbitrary
spherically symmetric bounded perturbation of the $D\approx 2$ equilibrium
environment. A necessary mass continuity condition on the perturbation boundary
between galactic interior and the exterior environment immediately defines that
boundary as a critical acceleration boundary with $a_0 \sim 4\pi G \Sigma_F$
where $a_0$ is the critical acceleration parameter and $\Sigma_F$ is the
characteristic mass surface density of the $D \approx 2$ fractal environment.
The MOND acceleration condition $V_0^2/R_0 = a_0$ for circular orbits on the
critical boundary follows in a straightforward manner.
