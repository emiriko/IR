We consider a multidimensional Burgers equation on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$
and the whole space $\Rd$. We show that, in case of the torus, there exists a
unique global solution in Lebesgue spaces. For a torus we also provide
estimates on the large time behaviour of solutions. In the case of $\Rd$ we
establish the existence of a unique global solution if a Beale-Kato-Majda type
condition is satisfied. To prove these results we use the probabilistic
arguments which seem to be new.
