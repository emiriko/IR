(2007)] a bipolar counter-propagating wave decomposition, Psi = Psi+ + Psi-,
was presented for stationary states Psi of the one-dimensional Schrodinger
equation, such that the components Psi+- approach their semiclassical WKB
analogs in the large action limit. The corresponding bipolar quantum
trajectories are classical-like and well-behaved, even when Psi has many nodes,
or is wildly oscillatory. In this paper, the method is generalized for
time-dependent wavepacket dynamics applications, and applied to several
benchmark problems, including multisurface systems with nonadiabatic coupling.
