Three-nucleon interactions are a frontier in understanding and predicting the
structure of strongly-interacting matter in laboratory nuclei and in the
cosmos. We present results and discuss the status of first calculations with
microscopic three-nucleon interactions beyond light nuclei. This coherent
effort is possible due to advances based on effective field theory and
renormalization group methods in nuclear physics.
