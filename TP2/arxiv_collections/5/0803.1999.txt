Recently, Cardy, Castro Alvaredo and the author obtained the first
exponential correction to saturation of the bi-partite entanglement entropy at
large region length, in massive two-dimensional integrable quantum field
theory. It only depends on the particle content of the model, and not on the
way particles scatter. Based on general analyticity arguments for form factors,
we propose that this result is universal, and holds for any massive
two-dimensional model (also out of integrability). We suggest a link of this
result with counting pair creations far in the past.
