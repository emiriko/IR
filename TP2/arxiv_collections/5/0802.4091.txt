Through a non-perturbative quantum theory, we investigate how the
quasi-electron excitations of a two-dimensional electron gas are modified by
strong coupling to the vacuum field of a microcavity. We show that the
electronic dressed states originate from a Fano-like coupling between the bare
electron states and the continuum of intersubband cavity polariton excitations.
In particular, we calculate the electron spectral function modified by
light-matter interactions and its impact on the electronic injection of
intersubband cavity polaritons. The domain of validity of the present
theoretical results is critically discussed. We show that resonant electron
tunneling from a narrow-band injector can selectively excite superradiant
states and produce efficient intersubband polariton electroluminescence.
