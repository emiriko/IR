We develop a grid method for multi-channel scattering of atoms in a waveguide
with harmonic confinement. This approach is employed to extensively analyze the
transverse excitations and deexcitations as well as resonant scattering
processes. Collisions of identical bosonic and fermionic as well as
distinguishable atoms in harmonic traps with a single frequency $\omega$
permitting the center-of-mass (c.m.) separation are explored in depth. In the
zero-energy limit and single mode regime we reproduce the well-known
confinement-induced resonances (CIRs) for bosonic, fermionic and heteronuclear
collisions. In case of the multi-mode regime up to four open transverse
channels are considered. Previously obtained analytical results are extended
significantly here. Series of Feshbach resonances in the transmission behaviour
are identified and analyzed. The behaviour of the transmission with varying
energy and scattering lengths is discussed in detail. The dual CIR leading to a
complete quantum suppression of atomic scattering is revealed in multi-channel
scattering processes. Possible applications include, e.g., cold and ultracold
atom-atom collisions in atomic waveguides and electron-impurity scattering in
quantum wires.
