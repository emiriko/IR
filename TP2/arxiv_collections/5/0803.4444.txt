We present a method for performing sampling from a Boltzmann distribution of
an ill-conditioned quadratic action. This method is based on heatbath
thermalization along a set of conjugate directions, generated via a
conjugate-gradient procedure. The resulting scheme outperforms local updates
for matrices with very high condition number, since it avoids the slowing down
of modes with lower eigenvalue, and has some advantages over the global
heatbath approach, compared to which it is more stable and allows for more
freedom in devising case-specific optimizations.
