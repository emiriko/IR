In (Istrate, Marathe, Ravi SODA 2001) we advocated the investigation of
robustness of results in the theory of learning in games under adversarial
scheduling models. We provide evidence that such an analysis is feasible and
can lead to nontrivial results by investigating, in an adversarial scheduling
setting, Peyton Young's model of diffusion of norms. In particular, our main
result incorporates into Peyton Young's model.
