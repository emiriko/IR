We report here experimental evidence of the reflection of a large fraction of
a beam of low energy antiprotons by an aluminum wall. This derives from the
analysis of a set of annihilations of antiprotons that come to rest in rarefied
helium gas after hitting the end wall of the apparatus. A Monte Carlo
simulation of the antiproton path in aluminum indicates that the observed
reflection occurs primarily via a multiple Rutherford-style scattering on Al
nuclei, at least in the energy range 1-10 keV where the phenomenon is most
visible in the analyzed data. These results contradict the common belief
according to which the interactions between matter and antimatter are dominated
by the reciprocally destructive phenomenon of annihilation.
