We prove that every closed hyperbolic 3-manifold has a family of (possibly
infinite sheeted) coverings with the property that the Cheeger constants in the
family tend to zero. This is used to show that, if in addition the fundamental
group of the manifold is LERF, then it satisfies the Lubotzky-Sarnak
conjecture.
