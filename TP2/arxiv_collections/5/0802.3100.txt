In piezoresisitive two-axis accelerometers with two proof masses suspended by
cantilever beams, there are generally many ways to configure the Wheatstone
bridges. The configurations are different both with respect to functionality
and performance. The main distinction is between bridges that contain resistors
belonging to both proof masses, and the one bridge that doesn't. We compare the
different bridge configurations by analytical calculations of bridge
non-linearity, robustness towards manufacturing variations and electronic
noise. We consider accelerometers where the ratio between the sensitivity to
acceleration normal and parallel to the chip plane vary over a wide range. For
numerical examples we use representative values for p-type silicon. The
performance of the configuration with one bridge connected to each proof mass
is superior to those that combine resistors belonging to different proof
masses.
