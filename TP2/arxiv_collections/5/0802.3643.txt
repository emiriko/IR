We develop a theoretical formalism to model the linear spectrum of a quantum
dot embedded in a high quality cavity, in presence of an arbitrary mechanism
modifying the homogeneous spectrum of the quantum dot. Within the simple
assumption of lorentzian broadening, we show how the known predictions of
cavity quantum electrodynamics are recovered. We then apply our model to the
case where the quantum dot interacts with an acoustic-phonon reservoir,
producing phonon sidebands in the response of the bare dot. In this case, we
show that the sidebands can sustain the spectral response of the cavity-like
peak even at moderate dot-cavity detuning, thus supporting recent experimental
findings.
