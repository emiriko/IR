We have carried out a Schrodinger functional (SF) calculation for the SU(3)
lattice gauge theory with two flavors of Wilson fermions in the sextet
representation of the gauge group. We find that the discrete beta function,
which governs the change in the running coupling under a discrete change of
spatial scale, changes sign when the SF renormalized coupling is in the
neighborhood of g^2=2.0. The simplest explanation is that the theory has an
infrared-attractive fixed point, but more complicated possibilities are allowed
by the data. While we compare rescalings by factors of 2 and 4/3, we work at a
single lattice spacing.
