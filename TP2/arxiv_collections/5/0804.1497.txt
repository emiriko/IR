The physics of neutrino oscillation is summarized, and then the results of
oscillation experiments, including the most recent results, are discussed. The
possibility that neutrinos are their own antiparticles is examined. What we
have learned so far about the neutrinos is reviewed, and the questions to be
answered through future experiments are discussed.
