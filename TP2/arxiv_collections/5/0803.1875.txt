Contemporary spreadsheets are plagued by a profusion of errors, auditing
difficulties, lack of uniform development methodologies, and barriers to easy
comprehension of the underlying business models they represent. This paper
presents a case that most of these difficulties stem from the fact that the
standard spreadsheet user-interaction paradigm - the 'cell-matrix' approach -
is appropriate for spreadsheet data presentation but has significant drawbacks
with respect to spreadsheet creation, maintenance and comprehension when
workbooks pass a minimal threshold of complexity. An alternative paradigm for
the automated generation of spreadsheets directly from plain-language business
model descriptions is presented along with its potential benefits. Sunsight
Modeller (TM), a working software system implementing the suggested paradigm,
is briefly described.
