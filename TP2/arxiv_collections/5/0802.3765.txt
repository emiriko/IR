The generation of photons in a three dimensional rectangular cavity with two
moving boundaries is studied by using the Multiple Scale Analysis (MSA). It is
shown that number of photons are enhanced for the cavity whose walls oscillate
symmetrically with respect to the center of the cavity. The non-stationary
Casimir effect is also discussed for the cavity which oscillates as a whole.
