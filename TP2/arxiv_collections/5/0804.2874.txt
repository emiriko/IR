Optimal control problem with a goal to squeeze wave packet of a trapped
quantum particle is considered and solved analytically using adiabatic
approximation. The analytical solution that drives the particle into a highly
localized final state is presented for a case of an infinite well trapping
potential. The presented solution may be applied to increase the resolution of
atom lithography.
