An exact expression for the Drude conductivity in one dimension is derived
under the presence of an arbitrary potential. In getting the conductivity the
influence of the electric field on the crystal potential is taken into account.
This coupling leads to a systematic deformation of the potential and
consequently to a significant modification of the charge transport. The
corrections to the conventional Drude conductivity are determined by the
configurational part of the partition function. The activation energy for the
conductivity process is expressed by a combination of the free energy of the
underlying equilibrium system. The electric current is calculated in the linear
response regime by solving the Smoluchowski equation. The steady state solution
differs significantly from the equilibrium distribution. In case of a tight
binding potential the conductivity offers corrections depending on the
amplitude of the potential. As a further application we discuss nanocontacts
with piecewise constant potentials. The electric conductivity is corrected by
the potential height.
