The ground-state energies of systems containing up to twelve $\pi^+$'s in a
spatial volume V ~ (2.5 fm)^3 are computed in dynamical, mixed-action lattice
QCD at a lattice spacing of ~ 0.125 fm for four different values of the light
quark masses. Clean signals are seen for each ground state, allowing for a
precise extraction of both the $\pi^+\pi^+$ scattering length and
$\pi^+\pi^+\pi^+$-interaction from a correlated analysis of systems containing
different numbers of $\pi^+$'s. This extraction of the $\pi^+\pi^+$ scattering
length is consistent with than that from the $\pi^+\pi^+$-system alone. The
large number of systems studied here significantly strengthens the arguments
presented in our earlier work and unambiguously demonstrates the presence of a
low energy $\pi^+\pi^+\pi^+$-interaction. The equation of state of a $\pi^+$
gas is investigated using our numerical results and the density dependence of
the isospin chemical potential for these systems agrees well with the
theoretical expectations of leading order chiral perturbation theory. The
chemical potential is found to receive a substantial contribution from the
$\pi^+\pi^+\pi^+$-interaction at the lighter pion masses. An important
technical aspect of this work is the demonstration of the necessity of
performing propagator contractions in greater than double precision to extract
the correct results.
