We study the pair-breaking effect of rotation on a cold Fermi gas in the
BCS-BEC crossover region. In the framework of BCS theory, which is supposed to
be qualitatively correct at zero temperature, we find that in a trap rotating
around a symmetry axis, three regions have to be distinguished: (A) a region
near the rotational axis where the superfluid stays at rest and where no pairs
are broken, (B) a region where the pairs are progressively broken with
increasing distance from the rotational axis, resulting in an increasing
rotational current, and (C) a normal-fluid region where all pairs are broken
and which rotates like a rigid body. Due to region B, density and current do
not exhibit any discontinuities.
