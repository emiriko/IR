By phenomenological Landau analysis, it is shown that a scalar order
parameter with the point-group symmetry $\Gamma_{1g}$ explains most properties
associated with the phase transition in PrFe$_4$P$_{12}$ at 6.5 K. The
scalar-order model reproduces magnetic and elastic properties in
PrFe$_4$P$_{12}$ consistently such as (i) the anomaly of the magnetic
susceptibility and elastic constant at the transition temperature, (ii)
anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility in the presence of uniaxial pressure,
and (iii) the anomaly in the elastic constant in magnetic field. An Ehrenfest
relation is derived which relates the anomaly of the magnetic susceptibility to
that of the elastic constant at the transition.
