We consider the problem of spectra for acoustic type of turbulence generated
by shocks being randomly distributed in space. We show that for turbulence with
a weak anisotropy such spectra have the same dependence in $k$-space as the
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) spectrum: $E(k)\sim k^{-2}$. However, the frequency
spectrum has always the falling $\sim \omega^{-2}$, independently on
anisotropy. In the strong anisotropic case the energy distribution relative to
wave vectors takes anisotropic dependence forming in the large $% k $ region
the spectra of the jet type.
