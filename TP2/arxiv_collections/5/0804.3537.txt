The radiative induction of the CPT and Lorentz violating Chern-Simons (CS)
term is reassessed. The massless and massive models are studied. Special
attention is given to the preservation of gauge symmetry at higher orders in
the background vector $b_\mu$ when radiative corrections are considered. Both
the study of the odd and even parity sectors of the complete vacuum
polarization tensor at one-loop order and a non-perturbative analysis show that
this symmetry must be preserved by the quantum corrections. As a complement we
obtain that transversality of the polarization tensor does not fix the value of
the coefficient of the induced CS term.
