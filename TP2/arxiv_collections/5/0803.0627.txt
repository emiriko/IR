The possibility of thermal and quantum fluctuations induced attractive
interaction leading to a pairing gap \Delta_tq in the single-particle spectrum
of d-p model in the limit of a large N of fermion flavor is investigated
analytically. This is an anomalous pairing gap in addition to the one with
d-wave symmetry originating from partially screened, inter-site coulomb
interaction. The motivation was to search for a hierarchy of multiple many-body
interaction scales in high-Tc superconductor as suggested by recent
experimental findings. The pairing gap anisotropy stems from more than one
sources, namely, nearest neighbour hoppings and the p-d hybridization but not
the coupling of the effective interaction. The temperature at which \Delta_tq
vanishes may be driven to zero by using a tuning parameter to have access to
quantum criticality only when N >> 1. For the physical case N = 2, the usual
coherent quasi-particle feature surfaces in the spectral weight everywhere in
the momentum space below the pairing gap \Delta_tq. Thus it appears that the
reduction in spin degeneracy has the effect of masking quantum criticality.
