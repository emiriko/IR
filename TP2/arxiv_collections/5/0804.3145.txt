It is known for quite some time that approximate density functional (ADF)
theories fail disastrously when describing the dis-sociative symmetric radical
cations R2+. Considering this dissociation limit, previous work has shown that
Hartree-Fock (HF) theory favors the R+1--R0 charge distribution while DF
approximations favor the R+0.5 -- R+0.5. Yet, general quantum mechanical
principles indicate that both these (as well as all intermediate) average
charge distributions are asymptotically energy degenerate. Thus HF and ADF
theories mistakenly break the symmetry but in a contradicting way. In this
letter we show how to construct system-dependent long-range corrected (LC)
density functionals that can successfully treat this class of molecules,
avoiding the spurious symmetry breaking. Examples and comparisons to
experimental data is given for R=H, He and Ne and it is shown that the new LC
theory improves considerably the theoretical description of the R2+ bond
properties, the long range form of the asymptotic potential curve as well as
the atomic polarizability. The broader impact of this finding is discussed as
well and it is argued that the widespread semi-empirical approach which
advocates treating the LC parameter as a system-independent parameter is in
fact inappropriate under general circumstances.
