We present measurements of the branching fraction and time-dependent CP
asymmetries in B0->J/Psi pi0 decays based on 466 million Y(4S)->BBbar events
collected with the BaBar detector at the SLAC PEP-II asymmetric-energy B
factory. We measure the CP asymmetry parameters
  S=-1.23 +/- 0.21 +/- 0.04 and C=-0.20 +/- 0.19 +/- 0.03, where the measured
value of S is 4.0 standard deviations from zero including systematic
uncertainties. The branching fraction is determined to be
  B(B0->J/Psi pi0)=(1.69 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.07)*10^{-5}.
