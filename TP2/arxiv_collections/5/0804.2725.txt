The electrical resistivity for a current moving perpendicular to layers
(chains) in quasi-2D (quasi-1D) metals under an applied magnetic field of
varying orientation is studied using Boltzmann transport theory. We consider
the simplest non-trivial quasi-2D and quasi-1D Fermi surfaces but allow for an
arbitrary elastic collision integral (i.e., a scattering probability with
arbitrary dependence on momentum-transfer) and obtain an expression for the
resistivity which generalizes that previously found using a single
relaxation-time approximation. The dependence of the resistivity on the angle
between the magnetic field and current changes depending on the
momentum-dependence of the scattering probability. So, whereas zero-field
intra-layer transport is sensitive only to the momentum-averaged scattering
probability (the transport relaxation rate) the resistivity perpendicular to
layers measured in a tilted magnetic field provides detailed information about
the momentum-dependence of interlayer scattering. These results help clarify
the meaning of the relaxation rate determined from fits of angular-dependent
magnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO) experimental data to theoretical
expressions. Furthermore, we suggest how AMRO might be used to probe the
dominant scattering mechanism.
