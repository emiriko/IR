The NA48/2 experiment at the CERN SPS carried out data taking in 2003 and
2004. Analysis of the selected data samples of 7,146 $K^\pm\to\pi^\pm e^+e^-$
decay candidates with 0.6% background, 1,164 $K^\pm\to\pi^\pm\gamma\gamma$
candidates with 3.3% background, and 120 $K^\pm\to\pi^\pm\gamma e^+e^-$
candidates with 6.1% background allowed precise measurements of branching
fractions and other characteristics of these rare kaon decays.
