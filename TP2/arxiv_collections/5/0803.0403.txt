Quantum systems with real energies generated by an apparently non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian may re-acquire the consistent probabilistic interpretation via an
ad hoc metric which specifies the set of observables in the updated Hilbert
space of states. The recipe is extended here to quantum toboggans. In the first
step the tobogganic integration path is rectified and the Schroedinger equation
is given the generalized eigenvalue-problem form. In the second step the
general double-series representation of the eligible metric operators is
derived.
