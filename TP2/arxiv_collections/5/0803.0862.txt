We present a very fast implementation of the Butler-Portugal algorithm for
index canonicalization with respect to permutation symmetries. It is called
xPerm, and has been written as a combination of a Mathematica package and a C
subroutine. The latter performs the most demanding parts of the computations
and can be linked from any other program or computer algebra system. We
demonstrate with tests and timings the effectively polynomial performance of
the Butler-Portugal algorithm with respect to the number of indices, though we
also show a case in which it is exponential. Our implementation handles generic
tensorial expressions with several dozen indices in hundredths of a second, or
one hundred indices in a few seconds, clearly outperforming all other current
canonicalizers. The code has been already under intensive testing for several
years and has been essential in recent investigations in large-scale tensor
computer algebra.
