The main goal of this paper is to extend and apply the principle of maximum
entropy (MaxEnt) to incomplete quantum process estimation tasks. We will define
a so-called process entropy function being the von Neumann entropy of the state
associated with the quantum process via Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. It will
be shown that an arbitrary process estimation experiment can be reformulated in
a unified framework and MaxEnt principle can be consistently exploited. We will
argue that the suggested choice for the process entropy satisfies natural list
of properties and it reduces to the state MaxEnt principle, if applied to
preparator devices.
