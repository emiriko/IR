The search for MSSM Higgs bosons will be an important goal at the LHC. In
order to analyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the charged MSSM
Higgs bosons, we combine the latest results for the CMS experimental
sensitivities based on full simulation studies with state-of-the-art
theoretical predictions of MSSM Higgs-boson production and decay properties.
The experimental analyses are done assuming an integrated luminosity of 30
fb^-1 for the two cases M_H+- < m_t and M_H+- > m_t. The results are
interpreted as 5 sigma discovery contours in M_H+- - tan_beta planes of the
MSSM for various benchmark scenarios. We study the dependence of the 5 sigma
contours on the variation of the relevant SUSY parameters. Particular emphasis
is put on analyzing the variation of the discovery contours with the Higgs
mixing parameter mu. The variation of mu can shift the prospective discovery
reach in tan_beta by up to Delta tan_beta = 40.
