Mobile devices, like sensor networks and MEMS actuators use mobile power
supplies to ensure energy for their operation. These are mostly batteries. The
lifetime of the devices depends on the power consumption and on the quality and
capacitance of the battery. Though the integrated circuits and their power
consumption improve continually, their clock frequency also increases with the
time, and the resultant power consumption seems not to vary, or slightly
increase. On the other hand, the properties of batteries are developing much
slower, necessitating the optimization of their usage on system level.
