In 1922 Ritt described polynomial solutions of the functional equation
P(f)=Q(g). In this paper we describe solutions of the equation above in the
case when P,Q are polynomials while f,g are allowed to be arbitrary entire
functions. In fact, we describe solutions of the more general functional
equation s=P(f)=Q(g), where s,f,g are entire functions and P,Q are arbitrary
rational functions. Besides, we solve the problem of description of "strong
uniqueness polynomials" for entire functions.
