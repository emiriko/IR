Near band-gap luminescence (hnu > 5 eV) of hexagonal boron nitride has been
studied by means of the time- and energy-resolved photoluminescence
spectroscopy method. Two emissions have been observed at 5.5 eV and 5.3 eV. The
high-energy emission at 5.5 eV is composed of fixed sub-bands assigned to bound
excitons at 5.47 eV, 5.56 eV and 5.61 eV. The non-structured low-energy
emission at 5.3 eV undergoes a large blue shift (up to 120 meV) with a linear
slope <1 with increasing excitation energy Eexc. At Eexc>5.7 eV, the band
position is fixed and marks the transition from the Raman to the
photoluminescence regime. We assign the 5.3 eV band to quasi donor-acceptor
pair (q-DAP) states due to electrostatic band fluctuations induced by charged
defects. The shift is explained by photo-induced neutralization of charged
defect states. The absence of contribution to the q-DAP luminescence from
exciton suggests the existence of a large exciton binding energy, which is
qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions.
