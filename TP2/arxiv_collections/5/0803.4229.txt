We present a systematical study on the kaon electromagnetic form factors
$F_{K^{\pm},K^0,\bar{K}^0}(Q^2)$ within the $k_T$ factorization formalism,
where the transverse momentum effects, the contributions from the different
helicity components and different twist structures of the kaon light-cone (LC)
wave function are carefully analyzed for giving a well understanding of the
hard contributions at the energy region where pQCD is applicable. The right
power behavior of the hard contribution from the higher helicity components and
from the higher twist structures can be obtained by keeping the $k_T$
dependence in the hard amplitude. Our results show that the $k_T$ dependence in
LC wave function affects the hard and soft contributions substantially and the
power-suppressed terms (twist-3 and higher helicity components) make an
important contribution below $Q^2\sim several GeV^2$ although they drop fast as
$Q^2$ increasing. The parameters of the proposed model wave function can be
fixed by the first two moments of its distribution amplitude and other
conditions. By varying the first two moments $a^K_1(1GeV)$ and $a^K_2(1GeV)$
with the region of $0.05\pm0.02$ and $0.10\pm 0.05$ respectively, we find that
the uncertainty of the kaon electromagnetic form factor is rather small.
