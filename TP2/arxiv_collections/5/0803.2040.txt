The electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) sector of the Standard Model can be
far richer and more interesting than the usual single scalar doublet model. We
explore scenarios where the EWSB sector is nearly scale invariant and
consequently gives rise to a light CP even scalar particle. The one-doublet SM
is in that category, as are many other models with either weakly or strongly
coupled sectors that trigger EWSB. We study the couplings of the light scalar
to the SM particles that can arise from the explicit breaking of scale
invariance focusing on the possible differences with the minimal SM. The
couplings of the light scalar to light fermions, as well as to the massless
gauge bosons, can be significantly enhanced. We find possible new discovery
channels due to the decays of the conformal scalar into e^+e^- and mu^+mu^-
pairs as well as new production channels via light quark annihilation.
