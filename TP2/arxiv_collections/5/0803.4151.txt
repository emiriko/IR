Recent microscopic calculation based on the density functional theory
predicts long-lived superheavy elements in a variety of shapes, including
spherical, axial and triaxial configurations. Only when N=184 is approached one
expects superheavy nuclei that are spherical in their ground states. Magic
islands of extra-stability have been predicted to be around Z=114, 124 or, 126
with N=184, and Z=120, with N=172. However, the question of whether the
fission-survived superheavy nuclei with high Z and N would live long enough for
detection or, undergo alpha-decay in a very short time remains open. In this
talk I shall present results of our calculations of alpha-decay half lives of
heavy and superheavy nuclei. Calculations, carried out in a WKB framework using
density-dependent M3Y interaction, have been found to reproduce the
experimental data quite well. Fission survived Sg nuclei with Z=106, N=162 is
predicted to have the highest alpha-decay half life (~3.2 hrs) in the
Z=106-108, N=160-164 region called, small island/peninsula. Neutron-rich (N
>170) superheavy nuclei with Z >118 are found to have half-lives of the order
of microseconds or, less.
