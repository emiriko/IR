Canonical description of the D=10 superstring action involving supertwistor
variables generalizing Penrose-Ferber supertwistors is developed. Primary and
secondary constraints are identified and arranged into the first- and
second-class sets. Dirac brackets are introduced and the deformation of the
Poisson bracket algebra of the first-class constraints is studied. The role of
the deformation parameter is played by alpha'.
