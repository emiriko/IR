We investigate infinite-order phase transitions like the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition observed in a triangular-lattice
three-spin interaction model. Based on a field theoretical description and the
operator-production-expansion technique, we perform the renormalization-group
analysis, and then clarify properties of marginal operators near the phase
transition points. The results are utilized to establish criteria to determine
the transition points and some universal relations among excitation levels to
characterize the transitions. We verify these predictions via the numerical
analysis on eigenvalue structures of the transfer matrix. Also, we discuss an
enhancement of symmetry at the end points of a critical intermediate phase in
connection with a transition observed in the ground state of the
bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain.
