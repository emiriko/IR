We study the quantum spin pumping of an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain with
competing exchange interactions. We show that spatially periodic potential
modulated in space and time acts as a quantum spin pump. In our model system,
an applied electric field causes a spin gap to its critical ground state by
introducing bond-alternation exchange interactions. We study quantum spin
pumping at different quantized magnetization states and also explain physically
the presence and absence of quantum spin pumping at different fractionally
quantized magnetization states.
