We investigate the effects of the adiabatic loading of optical lattices to
the temperature by applying the mean-field approximation to the
three-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model at finite temperatures. We compute the
lattice-height dependence of the isentropic curves for the given initial
temperatures in case of the homogeneous system i.e., neglecting the trapping
potential. Taking the unit of temperatures as the recoil energy, the adiabatic
cooling/heating through superfluid (SF) - normal (N) phase transition is
clearly understood. It is found that the cooling occurs in SF phase while the
heating occurs in N phase and the efficiency of adibatic cooling/heating is
higher at higher temperatures. We also explain how its behavior can be
understood from the lattice-hight dependence of dispersion relation in each
phase. Furthermore, the connection of the adiabatic heating/cooling between the
cases with/without the trapping potential is discussed.
