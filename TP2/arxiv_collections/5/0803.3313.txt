The inclusive reaction $p A \to pK^0_s + X$ was studied at IHEP accelerator
with $70 GeV/c$ proton beam using SVD-2 detector. Two different samples of
$K^0_s$, statistically independent and belonging to different phase space
regions, were used in the analyses and a narrow baryon resonance with the mass
$M=1523\pm 2(stat.)\pm 3(syst.) MeV/c^2$ was observed in both samples of the
data. The combined statistical significance was estimated to be of 8.0 (392
signal over 1990 background events). Using the part of events reconstructed
with better accuracy the width of resonance was constrained to $\Gamma < 14
MeV/c^2$ at 95% C.L. The $x_F$ distribution was found to have a peak at zero
with {$<|x_F|> \approx 0.1$}, that qualitatively agrees to a Regge-based model
predictions. A new cross section estimate of $\sigma \cdot BR(\Theta^+ \to
pK^0) = 4.9 \pm 1.0(stat.) \pm 1.5(syst.) \mu b/nucleon$ for $x_F > 0$ was
obtained.
