We introduce a notion of super-potential (canonical function) associated to
positive closed (p,p)-currents on compact Kaehler manifolds and we develop a
calculus on such currents. One of the key points in our study is the use of
deformations in the space of currents. As an application, we obtain several
results on the dynamics of holomorphic automorphisms: regularity and uniqueness
of the Green currents. We also get the regularity, the entropy, the ergodicity
and the hyperbolicity of the equilibrium measures.
