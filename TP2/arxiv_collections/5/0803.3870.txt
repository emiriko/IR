In this paper we derive the equations characterizing the boundary layer which
describes the transition of the distribution function of a gas of weakly
interacting bosons to the distribution function of the gas in the presence of a
Bose-Einstein condensate. To this end, we first rederive the classical
Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation taking as a starting point the dynamics of a system
of many weakly interacting quantum particles. The solutions of the
Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation yield blow-up in finite time. Near the blow-up time
the approximations used to derive the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation break down. We
derive the set of equations that describe the building of correlations and the
onset of quantum interference effects for the many-particle hamiltonian system
under the assumption that the blow-up for the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation takes
place in a self-similar form.
