We put forward a new CNOT gate scheme with atoms and ions based on quantum
interrogation and a bosonic particle extension of the models of linear optics
quantum computation. We show how the possibility of particle collision can
provide the strong interaction that is needed for universal quantum gates. Two
atom optics proposals are provided. Unlike previous schemes, these gates are at
the same time nondestructive, valid for arbitrary inputs and can work with a
probability as close to unity as desired in the lossless case. Data is encoded
into position modes and the gates only require basic atom optics elements,
which gives potentially simpler quantum computer implementations.
