Quantum entanglement, a fundamental property ensuring security of key
distribution and efficiency of quantum computing, is extremely sensitive to
decoherence. Different procedures have been developed in order to recover
entanglement after propagation over a noisy channel. However, besides a certain
amount of noise, entanglement is completely lost. In this case the channel is
called entanglement breaking and any multi-copy distillation methods cannot
help to restore even a bit of entanglement. We report the experimental
realization of a new method which restores entanglement from a single photon
entanglement breaking channel. The method based on measurement of environmental
light and quantum feed-forward correction can reveal entanglement even if this
one completely disappeared. This protocol provides new elements to overcome
decoherence effects.
