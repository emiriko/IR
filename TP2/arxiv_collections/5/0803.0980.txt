Let $B$ be a Blaschke product. We prove in several different ways the corona
theorem for the algebra $H^\infty_B:=\mC+BH^\infty$. That is, we show the
equivalence of the classical {\em corona condition} on data $f_1, ..., f_n \in
H^\infty_B$:
  \[ \forall z \in \mD, \sum_{k=1}^{n} |f_k(z)| \geq \delta >0, \] and the {\em
solvability of the Bezout equation} for $g_1, ..., g_n \in H^\infty_B$: \[
\forall z\in \mD, \sum_{k=1}^n g_k (z)f_k(z)=1. \] Estimates on solutions to
the Bezout equation are also obtained. We also show that the Bass stable rank
of $H^\infty_B$ is 1. Let $A(\mD)_B$ be the subalgebra of all elements from
$H^\infty_B$ having a continuous extension to the closed unit disk $\bar{\mD}$.
Analogous results are obtained also for $A(\mD)_B$.
