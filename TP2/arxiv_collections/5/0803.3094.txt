We consider an ergodic invariant measure $\mu$ for a smooth action of $Z^k$,
$k \ge 2$, on a $(k+1)$-dimensional manifold or for a locally free smooth
action of $R^k$, $k \ge 2$ on a $(2k+1)$-dimensional manifold. We prove that if
$\mu$ is hyperbolic with the Lyapunov hyperplanes in general position and if
one element of the action has positive entropy, then $\mu$ is absolutely
continuous. The main ingredient is absolute continuity of conditional measures
on Lyapunov foliations which holds for a more general class of smooth actions
of higher rank abelian groups.
