In a recent Comment (arXiv:0710.0018), Maitra, Burke, and van Leeuwen (MBL)
attempt to refute our criticism of the foundations of TDDFT (see Phys. Rev. A
75, 022513 (2007)). However, their arguments miss the essence of our position.
This is mainly due to an ambiguity concerning the meaning of the so-called
mapping derivation of time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations. We distinguish two
different conceptions, referred to as potential-functional based fixed-point
iteration (PF-FPI) and direct Kohn-Sham potential (DKSP) scheme, respectively.
We argue that the DKSP scheme, apparently adopted by MBL, is not a
density-functional method at all. The PF-FPI concept, on the other hand, while
legitimately predicated on the Runge-Gross mapping theorem, is invalid because
the convergence of the fixed-point iteration is not assured.
