In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. D 68, 034017 (2003)], we investigated the
inclusive production of prompt J/psi mesons in polarized hadron-hadron,
photon-hadron, and photon-photon collisions in the factorization formalism of
nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics providing compact analytic results for
the double longitudinal-spin asymmetry A_{LL}. For convenience, we adopted a
simplified expression for the tensor product of the gluon polarization
four-vector with its charge conjugate, at the expense of allowing for ghost and
anti-ghosts to appear as external particles. While such ghost contributions
cancel in the cross section asymmetry A_{LL} and thus were not listed in our
previous paper, they do contribute to the absolute cross sections. For
completeness and the reader's convenience, they are provided in this addendum.
