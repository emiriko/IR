Lie algebras of smooth sections are Lie algebras obtained from bundles of Lie
algebras, where the latter are vector bundles of which the fibers are Lie
algebras. We also consider the $\operatorname{C}^k$-sections for $k \in
\mathbb{N}$. This paper studies the derivations, the centroid and the
isomorphisms of such Lie algebras and generalizes some facts from Pierre
Lecomte's publications in 1979 and 1980 to the case where the fiber is perfect
or centerfree and it gives some more explicit proofs.
