The purpose of this paper is to examine the possible existence or
construction of traversable wormholes supported by generalized Chaplygin gas
(GCG) by starting with a general line element and the Einstein tensor, together
with the equation of state, thereby continuing an earlier study by the author
of wormholes supported by phantom energy. Numerical techniques are used to
demonstrate the existence of wormhole spacetimes that (1) meet the flare-out
conditions at the throat, (2) are traversable by humanoid travelers, thanks to
low tidal forces and short proper distances near the throat, and (3) are
asymptotically flat. There appears to be an abundance of solutions that avoid
an event horizon, suggesting the possibility of naturally occurring wormholes.
