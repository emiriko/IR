We propose an extended quantum theory, in which the number K of parameters
necessary to characterize a quantum state behaves as fourth power of the number
N of distinguishable states. As the simplex of classical N-point probability
distributions can be embedded inside a higher dimensional convex body of mixed
quantum states, one can further increase the dimensionality constructing the
set of extended quantum states. The embedding proposed corresponds to an
assumption that the physical system described in N dimensional Hilbert space is
coupled with an auxiliary subsystem of the same dimensionality. The extended
theory works for simple quantum systems and is shown to be a non-trivial
generalisation of the standard quantum theory for which K=N^2. Imposing certain
restrictions on initial conditions and dynamics allowed in the quartic theory
one obtains quadratic theory as a special case. By imposing even stronger
constraints one arrives at the classical theory, for which K=N.
