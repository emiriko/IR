We discuss relations and differences between two methods for the construction
of unitarily transformed effective interactions, the Similarity Renormalization
Group (SRG) and Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM). The aim of both
methods is to construct a soft phase-shift equivalent effective interaction
which is well suited for many-body calculations in limited model spaces. After
contrasting the two conceptual frameworks, we establish a formal connection
between the initial SRG-generator and the static generators of the UCOM
transformation. Furthermore we propose a mapping procedure to extract UCOM
correlation functions from the SRG evolution. We compare the effective
interactions resulting from the UCOM-transformation and the SRG-evolution on
the level of matrix elements, in no-core shell model calculations of light
nuclei, and in Hartree-Fock calculations up to 208-Pb. Both interactions
exhibit very similar convergence properties in light nuclei but show a
different systematic behavior as function of particle number.
