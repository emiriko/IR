This note tells you how to construct a k(n)-dimensional family of
(isomorphism classes of) irreducible representations of dimension n for the
three string braid group B_3, where k(n) is an admissible function of your
choosing; for example take k(n) = [ n/2 ] +1 as in arXiv:0803.2778 and
arXiv:0803.2785.
