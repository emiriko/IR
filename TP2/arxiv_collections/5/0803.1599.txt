Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) magnetometry is one of the most widely
employed techniques for the characterization of ferromagnetic thin-film
samples. Some information, such as coercive fields or anisotropy strengths can
be obtained without any knowledge of the optical and magneto-optical (MO)
properties of the material. On the other hand, a quantitative analysis, which
requires a precise knowledge of the material's index of refraction n and the MO
coupling constants K and G is often desirable, for instance for the comparison
of samples, which are different with respect to ferromagnetic layer
thicknesses, substrates, or capping layers. While the values of the parameters
n and the linear MO coupling parameter K reported by different authors usually
vary considerably, the relevant quadratic MO coupling parameters G of Fe are
completely unknown. Here, we report on measurements of the thickness dependence
(0-60nm) of the linear and quadratic MOKE in epitaxial bcc-Fe(001) wedge-type
samples performed at a commonly used laser wavelength of 670nm. By fitting the
thickness dependence we are able to extract a complete set of parameters n, K,
(G11 - G12), and G44 for the quantitative description of the MOKE of
bcc-Fe(001). We find sizable different n, K, and G parameters for films thinner
than about 10nm as compared to thicker films, which is indicative of a
thickness dependence of the electronic properties or of surface contributions
to the MOKE. The effect size of the quadratic MOKE is found to be about a third
of the record values recently reported for Co2FeSi.
