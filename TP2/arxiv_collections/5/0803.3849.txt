We consider the Hawking radiation from two regular black holes, the minimal
model and the noncommutative black hole. The flux of Hawking radiation is
derived by applying the anomaly cancellation method proposed by Robinson and
Wilczek. Two regular black holes have the same radiation pattern except for the
detailed expression for the Hawking temperature. The resulting flux of the
energy-momentum tensor is shown to be precisely the same with the thermal flux
from each regular black hole at the Hawking temperature.
