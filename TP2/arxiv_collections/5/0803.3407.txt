We study the effect of conformations on charge transport in a thin elastic
tube. Using the Kirchhoff model for a tube with any given Poisson ratio,
cross-sectional shape and intrinsic twist, we obtain a class of exact solutions
for its conformation. The tube's torsion is found in terms of its intrinsic
twist and its Poisson ratio, while its curvature satisfies a nonlinear
differential equation which supports exact {\it periodic} solutions in the form
of Jacobi elliptic functions, which we call {\it conformon lattice} solutions.
These solutions typically describe conformations with loops. Each solution
induces a corresponding quantum effective {\it periodic} potential in the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation for an electron in the tube. The wave function
describes the delocalization of the electron along the central axis of the
tube. We discuss some possible applications of this novel mechanism of charge
transport.
