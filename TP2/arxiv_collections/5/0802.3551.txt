A new family of 2-component vector-valued coherent states for the quantum
particle motion in an infinite square well potential is presented. They allow a
consistent quantization of the classical phase space and observables for a
particle in this potential. We then study the resulting position and
(well-defined) momentum operators. We also consider their mean values in
coherent states and their quantum dispersions.
