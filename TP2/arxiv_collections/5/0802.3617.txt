We go into the need for, and the requirements on, a formal theory of budgets.
We present a simple algebraic theory of rational budgets, i.e., budgets in
which amounts of money are specified by functions on the rational numbers. This
theory is based on the tuplix calculus. We go into the importance of using
totalized models for the rational numbers. We present a case study on the
educational budget of a university department offering master programs.
