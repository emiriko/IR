In this letter, we study the radiative heat transfer between two
nanoparticles in the near field and in the far field. We find that the heat
transfer is dominated by the electric dipole-dipole interaction for dielectric
particles and by the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction for metallic
nanoparticles. We introduce polarizabilities formulas valid for arbitrary
values of the skin depth. While the heat transfer mechanism is different for
metallic and dielectric nanoparticles, we show that the distance dependence is
the same. However, the dependence of the heat flux on the particle radius is
different.
