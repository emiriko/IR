Anomalous Values of Debye temperature have been obtained from Lamb Mossbauer
factor measurements of Ge-Se-Ag glasses. We show that this anomaly may arise
due to the presence of anharmonic potential at the high spin ferrous site. In
this paper, we use q Lamb Mossbauer factor and anharmonic Lamb Mossbauer factor
to study this anharmoncity.
