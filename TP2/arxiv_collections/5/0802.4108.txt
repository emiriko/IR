We report magnetic measurements up to 1200 K on multi-walled carbon nanotube
mats using Quantum Design vibrating sample magnetometer. Extensive magnetic
data consistently show two ferrromagnetic-like transitions at about 1000 K and
1275 K, respectively. The lower transition at about 1000 K is associated with
an Fe impurity phase and its saturation magnetization is in quantitative
agreement with the Fe concentration measured by an inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometer. On the other hand, the saturation magnetization for the
higher transition phase ($\geq$1.0 emu/g) is about four orders of magnitude
larger than that expected from the measured concentration of Co or CoFe, which
has a high enough Curie temperature to explain this high transition. We show
that this transition at about 1275 K is not consistent with a magnetic
proximity effect of Fe-carbon systems and ferromagnetism of any carbon-based
materials or magnetic impurities but with the paramagnetic Meissner effect due
to the existence of $\pi$ Josephson junctions in a granular superconductor.
