A detailed study of the di-boson Monte Carlo programs Pythia, MC@NLO and the
program of Baur, Han and Ohnemus (BHO) is performed. None of these programs
cover all aspects of di-boson production. The BHO code is used to produce event
weights emulating anomalous triple gauge couplings in Pythia and MC@NLO events.
In the same way, boson spin information which is missing for most di-boson
channels in MC@NLO can be introduced as well. This weighting code can be used
to study systematic effects related to various aspects of the Monte Carlo
generators, e.g. parton distribution functions. A detailed study comparing
distributions of event samples generated with these three generators shows a
nice agreement for events without jets. Some differences between the three
samples are observed for events with jets. Most of these differences can be
attributed to the different ways of jet production in the three programs.
