The use of artificial immune systems in intrusion detection is an appealing
concept for two reasons. Firstly, the human immune system provides the human
body with a high level of protection from invading pathogens, in a robust,
self-organised and distributed manner. Secondly, current techniques used in
computer security are not able to cope with the dynamic and increasingly
complex nature of computer systems and their security. It is hoped that
biologically inspired approaches in this area, including the use of
immune-based systems will be able to meet this challenge. Here we review the
algorithms used, the development of the systems and the outcome of their
implementation. We provide an introduction and analysis of the key developments
within this field, in addition to making suggestions for future research.
