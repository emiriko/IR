Dimensionality reduction is a topic of recent interest. In this paper, we
present the classification constrained dimensionality reduction (CCDR)
algorithm to account for label information. The algorithm can account for
multiple classes as well as the semi-supervised setting. We present an
out-of-sample expressions for both labeled and unlabeled data. For unlabeled
data, we introduce a method of embedding a new point as preprocessing to a
classifier. For labeled data, we introduce a method that improves the embedding
during the training phase using the out-of-sample extension. We investigate
classification performance using the CCDR algorithm on hyper-spectral satellite
imagery data. We demonstrate the performance gain for both local and global
classifiers and demonstrate a 10% improvement of the $k$-nearest neighbors
algorithm performance. We present a connection between intrinsic dimension
estimation and the optimal embedding dimension obtained using the CCDR
algorithm.
