We report on a series of experiments concerning the feasibility of example
driven modelling. The main aim was to establish experimentally within an
academic environment: the relationship between error and task complexity using
a) Traditional spreadsheet modelling; b) example driven techniques. We report
on the experimental design, sampling, research methods and the tasks set for
both control and treatment groups. Analysis of the completed tasks allows
comparison of several different variables. The experimental results compare the
performance indicators for the treatment and control groups by comparing
accuracy, experience, training, confidence measures, perceived difficulty and
perceived completeness. The various results are thoroughly tested for
statistical significance using: the Chi squared test, Fisher's exact test for
significance, Cochran's Q test and McNemar's test on difficulty.
