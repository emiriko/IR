In this work we consider the dynamical Casimir effect for a massless scalar
field -- under Dirichlet boundary conditions -- between two concentric
spherical shells. We obtain a general expression for the average number of
particle creation, for an arbitrary law of radial motion of the spherical
shells, using two distinct methods: by computing the density operator of the
system and by calculating the Bogoliubov coefficients. We apply our general
expression to breathing modes: when only one of the shells oscillates and when
both shells oscillate in or out of phase. We also analyze the number of
particle production and compare it with the results for the case of plane
geometry.
