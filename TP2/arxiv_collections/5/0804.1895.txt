We derive the polarization-dependent displacements parallel and perpendicular
to the plane of incidence, for a Gaussian light beam reflected from a planar
interface, taking into account the propagation of the beam. Using a
classical-optics formalism we show that beam propagation may greatly affect
both Goos-H\"{a}nchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts when the incident beam is
focussed.
