A central model in theoretical ecology considers the competition of a range
of species for a broad spectrum of resources. Recent studies have shown that
essentially two different outcomes are possible. Either the species surviving
competition are more or less uniformly distributed over the resource spectrum,
or their distribution is 'lumped' (or 'clumped'), consisting of clusters of
species with similar resource use that are separated by gaps in resource space.
Which of these outcomes will occur crucially depends on the competition kernel,
which reflects the shape of the resource utilization pattern of the competing
species. Most models considered in the literature assume a Gaussian competition
kernel. This is unfortunate, since predictions based on such a Gaussian
assumption are not robust. In fact, Gaussian kernels are a border case
scenario, and slight deviations from this function can lead to either uniform
or lumped species distributions. Here we illustrate the non-robustness of the
Gaussian assumption by simulating different implementations of the standard
competition model with constant carrying capacity. In this scenario, lumped
species distributions can come about by secondary ecological or evolutionary
mechanisms or by details of the numerical implementation of the model. We
analyze the origin of this sensitivity and discuss it in the context of recent
applications of the model.
