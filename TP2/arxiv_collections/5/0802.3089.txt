Functional aspects as well as the influence of integration technology on the
system behavior have to be considered in the 3D integration design process of
micro systems. Therefore, information from different physical domains has to be
provided to designers. Due to the variety of structures and effects of
different physical domains, efficient modeling approaches and simulation
algorithms have to be combined. The paper describes a modular approach which
covers detailed analysis with PDE solvers and model generation for system level
simulation.
