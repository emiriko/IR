In this paper, we first incorporate the weak interaction into the theory of
General Nonlocality by finding a appropriate metric for it. Accordingly, we
suggest the theoretical frame of General Nonlocality as the candidate theory of
unifying three microscope interactions in low energy limit. In this unifying
scenario, the essential role of photon field is stressed.
