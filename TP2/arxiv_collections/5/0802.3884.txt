This paper considers the question of whether Aryabhata's direct and indirect
references to relativity of motion are equivalent to Galilean Relativity.
Examining verses fom different sections of the text Aryabhatiya, we show that
there is explicit mention of relativity of space and motion, although there is
no explicit reference to the motion being uniform.
