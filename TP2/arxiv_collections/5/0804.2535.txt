This paper presents simple, syntactic strong normalization proofs for the
simply-typed lambda-calculus and the polymorphic lambda-calculus (system F)
with the full set of logical connectives, and all the permutative reductions.
The normalization proofs use translations of terms and types to systems, for
which strong normalization property is known.
