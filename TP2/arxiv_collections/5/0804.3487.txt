In this brief comment we attempt to clarify the apparent discrepancy between
the papers [1] and [2] on the quantum brachistochrone, namely whether it is
possible to use a judicious mixture of Hermitian and non-Hermitian quantum
mechanics to evade the standard lower limit on the time taken for evolution by
a Hermitian Hamiltonian with given energy dispersion between two given states.
