Photon plus jet production has been studied by the D0 and CDF experiments in
Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at a center of mass energy of
sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. Measurements of the inclusive photon plus jet, di-photon and
photon plus b jet cross section are presented. They are based on integrated
luminosities between 0.2 fb^-1 and 1.1 fb^-1. The results are compared to
perturbative QCD calculations in various approximations.
