The Schwarzschild space is one of the best studied spacetimes and its
exhaustive considerations are easily accessible. Nevertheless, by some reasons
it is still surrounded by a lot of misconceptions, myths, and "paradoxes". In
this pedagogical paper an attempt is made to give a simple (i. e., without
cumbersome calculations), but rigorous consideration to the relevant questions.
I argue that 1) an observer falling into a Schwarzschild black hole will
\emph{not} see "the entire history of the universe" 2) he will \emph{not} cross
the horizon at the speed of light 3) when inside the hole, he will \emph{not}
see the (future) singularity and 4) the latter is \emph{not} "central".
