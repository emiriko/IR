What if only a light Higgs boson is discovered at the CERN LHC?
  Conventional wisdom tells us that the scattering of longitudinal weak gauge
bosons would not grow strong at high energies. We show that this is not always
true. In some composite models, two-Higgs-doublet models, or even
supersymmetric models, the presence of a light Higgs boson does not guarantee
the complete unitarization of the $WW$ scattering. After the partial
unitarization by the light Higgs boson, the $WW$ scattering becomes strongly
interacting until it hits one or more heavier Higgs bosons or other strong
dynamics. We analyze how the LHC experiments can reveal this interesting
possibility of partially strong $WW$ scattering.
