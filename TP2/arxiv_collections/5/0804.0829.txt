We analyze a biophysical model of a neuron from the entorhinal cortex that
includes persistent sodium and slow potassium as non-standard currents using
reduction of dimension and dynamical systems techniques to determine the
mechanisms for the generation of mixed-mode oscillations. We have found that
the standard spiking currents (sodium and potassium) play a critical role in
the analysis of the interspike interval. To study the mixed-mode oscillations,
the six dimensional model has been reduced to a three dimensional model for the
subthreshold regime. Additional transformations and a truncation have led to a
simplified model system with three timescales that retains many properties of
the original equations, and we employ this system to elucidate the underlying
structure and explain a novel mechanism for the generation of mixed-mode
oscillations based on the canard phenomenon. In particular, we prove the
existence of a special solution, a singular primary canard, that serves as a
transition between mixed-mode oscillations and spiking in the singular limit by
employing appropriate rescalings, center manifold reductions, and energy
arguments. Additionally, we conjecture that the singular canard solution is the
limit of a family of canards and provide numerical evidence for the conjecture.
