We consider the Ising model on a cylindrical lattice of L columns, with
fixed-spin boundary conditions on the top and bottom rows. The spontaneous
magnetization can be written in terms of partition functions on this lattice.
We show how we can use the Clifford algebra of Kaufman to write these partition
functions in terms of L by L determinants, and then further reduce them to m by
m determinants, where m is approximately L/2. In this form the results can be
compared with those of the Ising case of the superintegrable chiral Potts
model. They point to a way of calculating the spontaneous magnetization of that
more general model algebraically.
