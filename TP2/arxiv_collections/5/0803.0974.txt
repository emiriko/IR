New THz data on the optical conductivity of Pb are presented as well as a
detailed Eliashberg analysis with particular emphasis on phonon-assisted
processes not included in a BCS approach. Consideration of the optical
self-energy instead of the conductivity itself helps highlight the differences
with BCS predictions. Predicted coherence peaks are observed in the optical
scattering rates. Impurities enhance the optical effective mass at zero
frequency by an order of magnitude and induce a large peak at twice the gap in
agreement with theory. This work illustrates the usefulness of the optical
self-energy for the analysis of data.
