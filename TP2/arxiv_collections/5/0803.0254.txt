Superconductivity in graphite intercalated compounds has been studied for
more than 40 years and it is still not fully understood, despite the recent
progress and the discovery of relatively high Tc superconductivity in CaC6 and
YbC6. Recent studies now suggest that the electron-phonon coupling is most
likely responsible for pairing and that the intercalant-derived electronic
states and vibrations play the dominant role. Here, we present the first
studies of electronic structure in CaC6, a superconductor with Tc=11.6 K. Using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find that, contrary to
theoretical models, the EPC on the graphene-derived Fermi sheets is
surprisingly strong, reflecting the interaction with high-frequency
graphene-derived vibrations. Thus, in addition to the amazing properties in the
charge-neutral state, graphene sheets also show surprises in the heavily doped
regime: they may support strong pairing interactions and lead to
superconductivity in compounds in which they are building blocks.
