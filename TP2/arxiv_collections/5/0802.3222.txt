We present a continuous-time Monte Carlo method for quantum impurity models,
which combines a weak-coupling expansion with an auxiliary-field decomposition.
The method is considerably more efficient than Hirsch-Fye and free of time
discretization errors, and is particularly useful as impurity solver in large
cluster dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations.
