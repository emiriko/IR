We study the oscillation frequencies and radiative decay rates of surface
plasmon modes of a simple-metal sphere as a function of sphere radius without
any assumptions concerning the sphere size. We re-examine within the framework
of classical electrodynamics the usual expectations for multipolar plasmon
frequency in the so called "low radius limit" of the classical picture.
