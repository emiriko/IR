We show that transmutation of linear momentum into position may occur in a
system of three magnetic vortices thanks to a direct link between topology and
dynamics in a ferromagnet. This happens via exchange between the linear
momentum of a vortex-antivortex pair and the position of a single vortex during
a semi-elastic scattering process. Vortex polarity switching occurs in the case
of inelastic collisions.
