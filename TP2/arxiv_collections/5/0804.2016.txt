The structural control of silicon nanocrystals is an important technological
problem. Typically a distribution of nanocrystal sizes and shapes emerges under
the uncontrolled aggregation of smaller clusters. The aim of this computational
study is to investigate the evolution of the nanocrystal electronic states and
their optical properties throughout their aggregation stages. To realistically
tackle such systems, an atomistic electronic structure tool is required that
can accommodate about tens of thousand nanocrystal and embedding lattice atoms
with very irregular shapes. For this purpose, a computationally-efficient
pseudopotential-based electronic structure tool is developed that can handle
realistic nanostructures based on the expansion of the wavefunction of the
aggregate in terms of bulk Bloch bands of the constituent semiconductors. With
this tool, the evolution of the electronic states as well as the
polarization-dependent absorption spectra correlated with the oscillator
strengths over their aggregation stages are traced. The low-lying aggregate
nanocrystal states develop binding and anti-binding counterparts of the
isolated states. Such information may become instrumental with the maturity of
the controlled aggregation of these nanocrystals.
