We show the formation of slow optical solitons in the asymmetric coupled
double quantum-wells (CQW) via a two-photon Raman resonance. With the
consideration of real parameters in AlGaAs-based CQW, we indicate the
possibility to have cancellation of the linear absorption and giant Kerr
nonlinearities. With the controllable balance between dispersion and nonlinear
effects in these solid-state based devices, this work may provide a practical
platform for nonlinear optical signal processing.
