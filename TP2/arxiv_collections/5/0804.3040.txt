There has been a recent resurgence of experimental efforts to quantitatively
determine the phase diagram of the Bose Hubbard model by carefully analyzing
experiments with ultracold bosonic atoms on an optical lattice. In many
realizations of these experiments, the hopping amplitudes are not homogeneous
throughout the lattice, but instead, the lattice has an anisotropy where
hopping along one direction is not exactly equal to hopping along a
perpendicular direction. In this contribution, we examine how an anisotropy in
the hopping matrix elements affects the Mott lobes of the Bose Hubbard model.
For weak anisotropy, we find the phase diagram is only slightly modified when
expressed in terms of the average hopping, while for strong anisotropy, one
expects to ultimately see dimensional crossover effects.
