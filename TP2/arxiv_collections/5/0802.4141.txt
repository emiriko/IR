We shall provide in this paper good deal pricing bounds for contingent claims
induced by the shortfall risk with some loss function. Assumptions we impose on
loss functions and contingent claims are very mild. We prove that the upper and
lower bounds of good deal pricing bounds are expressed by convex risk measures
on Orlicz hearts. In addition, we obtain its representation with the minimal
penalty function. Moreover, we give a representation, for two simple cases, of
good deal bounds and calculate the optimal strategies when a claim is traded at
the upper or lower bounds of its good deal pricing bound.
