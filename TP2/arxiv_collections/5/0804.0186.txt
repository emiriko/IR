The electron-phonon coupling of LaO$_{1-x}$F$_x$FeAs is re-investigated on
the basis of density functional theory in local density approximation. The
implications of the $(\pi,\pi)$ nesting of the Fermi surfaces are carefully
studied and found to lead to a non-standard electron-phonon coupling of the
corresponding Fe in-plane breathing mode, which might make a strong
contribution to the high superconducting transition temperature. The
semi-metallic behavior of the undoped material is also further illuminated.
