We have performed an extensive ab initio LDA and LSDA+U calculations of
electronic structure of newly discovered high-temperature superconducting
series ReO(1-x)F(x)FeAs (Re=La,Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and hypothetical case of Re=Y).
In all cases we obtain almost identical electronic spectrum (both energy
dispersions and the densities of states) in rather wide energy interval (about
2 eV) around the Fermi level. We also debate that this fact is unlikely to be
changed by the account of strong correlations. It leads inevitably to the same
critical temperature Tc of superconducting transition in any theoretical
BCS-like mechanism of Cooper pair formation. We argue that the experimentally
observed variations of Tc for different rare-earth substitutions are either due
to disorder effects or less probably because of possible changes in
spin-fluctuation spectrum of FeAs layers caused by magnetic interactions with
rare-earth spins in ReO layers.
