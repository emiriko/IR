Language emergence and evolution has recently gained growing attention
through multi-agent models and mathematical frameworks to study their behavior.
Here we investigate further the Naming Game, a model able to account for the
emergence of a shared vocabulary of form-meaning associations through
social/cultural learning. Due to the simplicity of both the structure of the
agents and their interaction rules, the dynamics of this model can be analyzed
in great detail using numerical simulations and analytical arguments. This
paper first reviews some existing results and then presents a new overall
understanding.
