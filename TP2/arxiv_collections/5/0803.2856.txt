The recognition, involvement, and description of main actors influences the
story line of the whole text. This is of higher importance as the text per se
represents a flow of words and expressions that once it is read it is lost. In
this respect, the understanding of a text and moreover on how the actor exactly
behaves is not only a major concern: as human beings try to store a given input
on short-term memory while associating diverse aspects and actors with
incidents, the following approach represents a virtual architecture, where
collocations are concerned and taken as the associative completion of the
actors' acting. Once that collocations are discovered, they become managed in
separated memory blocks broken down by the actors. As for human beings, the
memory blocks refer to associative mind-maps. We then present several priority
functions to represent the actual temporal situation inside a mind-map to
enable the user to reconstruct the recent events from the discovered temporal
results.
