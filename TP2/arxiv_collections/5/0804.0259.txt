Smoothed Wigner transforms have been used in signal processing, as a
regularized version of the Wigner transform, and have been proposed as an
alternative to it in the homogenization and / or semiclassical limits of wave
equations. We derive explicit, closed formulations for the coarse-scale
representation of the action of pseudodifferential operators. The resulting
``smoothed operators'' are in general of infinite order. The formulation of an
appropriate framework, resembling the Gelfand-Shilov spaces, is necessary.
Similarly we treat the ``smoothed Wigner calculus''. In particular this allows
us to reformulate any linear equation, as well as certain nonlinear ones (e.g.
Hartree and cubic non-linear Schr\"odinger), as coarse-scale phase-space
equations (e.g. smoothed Vlasov), with spatial and spectral resolutions
controlled by two free parameters. Finally, it is seen that the smoothed Wigner
calculus can be approximated, uniformly on phase-space, by differential
operators in the semiclassical regime. This improves the respective
weak-topology approximation result for the Wigner calculus.
