We investigate the properties and the microscopic structure of
superconductivity (SC), coexisting and sharing the common conducting band with
density wave (DW). Such coexistence may take place when the nesting of the
Fermi surface (FS) is not perfect, and in the DW state some quasi-particle
states remain on the Fermi level and lead to the Cooper instability. The
dispersion of such quasi-particle states is, in general, very different from
that without DW. Therefore, the properties of SC on the DW background may
strongly differ from those without DW. The upper critical field $H_{c2}$ in
such a SC state increases as the system approaches the critical pressure, where
the ungapped quasi-particles and superconductivity just appear, and it may
considerably exceed the usual $H_{c2}$ value without DW. The SDW background
strongly suppresses the singlet SC pairing, while it does not affect so much
the triplet SC transition temperature. The results obtained explain the
experimental observations in layered organic metals (TMTSF)$_{2}$PF$_{6}$ and
$\alpha $-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$KHg(SCN)$_{4}$, where SC appears in the DW states
under pressure and shows many unusual properties.
