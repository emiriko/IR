We report the determination of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, the
dominant magnetic anisotropy term in the \kagome spin-1/2 compound {\herbert}.
Based on the analysis of the high-temperature electron spin resonance (ESR)
spectra, we find its main component $|D_z|=15(1)$ K to be perpendicular to the
\kagome planes. Through the temperature dependent ESR line-width we observe a
building up of nearest-neighbor spin-spin correlations below $\sim$150 K.
