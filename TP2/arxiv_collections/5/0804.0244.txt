We give a brief account of the recent progresses in super Yang-Mills theories
based in particular on the application of Nekrasov's instanton technology to
the case of N=1 supersymmetry. We have developed a first-principle formalism
from which any chiral observable in the theory can be computed, including in
strongly coupled confining vacua. The correlators are first expressed in terms
of some external variables as sums over colored partitions. The external
variables are then fixed to their physical values by extremizing the
microscopic quantum superpotential. Remarquably, the results can be shown to
coincide with the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model approach, which uses a totally
different mathematical framework. These results clarify many important
properties of N=1 theories, related in particular to generalized Konishi
anomaly equations and to Veneziano-Yankielowicz terms in the glueball
superpotentials. The proof of the equivalence between the formalisms based on
colored partitions and on matrices is also a proof of the open/closed string
duality in the chiral sector of the theories.
