In this work, a systematic ab initio study of the influence of doping on
electronic structure and local magnetic moments of ferromagnetic MnAs has been
carried out. The majority of the considered substitution elements, potentially
suitable for modification of MnAs as working material of magnetic refrigerators
is shown to result in reduction of the ferromagnetic moment. But there are
variants of anionic substitution (for example, substitution of As for S and Se)
when the magnetic moment grows.
