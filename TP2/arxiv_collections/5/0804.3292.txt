We report unusual magnetic behavior in iron oxide hollow nanospheres of 9.3
$nm$ in diameter. The large fraction of atoms existing at the inner and outer
surfaces gives rise to a high magnetic disorder. The overall magnetic behavior
can be explained considering the coexistence of a soft superparamagnetic phase
and a hard phase corresponding to the highly frustrated cluster-glass like
phase at the surface regions.
