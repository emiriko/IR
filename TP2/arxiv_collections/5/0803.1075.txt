In order to study the resonance spectra of chaotic cavities subject to some
damping (which can be due to absorption or partial reflection at the
boundaries), we use a model of damped quantum maps. In the high-frequency
limit, the distribution of (quantum) decay rates is shown to cluster near a
``typical'' value, which is larger than the classical decay rate of the
corresponding damped ray dynamics. The speed of this clustering may be quite
slow, which could explain why it has not been detected in previous numerical
data.
