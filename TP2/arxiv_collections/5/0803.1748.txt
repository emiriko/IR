We present Risk Integrated's Enterprise Spreadsheet Platform (ESP), a
technical approach to the near-elimination of spreadsheet risk in the
enterprise computing environment, whilst maintaining the full flexibility of
spreadsheets for modelling complex financial structures and processes. In its
Basic Mode of use, the system comprises a secure and robust centralised
spreadsheet management framework. In Advanced Mode, the system can be viewed as
a robust computational framework whereby users can "submit jobs" to the
spreadsheet, and retrieve the results from the computations, but with no direct
access to the underlying spreadsheet. An example application, Monte Carlo
simulation, is presented to highlight the benefits of this approach with regard
to mitigating spreadsheet risk in complex, mission-critical, financial
calculations.
