We calculate the optical and Raman response within a phenomenological model
of fermion quasiparticles coupled to nearly critical collective modes. We find
that, whereas critical scaling properties might be masked in optical spectra
due to charge conservation, distinct critical signatures of charge and spin
fluctuations can be detected in Raman spectra exploiting specific symmetry
properties. We compare our results with recent experiments on the cuprates.
