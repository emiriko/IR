We present the first time-resolved cryogenic observations of Forster energy
transfer in large, monodisperse lead sulphide quantum dots with ground state
transitions near 1.5 um (0.83 eV), in environments from 160 K to room
temperature. The observed temperature-dependent dipole-dipole transfer rate
occurs in the range of (30-50 ns)^(-1), measured with our confocal
single-photon counting setup at 1.5 um wavelengths. By temperature-tuning the
dots, 94% efficiency of resonant energy transfer can be achieved for donor
dots. The resonant transfer rates match well with proposed theoretical models.
