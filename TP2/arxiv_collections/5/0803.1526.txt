Plagiarism is a crime against academy. It deceives readers, hurts plagiarized
authors, and gets the plagiarist undeserved benefits. However, even though
these arguments do show that copying other people's intellectual contribution
is wrong, they do not apply to the copying of words. Copying a few sentences
that contain no original idea (e.g. in the introduction) is of marginal
importance compared to stealing the ideas of others. The two must be clearly
distinguished, and the 'plagiarism' label should not be used for deeds which
are very different in nature and importance.
