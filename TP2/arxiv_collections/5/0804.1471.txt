We study numerically the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Ising Spin Glass, for
a time that spans eleven orders of magnitude, thus approaching the
experimentally relevant scale (i.e. {\em seconds}). We introduce novel analysis
techniques that allow to compute the coherence length in a model-independent
way. Besides, we present strong evidence for a replicon correlator and for
overlap equivalence. The emerging picture is compatible with non-coarsening
behavior.
