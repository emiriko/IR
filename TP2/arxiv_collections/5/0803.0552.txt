We generalize Lyons' rough paths theory in order to give a pathwise meaning
to some nonlinear infinite-dimensional evolution equation associated to an
analytic semigroup and driven by an irregular noise. As an illustration, we
discuss a class of linear and nonlinear 1d SPDEs driven by a space--time
Gaussian noise with singular space covariance and Brownian time dependence.
