Based on an approach to quark and lepton masses, where the mass spectra
originate in vacuum expectation values of U(3) flavor nonet (gauge singlet)
scalars, neutrino masses and mixing are investigated. As an offshoot of this
approach, it is found that an empirical neutrino mass matrix which is described
in terms of the up-quark and charged lepton masses can accommodate to a nearly
tribimaximal mixing.
