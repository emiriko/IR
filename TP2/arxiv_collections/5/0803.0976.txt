We stress on the similarities between vibronic symmetry-breaking, due to the
mixing of electronic states by phonons and leading to vibronic polarons along a
helix, and the conceivable helical form of light propagation possibly arising
from a symmetry breaking, due to the mixing of fermion states by photons.
