The ground state of hard-core bosons on the square lattice with nearest and
next-nearest neighbor repulsion is studied by Quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
A supersolid phase with vacancy condensation and 'star' diagonal ordering is
found for filling less than a quarter. At fillings above one quarter, a
supersolid phase exists between the star and the stripe crystal at
half-filling. No supersolid phase occurs above quarter-filling, if the ground
state at half-filling is either a checkerboard crystal or a superfluid. No
commensurate supersolid phase is observed.
