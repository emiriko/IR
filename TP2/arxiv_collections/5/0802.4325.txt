It is a standing open question to decide whether the Yao-Yao structure for
unit disk graphs (UDGs) is a length spanner of not. This question is highly
relevant to the topology control problem for wireless ad hoc networks. In this
paper we make progress towards resolving this question by showing that the
Yao-Yao structure is a length spanner for UDGs of bounded aspect ratio. We also
propose a new local algorithm, called Yao-Sparse-Sink, based on the Yao-Sink
method introduced by Li, Wan, Wang and Frieder, that computes a (1+e)-spanner
of bounded degree for a given UDG and for given e > 0. The Yao-Sparse-Sink
method enables an efficient local computation of sparse sink trees. Finally, we
show that all these structures for UDGs -- Yao, Yao-Yao, Yao-Sink and
Yao-Sparse-Sink -- have arbitrarily large weight.
