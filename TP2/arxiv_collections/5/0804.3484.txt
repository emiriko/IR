In this note we introduce the concept of a semi-bounded unitary
representations of an infinite-dimensional Lie group $G$. Semi-boundedness is
defined in terms of the corresponding momentum set in the dual $\g'$ of the Lie
algebra $\g$ of $G$. After dealing with some functional analytic issues
concerning certain weak-$*$-locally compact subsets of dual spaces, called
semi-equicontinuous, we characterize unitary representations which are bounded
in the sense that their momentum set is equicontinuous, we characterize
semi-bounded representations of locally convex spaces in terms of spectral
measures, and we also describe a method to compute momentum sets of unitary
representations of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions.
