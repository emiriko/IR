In Part I of this paper we discussed new methods for the numerical
continuation of point-to-cycle connecting orbits in 3-dimensional autonomous
ODE's using projection boundary conditions. In this second part we extend the
method to the numerical continuation of cycle-to-cycle connecting orbits. In
our approach, the projection boundary conditions near the cycles are formulated
using eigenfunctions of the associated adjoint variational equations, avoiding
costly and numerically unstable computations of the monodromy matrices. The
equations for the eigenfunctions are included in the defining boundary-value
problem, allowing a straightforward implementation in AUTO, in which only the
standard features of the software are employed. Homotopy methods to find the
connecting orbits are discussed in general and illustrated with an example from
population dynamics. Complete AUTO demos, which can be easily adapted to any
autonomous 3-dimensional ODE system, are freely available.
