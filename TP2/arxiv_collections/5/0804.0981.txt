Despite of its limited capabilities for ball-lightning modeling, the
chemically active dust plasma of electric discharges is a very interesting
physical object. Gatchina's discharge, which gives a possibility to study the
dust-gas fireball, represents a complex non-stationary process, combining the
creation and the destruction of relatively long-living high-enthalpy
microscopic states with non-ideal dust plasma and with a gas-dynamic form,
resulting in appearance of a spherical luminous object. In the present work we
studied spatial structure of the discharge and its dynamics with the help of
electric and optical measurements.
