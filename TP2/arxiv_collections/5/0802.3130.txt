A model is proposed to explain the observed correlation between monthly
fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures. The model
relies on the oceans being in a temperature-dependent equilibrium with the
atmosphere. When temperature changes, the system attempts to restore the
equilibrium, with a time constant constrained by the dynamic fluxes between the
two. The model is used to reconstruct both the historic evolution of CO2
concentrations since 1885, as well as the monthly fluctuations since 1959. The
best fit is obtained with the southern hemisphere sea surface temperature data.
In this new picture, human emissions play no role in the build-up of
atmospheric CO2, but do contribute to the fluxes that restore the equilibrium.
