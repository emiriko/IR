Signals of bimodality have been investigated in experimental data of
quasi-projectile decay produced in Au+Au collisions at 35 AMeV. This same data
set was already shown to provide several signals characteristic of a first
order, liquid-gas-like phase transition. Different event sortings proposed in
the recent literature are analyzed. A sudden change in the fragmentation
pattern is revealed by the distribution of the charge of the largest fragment,
compatible with a bimodal behavior.
