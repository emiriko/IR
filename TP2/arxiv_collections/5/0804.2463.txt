We report a thorough dielectric characterization of the alpha relaxation of
glass forming glycerol with varying additions of LiCl. Nine salt concentrations
from 0.1 - 20 mol% are investigated in a frequency range of 20 Hz - 3 GHz and
analyzed in the dielectric loss and modulus representation. Information on the
dc conductivity, the dielectric relaxation time (from the loss) and the
conductivity relaxation time (from the modulus) is provided. Overall, with
increasing ion concentration, a transition from reorientationally to
translationally dominated behavior is observed and the translational ion
dynamics and the dipolar reorientational dynamics become successively coupled.
This gives rise to the prospect that by adding ions to dipolar glass formers,
dielectric spectroscopy may directly couple to the translational degrees of
freedom determining the glass transition, even in frequency regimes where
usually strong decoupling is observed.
