We report a limit on the fractional temporal variation of the
proton-to-electron mass ratio as, obtained by comparing the frequency of a
rovibrational transition in SF6 with the fundamental hyperfine transition in
Cs. The SF6 transition was accessed using a CO2 laser to interrogate spatial
2-photon Ramsey fringes. The atomic transition was accessed using a primary
standard controlled with a Cs fountain. This result is direct and model-free.
