This paper discusses transport methods for the investigation of the (Ga,Mn)As
magnetic anisotropy. Typical magnetoresistance behaviour for different
anisotropy types is discussed, focusing on an in depth discussion of the
anisotropy fingerprint technique and extending it to layers with primarily
uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. We find that in all (Ga,Mn)As films studied,
three anisotropy components are always present. The primary biaxial along
([100] and [010]) along with both uniaxial components along the [110] and [010]
crystal directions which are often reported separately. Various fingerprints of
typical (Ga,Mn)As transport samples at 4 K are included to illustrate the
variation of the relative strength of these anisotropy terms. We further
investigate the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy and the
domain wall nucleation energy with the help of the fingerprint method.
