In this paper, making use of the global one-dimensionality conjecture, we
discuss the reduction of the Wheeler-DeWitt quantum geometrodynamics to the
Klein-Gordon equation describing the scalar bosonic particle. The method of
second quantization in the appropriate Fock space is applied, and, employing
both the Bogoliubov transformation as well as Heisenberg equations of motion,
the quantum gravity is expressed as evolution of the creators and annihilators
related to the initial data. It is shown that this procedure leads to the
understanding of the boson mass, through the one-point two-boson quantum
correlations, as a scaled initial data mass.
