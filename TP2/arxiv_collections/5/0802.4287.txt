The concept of time delayed creation of entanglement by the dissipative
process of spontaneous emission is investigated. A threshold effect for the
creation of entanglement is found that the initially unentangled qubits can be
entangled after a finite time despite the fact that the coherence between the
qubits exists for all times. This delayed creation of entanglement, that we
call sudden birth of entanglement, is opposite to the currently extensively
discussed sudden death of entanglement and is characteristic for transient
dynamics of one-photon entangled states of the system. We determine the
threshold time for the creation of entanglement and find that it is related to
time at which the antisymmetric state remains the only excited state being
populated. It is shown that the threshold time can be controlled by the
distance between the qubits and the direction of initial excitation relative to
the interatomic axis. This effect suggests a new alternative for the study of
entanglement and provides an interesting resource for creation on demand of
entanglement between two qubits.
