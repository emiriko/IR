There exist very lucid explanations of the combinatorial origins of rational
and algebraic functions, in particular with respect to regular and context free
languages. In the search to understand how to extend these natural
correspondences, we find that the shuffle product models many key aspects of
D-finite generating functions, a class which contains algebraic. We consider
several different takes on the shuffle product, shuffle closure, and shuffle
grammars, and give explicit generating function consequences. In the process,
we define a grammar class that models D-finite generating functions.
