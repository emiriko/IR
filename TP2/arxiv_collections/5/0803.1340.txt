We introduce the historical development and physical idea behind topological
Yang-Mills theory and explain how a physical framework describing subatomic
physics can be used as a tool to study differential geometry. Further, we
emphasize that this phenomenon demonstrates that the interrelation between
physics and mathematics have come into a new stage.
