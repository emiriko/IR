Arrowed-time divergence-free rules or cosmological quantum dynamics are
formulated through stepped Feynman paths across macroscopic slices of Milne
spacetime. Slice boundaries house totally-relativistic rays representing
elementary entities--preons. Total relativity and the associated preon Fock
space, despite distinction from special relativity (which lacks time arrow),
are based on the Lorentz group. Each path is a set of cubic vertices connected
by straight, directed and stepped arcs that carry inertial, electromagnetic and
gravitational action. The action of an arc step comprises increments each
bounded by Planck's constant. Action from extremely-distant sources is
determined by universe mean energy density. Identifying the arc-step energy
that determines inertial action with that determining gravitational action
establishes both arc-step length and universe density. Special relativity is
accurate for physics at laboratory spacetime scales far below that of Hubble
and far above that of Planck.
