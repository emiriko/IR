We present first-principles calculations on bulk CdSe and CdSe nanowires with
diameters of up to 22 \AA. Density functional linear combination of atomic
orbitals and plane wave calculations of the electronic and structural
properties are presented and discussed. We use an iterative, symmetry-based
method to relax the structures into the ground state. We find that the band gap
depends on surface termination. Vibrational properties in the whole Brillouin
zone of bulk CdSe and the zone-center vibrations of nanowires are calculated
and analyzed. We find strongly size-dependent and nearly constant modes,
depending on the displacement directions. A comparison with available
experimental Raman data is be given.
