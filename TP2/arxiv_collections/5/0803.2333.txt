We present the Casimir energy of spherical shell, for the symmetrically
deformed scalar field in $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time, satisfying Dirichlet
boundary condition. The Casimir energy shows the particle anti-particle
symmetry contrary to the asymmetrically deformed case. In addition, the
deformation effect starts from $O(1/\kappa)$ term unlike in the parallel
plates.
