The base is the Lagrangian of symmetry and its dynamical breaking or Higgs
breaking. When the soliton-like solutions of the scalar field equations are
substituted into the spinor field equations, in the approximation of
non-relativity we derive the Morse-type potential, whose energy spectrum is the
GMO mass formula and its modified accurate mass formula. According to the
symmetry of s-c quarks, the heavy flavor hadrons which made of u,d and c quarks
may be classified by SU(3) octet and decuplet. Then some simple mass formulas
are obtained, from this we predict some masses of unknown hadrons.
