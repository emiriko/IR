We introduce an elementary method for proving the absolute continuity of the
time marginals of one-dimensional processes. It is based on a comparison
between the Fourier transform of such time marginals with those of the one-step
Euler approximation of the underlying process. We obtain some absolute
continuity results for stochastic differential equations with H\"{o}lder
continuous coefficients. Furthermore, we allow such coefficients to be random
and to depend on the whole path of the solution. We also show how it can be
extended to some stochastic partial differential equations and to some
L\'{e}vy-driven stochastic differential equations. In the cases under study,
the Malliavin calculus cannot be used, because the solution in generally not
Malliavin differentiable.
