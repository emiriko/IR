We investigate the low-temperature electrical and thermal transport
properties in atomically precise metallic heterostructures involving
strongly-correlated electron systems. The model of the Mott-insulator/
band-insulator superlattice was discussed in the framework of the slave-boson
mean-field approximation and transport quantities were derived by use of the
Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation-time approximation. The results
for the optical conductivity are in good agreement with recently published
experimental data on (LaTiO$_3)_N$/(SrTiO$_3)_M$ superlattices and allow us to
estimate the values of key parameters of the model. Furthermore, predictions
for the thermoelectric response were made and the dependence of the Seebeck
coefficient on model parameters was studied in detail. The width of the
Mott-insulating material was identified as the most relevant parameter, in
particular, this parameter provides a way to optimize the thermoelectric power
factor at low temperatures.
