Physical spacetime geometry follows from some effective thermodynamics of
quantum states of all fields and particles described in frames of General
Relativity. In the sense of pure field theoretical Einstein's point of view on
gravitation the thermodynamic information is actually quantum gravity. We
propose new realization of this old idea by studying the canonical 3+1
Dirac-ADM approach to pseudo-Riemannian (Lorentzian) manifold of General
Relativity. We derive the Wheeler-DeWitt theory as the Global One-Dimensional
classical field theory of the Bose field associated with embedded 3-space,
where Wheeler's superspace metric is absent. The classical theory is discussed,
some deductions on tachyon state, Dark Energy density and cosmological constant
are included. Reduction to 1st order evolution is carried out, and quantum
theory by the second quantization in the Fock space of creators and
annihilators is constructed by employing the Heisenberg equation and the
bosonic Bogoliubov transformation for diagonalization. In result we find the
static reper with stable vacuum, where quantum states of 3-space can be
considered, and finally space quantum states thermodynamics is formulated.
