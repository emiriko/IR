Micro end-milling method is a universal micro manufacturing method, which can
be used to fabricating complex 3D structures and parts with many materials. But
compared with their micrometer order size, their surface roughness quality is
not satisfied. In this paper, the different metal phase grains influences are
researched, and the micro end-milling process is described while the material
is anisotropic. In this paper, the physical characteristics of different
grains, especially friction coefficient and elastic module, are very critical
to determine the chip formation process and surface generation. The chip is
often discontinues because of the grain boundary effect. Through the micro
end-milling experiment, the bottom surface results correlate very well with the
theory analysis.
