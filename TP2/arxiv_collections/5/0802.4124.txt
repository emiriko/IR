We study the full contributions at the leading order(LO) and QCD
next-to-leading order(NLO) to the cross section of the \eewwbb process in the
standard model(SM) at the ILC. In dealing the resonance problem we adopted the
complex mass scheme in both tree-level and one-loop level perturbative
calculations. Our numerical results show that the K-factor varies from 1.501 to
0.847 when $\sqrt{s}$ goes up from $360 GeV$ to $1.5 TeV$. We investigate the
dependence of the LO and QCD NLO corrected cross sections of process \eewwbb on
colliding energy $\sqrt{s}$ and Higgs-boson mass. We also present the results
of the LO and QCD NLO corrected distributions of the transverse momenta of
final particles, and the invariant masses of $Wb$-, $b\bar b$- and $WW$-pair.
