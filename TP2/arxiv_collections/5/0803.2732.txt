The collective behavior of molecular motor proteins have been investigated in
the literature using models to describe the long-time dynamics of a
unidimensional continuum motor distribution. Here, we consider the phenomena
related to the transport of particles (vesicles, organelles, virus, etc) in the
realm of these continuum motor systems. We argue that cargo movement may result
from its ability to perturb the existing motor distribution and to surf at the
resulting shock waves separating regions of different motor densities within
the transient regime. In this case, the observed bidirectionality of cargo
movement is naturally associated with reversals of shocks directions.
Comparison of the quantitative results predicted by this model with available
data for cargo velocity allows us to suggest that geometrical characteristics
of the transported particle shall determine the extension and intensity of the
perturbation it produces and thus, its dynamics. Possible implications of these
ideas to virus movement at the cell body are discussed in connection with their
distinguished morphological characteristics. Key words: collective effects of
molecular motors; cargo transport; non-linear partial differential equations;
shock waves.
