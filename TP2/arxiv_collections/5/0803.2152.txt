Spin-polarized transport through a quantum dot strongly coupled to
ferromagnetic electrodes with non-collinear magnetic moments is analyzed
theoretically in terms of the non-equilibrium Green function formalism.
Electrons in the dot are assumed to be coupled to a phonon bath. The influence
of electron-phonon coupling on tunnelling current, linear and nonlinear
conductance, and on tunnel magnetoresistance is studied in detail. Variation of
the main Kondo peaks and phonon satellites with the angle between magnetic
moments of the leads is analyzed.
