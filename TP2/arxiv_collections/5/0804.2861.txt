We report the observation of surface solitons in chirped semi-infinite
waveguide arrays whose waveguides exhibit exponentially decreasing refractive
indices. We show that the power threshold for surface wave formation decreases
with an increase of the array chirp and that for sufficiently large chirp
values linear surface modes are supported.
