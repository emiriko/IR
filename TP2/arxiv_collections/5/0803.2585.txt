We employ reduced density-matrix functional theory in the calculation of the
fundamental gap of open-shell systems. The formula for the calculation of the
fundamental gap is derived with special attention to the spin of the neutral
and the charged systems. We discuss the effects of different functionals as
well as the changes due to different basis sets. Also, we investigate the
importance of varying the natural orbitals for the calculation of the
fundamental gap
