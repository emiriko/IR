We have developed the Monte Carlo simulation program JEWEL 1.0 (Jet Evolution
With Energy Loss), which interfaces a perturbative final state parton shower
with medium effects occurring in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. This
is done by comparing for each jet fragment the probability of further
perturbative splitting with the density-dependent probability of scattering
with the medium. A simple hadronisation mechanism is included. In the absence
of medium effects, we validate JEWEL against a set of benchmark jet
measurements. For elastic interactions with the medium, we characterise not
only the medium-induced modification of the jet, but also the jet-induced
modification of the medium. Our main physics result is the observation that
collisional and radiative medium modifications lead to characteristic
differences in the jet fragmentation pattern, which persist above a soft
background cut. We argue that this should allow to disentangle collisional and
radiative parton energy loss mechanisms by measuring the n-jet fraction or a
class of jet shape observables.
