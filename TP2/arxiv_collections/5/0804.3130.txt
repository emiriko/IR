The intensity of classical bright solitons propagating in linearly coupled
identical fibers can be distributed either in a stable symmetric state at
strong coupling or in a stable asymmetric state if the coupling is small
enough. In the first case, if the initial state is not the equilibrium state,
the intensity may switch periodically from fiber to fiber, while in the second
case the a-symmetrical state remains forever, with most of its energy in either
fiber. The latter situation makes a state of propagation with two exactly
reciprocal realizations. In the quantum case, such a situation does not exist
as an eigenstate because of the quantum tunneling between the two fibers. Such
a tunneling is a purely quantum phenomenon which does not not exist in the
classical theory. We estimate the rate of tunneling by quantizing a simplified
dynamics derived from the original Lagrangian equations with test functions.
This tunneling could be within reach of the experiments, particularly if the
quantum coherence of the soliton can be maintained over a sufficient amount of
time.
