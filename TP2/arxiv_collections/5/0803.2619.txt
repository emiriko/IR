Modeling of headway/spacing between two consecutive vehicles has many
applications in traffic flow theory and transport practice. Most known
approaches only study the vehicles running on freeways. In this paper, we
propose a model to explain the spacing distribution of queuing vehicles in
front of a signalized junction based on random-matrix theory. We show that the
recently measured spacing distribution data well fit the spacing distribution
of a Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE). These results are also compared with
the spacing distribution observed for car parking problem. Why
vehicle-stationary-queuing and vehicle-parking have different spacing
distributions (GSE vs GUE) seems to lie in the difference of driving patterns.
