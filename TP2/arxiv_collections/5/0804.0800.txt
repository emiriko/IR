The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) glitch group is part of the LIGO
detector characterization effort. It consists of data analysts and detector
experts who, during and after science runs, collaborate for a better
understanding of noise transients in the detectors. Goals of the glitch group
during the fifth LIGO science run (S5) included (1) offline assessment of the
detector data quality, with focus on noise transients, (2) veto recommendations
for astrophysical analysis and (3) feedback to the commissioning team on
anomalies seen in gravitational wave and auxiliary data channels. Other
activities included the study of auto-correlation of triggers from burst
searches, stationarity of the detector noise and veto studies. The group
identified causes for several noise transients that triggered false alarms in
the gravitational wave searches; the times of such transients were identified
and vetoed from the data generating the LSC astrophysical results.
