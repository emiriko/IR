We study the statistics of the dissipated energy in the two-dimensional
random fuse model for fracture under different imposed strain conditions. By
means of extensive numerical simulations we compare different ways to compute
the dissipated energy. In the case of a infinitely slow driving rate
(quasi-static model) we find that the probability distribution of the released
energy shows two different scaling regions separated by a sharp energy
crossover. At low energies, the probability of having an event of energy $E$
decays as $\sim E^{-1/2}$, which is robust and independent of the energy
quantifier used (or lattice type). At high energies fluctuations dominate the
energy distribution leading to a crossover to a different scaling regime, $\sim
E^{-2.75}$, whenever the released energy is computed over the whole system. On
the contrary, strong finite-size effects are observed if we only consider the
energy dissipated at microfractures. In a different numerical experiment the
quasi-static dynamics condition is relaxed, so that the system is driven at
finite strain load rates, and we find that the energy distribution decays as
$\mathcal{P} (E) \sim E^{-1}$ for all the energy range.
