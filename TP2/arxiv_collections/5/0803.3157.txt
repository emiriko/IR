The influence of local order on the disordering scenario of small Wigner
islands is discussed. A first disordering step is put in evidence by the time
correlation functions and is linked to individual excitations resulting in
configuration transitions, which are very sensitive to the local symmetries.
This is followed by two other transitions, corresponding to orthoradial and
radial diffusion, for which both individual and collective excitations play a
significant role. Finally, we show that, contrary to large systems, the focus
that is commonly made on collective excitations for such small systems through
the Lindemann criterion has to be made carefully in order to clearly identify
the relative contributions in the whole disordering process.
