We present a first-principles scheme for the computation of the
magnetoelectric response of magnetic insulators. The method focuses on the
lattice-mediated part of the magnetic response to an electric field, which we
argue can be expected to be the dominant contribution in materials displaying a
strong magnetoelectric coupling. We apply our method to Cr2O3, a relatively
simple and experimentally well studied magnetoelectric compound.
