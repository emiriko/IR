We investigate the superconductivity of a three-dimensional d-p model with a
multilayer perovskite structure on the basis of the second-order perturabation
theory within the weak coupling framework. Our model has been designed with
multilayer high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates in mind. In our model, multiple
Fermi surfaces appear, and the component of a superconducting gap function
develops on each band. We have found that the multilayer structure can
stabilize the superconductivity in a wide doping range.
