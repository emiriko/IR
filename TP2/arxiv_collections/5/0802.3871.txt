We report the first evidence of electron-mediated ferromagnetism in a
molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) grown $GaAs/Al_{0.3}Ga_{0.7}As$ heterostructure
with Mn $\delta$-doping. The interaction between the magnetic dopants (Mn) and
the Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (2DEG) realizes magnetic ordering when the
temperature is below the Curie temperature ($T_{C} \sim 1.7K$) and the 2DEG is
brought in close proximity to the Mn layer by gating. The Anomalous Hall Effect
(AHE) contribution to the total Hall resistance is shown to be about three to
four orders of magnitude smaller than in the case of hole-mediated
ferromagnetism indicating the presence of small spin-orbit interaction.
