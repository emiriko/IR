In this paper we generalize the construction of locally boosted black brane
space time to higher derivative gravities. We consider the Gauss-Bonnet term
(with coefficient $\alpha'$) as a toy example. We find the solution to the
$\alpha'$ corrected Einstein equations to first order in the boundary
derivative expansion. This allows us to find the $\alpha'$ corrections to the
boundary stress tensor in the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk
action. We therefore obtain the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy which
agrees with other methods of computation in the literature.
