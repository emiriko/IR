We describe recent developments of the "magnetic scenario" of sQGP. We show
that at $T=(0.8-1.3)T_c$ there is a dense plasma of monopoles, capable of
supporting metastable flux tubes. Their existence allows to quantitatively
explained the non-trivial $T$-dependence of the static $\bar Q Q$ potential
energy calculated on the lattice. By molecular dynamics simulation we derived
transport properties (shear viscosity and diffusion constant) and showed that
the best liquid is given by most symmetric plasma, with 50%-50% of electric and
magnetic charges. The results are close to those of the ``perfect liquid''
observed at RHIC.
