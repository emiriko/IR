In the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT), top-partners (T_-) are
produced in pairs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Each top-partner decays
into a top quark (t) and the lightest T-odd gauge partner A_H. We demonstrate
reconstruction of the ttbar system decaying hadronically, and measurement of
the top-partner mass from the m_{T2} distribution. A top quark from a T_{-}
decay is polarized, and we discuss the effect of this polarization on the decay
distributions. Because the events consist of highly collinear jets which
occasionally overlap each other, we compare distributions using different jet
reconstruction algorithms (Snowmass cone, kt, Cambridge, SISCone). We find
clustering algorithms are advantageous for studying top polarization effects.
