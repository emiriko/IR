Self-similar solutions of a collapsing perfect fluid and a massless scalar
field with kinematic self-similarity of the first kind in 2+1 dimensions are
obtained. Their local and global properties of the solutions are studied. It is
found that some of them represent gravitational collapse, in which black holes
are always formed, and some may be interpreted as representing cosmological
models.
