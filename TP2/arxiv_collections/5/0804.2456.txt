We predict the contribution of scalar unparticle to the branching ratios of
the lepton flavor conserving Z -> l^+ l^- decays and we study the discrepancy
between the experimental and the QED corrected standard model branching ratios.
We observe that these decays are sensitive to the unparticle scaling dimension
d_u for its small values, especially for heavy lepton flavor output.
