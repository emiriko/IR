Much of what EuSpRIG discusses is concerned with the integrity of individual
spreadsheets. In businesses, interlocking spreadsheets are regularly used to
fill functional gaps in core administrative systems. The growth and deployment
of such integrated spreadsheet SYSTEMS raises the scale of issues to a whole
new level. The correct management of spreadsheet systems is necessary to ensure
that the business achieves its goals of improved performance and good corporate
governance, within the constraints of legislative compliance - poor management
will deliver the opposite. This paper is an anatomy of the real-life issues of
the commercial use of spreadsheets in business, and demonstrates how
Qtier-Rapor has been used to instil best practice in the use of integrated
commercial spreadsheet systems.
