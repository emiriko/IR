The magneto-optical inter-polarization conversions by a layer of quantum dots
have been investigated. Various types of polarization response of the sample
were observed as a function of external magnetic field and of the orientation
of the sample. The full set of experimental dependences is analyzed in terms of
a one-step and a two-step model of spin evolution. The angular distribution of
the quantum dots over the directions of elongation in the plane of the sample
is taken into account in terms of the two models, and the model predictions are
compared with experimental observations.
