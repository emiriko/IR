As implied by organizers, this talk is not a conference summary but rather an
outline of progress/challenges/``frontiers'' of the theory. Some fundamental
questions addressed are:
  Why is sQGP such a good liquid? Do we understand (de)confinement and what do
we know about ``magnetic'' objects creating it? Can we understand the AdS/CFT
predictions, from the gauge theory side? Can they be tested experimentally? Can
AdS/CFT duality help us understand rapid equilibration/entropy production? Can
we work out a complete dynamical ``gravity dual'' to heavy ion collisions?
