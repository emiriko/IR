We compute the one loop corrected effective Lagrangian for the
neutralino-neutralino-neutral Higgs interactions $\chi^{0}_{\ell}
\chi^{0}_kH^{0}_m$. The analysis completes the previous analyses where similar
corrections were computed for the $\bar{f} f H^{0}_m$ couplings, where $f$
stands for Standard Model quarks and leptons and for the
chargino-chargino-neutral Higgs couplings $\chi^{+}_l \chi^{-}_kH^{0}_m$ within
the minimal supersymmetric standard model MSSM. The effective one loop
Lagrangian is then applied to the computation of the neutral Higgs decays. The
sizes of the supersymmetric loop corrections of the neutral Higgs decay widths
into $\chi^{0}_{\ell} \chi^{0}_k$ (${\ell}=1,2,3,4$; $k=1,2,3,4$) are
investigated and the supersymmetric loop correction is found to be in the range
of $\sim 10%$ in significant regions of the parameter space. By including the
loop corrections of the other decay channels $\bar{b} b$, $\bar{t} t$,
$\bar{\tau} \tau$, $\bar{c} c$, and $\chi^{-}_i \chi^{+}_j$ ($i=1,2$; $j=1,2$),
the corrections to branching ratios for $H^{0}_m\to \chi^{0}_{\ell} \chi^{0}_k$
can reach as high as 50%. The effects of CP phases on the branching ratio are
also investigated. A discussion of the implications of the analysis for
colliders is given.
