We study the existence of the numeraire portfolio under predictable convex
constraints in a general semimartingale model of a financial market. The
numeraire portfolio generates a wealth process, with respect to which the
relative wealth processes of all other portfolios are supermartingales.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the numeraire
portfolio are obtained in terms of the triplet of predictable characteristics
of the asset price process. This characterization is then used to obtain
further necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of a no-free-lunch-type
notion. In particular, the full strength of the "No Free Lunch with Vanishing
Risk" (NFLVR) is not needed, only the weaker "No Unbounded Profit with Bounded
Risk" (NUPBR) condition that involves the boundedness in probability of the
terminal values of wealth processes. We show that this notion is the minimal
a-priori assumption required in order to proceed with utility optimization. The
fact that it is expressed entirely in terms of predictable characteristics
makes it easy to check, something that the stronger NFLVR condition lacks.
