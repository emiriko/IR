Graphene is a recently discovered carbon based material with unique physical
properties. This is a monolayer of graphite, and the two-dimensional electrons
and holes in it are described by the effective Dirac equation with a vanishing
effective mass. As a consequence, electromagnetic response of graphene is
predicted to be strongly non-linear. We develop a quasi-classical kinetic
theory of the non-linear electromagnetic response of graphene, taking into
account the self-consistent-field effects. Response of the system to both
harmonic and pulse excitation is considered. The frequency multiplication
effect, resulting from the non-linearity of the electromagnetic response, is
studied under realistic experimental conditions. The frequency up-conversion
efficiency is analysed as a function of the applied electric field and
parameters of the samples. Possible applications of graphene in terahertz
electronics are discussed.
