We present a counter example to paper \cite{P71} and show that the result
obtained is correct for a class of metric but not general. We calculate the
total energy of the Kantowski-Sachs space-time by using the energy-momentum
definitions of M{\o}ller in the theory of general relativity and the tetrad
theory of gravity.
