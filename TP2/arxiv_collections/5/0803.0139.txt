The Machian Universe, is usually described with Newtonian Physics, We give an
alternative General Relativistic picture for Mach's Universe. As such, we show
that, in the correct Machian limit, Schwarzschild's metric is coherent with
Robertson-Walker's, on condition that there be a cosmological constant, or the
Universe's rotation -- or both. It is now confirmed that the Universe is
accelerating, so the former condition applies. The latter was also confirmed
one more time with the recently discovered NASA space probes anomalies. From
Kerr-Lense-Thirring solution, we find an inverse scale-factor dependent angular
speed; we then, show that the cosmological "constant" may have Classically
originated from a centrifugal acceleration field.
