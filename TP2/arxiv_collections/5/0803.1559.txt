We show, that by performing a simultaneous analysis of the angular
dependencies of the +/- first and the zeroth diffraction orders of mixed
holographic gratings, each of the relevant parameters can be obtained: the
strength of the phase grating and the amplitude grating, respectively, as well
as a potential phase between them. Experiments on a pure lithium niobate
crystal are used to demonstrate the applicability of the analysis.
