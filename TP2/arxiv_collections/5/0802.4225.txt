The low-lying level structure of the unbound system $^{16}$B has been
investigated via single-proton removal from a 35 MeV/nucleon $^{17}$C beam. The
coincident detection of the beam velocity $^{15}$B fragment and neutron allowed
the relative energy of the in-flight decay of $^{16}$B to be reconstructed. The
resulting spectrum exhibited a narrow peak some 85 keV above threshold. It is
argued that this feature corresponds to a very narrow ($\Gamma \ll $100 keV)
resonance, or an unresolved multiplet, with a dominant $\pi (p_{3/2})^{-1}
\otimes \nu (d_{5/2}^3)_{J=3/2^+}$ + $\pi (p_{3/2})^{-1} \otimes \nu
(d_{5/2}^2,s_{1/2})_{J=3/2^+}$ configuration which decays by d-wave neutron
emission.
