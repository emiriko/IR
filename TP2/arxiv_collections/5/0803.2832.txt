We report nonperturbative results for the interacting quantum-critical
behavior in a Bose-Fermi Kondo model describing a spin-1/2 coupled both to a
fermionic band with a pseudogap density of states and to a dissipative bosonic
bath. The model serves as a paradigm for studying the interplay between Kondo
physics and low-energy dissipative modes in strongly correlated systems.
