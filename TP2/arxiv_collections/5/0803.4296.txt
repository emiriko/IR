We report the measurement of the branching fractions of the rare decays
B0->Ds(*)+pi-, B0->Ds(*)+rho-, and B0->Ds(*)-K(*)+ in a sample of 381 million
Y(4S) decays into BBbar pairs collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II
asymmetric-energy e+e- storage ring. We present evidence for the decay
B0->Ds-K*+ and the vector-vector decays B0->Ds*+rho- and B0->Ds*-K*+, as well
as the first measurement of the vector meson polarization in these decays. We
also determine the ratios of the CKM-suppressed to CKM-favored amplitudes
r(D(*)pi) and r(D(*)rho) in decays B0->D(*)pi and B0->D(*)rho, and comment on
the prospects for measuring the CP observable sin(2beta+gamma).
