A fully covariant model for describing the electromagnetic decay of Vector
  Mesons, both in light and in heavy sectors, is presented. The main
ingredients of our approach are i) an Ansatz for the Bethe-Salpeter vertex for
Vector Mesons, and ii) a Mandelstam-like formula for the electromagnetic decay
constant. The free parameters of our approach are fixed through a comparison
with the transverse momentum distribution obtained within a
  Light-Front Hamiltonian Dynamics framework with constituent quarks.
  Preliminary results for both the decays constants and the probability of the
valence component are shown.
