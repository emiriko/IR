We present the physical phenomenon of the subject discussed in the paper
\cite{fluc}. In that paper we dealt with the fluctuations of funnel solutions
of intersecting D1 and D3 branes and the electric field $E$ was considered as
very high value causing the results to be non-physical. In the present work,
the variation interval of $E$ is to be $[0,\frac{1}{\lambda}[$. Then, we extend
the study to discuss the overall transverse fluctuations of electrified funnel
solutions of D1$\bot$D5 system in the flat background. The boundary conditions
are found to be Neumann boundary conditions.
