In this paper, we present a new linear programming (LP) formulation of the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The proposed model has O(n^8) variables and
O(n^7) constraints, where n is the number of cities. Our numerical
experimentation shows that computational times for the proposed linear program
are several orders of magnitude smaller than those for the existing model [3].
