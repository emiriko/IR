In this paper we study the decoherence and purity of a driven solid-state
qubit in the Ohmic bath by using the method based on the master equation. At
first, instead of solving the master equation we investigate the coefficients
of the equation which describe the shift in frequency, diffusive, decoherence,
and so on. It is shown that one of the coefficients (we called it decoherence
coefficient) is crucial to the decoherence of the qubit in the model. Then we
investigate the evolution of the purity of the state in the model. From the
analysis of the purity we see that the decoherence time of the qubit decrease
with the increase of the amplitude of the driven fields and it is increase with
the increase of the frequency of the driven fields.
