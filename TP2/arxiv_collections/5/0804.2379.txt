In this paper the spin configurations of the ground state and one- and
two-electron excited states of the Hubbard model on the square lattice are
studied. We profit from a general rotated-electron description, which is
consistent with the model global $SO(3)\times SO(3)\times U(1)$ symmetry. For
rotated electrons, doubly and single occupancy are good quantum numbers for
on-site repulsion $U>0$. The above states are within that description generated
by occupancy configurations of charge $c$ fermions and spin-singlet two-spinon
$s1$ bond particles. Those describe the charge and spin degrees of freedom,
respectively, of the rotated electrons that singly occupy sites. While the $c$
fermions have no internal structure, that of the spin-neutral $s1$
bond-particle occupancy configurations is here described in terms of spinon
occupancies of a well-defined effective spin lattice. In reference
\cite{companion} it is confirmed that our results contribute to the further
understanding of the role of electronic correlations in the spin spectrum of
the parent compound La$_2$CuO$_4$. They are also of interest for studies of
ultra-cold fermionic atoms on an optical lattice.
