The action of a finite reflection group (type A) on its set of roots is
understood as a permutation representation or group action. We show that this
representation is an induced representation from a certain kind of parabolic
subgroup. Furthermore, we use this representation to define a statistic
(derived from the length function) on the set of roots. A possible application
to Costas Arrays is hinted at in a proposition.
