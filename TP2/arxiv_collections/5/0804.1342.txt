The effects of random magnetic fields are considered in an Ising spin-glass
model defined in the limit of infinite-range interactions. The probability
distribution for the random magnetic fields is a double Gaussian, which
consists of two Gaussian distributions centered respectively, at $+H_{0}$ and
$-H_{0}$, presenting the same width $\sigma$. It is argued that such a
distribution is more appropriate for a theoretical description of real systems
than its simpler particular two well-known limits, namely the single Gaussian
distribution ($\sigma \gg H_{0}$), and the bimodal one ($\sigma = 0$). The
model is investigated by means of the replica method, and phase diagrams are
obtained within the replica-symmetric solution. Critical frontiers exhibiting
tricritical points occur for different values of $\sigma$, with the possibility
of two tricritical points along the same critical frontier. To our knowledge,
it is the first time that such a behavior is verified for a spin-glass model in
the presence of a continuous-distribution random field, which represents a
typical situation of a real system. The stability of the replica-symmetric
solution is analyzed, and the usual Almeida-Thouless instability is verified
for low temperatures. It is verified that, the higher-temperature tricritical
point always appears in the region of stability of the replica-symmetric
solution; a condition involving the parameters $H_{0}$ and $\sigma$, for the
occurrence of this tricritical point only, is obtained analytically. Some of
our results are discussed in view of experimental measurements available in the
literature.
