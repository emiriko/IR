We have observed a violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the
macroscopic regime by more than 8 standard deviations. The violation has been
obtained while filtering out only the low frequency noise of the
quantum-correlated beams that results from the technical noise of the laser
used to generate them. We use bright intensity-difference squeezed beams
produced by four-wave mixing as the source of the correlated fields. We also
demonstrate that squeezing does not necessarily imply a violation of the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
