We define a self-map Pal: F_2 --> F_2 of the free group on two generators a,
b, using automorphisms of F_2 that form a group isomorphic to the braid group
B_3. The map Pal restricts to de Luca's right iterated palindromic closure on
the submonoid generated by a, b, and is continuous for the profinite topology
on F_2. The values of Pal are palindromes and coincide with the elements g of
F_2 such that abg is conjugate to bag.
