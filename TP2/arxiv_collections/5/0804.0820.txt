We present a unified theory of magnetic damping in itinerant electron
ferromagnets at order $q^2$ including electron-electron interactions and
disorder scattering. We show that the Gilbert damping coefficient can be
expressed in terms of the spin conductivity, leading to a Matthiessen-type
formula in which disorder and interaction contributions are additive. In a weak
ferromagnet regime, electron-electron interactions lead to a strong enhancement
of the Gilbert damping.
