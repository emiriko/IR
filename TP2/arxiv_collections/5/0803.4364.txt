Using the numerical path integral method we investigate the decoherence and
relaxation of qubits in spin-boson (SB) and spin-intermediate harmonic
oscillator (IHO)-bath (SIB) models. The cases that the environment baths with
low and medium frequencies are investigated. It is shown that the qubits in SB
and SIB models have the same decoherence and relaxation as the baths with low
frequencies. However, the qubits in the two models have different decoherence
and relaxation as the baths with medium frequencies. The decoherence and
relaxation of the qubit in SIB model can be modulated through changing the
coupling coefficients of the qubit-IHO and IHO-bath and the oscillation
frequency of the IHO.
