We obtain a fundamental measure density functional for mixtures of parallel
hard cylinders. To this purpose we first generalize to multicomponent mixtures
the fundamental measure functional proposed by Tarazona and Rosenfeld for a
one-component hard disk fluid, through a method alternative to the cavity
formalism of these authors. We show the equivalence of both methods when
applied to two-dimensional fluids. The density functional so obtained reduces
to the exact density functional for one-dimensional mixtures of hard rods when
applied to one-dimensional profiles. In a second step we apply an idea put
forward some time ago by two of us, based again on a dimensional reduction of
the system, and derive a density functional for mixtures of parallel hard
cylinders. We explore some features of this functional by determining the
fluid-fluid demixing spinodals for a binary mixture of cylinders with the same
volume, and by calculating the direct correlation functions.
