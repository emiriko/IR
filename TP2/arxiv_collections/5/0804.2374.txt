We compare different quantum Master equations for the time evolution of the
reduced density matrix. The widely applied secular approximation (rotating wave
approximation) applied in combination with the Born-Markov approximation
generates a Lindblad type master equation ensuring for completely positive and
stable evolution and is typically well applicable for optical baths. For phonon
baths however, the secular approximation is expected to be invalid. The usual
Markovian master equation does not generally preserve positivity of the density
matrix. As a solution we propose a coarse-graining approach with a dynamically
adapted coarse graining time scale. For some simple examples we demonstrate
that this preserves the accuracy of the integro-differential Born equation. For
large times we analytically show that the secular approximation master equation
is recovered. The method can in principle be extended to systems with a
dynamically changing system Hamiltonian, which is of special interest for
adiabatic quantum computation. We give some numerical examples for the
spin-boson model of cases where a spin system thermalizes rapidly, and other
examples where thermalization is not reached.
