We presented that the relaxation of n coupling molecules in a molecular
string exhibits n individual relaxation modes (RMs), each mode being
characterized by a definite relaxation time and amplitude according to the
string model. The n RMs behaving a single relaxation at high temperature,
evolves to two relaxation species, at low temperature, with different
temperature dependences for the respective relaxation times and amplitudes.
Since the characteristics of the two relaxation species are in agreement with
those exhibited by the universal alpha- and Johari-Goldstein (JG)
beta-relaxations in glass dynamics, we provided a unified molecular level
mechanism for these two processes.
