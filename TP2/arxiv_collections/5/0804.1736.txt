These two lectures concern the Color Glass Condensate and the Glasma. These
are forms of matter which might be studied in high energy hadronic collisions.
The Color Glass Condensate is high energy density gluonic matter. It
constitutes the part of a hadron wavefunction important for high energy
processes. The Glasma is matter produced from the collision of two high energy
hadrons. Both types of matter are associated with coherent fields. The Color
Glass Condensate is static and related to a hadron wavefunction where the
glasma is transient and evolves quickly after a collision. I present the
properties of such matter, and some aspects of what is known of their
properties.
