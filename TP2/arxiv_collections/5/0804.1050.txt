The Josephson current in a diffusive
superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor junction with precessing
magnetization is calculated within the quasiclassical theory of
superconductivity. When the junction is phase-biased, a stationary current
(without a.c. component) can flow through it despite the non-equilibrium
condition. A large critical current is predicted due to a dynamically induced
long range triplet proximity effect. Such effect could be observed in a
conventional hybrid device close to the ferromagnetic resonance.
