The theoretical interpretation of measurements of "wavefunctions" and spectra
in electromagnetic cavities excited by antennas is considered. Assuming that
the characteristic wavelength of the field inside the cavity is much larger
than the radius of the antenna, we describe antennas as "point-like
perturbations". This approach strongly simplifies the problem reducing the
whole information on the antenna to four effective constants. In the framework
of this approach we overcame the divergency of series of the phenomenological
scattering theory and justify assumptions lying at the heart of "wavefunction
measurements". This selfconsistent approach allowed us to go beyond the
one-pole approximation, in particular, to treat the experiments with
degenerated states. The central idea of the approach is to introduce
``renormalized'' Green function, which contains the information on boundary
reflections and has no singularity inside the cavity.
