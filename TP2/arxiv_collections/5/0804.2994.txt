We report the first observation of coherent quantum precession of
magnetization (CQP) in superfluid 3He-A in aerogel. The coherent precession in
bulk 3He A-phase is unstable due to the positive feedback of spin supercurrent
to the gradient of phase of precession. It was predicted that the homogeneous
precession will be stable if the orbital momentum of 3He-A could be oriented
along the magnetic field. We have succeeded to prepare this configuration by
emerging 3He in uniaxially-deformed anisotropic aerogel. The dissipation rate
of coherent precession states in aerogel is much larger then one in bulk 3He-B.
We propose a mechanism of this dissipation.
