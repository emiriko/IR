Isospin effects in 12C ion induced reactions on enriched tin isotopes are
investigated. The isoscaling parameter B is determined for different mass
regions of product nuclei. It is shown that the isoscaling parameter is
sensitive to the formation mechanism of products, and increases as the
difference in the asymmetry is increasing. Using the exitatation energy
obtained with the catcher technique temperatures, density ratio ro/ro0 for
product nuclei in different mass regions and the values of symmetry energy
coefficient for light mass regions of product nuclei for proton and deuteron
induced reactions are determined.
