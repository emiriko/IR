We present a calculation of the Hall coefficient in 2H-TaSe2 and 2H-Cu0.2NbS2
relied on the photoemission data and compare the results to transport
observations. The approach, based on the solution of the semiclassical
Boltzmann equation in the isotropic tau-approximation yields high-temperature
Hall coefficient consistent with the one measured directly. Taking into account
the opening of the pseudogap and redistribution of the spectral weight,
recently observed in angle resolved photoemission spectra of 2H-TaSe2, allows
us to reproduce the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient including
prominent sign change with no adjustable parameters.
