A method is presented that is able to predict the probability of outcomes of
snapshot measurements, such as the images of the instantaneous particle density
distribution in a quantum many-body system. It is shown that a gauge-like
transformation of the phase of the many-body wave function allows one to
construct a probability generating functional, the Fourier transform of which
with respect to the "gauge" field returns the joint probability distribution to
detect any given number of particles at various locations. The method is
applied to the problem of interference of two independent clouds of
Bose-Einstein condensates, where the initially separated clouds with fixed
boson numbers expand and the density profile image of the overlapping clouds is
registered. In the limit of large particle numbers, the probability to observe
a particular image of the density profile is shown to be given by a sum of
partial probability distributions, each of which corresponds to a noisy image
of interference of two matter waves with definite phase difference. In
agreement with earlier theoretical arguments, interference fringes are,
therefore, expected in any single shot measurement, the fringe pattern randomly
varying from run to run. These results conform to the physical picture where
the Bose-Einstein clouds are in spontaneously symmetry broken states, the
hidden phases of which are revealed by the density profile measurement via the
position of the interference fringes.
