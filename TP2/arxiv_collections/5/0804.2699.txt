This paper refutes the validity of the polynomial-time algorithm for solving
satisfiability proposed by Sergey Gubin. Gubin introduces the algorithm using
3-SAT and eventually expands it to accept a broad range of forms of the Boolean
satisfiability problem. Because 3-SAT is NP-complete, the algorithm would have
implied P = NP, had it been correct. Additionally, this paper refutes the
correctness of his polynomial-time reduction of SAT to 2-SAT.
