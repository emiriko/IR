We propose a single-step non-generational conjecture of all first class
constraints,(involving only variables compatible with canonical Poisson
brackets), for a realistic gauge singular field theory. We verify our proposal
for the free electromagnetic field, Yang-Mills fields in interaction with
spinor and scalar fields, and we also verify our proposal in the case
gravitational field. We show that the first class constraints which were
reached at using the standard Dirac's multi-generational algorithm will be
reproduced using the proposed conjecture. We make no claim that our conjecture
will be valid for all mathematically plausible Lagrangians; but, nevertheless
the examples we consider here show that this conjecture is valid for wide range
or much of realistic fields of physical interest that are know to exist and are
manifested in nature
