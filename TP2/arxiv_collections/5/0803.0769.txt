The entanglement in a Hubbard chain of hardcore bosons is investigated. The
analytic expression of the global entanglement in ground state is derived. The
divergence of the derivative of the global entanglement shows the quantum
criticality of the ground state. For the thermal equilibrium state, the
bipartite and the multipartite entanglement are evaluated. The entanglement
decreases to zero at a certain temperature. The thermal entanglement is rapidly
decreasing with the increase of the number of sites in the lattice. The
bipartite thermal entanglement approaches a constant value at a certain number
of sites while the multipartite entanglement eventually vanishes.
