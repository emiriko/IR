We propose a novel statistical approach to the analysis of experimental data
obtained in nucleus-nucleus collisions at high energies which borrows from
methods developed within the context of Random Matrix Theory. It is applied to
the detection of correlations in momentum distributions of emitted particles.
We find good agreement between the results obtained in this way and a standard
analysis based on the method of effective mass spectra and two-pair correlation
function often used in high energy physics. The method introduced here is free
from unwanted background contributions.
