I review the lattice simulations of light scalar mesons with quark-antiquark
and tetraquark interpolating fields. Several difficulties which complicate the
extraction of scalar meson masses from the scalar correlators are pointed out.
One of the major difficulties is the presence of the two-pseudoscalar
scattering states, which often dominate the correlator at light quark masses.
In the simulations with unphysical approximations such scattering contributions
are even more disturbing since they are often large and sometimes negative.
Techniques which allow extraction of scalar meson masses in presence of
scattering states are listed. Preliminary results of various lattice
collaborations are presented.
