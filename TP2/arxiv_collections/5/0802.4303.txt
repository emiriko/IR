Color octet (pseudo)scalars, if they exist, will be copiously produced at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, their detection can become a very
challenging task. In particular, if their decay into a pair of top quarks is
kinematically forbidden, the main decay channel would be into two jets, with a
very large background. In this Brief Report we explore the possibility of using
anomaly-induced decays of the color octet pseudoscalars into gauge bosons to
find them at the LHC.
