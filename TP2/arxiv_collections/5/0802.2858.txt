We present a new framework for calculating multi-jet observables through
resummation. The framework is based on the factorisation of scattering
amplitudes in an asymptotic limit. By imposing simple constraints on the
analytic behaviour of the result when applied away from this limit, we get good
agreement with the known lowest order perturbative behaviour of the scattering
amplitude, and predictions for the behaviour to all orders in the perturbative
series. As an example of application we study predictions for Higgs Boson
production through gluon fusion at the LHC in association with at least two
jets.
