Recent experimental studies on the instability appearance of capillary jets
have revealed the capabilities of linear spatiotemporal instability analysis to
predict the parametrical map where steady jetting or dripping takes place. In
this work, we present an extensive analytical, numerical and experimental
analysis of confined capillary jets extending previous studies. We propose an
extended, accurate analytic model in the limit of low Reynolds flows, and
introduce a numerical scheme to predict the system response when the liquid
inertia is not negligible. Theoretical predictions show a remarkable accuracy
with results from the extensive experimental exploration provided.
