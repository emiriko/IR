We have reflected a Stark-decelerated beam of OH molecules under normal
incidence from mirrors consisting of permanent magnets. Two different types of
magnetic mirrors have been demonstrated. A long-range flat mirror made from a
large disc magnet has been used to spatially focus the reflected beam in the
longitudinal direction ("bunching"). A short-range curved mirror composed of an
array of small cube magnets allows for transverse focusing of the reflected
beam.
