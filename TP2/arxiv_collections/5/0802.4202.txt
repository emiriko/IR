A quaternionic version of the Calabi problem on Monge-Ampere equation is
introduced. It is a quaternionic Monge-Ampere equation on a compact
hypercomplex manifold with an HKT-metric. The equation is non-linear elliptic
of second order. For a hypercomplex manifold with holonomy in SL(n;H),
uniqueness (up to a constant) of a solution is proven, as well as the zero
order a priori estimate. The existence of solution is conjectured, similar to
Calabi-Yau theorem. We reformulate this quaternionic equation as a special case
of a complex Hessian equation, making sense on any complex manifold.
