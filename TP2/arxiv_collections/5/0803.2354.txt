We find a general formula for the distribution of time averaged observables
for weakly non-ergodic systems. Such type of ergodicity breaking is known to
describe certain systems which exhibit anomalous fluctuations, e.g. blinking
quantum dots and the sub-diffusive continuous time random walk model. When the
fluctuations become normal we recover usual ergodic statistical mechanics.
Examples of a particle undergoing fractional dynamics in a binding force field
are worked out in detail. We briefly discuss possible physical applications in
single particle experiments.
