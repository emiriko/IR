Fast identification methods of pressure sensors are investigated. With regard
to a complete accurate sensor parameter identification two different
measurement methods are combined. The approach consists on one hand in
performing static measurements - an applied pressure results in a membrane
deformation measured interferometrically and the corresponding output voltage.
On the other hand optical measurements of the modal responses of the sensor
membranes are performed. This information is used in an inverse identification
algorithm to identify geometrical and material parameters based on a FE model.
The number of parameters to be identified is thereby generally limited only by
the number of measurable modal frequencies. A quantitative evaluation of the
identification results permits furthermore the classification of processing
errors like etching errors. Algorithms and identification results for membrane
thickness, intrinsic stress and output voltage will be discussed in this
contribution on the basis of the parameter identification of relative pressure
sensors.
