We apply Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) to investigate a set of
problems in a retail context. Specifically, we are working to understand the
relationship between human resource management practices and retail
productivity. Despite the fact we are working within a relatively novel and
complex domain, it is clear that intelligent agents do offer potential for
developing organizational capabilities in the future. Our multi-disciplinary
research team has worked with a UK department store to collect data and capture
perceptions about operations from actors within departments. Based on this case
study work, we have built a simulator that we present in this paper. We then
use the simulator to gather empirical evidence regarding two specific
management practices: empowerment and employee development.
