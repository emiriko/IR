We investigate the inverse freezing in the fermionic Ising spin-glass (FISG)
model in a transverse field $\Gamma$. The grand canonical potential is
calculated in the static approximation, replica symmetry and one-step replica
symmetry breaking Parisi scheme. It is argued that the average occupation per
site $n$ is strongly affected by $\Gamma$. As consequence, the boundary phase
is modified and, therefore, the reentrance associated with the inverse freezing
is modified too.
