The Fermi surfaces (FS) of LaOFeAs (in $k_z$=0 plane) consist of two
hole-type circles around $\Gamma$ point, which do not touch each other, and two
electron-type co-centered ellipses around M point, which are degenerate along
the M-X line. By first-principles calculations, here we show that additional
degeneracy exists for the two electron-type FS, and the crucial role of
F-doping and pressure is to enhance this orbital degeneracy. It is suggested
that the inter-orbital fluctuation is the key point to understand the
unconventional superconductivity in these materials.
