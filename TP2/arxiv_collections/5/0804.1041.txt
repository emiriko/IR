Let C be a compact and convex set in the plane that contains the origin in
its interior, and let S be a finite set of points in the plane. The Delaunay
graph DG_C(S) of S is defined to be the dual of the Voronoi diagram of S with
respect to the convex distance function defined by C. We prove that DG_C(S) is
a t-spanner for S, for some constant t that depends only on the shape of the
set C. Thus, for any two points p and q in S, the graph DG_C(S) contains a path
between p and q whose Euclidean length is at most t times the Euclidean
distance between p and q.
