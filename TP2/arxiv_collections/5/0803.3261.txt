The experimental realization of dynamo excitation as well as theoretical and
numerical examinations of the induction equation have shown the relevance of
boundary conditions for a self-sustaining dynamo.
  Within the interior of a field producing domain geometric constraints or
varying material properties (e.g. electrical conductivity of the container
walls or localized high-permeability material) might also play a role.
Combining a grid based finite volume approach with the boundary element method
in a hybrid FV-BEM scheme offers the flexibility of a local discretization with
a stringent treatment of insulating magnetic boundary conditions in almost
arbitrary geometries at comparatively low costs. Kinematic simulations of
dynamo action generated by a well known prescribed mean flow demonstrate the
reliability of the approach.
  Future examinations are intended to understand the behavior of the VKS-dynamo
experiment where the field producing flow is driven by ferrous propellers and
the induction effects of conductivity/permeability inhomogeneities might
provide the required conditions for the measured dynamo characteristics.
