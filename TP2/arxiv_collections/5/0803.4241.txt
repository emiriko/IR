The application of genetic algorithms (GAs) to many optimization problems in
organizations often results in good performance and high quality solutions. For
successful and efficient use of GAs, it is not enough to simply apply simple
GAs (SGAs). In addition, it is necessary to find a proper representation for
the problem and to develop appropriate search operators that fit well to the
properties of the genotype encoding. The representation must at least be able
to encode all possible solutions of an optimization problem, and genetic
operators such as crossover and mutation should be applicable to it. In this
paper, serial alternation strategies between two codings are formulated in the
framework of dynamic change of genotype encoding in GAs for function
optimization. Likewise, a new variant of GAs for difficult optimization
problems denoted {\it Split-and-Merge} GA (SM-GA) is developed using a parallel
implementation of an SGA and evolving a dynamic exchange of individual
representation in the context of Dual Coding concept. Numerical experiments
show that the evolved SM-GA significantly outperforms an SGA with static single
coding.
