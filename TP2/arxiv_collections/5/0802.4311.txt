We study multistep Bayesian betting strategies in coin-tossing games in the
framework of game-theoretic probability of Shafer and Vovk (2001). We show that
by a countable mixture of these strategies, a gambler or an investor can
exploit arbitrary patterns of deviations of nature's moves from independent
Bernoulli trials. We then apply our scheme to asset trading games in continuous
time and derive the exponential growth rate of the investor's capital when the
variation exponent of the asset price path deviates from two.
