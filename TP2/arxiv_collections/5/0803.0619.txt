$\rm BaBiO_3$ is characterized by a charge disproportionation with half of
the Bi atoms possessing a valence 3+ and half a valence 5+. Because of
selfinteraction errors, local and semi-local density functionals fail to
describe the charge disproportionation quantitatively, yielding a too small
structural distortion and no band gap. Using hybrid functionals we obtain a
satisfactory description of the structural, electronic, optical, and
vibrational properties of $\rm BaBiO_3$. The results obtained using GW (Green's
function G and screened Coulomb potential W) based schemes on top of hybrid
functionals, including fully selfconsistent GW calculations with vertex
corrections in the dielectric screening, qualitatively confirm the HSE picture
but a systematic overestimation of the bandgap by about 0.4 eV is observed.
