A general algebraic method of quantum corrections evaluation is presented.
Quantum corrections to a few classical solutions (kinks and periodic) of
Ginzburg-Landau (phi-in-quadro) and Sin-Gordon models are calculated in
arbitrary dimensions. The Green function for heat equation with a soliton
potential is constructed by means of Laplace transformation theory and Hermit
equation for the Green function transform. The generalized zeta-function is
used to evaluate the functional integral and quantum corrections to mass in
quasiclassical approximation.
