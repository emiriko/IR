Microscopic mechanisms of positive charge transfer in DNA remain unclear. A
quantum state of electron hole in DNA is determined by the competition of the
pi-stacking interaction $b$ sharing a charge between different base pairs and
the interaction $\lambda$ with the local environment which attempts to trap
charge. To determine which interaction dominates we investigated charge quantum
states in various $(GC)_{n}$ sequences choosing DNA parameters satisfying
experimental data for the balance of charge transfer rates $G^{+}
\leftrightarrow G_{n}^{+}$, $n=2,3$ \cite{FredMain}. We show that experimental
data can be consistent with theory only assuming $b\ll \lambda$ meaning that
charge is typically localized within the single $G$ site. Consequently any DNA
sequence including the one consisting of identical base pairs behaves more like
an insulating material then a molecular conductor. Our theory can be verified
experimentally, for instance measuring balance of charge transfer reactions
$G^{+} \leftrightarrow G_{n}^{+}$, $n \geq 4$ and comparing the experimental
results with our predictions.
