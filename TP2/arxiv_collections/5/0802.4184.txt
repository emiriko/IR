In this paper we investigate the superspin glass behavior of a concentrated
assembly of interacting maghemite nanoparticles and compare it to that of
canonical atomic spin glass systems. ac versus temperature and frequency
measurements show evidence of a superspin glass transition taking place at low
temperature. In order to fully characterize the superspin glass phase, the
aging behavior of both the thermo-remanent magnetization (TRM) and ac
susceptibility has been investigated. It is shown that the scaling laws obeyed
by superspin glasses and atomic spin glasses are essentially the same, after
subtraction of a superparamagnetic contribution from the superspin glass
response functions. Finally, we discuss a possible origin of this
superparamagnetic contribution in terms of dilute spin glass models.
