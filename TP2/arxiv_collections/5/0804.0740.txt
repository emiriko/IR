We experimentally analyze the complete photon number statistics of parametric
downconversion and ascertain the influence of multimode effects. Our results
clearly reveal a difference between single mode theoretical description and the
measured distributions. Further investigations assure the applicability of
loss-tolerant photon number reconstruction and prove strict photon number
correlation between signal and idler modes.
