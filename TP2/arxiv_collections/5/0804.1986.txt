We report the spontaneous formation of a plasma from a gas of cold Rydberg
molecules. Double-resonant laser excitation promotes nitric oxide, cooled to 1
K in a seeded supersonic molecular beam, to single Rydberg states extending as
deep as 80 cm$^{-1}$ below the lowest ionization threshold. The density of
excited molecules in the illuminated volume is as high as 1 x 10$^{13}$
cm$^{-3}$. This population evolves to produce prompt free electrons and a
durable cold plasma of electrons and intact NO$^{+}$ ions.
