The Komar integral relation of Einstein gravity is generalized to Lovelock
theories of gravity. This includes, in particular, a new boundary integral for
the Komar mass in Einstein gravity with a nonzero cosmological constant, which
has a finite result for asymptotically AdS black holes, without the need for an
infinite background subtraction. Explicit computations of the Komar mass are
given for black holes in pure Lovelock gravities of all orders and in general
Gauss-Bonnet theories.
