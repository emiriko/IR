Protein identification is one of the major task of Proteomics researchers.
Protein identification could be resumed by searching the best match between an
experimental mass spectrum and proteins from a database. Nevertheless this
approach can not be used to identify new proteins or protein variants. In this
paper an evolutionary approach is proposed to discover new proteins or protein
variants thanks a "de novo sequencing" method. This approach has been
experimented on a specific grid called Grid5000 with simulated spectra and also
real spectra.
