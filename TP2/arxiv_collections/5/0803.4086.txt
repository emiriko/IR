The subject of this report is the dynamics of elastic system in conjunction
with hydrogen bonds of the DNA. We draw attention to the draw-back of the
familiar rod model of the DNA, and make a case of constructing models that
could accommodate the intrinsic structure of the DNA. In this respect studying
the interplay among the elastic system and the protons of the DNA, is of
interest, for it could accommodate the inter-strand as well as the tunneling
modes of protons. Following this direction, we come to the conclusion that the
elastic-proton dynamics may have a bearing on biophysics of the DNA. The
phenomenon of point mutations is discussed within this framework.
