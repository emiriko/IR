We investigate the gauge-Higgs unification models within the scheme of the
coset space dimensional reduction, beginning with a gauge theory in a
fourteen-dimensional spacetime where extra-dimensional space has the structure
of a ten-dimensional compact coset space. We found seventeen phenomenologically
acceptable models through an exhaustive search for the candidates of the coset
spaces, the gauge group in fourteen dimension, and fermion representation. Of
the seventeen, ten models led to $\mathrm{SO}(10) (\times \mathrm{U}(1))$
GUT-like models after dimensional reduction, three models led to
$\mathrm{SU}(5) \times \mathrm{U}(1)$ GUT-like models, and four to
$\mathrm{SU}(3) \times \mathrm{SU}(2) \times \mathrm{U}(1) \times
\mathrm{U}(1)$ Standard-Model-like models. The combinations of the coset space,
the gauge group in the fourteen-dimensional spacetime, and the representation
of the fermion contents of such models are listed.
