The three-dimensional classical dimer model with interactions shows an
unexpected continuous phase transition between an ordered dimer crystal and a
Coulomb liquid. A detailed analysis of the critical dimer and monomer
correlation functions point to a subtle interplay between the fluctuations of
the crystal order parameter and the "magnetic" degrees of freedom present in
the Coulomb phase. The distribution probability of the crystal order parameter
suggests an emerging continuous O(3) symmetry at the critical point.
