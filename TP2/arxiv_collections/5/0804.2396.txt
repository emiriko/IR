We show theoretically that entangled photon pairs can be produced on demand
through the biexciton decay of a quantum dot strongly coupled to the modes of a
photonic crystal. The strong coupling allows to tune the energy of the mixed
exciton-photon (polariton) eigenmodes, and to overcome the natural splitting
existing between the exciton states coupled with different linear polarizations
of light. Polariton states are moreover well protected against dephasing due to
their lifetime ten to hundred times shorter than that of a bare exciton. Our
analysis shows that the scheme proposed can be achievable with the present
technology.
