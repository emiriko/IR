In the present discussion Background Independent framework of Quantum
Mechanics and its possible implications in the studies of gravity and Physics
at short distance are addressed. The expression of the metric of quantum state
space $g_{\mu\nu}$ which is intrinsically a quantized quantity, is identified
in terms of Compton wavelength as: $[<\partial_\mu\psi\mid\partial_\nu\psi> -
<\partial_\mu\psi\mid\psi> <\psi\mid\partial_\nu\psi>] = 1 / \lambdabar_C^2
(=m_0^2c^2 / \hbar^2})$. The discussion also sheds light on the notion of
neighborhood in quantum evolution, and various constraints on the possibilities
of smallness of distance in the quantum mechanical limits.
