A numerical method is presented which allows to compute the spectrum of the
Schroedinger operator for a particle constrained on a two dimensional flat
torus under the combined action of a transverse magnetic field and any
conservative force. The method employs a fast Fourier transform to accurately
represent the momentum variables and takes into account the twisted boundary
conditions required by the presence of the magnetic field. An accuracy of
twelve digits is attained even with coarse grids. Landau levels are reproduced
in the case of a uniform field satisfying Dirac's condition. A new fine
structure of levels within the single Landau level is formed when the field has
a sinusoidal component with period commensurable to the integer magnetic
charge.
