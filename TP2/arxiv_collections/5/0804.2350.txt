We determine the mass and strength of the scalar meson from NN scattering
data by renormalizing the One Boson Exchange Potential. This procedure provides
a great insensitivity to the unknown short distance interaction making the
vector mesons marginally important and allowing for SU(3) couplings in the 1S0
channel. The scalar meson parameters are tightly constrained by low energy np.
We discuss whether this scalar should be compared to the recent findings based
on the Roy equations analysis of pipi scattering.
