Heavy flavor baryons containing single and double charm (beauty) quarks with
light flavor combinations are studied using the hyper central description of
the three-body problem. The confinement potential is assumed as hyper central
coulomb plus power potential with power index $\upsilon$. The ground state
masses of the heavy flavor, $J^P={1/2}^+$ and ${3/2}^+$ baryons are computed
for different power index, $ \nu$ starting from 0.5 to 2.0. The predicted
masses are found to attain a saturated value in each case of quark combinations
beyond the power index $\nu=1.0$.
