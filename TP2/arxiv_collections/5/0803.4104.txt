We investigate the relation among slopes and intercepts of Regge trajectories
for mesons of a given spin and different parities using large N_c arguments and
the matching to perturbative QCD in the deep-Minkowski region. For spin-1
mesons of opposite parities we prove that: a) for large and increasing N_c, the
scale \Lambda^{(V,A)} separating the resonance-dominated and the
perturbative-saturated region in the channels V,A grows as \sqrt{N_c}; b) to
satisfy the Weinberg sum rules the slopes of Regge trajectories for mesons of
opposite parities must coincide; c) their intercepts may differ and their
difference corresponds to the difference between \Lambda^V and \Lambda^A. Some
arguments indicate that this difference should tend to zero as N_c\to\infty.
