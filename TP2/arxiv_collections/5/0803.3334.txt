We formulate a Swendsen-Wang-like version of the geometric cluster algorithm.
As an application,we study the hard-core lattice gas on the triangular lattice
with the first- and the second-neighbor exclusions. The data are analyzed by
finite-size scaling, but the possible existence of logarithmic corrections is
not considered due to the limited data. We determine the critical chemical
potential as $\mu_c=1.75682 (2)$ and the critical particle density as
$\rho_c=0.180(4)$. The thermal and magnetic exponents $y_t=1.51(1) \approx 3/2$
and $y_h=1.8748 (8) \approx 15/8$, estimated from Binder ratio $Q$ and
susceptibility $\chi$, strongly support the general belief that the model is in
the 4-state Potts universality class. On the other hand, the analyses of
energy-like quantities yield the thermal exponent $y_t$ ranging from $1.440(5)$
to $1.470(5)$. These values differ significantly from the expected value 3/2,
and thus imply the existence of logarithmic corrections.
