We discuss steady state crack growth in the spirit of a free boundary
problem. It turns out that mode I and mode III situations are very different
from each other: In particular, mode III exhibits a pronounced transition
towards unstable crack growth at higher driving forces, and the behavior close
to the Griffith point is determined entirely through crack surface dissipation,
whereas in mode I the fracture energy is renormalized due to a remaining finite
viscous dissipation. Intermediate mixed-mode scenarios allow steady state crack
growth with higher velocities, leading to the conjecture that mode I cracks can
be unstable with respect to a rotation of the crack front line.
