In antecedent experiments the electron screening energies of the d+d
reactions in metallic environments have been determined to be enhanced by an
order of magnitude in comparison to the case of gaseous deuterium targets. The
analytical models describing averaged material properties have not been able to
explain the experimental results so far. Therefore, a first effort has been
undertaken to simulate the dynamics of reacting deuterons in a metallic lattice
by means of an ab-initio Hartree-Fock calculation of the total electrostatic
force between the lattice and the successively approaching deuterons via path
integration. The calculations have been performed for Li and Ta, clearly
showing a migration of electrons from host metallic to the deuterium atoms.
However, in order to avoid more of the necessary simplifications in the model
the utilization of a massive parallel supercomputer would be required.
