Control scenarios have been identified where the use of randomized design may
substantially improve the performance of dynamical decoupling methods [L. F.
Santos and L. Viola, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 97}, 150501 (2006)]. Here, by
focusing on the suppression of internal unwanted interactions in closed quantum
systems, we review and further elaborate on the advantages of randomization at
long evolution times. By way of illustration, special emphasis is devoted to
isolated Heisenberg-coupled chains of spin-1/2 particles. In particular, for
nearest-neighbor interactions, two types of decoupling cycles are contrasted:
inefficient averaging, whereby the number of control actions increases
exponentially with the system size, and efficient averaging associated to a
fixed-size control group. The latter allows for analytical and numerical
studies of efficient decoupling schemes created by exploiting and merging
together randomization and deterministic strategies, such as symmetrization,
concatenation, and cyclic permutations. Notably, sequences capable to remove
interactions up to third order are explicitly constructed. The consequences of
faulty controls are also analyzed.
