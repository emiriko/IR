In this note we propose an encryption communication protocol which also
provides database security. For the encryption of the data communication we use
a transformation similar to the Cubic Public-key transformation. This method
represents a many-to-one mapping which increases the complexity for any brute
force attack. Some interesting properties of the transformation are also
included which are basic in the authentication protocol.
