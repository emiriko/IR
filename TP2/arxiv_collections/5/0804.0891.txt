We prove the unconditional security of an entanglement-based
quantum-key-distribution protocol using detectors that respond to multiple
modes of light and cannot distinguish between one from two or more photons.
Even with such practical detectors, any defect in the source is automatically
detected as an increase in the error rate or in the rate of double clicks.
