We give evidence that the functional renormalization group (FRG), developed
to study disordered systems, may provide a field theoretic description for the
loop-erased random walk (LERW), allowing to compute its fractal dimension in a
systematic expansion in epsilon=4-d. Up to two loop, the FRG agrees with
rigorous bounds, correctly reproduces the leading logarithmic corrections at
the upper critical dimension d=4, and compares well with numerical studies. We
obtain the universal subleading logarithmic correction in d=4, which can be
used as a further test of the conjecture.
