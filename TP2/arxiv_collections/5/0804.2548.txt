Using variational cluster approach, we study influence of frustration and
dimensionality on magnetic properties in the ground state of Hubbard model on a
stacked square lattice in the large $U$ region (U/t=10), by changing the
next-nearest-neighbor hopping, $t^{\prime}$, and the interlayer hopping,
$t_{\perp}$. For small $t_{\perp}<t^{\ast}_{\perp}$ with
$t^{\ast}_{\perp}/t{\approx}0.44$, antiferromagnetic long-range order appears
at small $t^{\prime}<t^{\prime}_{c_{1}}$, and collinear magnetic long-range
order at large $t^{\prime}>t^{\prime}_{c_{2}}$. They are separated by a
paramagnetic Mott insulating state which appears in the parameter region
$t^{\prime}_{c_{1}}<t^{\prime}<t^{\prime}_{c_{2}}$. For large
$t_{\perp}>t^{\ast}_{\perp}$, the paramagnetic Mott insulating state disappears
and a direct transition between antiferromagnetic state and collinear magnetic
state occurs at $t^{\prime}=t^{\prime}_{c_{3}}$. We also find that the
transition from the antiferromagnetic state to the paramagnetic Mott insulating
state is of the second-order and that from the collinear magnetic state to the
paramagnetic Mott insulating or the antiferromagnetic state is of the
first-order.
