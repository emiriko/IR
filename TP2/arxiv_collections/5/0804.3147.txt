Observables in elastic proton-deuteron scattering are sensitive probes of the
nucleon-nucleon interaction and three-nucleon force effects. The present
experimental data base for this reaction is large, but contains a large
discrepancy between data sets for the differential cross section taken at 135
MeV/nucleon by two experimental research groups. This paper reviews the
background of this problem and presents new data taken at KVI. Differential
cross sections and analyzing powers for the $^{2}{\rm H}(\vec p,d){p}$ and
${\rm H}(\vec d,d){p}$ reactions at 135 MeV/nucleon and 65 MeV/nucleon,
respectively, have been measured. The data differ significantly from previous
measurements and consistently follow the energy dependence as expected from an
interpolation of published data taken over a large range at intermediate
energies.
