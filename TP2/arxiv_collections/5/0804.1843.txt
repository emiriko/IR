We analyze the inclusive decay mode $B\to X_s+{\rm Missing Energy}$ in the
unparticle model, where an unparticle can also serve as the missing energy. We
use the Heavy Quark Effective Theory in the calculation. The analytical result
of the decay width in the free quark limit and that of the differential decay
rate to the order of $1/m_b^2$ are presented. Numerical results of the
inclusive mode show interesting differences from those of the exclusive modes.
Near the lower endpoint region, the $d_{\mathcal U}<2$ unparticle has very
different behavior from the Standard Model particles.
