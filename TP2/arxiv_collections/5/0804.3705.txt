We consider a Bose gas with an attractive interaction in a symmetric double
well potential. In the Hartree approximation, the ground state solution
spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the trapping potential above certain value
of the interaction strength. We demonstrate how the Landau-Ginzburg scheme of
the second order phase transition emerges from the quantum model and show its
link to the spontaneous symmetry breaking mentioned above. We identify the
order parameter, the critical point and analyze quantum fluctuations around it.
