We categorify the highest weight integrable representations and their tensor
products of a symmetric quantum Kac-Moody algebra. As byproducts, we obtain a
geometric realization of Lusztig's canonical bases of these representations as
well as a new positivity result. The main ingredient in the underlying
geometric construction is a class of micro-local perverse sheaves on quiver
varieties.
