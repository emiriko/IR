Motivated by recent experiments on Faraday waves in Bose Einstein condensates
(BEC) we investigate the dynamics of two component cigar shaped BEC subject to
periodic modulation of the strength of the transverse confinement. It is shown
that two coupled Mathieu equations govern the dynamics of the system. We found
that the two component BEC in a phase mixed state is relatively more unstable
towards pattern formation than the phase segregated state.
