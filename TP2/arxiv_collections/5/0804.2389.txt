We consider Regge calculus in the representation in terms of area tensors and
self- and antiselfdual connections generalised to the case of Holst action that
is standard Einstein action in the tetrad-connection variables plus topological
(on equations of motion for connections) term with coefficient $1/\gamma$,
$\gamma$ is Barbero-Immirzi parameter. The quantum measure is shown to
exponentially decrease with areas with typical cut-off scales $4\pi G$ and
$4\pi G\gamma$ in spacelike and timelike regions, respectively ($G$ is the
Newton constant).
