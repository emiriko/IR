We report micro-photoluminescence studies of single GaN/AlN quantum dots
grown along the (0001) crystal axis by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111)
substrates. The emission lines exhibit a linear polarization along the growth
plane, but with varying magnitudes of the polarization degree and with
principal polarization axes that do not necessarily correspond to
crystallographic directions. Moreover, we could not observe any splitting of
polarized emission lines, at least within the spectral resolution of our setup
(1 meV). We propose a model based on the joint effects of electron-hole
exchange interaction and in-plane anisotropy of strain and/or quantum dot
shape, in order to explain the quantitative differences between our
observations and those previously reported on, e.g. CdTe- or InAs-based quantum
dots.
