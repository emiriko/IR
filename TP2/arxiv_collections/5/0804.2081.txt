We have fabricated graphene devices with a top gate separated from the
graphene layer by an air gap--a design which does not decrease the mobility of
charge carriers under the gate. This gate is used to realise p-n-p structures
where the conducting properties of chiral carriers are studied. The band
profile of the structures is calculated taking into account the specifics of
the graphene density of states and is used to find the resistance of the p-n
junctions expected for chiral carriers. We show that ballistic p-n junctions
have larger resistance than diffusive ones. This is caused by suppressed
transmission of chiral carriers at angles away from the normal to the junction.
