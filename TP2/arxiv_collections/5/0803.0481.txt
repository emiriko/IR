In the framework of the seesaw models with triplets of fermions, we evaluate
the decay rates of $\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\tau \to l \gamma$ transitions. We
show that although, due to neutrino mass constraints, those rates are in
general expected to be well under the present experimental limits, this is not
necessarily always the case. Interestingly enough, the observation of one of
those decays in planned experiments would nevertheless contradict bounds
stemming from present experimental limits on the $\mu \to eee$ and $\tau \to 3
l$ decay rates. Such detection of radiative decays would therefore imply that
there exist sources of lepton flavour violation not associated to triplet
fermions.
