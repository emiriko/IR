We theoretically study a cavity filled with atoms, which provides the
optical-mechanical interaction between the modified cavity photonic field and a
movable mirror at one end. We show that the cavity field ``dresses'' these
atoms, producing two types of polaritons, effectively enhancing the radiation
pressure of the cavity field upon the end mirror, as well as establishing an
additional squeezing mode of the end mirror. This squeezing produces an
adiabatic entanglement, which is absent in usual vacuum cavities, between the
oscillating mirror and the rest of the system. We analyze the entanglement and
quantify it using the Loschmidt echo and fidelity.
