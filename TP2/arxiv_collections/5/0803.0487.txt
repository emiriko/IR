For a class of large-N multi-matrix models, we identify a group G that plays
the same role as the group of loops on space-time does for Yang-Mills theory. G
is the spectrum of a commutative shuffle-deconcatenation Hopf algebra that we
associate to correlations. G is the exponential of the free Lie algebra. The
generating series of correlations is a function on G and satisfies quadratic
equations in convolution. These factorized Schwinger-Dyson or loop equations
involve a collection of Schwinger-Dyson operators, which are shown to be
right-invariant vector fields on G, one for each linearly independent primitive
of the Hopf algebra. A large class of formal matrix models satisfying these
properties are identified, including as special cases, the zero momentum limits
of the Gaussian, Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills field theories. Moreover, the
Schwinger-Dyson operators of the continuum Yang-Mills action are shown to be
right-invariant derivations of the shuffle-deconcatenation Hopf algebra
generated by sources labeled by position and polarization.
