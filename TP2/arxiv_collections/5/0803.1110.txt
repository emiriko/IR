An algorithm is presented for the computation of the topology of a
non-reduced space curve defined as the intersection of two implicit algebraic
surfaces. It computes a Piecewise Linear Structure (PLS) isotopic to the
original space curve. The algorithm is designed to provide the exact result for
all inputs. It's a symbolic-numeric algorithm based on subresultant
computation. Simple algebraic criteria are given to certify the output of the
algorithm. The algorithm uses only one projection of the non-reduced space
curve augmented with adjacency information around some "particular points" of
the space curve. The algorithm is implemented with the Mathemagix Computer
Algebra System (CAS) using the SYNAPS library as a backend.
