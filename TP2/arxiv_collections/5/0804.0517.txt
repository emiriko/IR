We construct a class of singular integral operators associated with
homogeneous Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund standard kernels on $d$-dimensional, $d <1$,
Sierpinski gaskets $E_d$. These operators are bounded in $L^2(\mu_d)$ and their
principal values diverge $\mu_d$ almost everywhere, where $\mu_d$ is the
natural (d-dimensional) measure on $E_d$.
