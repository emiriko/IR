We present a detailed calculation of intensities of two-phonon and
four-phonon Raman peaks in graphene. Writing the low-energy hamiltonian of the
interaction of electrons with the crystal vibrations and the electromagnetic
field from pure symmetry considerations, we describe the system in terms of
just a few independent coupling constants, considered to be parameters of the
theory. The electron scattering rate is introduced phenomenologically as
another parameter. The results of the calculation are used to extract
information about these parameters from the experimentally measured Raman peak
intensities.
