We investigate the effect of curvature on the behaviour of a quantum particle
bound to move on a surface shaped as a helical tube. We derive and discuss the
governing Schr\"odinger equation and the corresponding quantum effective
potential which is periodic and points to the helical configuration as more
energetically favorable as compared to the straight tube. The exhibited
periodicity also leads to energy band structure of pure geometrical origin.
