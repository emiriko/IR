We find that the drag force for a heavy quark moving through N=4 SU(N_c)
supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma is generally enhanced by the leading
correction due to finite 't Hooft coupling. For a bottom quark, the drag force
increases by about 50%, whereas for a charm quark it increases by about 5%. We
also discuss the drag force for the case of Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
