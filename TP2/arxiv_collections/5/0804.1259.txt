We discuss the calculation of the 1-loop effective action on four
dimensional, canonically deformed Euclidean space. The theory under
consideration is a scalar $\phi^4$ model with an additional oscillator
potential. This model is known to be re normalisable. Furthermore, we couple an
exterior gauge field to the scalar field and extract the dynamics for the gauge
field from the divergent terms of the 1-loop effective action using a matrix
basis. This results in proposing an action for noncommutative gauge theory,
which is a candidate for a renormalisable model.
