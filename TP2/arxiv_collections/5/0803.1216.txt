We present a microresonator-based system capable of simultaneously producing
time-advanced and time-delayed pulses. The effect is based on the combination
of a sharp spectral feature with two orthogonally-polarized propagating
waveguide modes. We include an experimental proof-of-concept implementation
using a silica microsphere coupled to a tapered optical fiber and use a
time-domain picture to interpret the observed delays. We also discuss potential
applications for future all-optical networks.
