We study the behaviour of the Binder cumulant on finite square lattices at
the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition. We determine the fixed point value of
the Binder cumulant and the coefficient of the leading logarithmic correction.
These calculations are supplemented with Monte Carlo simulations of the
classical XY (plane rotator) model, the Villain model and the dual of the
absolute value solid-on-solid model. Using the single cluster algorithm, we
simulate lattices up to L=4096. For the lattice sizes reached, subleading
corrections are needed to fit the data for the Binder cumulant. We demonstrate
that the combined analysis of the Binder cumulant and the second moment
correlation length over the lattice size allows for an accurate determination
of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature on relatively small lattices.
We test the new method at the example of the 2-component phi^4 model on the
lattice.
