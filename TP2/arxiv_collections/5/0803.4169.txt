Pulsed-field magnetization experiments (fields $B$ of up to 85 T and
temperatures $T$ down to 0.4 K) are reported on nine organic Cu-based
two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg magnets. All compounds show a low-$T$
magnetization that is concave as a function of $B$, with a sharp ``elbow''
transition to a constant value at a field $B_{\rm c}$. Monte-Carlo simulations
including a finite interlayer exchange energy $J_{\perp}$ quantitatively
reproduce the data; the concavity indicates the effective dimensionality and
$B_{\rm c}$ is an accurate measure of the in-plane exchange energy $J$. Using
these values and Ne\'el temperatures measured by muon-spin rotation, it is also
possible to obtain a quantitative estimate of $|J_{\perp}/J|$. In the light of
these results, it is suggested that in magnets of the form
[Cu(HF$_2$)(pyz)$_2$]X, where X is an anion, the sizes of $J$ and $J_{\perp}$
are controlled by the tilting of the pyrazine (pyz) molecule with respect to
the 2D planes.
