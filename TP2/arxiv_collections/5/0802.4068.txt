For each Frobenius algebra there is defined a skein module of surfaces
embedded in a given 3-manifold and bounding a prescribed curve system in the
boundary. The skein relations are local and generate the kernel of a certain
natural extension of the corresponding topological quantum field theory. In
particular the skein module of the 3-ball is isomorphic to the ground ring of
the Frobenius algebra. We prove a presentation theorem for the skein module
with generators incompressible surfaces colored by elements of a generating set
of the Frobenius algebra, and with relations determined by tubing geometry in
the manifold and relations of the algebra.
