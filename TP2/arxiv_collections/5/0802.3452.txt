We produce, on general homogeneous groups, an analogue of the usual
H\"ormander pseudodifferential calculus on Euclidean space, at least as far as
products and adjoints are concerned. In contrast to earlier works, we do not
limit ourselves to analogues of classical symbols, nor to the Heisenberg group.
The key technique is to understand ``multipliers'' of any given order j, and
the operators of convolution with their inverse Fourier transforms, which we
here call convolution operators of order j. (Here a ``multiplier'' is an
analogue of a H\"ormander-type symbol a(x,\xi), which is independent of x.)
Specifically, we characterize the space of inverse Fourier transforms of
multipliers of any order j, and use this characterization to show that the
composition of convolution operators of order j_1 and j_2 is a convolution
operator of order j_1+j_2.
