We derive the wall crossing formula for the decay of a quarter BPS dyon into
a pair of half-BPS dyons by analyzing the quantum dynamics of multi-centered
black holes in N=4 supersymmetric string theories. Our analysis encompasses the
cases where the final decay products are non-primitive dyons. The results are
in agreement with the microscopic formula for the dyon spectrum in the special
case of heterotic string theory on T^6.
