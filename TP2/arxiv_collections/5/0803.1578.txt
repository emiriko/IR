We analyze the experimental observation of metastable anisotropy resistance
orientation at half filled quantum Hall fluids by means of a model of a quantum
nematic liquid in an explicit symmetry breaking potential. We interpret the
observed ``rotation'' of the anisotropy axis as a process of nucleation of
nematic domains and compute the nucleation rate within this model. By comparing
with experiment, we are able to predict the critical radius of nematic bubbles,
$R_c\sim 2.6 \mu m $. Each domain contains about $10^4$ electrons.
