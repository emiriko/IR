Antilla, Ball and Perissinaki proved that the squares of coordinate functions
in $\ell_p^n$ are negatively correlated. This paper extends their results to
balls in generalized Orlicz norms on R^n. From this, the concentration of the
Euclidean norm and a form of the Central Limit Theorem for the generalized
Orlicz balls is deduced. Also, a counterexample for the square negative
correlation hypothesis for 1-symmetric bodies is given.
  Currently the CLT is known in full generality for convex bodies (see the
paper "Power-law estimates for the central limit theorem for convex sets" by B.
Klartag), while for generalized Orlicz balls a much more general result is true
(see "The negative association property for the absolute values of random
variables equidistributed on a generalized Orlicz ball" by M. Pilipczuk and J.
O. Wojtaszczyk). While, however, both aforementioned papers are rather long,
complicated and technical, this paper gives a simple and elementary proof of,
eg., the Euclidean concentration for generalized Orlicz balls.
