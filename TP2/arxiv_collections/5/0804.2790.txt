It is revisited the Michelson-Morley experiment within the quantum mechanics
framework. One can define the wave function of photon in the whole space at a
given moment of time. The phase difference between the source and receiver is a
distance between the source and receiver at the time of reception hence it does
not depend on the velocity of the frame. Then one can explain the null result
of the Michelson-Morley experiment within the quantum mechanics framework.
