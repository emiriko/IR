We give an introduction into quantum cosmology with emphasis on its
conceptual parts. After a general motivation we review the formalism of
canonical quantum gravity on which discussions of quantum cosmology are usually
based. We then present the minisuperspace Wheeler--DeWitt equation and
elaborate on the problem of time, the imposition of boundary conditions, the
semiclassical approximation, the origin of irreversibility, and singularity
avoidance. Restriction is made to quantum geometrodynamics; loop quantum
gravity and string theory are discussed in other contributions to this volume.
