Recently, a new class of $W$-states has been defined by Agarwal and Pati
\cite{agarwal} and it has been shown that they can be used as a quantum channel
for teleportation and superdense coding. In this work, we identify those
three-qubit states from the set of the new class of $W$-states which are most
efficient or suitable for quantum teleportation. We show that with some
probability $|W_1>=(1/2)(|100>+|010>+\sqrt{2}|001>)$ is best suited for
teleportation channel in the sense that it does not depend on the input state.
