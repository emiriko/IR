Using 383 million BBbar pairs from the BaBar data sample, we report results
for branching fractions of six charged B-meson decay modes, where a charged
kaon recoils against a charmless resonance decaying to KKbar* or etapipi final
states with mass in the range (1.2-1.8)gev/c^2. We observe a significant
enhancement at the low KK*bar invariant mass which is interpreted as B+ -->
eta(1475)K+, find evidence for the decay B+ --> eta(1295)K+, and place upper
limits on the decays B+ --> eta(1405)K+, B+ --> f_1(1285)K+, B+ -->
f_1(1420)K+, and B+ --> phi(1680)K+.
