We theoretically study the recently observed tunnel-barrier-enhanced dc
voltage signals generated by magnetization precession in magnetic tunnel
junctions. While the spin pumping is suppressed by the high tunneling
impedance, two complimentary processes are predicted to result in a sizable
voltage generation in ferromagnet (F)|insulator (I)|normal-metal (N) and F|I|F
junctions, with one ferromagnet being resonantly excited. Magnetic dynamics in
F|I|F systems induces a robust charge pumping, translating into voltage in open
circuits. In addition, dynamics in a single ferromagnetic layer develops
longitudinal spin accumulation inside the ferromagnet. A tunnel barrier then
acts as a nonintrusive probe that converts the spin accumulation into a
measurable voltage. Neither of the proposed mechanisms suffers from spin
relaxation, which is typically fast on the scale of the exponentially slow
tunneling rates. The longitudinal spin-accumulation buildup, however, is very
sensitive to the phenomenological ingredients of the spin-relaxation picture.
