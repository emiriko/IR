Finite-size fluctuations in coevolutionary dynamics arise in models of
biological as well as of social and economic systems. This brief tutorial
review surveys a systematic approach starting from a stochastic process
discrete both in time and state. The limit $N\to \infty$ of an infinite
population can be considered explicitly, generally leading to a replicator-type
equation in zero order, and to a Fokker-Planck-type equation in first order in
$1/\sqrt{N}$. Consequences and relations to some previous approaches are
outlined.
