An empirically validated, phenomenological model relating the parameters of
an astronomical body to the stochastic fluctuations of its granular components
is generalized in terms of fractal scaling laws. The mass of the particle
constituting the preponderance of the mass of a typical galaxy is determined
from the generalized model as a function of the fractal dimension. For a
fractal dimension between 1 and 3 the mass of the dominant particle in galaxies
is, roughly, between the Planck mass and 1eV. If the dimension is near 2 then
the fractal model is identical to the original stochastic model, and the mass
of the dominant particle must be of order near the nucleon mass. Two additional
expressions for the mass of the dominant particle in the universe are obtained
from basic quantum considerations and from the existence of a cosmological
constant. It follows that the fractal dimension 2 is favored and that the mass
of the dominant particle is proportional to sixth root of the cosmological
constant and of order near the nucleon mass.
