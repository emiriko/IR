The nature of spin wave modes excited by spin-polarized direct current in a
spin-torque auto-oscillator based on a magnetic nanocontact was studied by a
micromagnetic simulation in the case when the external bias magnetic field was
rotated from the in-plane to perpendicular-to-plane orientation. In qualitative
agreement with the weakly-nonlinear analytical theory it was found, that at a
certain critical angle, an abrupt switching from the self-localized nonlinear
"bullet" mode to a propagating quasi-linear Slonczewski mode takes place, and
is accompanied by an upward jump in generated microwave frequency. It was,
also, found that the analytical theory overestimates the magnitude of a
critical magnetization angle, corresponding to the mode switching, and that the
magnitude of the frequency jump caused by the mode switching is inversely
proportional to the nanocontact radius.
