A modified generally covariant Yang-Mills action, which depends on the
complex structure of spacetime and not its metric, is proved to be
renormalizable. This proof makes this Lagrangian model the unique known
generally covariant four dimensional model to be renormalizable without higher
order derivatives. The first order one-loop diagrams are computed in an
appropriate gauge condition and they are found to be finite.
