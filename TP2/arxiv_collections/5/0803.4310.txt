We investigate theoretically the Rashba spin-orbit interaction in InAs/GaSb
quantum wells(QWs). We find that the Rashba spin-splitting (RSS) depends
sensitively on the thickness of the InAs layer. The RSS exhibits nonlinear
behavior for narrow InAs/GaSb QWs and the oscillating feature for wide
InAs/GaSb QWs. The nonlinear and oscillating behaviors arise from the weakened
and enhanced interband coupling. The RSS also show asymmetric features respect
to the direction of the external electric field.
