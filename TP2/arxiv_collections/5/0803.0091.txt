The structures of proteins exhibit secondary elements composed of helices and
loops. Comparison of several water-only hydrophobicity scales with the
functionalities of two repeat proteins shows that these secondary elements
possess water-induced medium-range order that is sometimes similar, but can
also be complementary, to structural order. Study of these hitherto "phantom"
order parameters promises far-reaching incremental improvements in the theory
of protein dynamics. A by-product of the theory is an independent evaluation of
the reliability of different hydrophobicity scales.
