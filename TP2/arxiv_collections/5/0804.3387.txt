We have investigated the validity of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
(FDT) and the applicability of the concept of effective temperature in a number
of non-equilibrium soft glassy materials. Using a combination of passive and
active microrheology to measure displacement fluctuations and the mechanical
response function of probe particles embedded in the materials, we have
directly tested the validity of the FDT. Our results show no violation of the
FDT over several decades in frequency (1-10$^4$ Hz) for hard sphere colloidal
glasses and colloidal glasses and gels of Laponite. We further extended the
bandwidth of our measurements to lower frequencies (down to 0.1 Hz) using video
microscopy to measure the displacement fluctuations, again without finding any
deviations from the FDT.
