We report on the magnetic properties of the manganite Bi_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_3
(x=0.33) at low temperature. The analysis of the field expansion of the ac
susceptibility and the observation of aging properties make clear that a spin
glass phase appears below T = 39K, in the presence of magnetic order. Neutron
scattering shows both magnetic Bragg scattering and magnetic diffusion at small
angles, and confirms this coexistence. In contrast to Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_3
(x=0.3-0.33) which exhibits a mesoscopic phase separation responsible for a
field driven percolation, the glassy and short range ferromagnetic order
observed here does not cause colossal magnetoresistance (CMR).
