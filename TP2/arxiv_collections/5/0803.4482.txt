The inspiral of a stellar mass compact object falling into a massive Kerr
black hole can be broken into three different regimes: An adiabatic inspiral
phase, where the inspiral timescale is much larger than the orbital period; a
late-time radial infall, which can be approximated as a plunging geodesic; and
a regime where the body transitions from the inspiral to plunge. In earlier
work, Ori and Thorne have outlined a method to compute the trajectory during
this transition for a compact object in a circular, equatorial orbit. We
generalize this technique to include inclination and eccentricity.
