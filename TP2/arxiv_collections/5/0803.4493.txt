We use the Mellin-Barnes representation in order to improve the theoretical
estimate of mass corrections to the width of light pseudoscalar meson decay
into a lepton pair, $P\to l^+l^-$ . The full resummation of the terms
$\ln(m_l^2/\Lambda^2)(m_l^2/\Lambda^2)^n$ and $(m_l^2/\Lambda^2)^n$ to the
decay amplitude is performed, where $m_l$ is the lepton mass and
$\Lambda\approx m_\rho$ is the characteristic scale of the
$P\to\gamma^*\gamma^*$ form factor. The total effect of mass corrections for
the $e^+e^-$ channel is negligible and for the $\mu^+\mu^-$ channel its order
is of a few per cent.
