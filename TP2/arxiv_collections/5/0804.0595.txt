Type II supergravity on backgrounds admitting SU(3) x SU(3) structure and
general fluxes is considered. Using the generalized geometry formalism, we
study dimensional reductions leading to N=2 gauged supergravity in four
dimensions, possibly with tensor multiplets. In particular, a geometric formula
for the full N=2 scalar potential is given. Then we implement a truncation
ansatz, and derive the complete N=2 bosonic action. While the NSNS contribution
is obtained via a direct dimensional reduction, the contribution of the RR
sector is computed starting from the democratic formulation and demanding
consistency with the reduced equations of motion.
