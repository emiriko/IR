We explicate an example of the so called Task oriented Maximally Entangled
states (TMES) in the context of teleportation and superdense coding. In
physical situation, this state can emerge from decoherence of more entangled
state or may be prepared for the purpose at hand, with less entanglement
resource. We find that a variant of the Brown state can be utilized for perfect
teleportation of single and two qubit states. In case of superdense coding, it
is observed that five cbits can be transmitted by sending only three qubits.
