A brief account of the zero temperature magnetic response of a system of
strongly correlated electrons in strong magnetic field is given in terms of its
quasiparticle properties. The scenario is based on the paramagnetic phase of
the half-filled Hubbard model, and the calculations are carried out with the
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) together with the numerical renormalization
group (NRG). As well known, in a certain parameter regime one finds a magnetic
susceptibility which increases with the field strength. Here, we analyze this
metamagnetic response based on Fermi liquid parameters, which can be calculated
within the DMFT-NRG procedure. The results indicate that the metamagnetic
response can be driven by field-induced effective mass enhancement. However,
also the contribution due to quasiparticle interactions can play a significant
role. We put our results in context with experimental studies of itinerant
metamagnetic materials.
