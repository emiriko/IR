We present a theory of momentum space local density-of-states (LDOS) maps
N(q,omega) in graphene. The LDOS map has both intravalley contributions
centered near zero momentum and reciprocal lattice vectors and intervalley
contributions displaced by the wavevector K'-K which connects graphene's two
distinct Dirac points. Using graphene's Dirac equation chiral quasiparticle
continuum model, we obtain analytic results which explain the qualitative
differences between these two LDOS map features. We comment on the sensitivity
of both N(q,omega) features to the mix of atomic length scale and smooth
disorder sources present in a particular graphene sample.
