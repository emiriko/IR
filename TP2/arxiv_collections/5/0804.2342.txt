Collective excitations spectrum of Dirac electrons in mono and bilayer
graphene in the presence of a uniform magnetic field is investigated.
Analytical results for inter-Landau band plasmon spectrum within the
self-consistent-field approach are obtained. SdH type oscillations that are a
monotonic function of the magnetic field are observed in the plasmon spectrum
of both mono- and bi-layer graphene systems. The results presented are also
compared with those obtained in conventional 2DEG. The chiral nature of the
quasiparticles in mono and bilayer graphene system results in the observation
of $\pi$ and $2\pi$ Berry's phase in the SdH- type oscillations in the plasmon
spectrum.
