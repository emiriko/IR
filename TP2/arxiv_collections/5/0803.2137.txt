We report on a search for large extra dimensions in a data sample of
approximately 1 fb^{-1} of ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. We
investigate Kaluza-Klein graviton production with a photon and missing
transverse energy in the final state. At the 95% C.L. we set limits on the
fundamental mass scale M_{D} from 884 GeV to 778 GeV for two to eight extra
dimensions.
