We study the dynamics of quantum entanglement between two Unruh-DeWitt
detectors, one stationary (Alice), and another uniformly accelerating (Rob),
with no direct interaction but coupled to a common quantum field in (3+1)D
Minkowski space. We find that for all cases studied the initial entanglement
between the detectors disappears in a finite time ("sudden death"). After the
moment of total disentanglement the correlations between the two detectors
remain nonzero until late times. The relation between the disentanglement time
and Rob's proper acceleration is observer dependent. The larger the
acceleration is, the longer the disentanglement time in Alice's coordinate, but
the shorter in Rob's coordinate.
