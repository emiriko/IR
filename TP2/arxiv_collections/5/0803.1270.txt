It is a well-known fact that genetic sequences may contain sections with
repeated units, called repeats, that differ in length over a population, with a
length distribution of geometric type. A simple class of recombination models
with single crossovers is analysed that result in equilibrium distributions of
this type. Due to the nonlinear and infinite-dimensional nature of these
models, their analysis requires some nontrivial tools from measure theory and
functional analysis, which makes them interesting also from a mathematical
point of view. In particular, they can be viewed as quadratic, hence nonlinear,
analogues of Markov chains.
