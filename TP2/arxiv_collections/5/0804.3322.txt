We describe a search for the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral sources in the Round
1B Mock LISA Data Challenge data sets. The search algorithm is a Monte-Carlo
search based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, but also incorporates
simulated, thermostated and time annealing, plus a harmonic identification
stage designed to reduce the chance of the chain locking onto secondary maxima.
In this paper, we focus on describing the algorithm that we have been
developing. We give the results of the search of the Round 1B data, although
parameter recovery has improved since that deadline. Finally, we describe
several modifications to the search pipeline that we are currently
investigating for incorporation in future searches.
