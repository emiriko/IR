We study analytically and by means of an off-lattice bead-spring dynamic
Monte Carlo simulation model the adsorption kinetics of a single macromolecule
on a structureless flat substrate in the regime of strong physisorption. The
underlying notion of a ``stem-flower'' polymer conformation, and the related
mechanism of ``zipping'' during the adsorption process are shown to lead to a
Fokker-Planck equation with reflecting boundary conditions for the
time-dependent probability distribution function (PDF) of the number of
adsorbed monomers. The theoretical treatment predicts that the mean fraction of
adsorbed segments grows with time as a power law with a power of $(1+\nu)^{-1}$
where $\nu\approx 3/5$ is the Flory exponent. The instantaneous distribution of
train lengths is predicted to follow an exponential relationship. The
corresponding PDFs for loops and tails are also derived. The complete solution
for the time-dependent PDF of the number of adsorbed monomers is obtained
numerically from the set of discrete coupled differential equations and shown
to be in perfect agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation results. In addition
to homopolymer adsorption, we study also regular multiblock copolymers and
random copolymers, and demonstrate that their adsorption kinetics may be
considered within the same theoretical model.
