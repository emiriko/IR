Strongly interacting gauge mediation (SIGM) of supersymmetry breaking is very
attractive, since it naturally predicts a light gravitino of mass $\lsim{\cal
O}(10)$ eV, which causes no cosmological problem. We discuss various signatures
of the SIGM in the early stage (a low integrated luminosity period) of the LHC
experiments. We show, in particular, a possible way to discriminate it from the
conventional gauge mediation by counting the number of high $P_{\rm T}$
leptons.
