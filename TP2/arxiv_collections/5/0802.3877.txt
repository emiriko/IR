Consider a system of $N$ bosons in three dimensions interacting via a
repulsive short range pair potential $N^2V(N(x_i-x_j))$, where $\bx=(x_1, >...,
x_N)$ denotes the positions of the particles. Let $H_N$ denote the Hamiltonian
of the system and let $\psi_{N,t}$ be the solution to the Schr\"odinger
equation. Suppose that the initial data $\psi_{N,0}$ satisfies the energy
condition \[ < \psi_{N,0}, H_N \psi_{N,0} > \leq C N >. \] and that the
one-particle density matrix converges to a projection as $N \to \infty$. Then,
we prove that the $k$-particle density matrices of $\psi_{N,t}$ factorize in
the limit $N \to \infty$. Moreover, the one particle orbital wave function
solves the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a cubic non-linear
Schr\"odinger equation with the coupling constant proportional to the
scattering length of the potential $V$. In \cite{ESY}, we proved the same
statement under the condition that the interaction potential $V$ is
sufficiently small; in the present work we develop a new approach that requires
no restriction on the size of the potential.
