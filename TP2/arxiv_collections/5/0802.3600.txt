Microcanonical equations for several thermodynamic properties of a system,
suitable for molecular dynamics simulations, are derived from the nonextensive
Tsallis entropy functional. Two possible definitions of temperature, the usual
one and a ``physical'' modification which satisfies the zeroth law of
thermodynamics, are considered, and the results from both choices are compared.
Results for the ideal gas using the first definition of temperature are
provided and discussed in relation with the canonical results reported in the
literature. The second choice leaves most formulae unchanged from their
extensive (Shannon-Boltzmann-Gibbs) form.
