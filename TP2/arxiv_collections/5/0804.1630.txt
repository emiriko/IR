In this paper, we extended road-based topological analysis to both nationwide
and urban road networks, and concentrated on a sensitivity study with respect
to the formation of self-organized natural roads based on the Gestalt principle
of good continuity. Both Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and Global
Positioning System (GPS) data were used to correlate with a series of ranking
metrics including five centrality-based metrics and two PageRank metrics. It
was found that there exists a tipping point from segment-based to road-based
network topology in terms of correlation between ranking metrics and their
traffic. To our big surprise, (1) this correlation is significantly improved if
a selfish rather than utopian strategy is adopted in forming the self-organized
natural roads, and (2) point-based metrics assigned by summation into
individual roads tend to have a much better correlation with traffic flow than
line-based metrics. These counter-intuitive surprising findings constitute
emergent properties of self-organized natural roads, which are intelligent
enough for predicting traffic flow, thus shedding substantial insights into the
understanding of road networks and their traffic from the perspective of
complex networks.
