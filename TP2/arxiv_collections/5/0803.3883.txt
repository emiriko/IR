We present an approach for the semiclassical treatment of open quantum
systems. An expansion into localized states allows restriction of a simulation
to a fraction of the environment that is located within a predefined vicinity
of the system. Adding and dropping environmental particles during the
simulation yields an effective reduction of the size of the system that is
being treated.
