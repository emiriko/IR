We consider positive travelling fronts of the time-delayed reaction-diffusion
equation with the monostable birth function. Our main result says that for
every fixed and sufficiently large velocity c, the positive travelling front is
unique (modulo translations). To prove the uniqueness, we introduce a small
parameter 1/c and realize the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction in a scale of Banach
spaces.
