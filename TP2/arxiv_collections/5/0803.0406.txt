Dissipation may cause two initially entangled qubits to evolve into a
separable state in a finite time. This behavior is called entanglement sudden
death (ESD). We study to what extent quantum error correction can combat ESD.
We find that in some cases quantum error correction can delay entanglement
sudden death but in other cases quantum error correction may cause ESD for
states that otherwise do not suffer from it. Our analysis also shows that
fidelity may not be the best measure to compare the efficiency of different
error correction codes since the fidelity is not directly coupled to a state's
remaining entanglement.
