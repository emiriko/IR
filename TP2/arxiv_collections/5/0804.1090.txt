Using space-, time- and phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering
spectroscopy we investigate the difference in phase of the two
counterpropagating spin waves excited by the same microwave microstrip
transducer. These studies are performed both for backward volume magnetostatic
waves and magnetostatic surface waves in an in-plane magnetized yttrium iron
garnet film. The experiments show that for the backward volume magnetostatic
spin waves (which are reciprocal and excited symmetrically in amplitude) there
is a phase difference of $\pi$ associated with the excitation process and thus
the phase symmetry is distorted. On the contrary, for the magnetostatic surface
spin waves (which are non-reciprocal and unsymmetrical in amplitude) the phase
symmetry is preserved (there is no phase difference between the two waves
associated with the excitation). Theoretical analysis confirms this effect.
