Several research groups are giving special attention to quantum walks
recently, because this research area have been used with success in the
development of new efficient quantum algorithms. A general simulator of quantum
walks is very important for the development of this area, since it allows the
researchers to focus on the mathematical and physical aspects of the research
instead of deviating the efforts to the implementation of specific numerical
simulations. In this paper we present QWalk, a quantum walk simulator for one-
and two-dimensional lattices. Finite two-dimensional lattices with generic
topologies can be used. Decoherence can be simulated by performing measurements
or by breaking links of the lattice. We use examples to explain the usage of
the software and to show some recent results of the literature that are easily
reproduced by the simulator.
