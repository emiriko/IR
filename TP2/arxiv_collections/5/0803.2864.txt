Exact time-dependent solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equation for
a spherical mass moving with arbitrarily high constant velocity are derived and
analyzed. The threshold conditions required for gravitational repulsion of
particles at rest are determined as a function of source speed and field
strength and particle position.
