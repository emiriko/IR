Geometry, electronic structure, and magnetic properties of TMNan (TM=Cr-Ni; n
= 4-7) clusters are studied within a gradient corrected density functional
theory (DFT) framework. Two complementary approaches, the first adapted to
all-electron calculations on free clusters, and the second been on plane wave
projector augmented wave (PAW) method within a supercell approach are used.
Except for NiNan, the clusters in this series are found to retain the atomic
moments of the TM atoms, and the magnetic moment presented an odd-even
oscillation with respect to the number of Na atoms. The origin of these
odd-even oscillations is explained from the nature of chemical bonding in these
clusters. Differences and similarities between the chemical bonding and the
magnetic properties of these clusters and the TMNan (TM = Sc, V and Ti; n =
4-6) clusters on one hand, and TM-doped Au and Ag clusters on the other hand,
are discussed.
