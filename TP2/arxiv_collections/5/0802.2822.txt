We analyze qubit channels by exploiting the possibility of representing
two-level quantum systems in terms of characteristic functions. To do so, we
use functions of non-commuting variables (Grassmann variables), defined in
terms of generalized displacement operators, following an approach which
resemble the one adopted for continuous-variable (Bosonic) systems. It allows
us to introduce the notion of qubit Gaussian channels and to show that they
share similar properties with the corresponding continuous-variable
counterpart. Some examples of qubit channels are investigated using this
approach.
