Simulation studies are undertaken for the system Ag/Au(100) by means of grand
canonical Monte Carlo applied to a large lattice system. The interactions are
calculated using the embedded atom model. The formation of adsorbed Ag phases
of low dimensionality on Ag(100) is investigated and the influence of surface
defects on the shape of the adsorption isotherms is studied. The results of the
simulations are discussed in the light of experimental information available
from electrochemical measurements.
