The implication of chiral symmetry for the pion-induced dissociation of the
J/psi is examined in detail. It is shown how the low-energy dynamics of pions,
constrained by chiral symmetry, affect the dissociation cross-section. The
derived soft-pion theorem is then integrated into a Lagrangian model which
includes also abnormal parity content and chiral-symmetric form factors.
Dissociation by the rho meson is also considered.
