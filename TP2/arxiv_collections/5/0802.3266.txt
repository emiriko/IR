We calculate the emission rate of Hawking radiation from the cosmological
horizon by quantum tunneling approaches. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi and the null
geodesic methods, two typical observations are obtained. First, the spectrum of
radiation is not strictly pure thermal. Second, the value of the cosmological
constant decreases. Our calculation is different from other similar works about
Hawking radiation from the cosmological horizon in that the horizon does not
shrink but expands by taking into account the back-reaction effect. We show
that when a positive frequency particle is materialized near the cosmological
horizon, the contribution of a negative frequency partner to the background
geometry lowers the value of the cosmological constant. We also touch upon
thermodynamics of de Sitter space and the quantum creation of universe.
