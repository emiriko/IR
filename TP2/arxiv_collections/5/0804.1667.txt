LF is a dependent type theory in which many other formal systems can be
conveniently embedded. However, correct use of LF relies on nontrivial
metatheoretic developments such as proofs of correctness of decision procedures
for LF's judgments. Although detailed informal proofs of these properties have
been published, they have not been formally verified in a theorem prover. We
have formalized these properties within Isabelle/HOL using the Nominal Datatype
Package, closely following a recent article by Harper and Pfenning. In the
process, we identified and resolved a gap in one of the proofs and a small
number of minor lacunae in others. We also formally derive a version of the
type checking algorithm from which Isabelle/HOL can generate executable code.
Besides its intrinsic interest, our formalization provides a foundation for
studying the adequacy of LF encodings, the correctness of Twelf-style
metatheoretic reasoning, and the metatheory of extensions to LF.
