The author offers a new kind of thermonuclear reflect reactor. The remarkable
feature of this new reactor is a three net AB reflector, which confines the
high temperature plasma. The plasma loses part of its energy when it contacts
with the net but this loss can be compensated by an additional permanent plasma
heating. When the plasma is rarefied (has a small density), the heat flow to
the AB reflector is not large and the temperature in the triple reflector net
is lower than 2000 - 3000 K. This offered AB-reactor has significantly less
power then the currently contemplated power reactors with magnetic or inertial
confinement (hundreds-thousands of kW, not millions of kW). But it is enough
for many vehicles and ships and particularly valuable for tunnelers, subs and
space apparatus, where air to burn chemical fuel is at a premium or simply not
available.
  The author has made a number of innovations in this reactor, researched its
theory, developed methods of computation, made a sample computation of typical
project. The main point of preference for the offered reactor is its likely
cheapness as a power source.
  Key words: Micro-thermonuclear reactor, Multi-reflex AB-thermonuclear
reactor, Self-magnetic AB-thermonuclear reactor, aerospace thermonuclear
engine.
