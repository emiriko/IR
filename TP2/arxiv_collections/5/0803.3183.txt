The well-known Deutsch Algorithm (DA) and Deutsch-Jozsha Algorithm (DJA) both
are used as an evidence to the power of quantum computers over classical
computation mediums. In these theoretical experiments, it has been shown that a
quantum computer can find the answer with certainty within a few steps although
classical electronic systems must evaluate more iterations than quantum
computer. In this paper, it is shown that a classical computation system formed
by using ordinary electronic parts may perform the same task with equal
performance than quantum computers. DA and DJA quantum circuits act like an
analog computer, so it is unfair to compare the bit of classical digital
computers with the qubit of quantum computers. An analog signal carrying wire
will of course carry more information that a bit carrying wire without serial
communication protocols.
