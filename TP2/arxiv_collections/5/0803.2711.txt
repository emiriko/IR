The paper elucidates, with an analytic example, a subtle mistake in the
application of the extended likelihood method to the problem of determining the
fractions of pure samples in a mixed sample from the shape of the distribution
of a random variable. This mistake, which affects two widely used software
packages, leads to a misestimate of the errors.
