We have calculated the neutron electric dipole moment (NEDM) in the presence
of the CP violating $\theta$ term in lattice QCD with 2-flavor dynamical clover
quarks, using the external electric field method. Accumulating a large number
of statistics by the averages over 16 different source points and over forward
and backward nucleon propagators, we have obtained non-zero signals of neutron
and proton EDM beyond one standard deviation at each quark mass in full QCD. We
have investigated the quark mass dependence of nucleon EDM in full QCD, and
have found that nucleon EDM in full QCD does not decrease toward the chiral
limit, as opposed to the theoretical expectation. We briefly discuss possible
reasons for this behavior.
