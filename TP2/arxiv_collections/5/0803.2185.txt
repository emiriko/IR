We have performed x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS), and resonant photoemission spectroscopy (RPES) measurements
of Mn-implanted 3$C$-SiC (3$C$-SiC:Mn) and carbon-incorporated Mn$_{5}$Si$_{2}$
(Mn$_{5}$Si$_{2}$:C). The Mn 2$p$ core-level XPS and XAS spectra of 3$C$-SiC:Mn
and Mn$_{5}$Si$_{2}$:C were similar to each other and showed "intermediate"
behaviors between the localized and itinerant Mn 3$d$ states.
  The intensity at the Fermi level was found to be suppressed in 3$C$-SiC:Mn
compared with Mn$_{5}$Si$_{2}$:C. These observations are consistent with the
formation of Mn$_{5}$Si$_{2}$:C clusters in the 3$C$-SiC host, as observed in a
recent transmission electron microscopy study.
