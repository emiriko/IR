A boundary layer turbulence index (TIBL) product has been developed to assess
the potential for turbulence in the lower troposphere, generated using RUC-2
numerical model data. The index algorithm approximates boundary layer turbulent
kinetic energy by parameterizing vertical wind shear, responsible for
mechanical production of TKE, and kinematic heat flux, parameterized by the
vertical temperature lapse rate and responsible for buoyant production of TKE.
Validation for the TIBL product has been conducted for selected nonconvective
wind events during the 2008 winter season over the Idaho National Laboratory
mesonet domain. This paper presents studies of four significant wind events
between December 2007 and February 2008 over southeastern Idaho. Based on the
favorable results highlighted from validation statistics and in the case
studies, the RUC TIBL product has demonstrated operational utility in assessing
turbulence hazards to low-flying aircraft and ground transportation, and in the
assessment of wildfire threat.
