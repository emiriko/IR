Geometric routing algorithms like GFG (GPSR) are lightweight, scalable
algorithms that can be used to route in resource-constrained ad hoc wireless
networks. However, such algorithms run on planar graphs only. To efficiently
construct a planar graph, they require a unit-disk graph. To make the topology
unit-disk, the maximum link length in the network has to be selected
conservatively. In practical setting this leads to the designs where the node
density is rather high. Moreover, the network diameter of a planar subgraph is
greater than the original graph, which leads to longer routes. To remedy this
problem, we propose a void traversal algorithm that works on arbitrary
geometric graphs. We describe how to use this algorithm for geometric routing
with guaranteed delivery and compare its performance with GFG.
