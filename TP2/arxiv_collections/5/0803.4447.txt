We consider the longitudinal hydrodynamic evolution of the fireball created
in a relativistic heavy-ion collision. Nonzero shear viscosity reduces the
colling rate of the system and hinders the acceleration of the longitudinal
flow. As a consequence, the initial energy density needed to reproduce the
experimental data at RHIC energies is significantly reduced. At LHC energies,
we expect that shear viscosity helps to conserve a Bjorken plateau in the
rapidity distributions during the expansion.
