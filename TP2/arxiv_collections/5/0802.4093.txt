We demonstrate that the formation of a chiral d-density wave (CDDW) state
generates a Topological Meissner effect (TME) in the absence of any kind of
superconductivity. The TME is identical to the usual superconducting Meissner
effect but it appears only for magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane while
it is absent for in plane fields. The observed enhanced diamagnetic signals in
the non-superconducting pseudogap regime of the cuprates may find an
alternative interpretation in terms of a TME, originating from a chiral
d-density wave pseudogap.
