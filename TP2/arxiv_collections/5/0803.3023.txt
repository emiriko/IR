The magneto-optical absorption properties of graphene multilayers are
theoretically studied. It is shown that the spectrum can be decomposed into
sub-components effectively identical to the monolayer or bilayer graphene,
allowing us to understand the spectrum systematically as a function of the
layer number. Odd-layered graphenes always exhibit absorption peaks which
shifts in proportion to sqrt(B), with B being the magnetic field, due to the
existence of an effective monolayer-like subband. We propose a possibility of
observing the monolayer-like spectrum even in a mixture of multilayer graphene
films with various layers numbers.
