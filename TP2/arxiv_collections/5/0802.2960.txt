We present an implementation of a Monte Carlo algorithm that generates points
randomly and uniformly on a set of arbitrary surfaces. The algorithm is
completely general and only requires the geometry modeling software to provide
the intersection points of an arbitrary line with the surface being sampled. We
demonstrate the algorithm using the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. The
efficiency of the sampling algorithm is discussed, along with various options
in the implementation and example applications.
