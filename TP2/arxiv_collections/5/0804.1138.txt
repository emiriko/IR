We have studied transport properties in a two-dimensional electron gas with
equal Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions under a perpendicular
magnetic field. By employing the exact solution for this system, we found
resonant charge and spin Hall conductances at a certain magnetic field, where
all the nearest-neighboring Landau levels cross. Near this value of magnetic
field, there exists a resonant spin polarization, which can also induce
resonant charge and spin Hall effects.
