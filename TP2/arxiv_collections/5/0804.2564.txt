We study polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to the modified
Laguerre weight $z^{-n + \nu} e^{-Nz} (z-1)^{2b}$ in the limit where $n, N \to
\infty$ with $N/n \to 1$ and $\nu$ is a fixed number in $\mathbb{R} \setminus
\mathbb{N}_0$. With the effect of the factor $(z-1)^{2b}$, the local parametrix
near the critical point $z =1$ can be constructed in terms of $\Psi$-functions
associated with the Painleve IV equation. We show that the asymptotics of the
recurrence coefficients of orthogonal polynomials can be described in terms of
specified solution of the Painleve IV equation in the double scaling limit. Our
method is based on the Deift/Zhou steepest decent analysis of the
Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with orthogonal polynomials.
