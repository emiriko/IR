Plasmas are usually described using classical equations. While this is often
a good approximation, where are situations when a quantum description is
motivated. In this paper we will include several quantum effects, ranging from
particle dispersion, which give raise to the so called Bohm potential, to spin
effects, and to quantum electrodynamical effects. The later effects appears
when the field strength approaches the Schwinger critical field, which may
occur in for example astrophysical systems. Examples of how to model such
quantum effects will be presented, and the phenomena resulting from these
models will be discussed.
