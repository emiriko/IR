We study effects of unparticle physics on muon g-2 and LFV tau decay
processes. LFV interactions between the Standard Model sector and unparticles
can explain the difference of experimental value of muon g-2 from the Standard
Model prediction. While the same couplings generate LFV tau decay, we found
that LFV coupling can be of O(0.1 ... 1) without conflict with experimental
bounds of LFV tau decay if the scaling dimension of unparticle operator d_{U} >
1.6.
