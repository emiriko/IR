We construct the invisible quantum barrier which represents the phenomenon of
quantum reflection using the available data. We use the Abel equation to invert
the data. The resulting invisible quantum barrier is double-valued in both
axes. We study this invisible barrier in the case of atom and Bose-Einstein
Condensate reflection from a solid silicon surface. A time-dependent,
one-spatial dimension Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved for the BEC case. We
found that the BEC behaves very similarly to the single atom except for size
effects, which manifest themselves in a maximum in the reflectivity at small
distances from the wall. The effect of the atom-atom interaction on the BEC
reflection and correspondingly on the invisible barrier is found to be
appreciable at low velocities and comparable to the finite size effect. The
trapping of ultracold atom or BEC between two walls is discussed.
