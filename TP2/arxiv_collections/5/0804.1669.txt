We discuss the problem of determining the complete weight hierarchy of linear
error correcting codes associated to Grassmann varieties and, more generally,
to Schubert varieties in Grassmannians. The problem is partially solved in the
case of Grassmann codes, and one of the solutions uses the combinatorial notion
of a closed family. We propose a generalization of this to what is called a
subclose family. A number of properties of subclose families are proved, and
its connection with the notion of threshold graphs and graphs with maximum sum
of squares of vertex degrees is outlined.
