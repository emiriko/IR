Calculations, performed in Thomas-Fermi approximation, show that the energy
of a condensed phase of molecular metallic oxygen is lower by 496 kJ/mol than
that of an insulator oxygen phase. The insulator phase is separated from a
metallic one by energetic barrier of 1165 kJ/mol. This barrier could be
overcome by means of electromagnetic irradiation with quantum energy of 12.071
eV or a bit higher. During such a transition the amount of energy equal to 496
kJ/mol is released. It should be extracted from a sample to secure the
existence of a metallic phase.
