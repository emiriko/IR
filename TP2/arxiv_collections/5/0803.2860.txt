Budding from the plasma membrane of the host cell is an indispensable step in
the life cycle of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which belongs to a
large family of enveloped RNA viruses, retroviruses. Unlike regular enveloped
viruses, retrovirus budding happens {\em concurrently} with the self-assembly
of retrovirus protein subunits (Gags) into spherical virus capsids on the cell
membrane. Led by this unique budding and assembly mechanism, we study the free
energy profile of retrovirus budding, taking into account of the Gag-Gag
attraction energy and the membrane elastic energy. We find that if the Gag-Gag
attraction is strong, budding always proceeds to completion. During early stage
of budding, the zenith angle of partial budded capsids, $\alpha$, increases
with time as $\alpha \propto t^{1/3}$. However, when Gag-Gag attraction is
weak, a metastable state of partial budding appears. The zenith angle of these
partially spherical capsids is given by
$\alpha_0\simeq(\tau^2/\kappa\sigma)^{1/4}$ in a linear approximation, where
$\kappa$ and $\sigma$ are the bending modulus and the surface tension of the
membrane, and $\tau$ is a line tension of the capsid proportional to the
strength of Gag-Gag attraction. Numerically, we find $\alpha_0<0.3\pi$ without
any approximations. Using experimental parameters, we show that HIV budding and
assembly always proceed to completion in normal biological conditions. On the
other hand, by changing Gag-Gag interaction strength or membrane rigidity, it
is relatively easy to tune it back and forth between complete budding and
partial budding. Our model agrees reasonably well with experiments observing
partial budding of retroviruses including HIV.
