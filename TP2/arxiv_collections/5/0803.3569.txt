Investigations within the local spin density functional theory (LSDF) of the
intermetallic hydride system $ {\rm CeRhSnH_x} $ were carried out for discrete
model compositions in the range $ 0.33 \leq x_H \leq 1.33 $. The aim of this
study is to assess the change of the cerium valence state in the neighborhood
of the experimental hydride composition, $ {\rm CeRhSnH_{0.8}} $. In agreement
with experiment, the analyses of the electronic and magnetic structures and of
the chemical bonding properties point to trivalent cerium for $ 1 \leq x_H \leq
1.33 $. In contrast, for lower hydrogen amounts the hydride system stays in an
intermediate-valent state for cerium, like in $ {\rm CeRhSn} $. The influence
of the insertion of hydrogen is addressed from both the volume expansion and
chemical bonding effects. The latter are found to have the main influence on
the change of Ce valence character. Spin polarized calculations point to a
finite magnetic moment carried by the Ce $ 4f $ states; its magnitude increases
with $ x_H $ in the range $ 1 \leq x_H \leq 1.33 $.
