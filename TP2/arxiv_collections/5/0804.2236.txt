We study anomalous scaling and multiscaling of two-dimensional crack profiles
in the random fuse model using both periodic and open boundary conditions. Our
large scale and extensively sampled numerical results reveal the importance of
crack branching and coalescence of microcracks, which induce jumps in the
solid-on-solid crack profiles. Removal of overhangs (jumps) in the crack
profiles eliminates the multiscaling observed in earlier studies and reduces
anomalous scaling. We find that the probability density distribution $p(\Delta
h(\ell))$ of the height differences $\Delta h(\ell) = [h(x+\ell) - h(x)]$ of
the crack profile obtained after removing the jumps in the profiles has the
scaling form $p(\Delta h(\ell)) = <\Delta h^2(\ell)>^{-1/2} ~f(\frac{\Delta
h(\ell)}{<\Delta h^2(\ell)>^{1/2}})$, and follows a Gaussian distribution even
for small bin sizes $\ell$. The anomalous scaling can be summarized with the
scaling relation $[\frac{<\Delta h^2(\ell)>^{1/2}}{<\Delta
h^2(L/2)>^{1/2}}]^{1/\zeta_{loc}} + \frac{(\ell-L/2)^2}{(L/2)^2} = 1$, where
$<\Delta h^2(L/2)>^{1/2} \sim L^{\zeta}$.
