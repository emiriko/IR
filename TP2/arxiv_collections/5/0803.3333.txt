In this paper, it is shown why Lorentz Transformation implies the general
case where observed events are not necessarily in the inertia frame of any
observer but assumes a special scenario when determining the length contraction
and time dilation factors. It is shown that this limitation has led to
mathematical and physical inconsistencies. The paper explains the conditions
for a successful theory of time dilation and length contraction, and provides a
simple proof to a new generalized transformation of coordinate systems as the
only possible solution that meets those conditions. It discusses
inconsistencies of Lorentz Transformation, and shows how the new generalized
transformation resolves those apparent inconsistencies. The new transformation
agrees with Special Relativity on its conclusions of time dilation and space
contraction, and yields the same law of addition of velocities as proposed in
Lorentz Transformation.
