A stylized compressed sensing radar is proposed in which the time-frequency
plane is discretized into an N by N grid. Assuming the number of targets K is
small (i.e., K much less than N^2), then we can transmit a sufficiently
"incoherent" pulse and employ the techniques of compressed sensing to
reconstruct the target scene. A theoretical upper bound on the sparsity K is
presented. Numerical simulations verify that even better performance can be
achieved in practice. This novel compressed sensing approach offers great
potential for better resolution over classical radar.
