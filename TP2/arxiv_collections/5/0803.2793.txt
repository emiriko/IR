We study the interplay of disorder and correlation in the one-dimensional
hole-doped Hubbard-model with disorder (Anderson-Hubbard model) by using the
density-matrix renormalization group method. Concentrating on the doped-hole
density profile, we find in a large $U/t$ regime that the clean system exhibits
a simple fluid-like behavior whereas finite disorders create locally Mott
regions which expand their area with increasing the disorder strength contrary
to the ordinary sense. We propose that such an anomalous Mott phase formation
assisted by disorder is observable in atomic Fermi gases by setup of the box
shape trap.
