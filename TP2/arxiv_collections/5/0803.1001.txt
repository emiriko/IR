The representation of science as a citation-density landscape and the study
of scaling rules with the field-specific citation-density as a main topological
property was previously analysed at the level of research groups. Here the
focus is on the individual researcher. In this new analysis, the
size-dependence of several main bibliometric indicators for a large set of
individual researchers is explored. Similar results as those previously
observed for research groups are here described for individual researchers,
reinforcing the idea of prevalent scaling rules in the representation of
science as a citation-density landscape. Differences among thematic areas with
different citation densities are discussed.
