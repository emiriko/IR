We study the supersymmetric model with $D_4 \times Z_2$ lepton flavor
symmetry. We evaluate soft supersymmetry breaking terms, i.e. soft slepton
masses and A-terms, which are predicted in the $D_4$ flavor model. We consider
constraints due to experiments of flavor changing neutral current processes.
