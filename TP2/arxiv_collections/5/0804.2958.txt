When outcomes are missing for reasons beyond an investigator's control, there
are two different ways to adjust a parameter estimate for covariates that may
be related both to the outcome and to missingness. One approach is to model the
relationships between the covariates and the outcome and use those
relationships to predict the missing values. Another is to model the
probabilities of missingness given the covariates and incorporate them into a
weighted or stratified estimate. Doubly robust (DR) procedures apply both types
of model simultaneously and produce a consistent estimate of the parameter if
either of the two models has been correctly specified. In this article, we show
that DR estimates can be constructed in many ways. We compare the performance
of various DR and non-DR estimates of a population mean in a simulated example
where both models are incorrect but neither is grossly misspecified. Methods
that use inverse-probabilities as weights, whether they are DR or not, are
sensitive to misspecification of the propensity model when some estimated
propensities are small. Many DR methods perform better than simple
inverse-probability weighting. None of the DR methods we tried, however,
improved upon the performance of simple regression-based prediction of the
missing values. This study does not represent every missing-data problem that
will arise in practice. But it does demonstrate that, in at least some
settings, two wrong models are not better than one.
