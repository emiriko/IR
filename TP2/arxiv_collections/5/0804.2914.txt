The penetration depth of FFLO d-wave superconductors is calculated, in
presence of additional magnetic field for both parallel and perpendicular to
the internal FFLO magnetic field, when the nonlocal effects are dominated. The
generalized Gorkov equations have been used to obtain the linearized response
kernel. It is shown that extra term added to total kernel with no spatially gap
is proportional to the momentum of FFLO Cooper pairs, Q. For the case parallel
to the internal FFLO magnetic field, below a crossover temperature T*, it is
shown that Lambda(T)-Lambda(0) is proportional to T^3 for both specular
reflecting and diffusive boundary. It is noted that both terms in penetration
depth with and without Q dependence have the same temperature dependence but
magnetic field dependence are different(the terms without and with Q dependence
are proportional to 1/h' and 1/(h'^2) respectively). Also nonlocal effect on
penetration depth of FFLO state in reign T>>T* obtains temperature dependence
T^4. Furthermore, when external magnetic test-field is perpendicular to
internal FFLO magnetic field, it is shown that nonlocal effects on penetration
depth give the same Q and temperature dependence as the parallel case but with
different internal and additional magnetic field dependences.
