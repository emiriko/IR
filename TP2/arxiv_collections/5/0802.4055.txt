We apply a variational technique to solve the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation for Bose-Einstein condensates in which an additional dipole-dipole
interaction between the atoms is present with the goal of modelling the
dynamics of such condensates. We show that universal stability thresholds for
the collapse of the condensates correspond to bifurcation points where always
two stationary solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation disappear in a
tangent bifurcation, one dynamically stable and the other unstable. We point
out that the thresholds also correspond to "exceptional points," i.e. branching
singularities of the Hamiltonian. We analyse the dynamics of excited condensate
wave functions via Poincare surfaces of section for the condensate parameters
and find both regular and chaotic motion, corresponding to (quasi-)
periodically oscillating and irregularly fluctuating condensates, respectively.
Stable islands are found to persist up to energies well above the saddle point
of the mean-field energy, alongside with collapsing modes. The results are
applicable when the shape of the condensate is axisymmetric.
