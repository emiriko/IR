It is now widely accepted that environmental entanglement and the resulting
decoherence processes play a crucial role in the quantum-to-classical
transition and the emergence of "classicality" from quantum mechanics. To this
extent, decoherence is often understood as signifying a break with the
Copenhagen interpretation, and in particular with Bohr's view of the
indispensability of classical concepts. This paper analyzes the relationship
between Bohr's understanding of the quantum-classical divide and his doctrine
of classical concepts and the decoherence-based program of emergent
classicality. By drawing on Howard's reconstruction of Bohr's doctrine of
classical concepts, and by paying careful attention to a hitherto overlooked
disagreement between Heisenberg and Bohr in the 1930s about the placement of
the quantum-classical "cut," we show that Bohr's view of the quantum-classical
divide can be physically justified by appealing to decoherence. We also discuss
early anticipations of the role of the environment in the quantum-classical
problem in Heisenberg's writings. Finally, we distinguish four different
formulations of the doctrine of classical concepts in an effort to present a
more nuanced assessment of the relationship between Bohr's views and
decoherence that challenges oversimplified statements frequently found in the
literature.
