We have fabricated an array of closely spaced quantum dashes starting from a
planar array of self-assembled semiconductor quantum wires. The array is
embedded in a metallic nanogap which we investigate by micro-photoluminescence
as a function of a lateral electric field. We demonstrate that the net electric
charge and emission energy of individual quantum dashes can be modified
externally with performance limited by the size inhomogeneity of the
self-assembling process.
