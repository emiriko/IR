Electron field emission characteristics of individual multiwalled carbon
nanotubes have been investigated by a piezoelectric nanomanipulation system
operating inside a scanning electron microscopy chamber. The experimental setup
ensures a high control capability on the geometric parameters of the field
emission system (CNT length, diameter and anode-cathode distance). For several
multiwalled carbon nanotubes, reproducible and quite stable emission current
behaviour has been obtained with a dependence on the applied voltage well
described by a series resistance modified Fowler-Nordheim model. A turn-on
field of about 30 V/um and a field enhancement factor of around 100 at a
cathode-anode distance of the order of 1 um have been evaluated. Finally, the
effect of selective electron beam irradiation on the nanotube field emission
capabilities has been extensively investigated.
