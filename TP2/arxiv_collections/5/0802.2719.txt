The recently fabricated two-dimensional magnetic materials Cu9X2(cpa)6.xH2O
(cpa=2-carboxypentonic acid; X=F,Cl,Br) have copper sites which form a
triangular kagome lattice (TKL), formed by introducing small triangles
(``a-trimers'') inside of each kagome triangle (``b-trimer''). We show that in
the limit where spins residing on b-trimers have Ising character, quantum
fluctuations of XXZ spins residing on the a-trimers can be exactly accounted
for in the absence of applied field. This is accomplished through a mapping to
the kagome Ising model, for which exact analytic solutions exist. We derive the
complete finite temperature phase diagram for this XXZ-Ising model, including
the residual zero temperature entropies of the seven ground state phases.
Whereas the disordered (spin liquid) ground state of the pure Ising TKL model
has macroscopic residual entropy ln72=4.2767... per unit cell, the introduction
of transverse(quantum) couplings between neighboring $a$-spins reduces this
entropy to 2.5258... per unit cell. In the presence of applied magnetic field,
we map the TKL XXZ-Ising model to the kagome Ising model with three-spin
interactions, and derive the ground state phase diagram. A small (or even
infinitesimal) field leads to a new phase that corresponds to a
non-intersecting loop gas on the kagome lattice, with entropy 1.4053... per
unit cell and a mean magnetization for the b-spins of 0.12(1) per site. In
addition, we find that for moderate applied field, there is a critical spin
liquid phase which maps to close-packed dimers on the honeycomb lattice, which
survives even when the a-spins are in the Heisenberg limit.
