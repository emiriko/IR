A natural hierarchical framework for network topology abstraction is
presented based on an analogy with the Kadanoff transformation and
renormalisation group in theoretical physics. Some properties of the
renormalisation group bear similarities to the scalability properties of
network routing protocols (interactions). Central to our abstraction are two
intimately connected and complementary path diversity units: simple cycles, and
cycle adjacencies. A recursive network abstraction procedure is presented,
together with an associated generic recursive routing protocol family that
offers many desirable features.
