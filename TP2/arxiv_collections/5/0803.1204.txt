Experiments are carried out with a globally coupled, externally forced
population of limit-cycle electrochemical oscillators with an approximately
unimodal distribution of heterogeneities. Global coupling induces mutually
entrained (at frequency $\omega_{1}$) states; periodic forcing produces
forced-entrained ($\omega_{\mathrm{F}}$) states. As a result of the interaction
of mutual and forced entrainment, resonant cluster states occur with equal
spacing of frequencies that have discretized frequencies following a resonance
rule $\omega_{n}\cong n\omega_{1}-(n-1)\omega_{\mathrm{F}}$. Resonance
clustering requires an optimal, intermediate global coupling strength; at weak
coupling the clusters have smaller sizes and do not strictly follow the
resonance rule, while at strong coupling the population behaves similar to a
single, giant oscillator.
