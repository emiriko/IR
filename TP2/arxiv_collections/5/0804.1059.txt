We propose a general security definition for cryptographic quantum protocols
that implement classical non-reactive two-party tasks. The definition is
expressed in terms of simple quantum-information-theoretic conditions which
must be satisfied by the protocol to be secure. The conditions are uniquely
determined by the ideal functionality F defining the cryptographic task to be
implemented. We then show the following composition result. If quantum
protocols pi_1,...,pi_k securely implement ideal functionalities F_1,...,F_k
according to our security definition, then any purely classical two-party
protocol, which makes sequential calls to F_1,...,F_k, is equally secure as the
protocol obtained by replacing the calls to F_1,...,F_k with the respective
quantum protocols pi_1,...,pi_k. Hence, our approach yields the minimal
security requirements which are strong enough for the typical use of quantum
protocols as subroutines within larger classical schemes. Finally, we show that
recently proposed quantum protocols for oblivious transfer and secure
identification in the bounded-quantum-storage model satisfy our security
definition, and thus compose in the above sense.
