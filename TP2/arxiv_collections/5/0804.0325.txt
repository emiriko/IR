Anomalous magnetic and transport properties observed in the
La0.8-xEuxSr0.2MnO3 (0.04 l.e x l.e. 0.36) compounds are presented in this
paper. The Curie temperature (TC) decreases from 260 K for x = 0.04 to 188 K
for x = 0.16 and surprisingly thereafter increases for higher Eu concentrations
(x > 0.16) and becomes nearly constant ~230 K. Resistivity increases with Eu
concentration up to x = 0.16 but decreases for higher Eu concentration (x >
0.16). In the magnetoresistance data, in addition to a peak corresponding to
the insulator-metal transition at (TI-M1), a second peak is also observed at a
relatively lower temperature, (TI-M2). Both TI-M1 and TI-M2 follow the same
trend as TC. The unique variation of TC and magnetoresistance is explained on
the basis of structure and disorder correlated to microscopic electronic phase
segregation. The studies with the existing studies also point to the
universibility of this consideration.
