By fitting to a database of ab-initio forces and energies, we can extract
pair potentials for alloys, with a simple six-parameter analytic form including
Friedel oscillations, which give a remarkably faithful account of many complex
intermetallic compounds. As examples we show results for (crystal or
quasicrystal) structure prediction and phonon spectrum for three systems:
Fe--B, Al--Mg--Zn, and Al--Cu--Fe.
