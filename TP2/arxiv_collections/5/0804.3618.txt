We determine the small signal gain and noise response of an amplifier based
on the nonlinear response of a quantum nanomechanical resonator. The resonator
is biased in the nonlinear regime by a strong harmonic bias force and we
determine the response to a small additional driving signal detuned with
respect to the bias force.
