We have focused and decelerated benzonitrile (C$_7$H$_5$N) molecules from a
molecular beam, using an array of time-varying inhomogeneous electric fields in
alternating gradient configuration. Benzonitrile is prototypical for large
asymmetric top molecules that exhibit rich rotational structure and a high
density of states. At the rotational temperature of 3.5 K in the pulsed
molecular beam, many rotational states are populated. Benzonitrile molecules in
their absolute ground state are decelerated from 320 m/s to 289 m/s, and
similar changes in velocity are obtained for excited rotational states. All
measurements agree well with the outcome of trajectory calculations. These
experiments demonstrate that such large polyatomic molecules are amenable to
the powerful method of Stark deceleration.
