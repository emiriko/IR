We report the first observation of the dependence of the
coherent-backscattering (CBS) enhanced cone with the frequency of the
backscattered photon. The experiment is performed on a diffusing liquid
suspension and the Doppler broadening of light is induced by the Brownian
motion of the scatterers. Heterodyne detection on a CCD camera is used to
measure the complex field (i.e., the hologram) of the light that is
backscattered at a given frequency. The analysis of the holograms yield the
frequency and the propagation direction of the backscattered photons. We
observe that the angular CBS cone becomes more narrow in the tail of the
Brownian spectrum. The experimental results are in good agreement with a simple
theoretical model.
