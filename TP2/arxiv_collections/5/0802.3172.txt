A generalized mass formula is used to calculate the neutron and proton drip
lines of normal and lambda hypernuclei treating non-strange and strange nuclei
on the same footing. Calculations suggest existence of several bound
hypernuclei whose normal cores are unbound. Addition of Lambda or,
Lambda-Lambda hyperon(s) to a normal nucleus is found to cause shifts of the
neutron and proton driplines from their conventional limits.
