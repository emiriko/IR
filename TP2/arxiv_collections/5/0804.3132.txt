Based on Document (1), by considering the retarded interaction of radiation
fields, the third order transition probabilities of stimulated radiations and
absorptions of light are calculated. The revised formulas of nonlinear
polarizations are provided. The results show that that the general processes of
non-linear optics violate time reversal symmetry. The phenomena of non-linear
optics violating time reversal symmetry just as sum frequency, double
frequency, different frequencies, double stable states, self-focusing and
self-defocusing, echo phenomena, as well as optical self-transparence and self
absorptions and so on are analyzed.
