This paper reports on a detailed magnetotransport investigation of the
magnetic anisotropies of (Ga,Mn)As layers produced by various sources
worldwide. Using anisotropy fingerprints to identify contributions of the
various higher order anisotropy terms, we show that the presence of both a
[100] and a [110] uniaxial anisotropy in addition to the primary ([100] +
[010]) anisotropy is common to all medium doped (Ga,Mn)As layers typically used
in transport measurement, with the amplitude of these uniaxial terms being
characteristic of the individual layers.
