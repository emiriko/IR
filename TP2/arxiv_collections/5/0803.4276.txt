Three-dimensional trapping of neutral atoms in a combined gravito-magnetic
potential is reported. Clouds of cold rubidium atoms in different hyperfine
states of the ground level were trapped with a lifetime of 4.5 s. Confinement
exclusively occurred as a combination of the static magnetic force and the
gravitational force.
