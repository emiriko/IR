We present a continuation method that enables one to track or continue
branches of periodic orbits directly in an experiment when a parameter is
changed. A control-based setup in combination with Newton iterations ensures
that the periodic orbit can be continued even when it is unstable. This is
demonstrated with the continuation of initially stable rotations of a
vertically forced pendulum experiment through a fold bifurcation to find the
unstable part of the branch.
