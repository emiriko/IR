Using the quark-antiquark interactions obtained in the framework of the
bootstrap method we construct a potential model, investigate the possibility of
describing of heavy quarkonia and calculate the bottomonium spectrum. The
potential of the interaction was obtained as a nonrelativistic limit of the
relativistic quark-antiquark amplitudes Q{\bar Q} -> Q\bar Q.
