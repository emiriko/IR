We investigate magnetic Feshbach resonances in two different ultracold K-Rb
mixtures. Information on the K(39)-Rb(87) isotopic pair is combined with novel
and pre-existing observations of resonance patterns for K(40)-Rb(87).
Interisotope resonance spectroscopy improves significantly our near-threshold
model for scattering and bound-state calculations. Our analysis determines the
number of bound states in singlet/triplet potentials and establishes precisely
near threshold parameters for all K-Rb pairs of interest for experiments with
both atoms and molecules. In addition, the model verifies the validity of the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation at the present level of accuracy.
