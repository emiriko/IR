In the classical (non-quantum) relativity theory the course of the moving
clock is dilated as compared to the course of the clock at rest (the Einstein
dilation). Any unstable system may be regarded as a clock. The time evolution
(e.g., the decay) of a uniformly moving physical system is considered using the
relativistic quantum theory. The example of a moving system is given whose
evolution turns out to be speeded-up instead of being dilated. A discussion of
this paradoxical result is presented.
