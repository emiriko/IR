In a recent letter, Chatterjee et al. (Nature Phys. 4, 108 (2008)) reported
tunnelling data obtained below and above the critical temperature (Tc = 15 K)
by STM in overdoped Bi2-yPbySr2CuO6+x (Bi2201) and some interpretations of the
data1. The main experimental findings of their work are observations of
native-impurity resonances which coexist spatially with the superconducting
(SC) gap below Tc and survive unchanged on warming through Tc. No doubts, the
data in the letter are an important piece of information for assembling the
high-Tc SC jigsaw puzzle; however, there are inaccuracies in the discussion. In
addition, I propose another interpretation of the data.
