We describe the interaction between an electromagnetic field and a long
Josephson junction (JJ) driven by a dc current. We calculate the amplitudes of
emission and absorption of light via the creation and annihilation of quantized
Josephson plasma waves (JPWs). Both, the energies of JPW quanta and the
amplitudes of light absorption and emission, strongly depend on the junction's
length and can be tuned by an applied dc current. Moreover, photon-assisted
macroscopic quantum tunnelling in long Josephson junctions show resonances when
the frequency of the outside radiation coincides with the current-driven
eigenfrequencies of the quantized JPWs.
