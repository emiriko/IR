We suggest a systematic method of extension of quasi-exactly solvable (QES)
systems. We construct finite-dimensional subspaces on the basis of special
functions (hypergeometric, Airy, Bessel ones) invariant with respect to the
action of differential operators of the second order with polynomial
coefficients. As a example of physical applications, we show that the known
two-photon Rabi Hamiltonian becomes quasi-exactly solvable at certain values of
parameters when it can be expressed in terms of corresponding QES operators
related to the hypergeometric function.
