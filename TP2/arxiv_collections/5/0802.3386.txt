Pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) is one of the most promising techniques for the
formation of complex-oxide heterostructures, superlattices, and well-controlled
interfaces. The first part of this paper presents a review of several useful
modifications of the process, including methods inspired by combinatorial
approaches. We then discuss detailed growth kinetics results, which illustrate
that 'true' layer-by-layer (LBL) growth can only be approached, but not fully
met, even though many characterization techniques reveal interfaces with
unexpected sharpness. Time-resolved surface x-ray diffraction measurements show
that crystallization and the majority of interlayer mass transport occur on
time scales that are comparable to those of the plume/substrate interaction,
providing direct experimental evidence that a growth regime exists in which
non-thermal processes dominate PLD. This understanding shows how kinetic growth
manipulation can bring PLD closer to ideal LBL than any other growth method
available today.
