We study the succinctness of the complement and intersection of regular
expressions. In particular, we show that when constructing a regular expression
defining the complement of a given regular expression, a double exponential
size increase cannot be avoided. Similarly, when constructing a regular
expression defining the intersection of a fixed and an arbitrary number of
regular expressions, an exponential and double exponential size increase,
respectively, can in worst-case not be avoided. All mentioned lower bounds
improve the existing ones by one exponential and are tight in the sense that
the target expression can be constructed in the corresponding time class, i.e.,
exponential or double exponential time. As a by-product, we generalize a
theorem by Ehrenfeucht and Zeiger stating that there is a class of DFAs which
are exponentially more succinct than regular expressions, to a fixed
four-letter alphabet. When the given regular expressions are one-unambiguous,
as for instance required by the XML Schema specification, the complement can be
computed in polynomial time whereas the bounds concerning intersection continue
to hold. For the subclass of single-occurrence regular expressions, we prove a
tight exponential lower bound for intersection.
