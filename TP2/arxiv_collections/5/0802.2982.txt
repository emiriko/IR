The recently discovered $X$(3872) has many possible interpretations. We study
the production of $X$(3872) with PANDA at GSI for the antiproton-proton
collision with two possible interpretations of X(3872). One is as a
loosely-bound molecule of $D$-mesons, while another is a 2P charmonium state
$\chi_{c1}$ (2P). Using effective couplings we are able to give numerical
predictions for the production near the threshold and the production associated
with $\pi^0$. The produced $X$(3872) can be identified with its decay $J/\psi
\pi^+\pi^-$. We also study the possible background near the threshold
production for $X(3872) \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$. With the designed luminosity
$1.5{\rm fb}^{-1}$ per year of PANDA we find that the event number of $p\bar p
\to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ near the threshold is at the order of $10^6 \sim 10^8$,
where the large uncertainty comes from the total decay width of X(3872). Our
study shows that at the threshold more than about 60% events come from the
decay of X(3872) and two interpretations are distinguishable from the
line-shape of the production. With our results we except that the PANDA
experiments will shed light on the property of X(3872).
