We present evidence from computer simulations for glassy dynamics in
suspensions of monodisperse hard ellipsoids. In equilibrium, almost spherical
ellipsoids show a first order transition from an isotropic phase to a rotator
phase. When overcompressing the isotropic phase into the rotator regime, we
observe super-Arrhenius slowing down of diffusion and relaxation, accompanied
by two-step relaxation in positional and orientational correlators. The effects
are strong enough for asymptotic laws of mode-coupling theory to apply. Glassy
dynamics are unusual in monodisperse systems. Typically, polydispersity in size
or a mixture of particle species is prerequisite to prevent crystallization.
Here, we show that a slight particle anisometry acts as a sufficient source of
disorder. This sheds new light on the question of which ingredients are
required for glass formation.
