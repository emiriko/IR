We give an introductory review of quantum physics on the noncommutative
spacetime called the Groenewold-Moyal plane. Basic ideas like star products,
twisted statistics, second quantized fields and discrete symmetries are
discussed. We also outline some of the recent developments in these fields and
mention where one can search for experimental signals.
