Using a sample of 14 million $\psip$ events collected with the BESII
detector, branching fractions or upper limits on the branching fractions of
$\psip$ decays into $\gamma\ppb$, $\gamma 2(\pip\pim)$, $\gamma \kskp$, $\gamma
\kap\kam\pip\pim$, $\gamma\kstarz\kam\pip+c.c.$, $\gamma \kstarz \kstarzb$,
$\gamma\pip\pim\ppb$, $\gamma2(\kap\kam)$, $\gamma3(\pip\pim)$ and
$\gamma2(\pip\pim)\kap\kam$ with hadron invariant mass less than 2.9$\gev/c^2$
are reported. We also report branching fractions of $\psip$ decays into
$\gamma\ppb\piz$, $\ppb\piz\piz$, $2(\pip\pim)\piz$, $\omega\pp$, $\omega
f_2(1270)$, $b_1^\pm\pi^\mp$, $\piz\kskp$, $K^\pm\rho^\mp\ks$,
$\piz2(\pip\pim)\kap\kam$ and $\gamma\piz2(\pip\pim)\kap\kam$.
