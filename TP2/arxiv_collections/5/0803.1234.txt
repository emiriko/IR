The baryon asymmetry of the Universe requires CP violation, but the Standard
Model falls short by a factor of $10^{-10}$ or more. Starting from a clue at
the $B$ factories, we point out that the large Yukawa couplings of the
sequential fourth generation $t^\prime$ and $b^\prime$ quarks can provide
enhancement by a factor of over $10^{13}$, making the 2-3-4 generation quark
sector a viable source of CP violation for the baryon asymmetry of the
Universe. With recent hints of large $\sin2\Phi_{B_s}$ in $B_s^0$-$\bar B_s^0$
mixing from the Tevatron, the ultimate test would be to discover the $t^\prime$
and $b^\prime$ quarks at the Large Hadron Collider.
