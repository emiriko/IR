In this letter, we prove that the perfectly secure One-Time Pad (OTP)
encryption can be seen as finding the initial condition on the binary map under
a random switch based on the perfectly random pad. This turns out to be a
special case of Grangetto's randomized arithmetic coding performed on the
Binary Map. Furthermore, we derive the set of possible perfect secrecy systems
using such an approach. Since OTP encryption is an XOR operation, we thus have
a dynamical systems implementation of the XOR gate. We show similar
implementations for other gates such as NOR, NAND, OR, XNOR, AND and NOT. The
dynamical systems framework unifies the three areas to which Shannon made
foundational contributions: lossless compression (Source Coding), perfect
encryption (Cryptography), and design of logic gates (Computation)
