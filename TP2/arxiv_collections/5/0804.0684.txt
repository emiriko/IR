We discuss various ways to handle self-interaction corrections (SIC) to
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. To that end, we use a simple
model of few particles in a finite number of states together with a simple
zero-range interaction for which full Hartree-Fock can easily be computed as a
benchmark. The model allows to shed some light on the balance between
orthonormality of the involved states and energy variance.
