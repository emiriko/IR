Recently we introduced an extended vector bundle X on which non-Abelian
tensor gauge fields realize a connection. Our aim here is to introduce
interaction of these non-Abelian tensor gauge fields with fermions and bosons.
We have found that there exist two series of gauge invariant forms describing
this interaction. The linear sum of these forms comprises the general gauge
invariant Lagrangian. Studying the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations we
found that a particular linear combination of these forms exhibits enhanced
symmetry which guarantees the conservation of the corresponding high-rank
currents. A possible mechanism of symmetry breaking and mass generation of
tensor gauge bosons is suggested.
