We present a relativistic chiral effective theory for symmetric and
asymmetric nuclear matter taken in the Hartree-Fock scheme. The nuclear binding
is insured by a background chiral invariant scalar field associated with the
radial fluctuations of the chiral quark condensate. Nuclear matter saturation
is obtained once the scalar response of the nucleon generating three-body
repulsive forces is incorporated. For these parameters related to the scalar
sector and quark confinement mechanism inside the nucleon we make use of an
analysis of lattice results on the nucleon mass evolution with the quark mass.
The other parameters are constrained as most as possible by standard hadron and
nuclear phenomenology. Special attention is paid to the treatment of the
propagation of the scalar fluctuations. The rearrangement terms associated with
in-medium modified mass and coupling constants are explicitly included to
satisfy the Hugenholtz -Van Hove theorem. We point out the important role of
the tensor piece of the rho exchange Fock term to reproduce the asymmetry
energy of nuclear matter. We also discuss the isospin dependence of the Landau
nucleon effective mass.
