The three-gluon glueball states are studied with the generalization of a
semirelativistic potential model giving good results for two-gluon glueballs.
The Hamiltonian depends only on 3 parameters fixed on two-gluon glueball
spectra: the strong coupling constant, the string tension, and a gluon size
which removes singularities in the potential. The Casimir scaling determines
the structure of the confinement. Our results are in good agreement with other
approaches and lattice calculation for the odderon trajectory but differ
strongly from lattice in the $J^{+-}$ sector. We propose a possible explanation
for this problem.
