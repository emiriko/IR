Birefringence measurements have been carried out on the Pb-doped silica
hydrogels prepared under various magnetic fields up to 5T. The silica gels
prepared at 5T were used as a medium of crystal growth of PbBr2, whose result
implied the structural anisotropy; an aligned array of crystallites was
obtained by transmission electron microscopy. While the samples prepared at 0,
1, and 3T have no birefringence, we found that the samples have negative
birefringence on the order of magnitude 10^-6 as if the direction of the
magnetic field is the optic axis of a uniaxal crystal. To the authors'
knowledge, the birefringent silica hydrogels were obtained by gelation under
magnetic field for the first time. Also, scanning microscopic light scattering
experiments have been performed. The results indicate that the characteristic
length distribution for birefringent samples is narrower than that for
non-birefringent ones.
