Thin film heterostructures provide a powerful means to study the antagonism
between superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism (FM). One interesting issue
in FM-SC hybrids which defies the notion of antagonistic orders is the
observation of magnetic field induced superconductivity (FIS). Here we show
that in systems where the FM domains/islands produce spatial inhomogeneities of
the SC order parameter, the FIS can derive significant contribution from
different mobilities of the magnetic flux identified by two distinct critical
states in the inhomogeneous superconductor. Our experiments on nanoengineered
bilayers of ferromagnetic CoPt and superconducting NbN where CoPt/NbN islands
are separated by a granular NbN, lend support to this alternative explanation
of FIS in certain class of FM-SC hybrids.
