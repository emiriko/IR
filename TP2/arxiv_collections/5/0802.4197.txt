This review is described some new results in the studies of anomalous
electromagnetic of thin carbon films. Starting with historical sketch of
studies of superconductivity and electromagnetic in carbonaceous materials the
efforts of such persons as the Nobel Prize winners Vitaly L.Ginzburg and
W.A.Little, the Polish outstanding scientist K.Antonowicz, the Americans
J.T.Chen, Liren Zhao and Bor Z. Jang, the German researcher P.Esquinazy and his
group, the Russian scientists T.L.Makarova, V.I.Tsebro, O.E.Omelyanovskii and
A.P. Moravskii, and the Chinese scientists G.M.Zhao and Y.S.Wang has been
mentioned. The work presents the study of some new anomalous electromagnetic
effects in graphite-like thin carbon films. These are: The fast switching (10-9
sec) of electrical conductivity The detection of microwave radiation and its
temperature dependence The oscillations of film stack magnetization in a
magnetic field of 1-5 T The generation of optical radiation during the
spasmodic switching of conductivity These effects are explained to be the
consequence of carbon films granular structure, which can be considered as the
Josephson junction array (JJA). The description of theory of the reversed ac
Josephson effect (RJE) and its application to the search of high-temperature
superconducting (SC) phase in granular materials was done. As for magnetic
properties the description of the technique of P.Barbara and co-workers,
A.P.Nielsen e.a., C.Auletta et al., Mahesh Chandran and other scientists on
studies of two-dimensional JJA has been added. The both mentioned techniques
have been applied to analyze the data on electromagnetic measurements in the
thin granular carbon films.
