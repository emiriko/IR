What makes a problem suitable for statistical analysis? Are historical and
religious questions addressable using statistical calculations? Such issues
have long been debated in the statistical community and statisticians and
others have used historical information and texts to analyze such questions as
the economics of slavery, the authorship of the Federalist Papers and the
question of the existence of God. But what about historical and religious
attributions associated with information gathered from archeological finds? In
1980, a construction crew working in the Jerusalem neighborhood of East Talpiot
stumbled upon a crypt. Archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority
came to the scene and found 10 limestone burial boxes, known as ossuaries, in
the crypt. Six of these had inscriptions. The remains found in the ossuaries
were reburied, as required by Jewish religious tradition, and the ossuaries
were catalogued and stored in a warehouse. The inscriptions on the ossuaries
were catalogued and published by Rahmani (1994) and by Kloner (1996) but there
reports did not receive widespread public attention. Fast forward to March
2007, when a television ``docudrama'' aired on The Discovery Channel entitled
``The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' touched off a public and religious controversy--one
only need think about the title to see why there might be a controversy! The
program, and a simultaneously published book [Jacobovici and Pellegrino
(2007)], described the ``rediscovery'' of the East Talpiot archeological find
and they presented interpretations of the ossuary inscriptions from a number of
perspectives. Among these was a statistical calculation attributed to the
statistician Andrey Feuerverger: ``that the odds that all six names would
appear together in one tomb are 1 in 600, calculated conservatively--or
possibly even as much as one in one million.''
