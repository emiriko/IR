Tensor models can be regarded as theories of dynamical fuzzy spaces, and
provide background independent theories of space. Their classical solutions
correspond to classical background spaces, and the small fluctuations around
them can be regarded as fluctuations of fields on them. In this paper, I
numerically study a tensor model around its classical backgrounds of two-,
three- and four-dimensional fuzzy flat tori and show that the properties of
low-lying low-momentum modes are in clear agreement with general relativity.
Numerical analysis also suggests that the lowest-order effective action is
composed of curvature square terms, which is consistent with general relativity
in view of the form of the considered action of the tensor model.
