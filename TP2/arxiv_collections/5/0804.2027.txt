We consider quantum corrections to a kink of noncommutative supersymmetric
phi^4 theory in 1+1 dimensions. Despite the presence of an infinite number of
time derivatives in the action, we are able to define supercharges and a
Hamiltonian by using an unconventional canonical formalism. We calculate the
quantum energy E of the kink (defined as a half-sum of the eigenfrequencies of
fluctuations) which coincides with its' value in corresponding commutative
theory independently of the noncommutativity parameter. The renormalization
also proceeds precisely as in the commutative case. The vacuum expectation
value of the new Hamiltonian is also calculated and appears to be consistent
with the value of the quantum energy E of the kink.
