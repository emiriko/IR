It is pointed out that assigning D_{s0}^+(2317) to an iso-triplet tetra-quark
meson is favored by experiments. It also is discussed why its neutral and
doubly charged partners have never been observed in inclusive e^+e^-
annihilation. To search for them, hadronic weak decays of B mesons would be
better, and their production rates, Br(B_u^+ -> D^-D_{s0}^{++}(2317)) and
Br(B_d^0 ->antiD^0D_{s0}^{0}(2317)), would be around 10^{-3}.
