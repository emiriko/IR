Fragile materials ranging from sand to fire-retardant to toothpaste are able
to exhibit both solid and fluid-like properties across the jamming transition.
Unlike ordinary fusion, systems of grains, foams and colloids jam and cease to
flow under conditions that still remain unknown. Here we quantify jamming via a
thermodynamic approach by accounting for the structural ageing and the
shear-induced compressibility of dry sand. Specifically, the jamming threshold
is defined using a non-thermal temperature that measures the 'fluffiness' of a
granular mixture. The thermodynamic model, casted in terms of pressure,
temperature and free-volume, also successfully predicts the entropic data of
five molecular glasses. Notably, the predicted configurational entropy avoids
the Kauzmann paradox entirely. Without any free parameters, the proposed
equation-of-state also governs the mechanism of shear-banding and the
associated features of shear-softening and thickness-invariance.
