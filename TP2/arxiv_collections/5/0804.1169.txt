We report on new H$(e,e^\prime p)\gamma$ measurements in the $\Delta(1232)$
resonance at $Q^2=0.06$ (GeV/c) carried out simultaneously with H$(e,e^\prime
p)\pi^0$. It is the lowest $Q^2$ for which the virtual Compton scattering (VCS)
reaction has been studied in the first resonance region. The VCS measured cross
sections are well described by dispersion-relation calculations in which the
multipole amplitudes derived from H$(e,e^\prime p)\pi^0$ data are used as
input, thus confirming the compatibility of the results. The derived resonant
magnetic dipole amplitude $M^{3/2}_{1+} = (40.60 \pm
0.70_{stat+sys})(10^{-3}/m_{\pi^+})$ at $W=$ 1232 MeV is in excellent agreement
with the value extracted from H$(e,e^\prime p)\pi^0$ measurements.
