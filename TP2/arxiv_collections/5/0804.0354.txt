We study non-Gaussian states generated by two-photon subtraction from a cw
squeezed light source. In a cw scheme one can subtract two photons from the
source with a designated time separation and can genarate temporally
multiplexed superposition states of continuous variables. We numerically study
the properties of these states in the light of bosonic interference in the time
domain. In an appropriate temporal mode amplified kittens are produced in a
region where the time separation is comparable with the correlation time of
squeezed packets.
