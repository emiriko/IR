We consider non-topological, "bell-shaped" localized and regular solutions
available in some 1+1 dimensional scalar field theories. Several properties of
such solutions are studied, namely their stability and the occurence of fermion
bound states in the background of a kink and a kink-anti-kink solutions of the
sine-Gordon model.
