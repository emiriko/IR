A quantum state is nonclassical if its Glauber-Sudarshan P function fails to
be interpreted as a probability density. This quantity is often highly
singular, so that its reconstruction is a demanding task. Here we present the
experimental determination of a well-behaved P function showing negativities
for a single-photon-added thermal state. This is a direct visualization of the
original definition of nonclassicality. The method can be useful under
conditions for which many other signatures of nonclassicality would not
persist.
