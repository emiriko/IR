We show that the Coulomb blockade in parallel dots pierced by magnetic flux
$\Phi$ completely blocks the resonant current for any value of $\Phi$ except
for integer multiples of the flux quantum $\Phi_0$. This non-analytic
(switching) dependence of the current on $\Phi$ arises only when the dot states
that carry the current are of the same energy. The time needed to reach the
steady state, however, diverges when $\Phi\to n\Phi_0$.
