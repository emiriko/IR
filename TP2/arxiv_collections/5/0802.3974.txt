The new approach to representation of syntax of formal languages-- a
formalism of syntax diagrams is offered. Syntax diagrams look a convenient
language for the description of syntactic relations in the languages having
nonlinear representation of texts, for example, for representation of syntax
lows of the language of structural chemical formulas. The formalism of
neighbourhood grammar is used to describe the set of correct syntax constructs.
The neighbourhood the grammar consists of a set of families of
"neighbourhoods"-- the diagrams defined for each symbol of the language's
alphabet. The syntax diagram is correct if each symbol is included into this
diagram together with some neighbourhood. In other words, correct diagrams are
needed to be covered by elements of the neighbourhood grammar. Thus, the
grammar of formal language can be represented as system of the covers defined
for each correct syntax diagram.
