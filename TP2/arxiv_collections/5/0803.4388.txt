In this work, we introduce a symmetric algorithm obtained by the recurrence
relation a_{n}^{k}=a_{n-1}^{k}+a_{n}^{k-1}. We point out that this algorithm
can be apply to hyperharmonic-, ordinary and incomplete Fibonacci- and Lucas
numbers. An explicit formulae for hyperharmonic numbers, general generating
functions of the Fibonacci- and Lucas numbers are obtained. Besides we define
"hyperfibonacci numbers", "hyperlucas numbers". Using these new concepts, some
relations between ordinary and incomplete Fibonacci- and Lucas numbers are
investigated.
