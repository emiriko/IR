These notes are based on lectures delivered by the authors at a Langeoog
seminar of SFB/TR12 "Symmetries and universality in mesoscopic systems" to a
mixed audience of mathematicians and theoretical physicists. After a brief
outline of the basic physical concepts of equilibrium and nonequilibrium
states, the one-dimensional simple exclusion process is introduced as a
paradigmatic nonequilibrium interacting particle system. The stationary measure
on the ring is derived and the idea of the hydrodynamic limit is sketched. We
then introduce the phenomenological Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and
explain the associated universality conjecture for surface fluctuations in
growth models. This is followed by a detailed exposition of a seminal paper of
Johansson that relates the current fluctuations of the totally asymmetric
simple exclusion process (TASEP) to the Tracy-Widom distribution of random
matrix theory. The implications of this result are discussed within the
framework of the KPZ conjecture.
