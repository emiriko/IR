The Afshar experiment is a relatively simple two-slit experiment with results
that appear to show a discrepancy with the predictions of Bohr's Principle of
Complementarity. We report on the results of a calculation using a simpler but
equivalent set-up called the modified Afshar experiment. Numerical results are
in agreement with the experimental results performed on the Afshar experiment
set-up. Calculations show that the level of which-way information and
visibility in the Afshar experiement is higher than originally estimated.
