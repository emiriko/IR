We consider a spin ladder model which is known to have matrix product states
as exact ground states with spin liquid characteristics. The model has two
critical-point transitions at the parameter values u=0 and infinity. We study
the variation of entanglement and fidelity measures in the ground states as a
function of u and specially look for signatures of quantum phase transitions at
u=0 and infinity. The two different entanglement measures used are S(i) (the
single-site von Neumann entropy) and S(i, j) (the two-body entanglement). At
the quantum critical point (QCP) u=infinity, the entanglement measure E (=S(i)
,S(i, j)) vanishes but remains nonzero at the other QCP u=0. The first and
second derivatives of E with respect to the parameter u and the entanglement
length associated with S(i, j) are further calculated to identify special
features, if any, near the QCPs. We further determine the GS fidelity F and a
quantity ln(D) related to the second derivative of F and show that these
quantities calculated for finite-sized systems are good indicators of QPTs
occurring in the infinite system.
