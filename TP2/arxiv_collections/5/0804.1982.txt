In this paper, we design linear time algorithms to recognize and determine
topological invariants such as the genus and homology groups in 3D. These
properties can be used to identify patterns in 3D image recognition. This has
tremendous amount of applications in 3D medical image analysis. Our method is
based on cubical images with direct adjacency, also called (6,26)-connectivity
images in discrete geometry. According to the fact that there are only six
types of local surface points in 3D and a discrete version of the well-known
Gauss-Bonnett Theorem in differential geometry, we first determine the genus of
a closed 2D-connected component (a closed digital surface). Then, we use
Alexander duality to obtain the homology groups of a 3D object in 3D space.
