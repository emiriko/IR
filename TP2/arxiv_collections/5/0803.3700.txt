We generate indistinguishable photons from a semiconductor diode containing a
InAs/GaAs quantum dot. Using an all-electrical technique to populate and
control a single-photon emitting state we filter-out dephasing by
Stark-shifting the emission energy on timescales below the dephasing time of
the state. Mixing consecutive photons on a beam-splitter we observe two-photon
interference with a visibility of 64%.
