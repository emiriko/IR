We propose a new method for the calculation of thermodynamic properties of
one-dimensional quantum systems by combining the TMRG approach with the corner
transfer-matrix method. The corner transfer-matrix DMRG method brings
reasonable advantage over TMRG for classical systems. We have modified the
concept for the calculation of thermal properties of one-dimensional quantum
systems. The novel QCTMRG algorithm is implemented and used to study two simple
test cases, the classical Ising chain and the isotropic Heisenberg model. In a
discussion, the advantages and challenges are illuminated.
