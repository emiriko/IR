This Brief Review deals with the recent resurgence of interest in adding a
second scalar doublet (eta^+,eta^0) to the Standard Model of particle
interactions. In most studies, it is taken for granted that eta^0 should have a
nonzero vacuum expectation value, even if it may be very small. What if there
is an exactly conserved symmetry which ensures <eta^0>=0? The phenomenological
ramifications of this idea include dark matter, radiative neutrino mass,
leptogenesis, and grand unification.
