We report the observation of the $A_{\rm g}$-symmetric one-magnon Raman peak
in the magnon Bose-Einstein condensation phase of TlCuCl$_{3}$. Its Raman shift
traces the one-magnon energy at the magnetic $\Gamma$ point, and its intensity
is proportional to the squared transverse magnetization. The appearance of the
one-magnon Raman scattering originates from the exchange magnon Raman process
and reflects the change of the magnetic-state symmetry. Using the bond-operator
representation, we theoretically clarify the Raman selection rules, being
consistent with the experimental results.
