In this paper, we consider the dynamical evolution of dark vortex states in
the two-dimensional defocusing discrete nonlinear Schroedinger model, a model
of interest both to atomic physics and to nonlinear optics. We find that in a
way reminiscent of their 1d analogs, i.e., of discrete dark solitons, the
discrete defocusing vortices become unstable past a critical coupling strength
and, in the infinite lattice, they apparently remain unstable up to the
continuum limit where they are restabilized. In any infinite lattice,
stabilization windows of the structures may be observed. Systematic tools are
offered for the continuation of the states both from the continuum and,
especially, from the anti-continuum limit. Although the results are mainly
geared towards the uniform case, we also consider the effect of harmonic
trapping potentials.
