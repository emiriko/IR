We establish a relation between several entanglement properties in the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, which is a system of mutually interacting spins
embedded in a magnetic field. We provide analytical proofs that the single-copy
entanglement and the global geometric entanglement of the ground state close to
and at criticality behave as the entanglement entropy. These results are in
deep contrast to what is found in one- dimensional spin systems where these
three entanglement measures behave differently.
