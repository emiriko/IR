We consider a chain of free electrons with periodically switched dimerization
and study the entanglement entropy of a segment with the remainder of the
system. We show that it evolves in a stepwise manner towards a value
proportional to the length of the segment and displays in general slow
oscillations. For particular quench periods and full dimerization an explicit
solution is given. Relations to equilibrium lattice models are pointed out.
