We report on a new methodological approach to electrodynamics based on a
fluidic viewpoint. We develop a systematic approach establishing analogies
between physical magnitudes and isomorphism (structure-preserving mappings)
between systems of equations. This methodological approach allows us to give a
general expression for the hydromotive force, thus re-obtaining the
Navier-Stokes equation departing from the an appropriate electromotive force.
  From this ground we offer a fluidic approach to different kind of issues with
interest in propulsion, e.g., the force exerted by a charged particle on a body
carrying current; the magnetic force between two parallel currents; the
Magnus's force. It is shown how the intermingle between the fluid vectors
fields and electromagnetic fields lead to new insights on their dynamics. The
new concepts introduced in this work suggest possible applications to
electromagnetic (EM) propulsion devices and the mastery of the principles of
producing electric fields of required configuration in plasma medium.
