We propose a scheme to realize controlled phase gate between two single
photons through a single quantum dot in slow-light silicon photonic crystal
waveguide. Enhanced Purcell factor and beta factor lead to high gate fidelity
over broadband frequencies compared to cavity-assisted system. The excellent
physical integration of this silicon photonic crystal waveguide system provides
tremendous potential for large-scale quantum information processing.
