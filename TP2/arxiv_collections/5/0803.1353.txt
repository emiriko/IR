The phase diagram of the coupled sine circle map lattice exhibits a variety
of interesting phenomena including spreading regions with spatiotemporal
intermittency, non-spreading regions with spatial intermittency, and coherent
structures termed solitons. A cellular automaton mapping of the coupled map
lattice maps the spreading to non-spreading transition to a transition from a
probabilistic to a deterministic cellular automaton. The solitonic sector of
the map shows spatiotemporal intermittency with soliton creation, propagation
and annihilation. A probabilistic cellular automaton mapping is set up for this
sector which can identify each one of these phenomena.
