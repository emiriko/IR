It is shown in the framework of the fully relativistic Dirac-Fock treatment
of photoionization and radiative recombination processes that taking into
account all significant multipoles of the radiative field is of considerable
importance at electron energy higher than several keV. For the first time, we
show that the relativistic Maxwell-Bolzmann distribution of continuum electrons
should be used in hot thermal plasmas. This decreases the radiative
recombination rate coefficient up to several multipoles compared to the
non-relativistic distribution commonly used.
