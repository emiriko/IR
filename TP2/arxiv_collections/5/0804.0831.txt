We report on a search for the doubly Cabibbo suppressed decay B+ -> D*+ pi0,
based on a data sample of 657 million BBbar pairs collected at the Upsilon(4S)
resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+ e- collider.
We find no significant signal and set an upper limit of Br(B+ -> D*+ pi0) < 3.6
x 10^-6 at the 90% confidence level. This limit can be used to constrain the
ratio between suppressed and favored B -> D* pi decay amplitudes, r < 0.051, at
the 90% confidence level.
