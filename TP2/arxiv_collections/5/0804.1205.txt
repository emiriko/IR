We present a quantitative theory for a relaxation function in a simple
glass-forming model (binary mixture of particles with different interaction
parameters). It is shown that the slowing down is caused by the competition
between locally favored regions (clusters) which are long lived but each of
which relaxes as a simple function of time. Without the clusters the relaxation
of the background is simply determined by one typical length which we deduce
from an elementary statistical mechanical argument. The total relaxation
function (which depends on time in a nontrivial manner) is quantitatively
determined as a weighted sum over the clusters and the background. The
`fragility' in this system can be understood quantitatively since it is
determined by the temperature dependence of the number fractions of the locally
favored regions.
