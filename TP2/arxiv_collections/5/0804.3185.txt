We investigate the interactions and chiral properties of the four
spin-$\thalf$-baryons : $N^-(D_{13})$, $N^+(P_{13})$, $\Delta^+(P_{33})$ and
$\Delta^-(D_{33})$ together with the nucleon. We construct the $SU(2)_R \times
SU(2)_L$ invariant interactions between the spin-$\half$ and -$\thalf$ baryons
with the aid of a new, specially developed spin and isospin projection
technique for these baryon fields, where the chiral invariant interactions
contain one- and two-pion couplings. We obtain simple relations for the
coupling constants of the one- and two-pion spin $\half-\thalf$ transitions
terms. The relation for the one-pion interactions reasonably agrees with the
experiments, which suggests that these spin-$\thalf$ baryons are chiral
partners.
