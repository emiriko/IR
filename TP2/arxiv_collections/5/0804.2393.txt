Here we use a description of the electronic correlations contained in the
Hubbard model on the square-lattice perturbed by very weak three-dimensional
uniaxial anisotropy in terms of the residual interactions of charge $c$
fermions and spin-neutral composite two-spinon $s1$ fermions. Excellent
quantitative agreement with the anisotropic linear-$\omega$ one-electron
scattering rate and normal-state linear-$T$ resistivity observed in experiments
on hole-doped cuprates with critical concentrations $x_c\approx 0.05$ and
$x_*\approx 0.27$ is achieved. Our results provide strong evidence that the
normal-state linear-$T$ resistivity is a manifestation of low-temperature
scale-invariant physics.
