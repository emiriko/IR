Starting from the temperature dependence of the energy density and pressure
from lattice QCD calculation, we extract the temperature dependence of the
electric and magnetic condensate near $T_c$. While the magnetic condensate
hardly changes across $T_c$, we find that the electric condensate increases
abruptly above $T_c$. This induces a small but an equally abrupt decrease in
the mass of $J/\psi$, can be calculated through the second-order Stark effect.
Combining the present result with the previously determined QCD sum rule
constraint, we extract the thermal width of $J/\psi$ above $T_c$, which also
increases fast. These changes can be identified as the critical behavior of
$J/\psi$ across $T_c$ associated with the phase transition. We find that the
mass shift and with broadening of $J/\psi$ at 1.05 $T_c$ will be around -100
MeV and 100 MeV respectively.
