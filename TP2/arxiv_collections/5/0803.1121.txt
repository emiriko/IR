We examine an elliptic curve constructed in an earlier paper from a certain
representation of $\SL(2,\Z)$ on the space of convergent Dirichlet series. The
curve is observed to be a modular curve for $\Gamma^1(15)$ and a certain orbit
of modular functions is thereby associated with the Riemann zeta function.
Explicit descriptions are given of these functions and of the permutation
action of $\SL(2,\Z)$ on them.
