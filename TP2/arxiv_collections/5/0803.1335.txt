Based on calculating the contributions of the littlest Higgs model with
T-parity (called $LHT$ model) to the anomalous top coupling $tq\gamma$ ($q=u$
or $c$), we consider single top production via the t-channel partonic process
$eq\to et$ at $ep$ collision. Our numerical results show that the production
cross section in the $LHT$ model can be significantly enhanced relative to that
in the standard model.
