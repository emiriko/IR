Many new physics models predict resonances with masses in the TeV range which
decay into a pair of top quarks. With its large cross section, t-bar t
production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offers an excellent opportunity
to search for such particles. We present a detailed study of the discovery
potential of the CERN Large Hadron Collider for Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations
of the gluon in bulk Randall-Sundrum (RS) models in the t-bar t -> ell^+/- nu
b-bar bq-bar q' (ell=e, mu) final state. We utilize final states with one or
two tagged b-quarks, and two, three or four jets (including b-jets). Our
calculations take into account the finite resolution of detectors, the energy
loss due to b-quark decays, the expected reduced b-tagging efficiency at large
t-bar t invariant masses, and include the background originating from Wb-bar
b+jets, (Wb+W-bar b)+jets, W+jets, and single top + jets production. We derive
semi-realistic 5 sigma discovery limits for nine different KK gluon scenarios,
and compare them with those for KK gravitons, and a Z_H boson in the Littlest
Higgs model. We also analyze the capabilities of the LHC experiments to
differentiate between individual KK gluon models and measure the couplings of
KK gluons to quarks. We find that, for the parameters and models chosen, KK
gluons with masses up to about 4 TeV can be discovered at the LHC. The ability
of the LHC to discriminate between different bulk RS models, and to measure the
couplings of the KK gluons is found to be highly model dependent.
