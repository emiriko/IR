We apply the energy-momentum tensor to calculate energy, momentum and
angular-momentum of two different tetrad fields. This tensor is coordinate
independent of the gravitational field established in the Hamiltonian structure
of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR). The spacetime of
these tetrad fields is the charged dilaton. Our results show that the energy
associated with one of these tetrad fields is consistent, while the other one
does not show this consistency. Therefore, we use the regularized expression of
the gravitational energy-momentum tensor of the TEGR. We investigate the energy
within the external event horizon using the definition of the gravitational
energy-momentum.
