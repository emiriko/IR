(Sr$_{2}$,Ba$_{2}$)Cu$_{3}$O$_{4}$Cl$_{2}$ are antiferromagnetic insulators
which are akin to the parent compounds of the cuprate superconductors but with
two distinct magnetic ordering temperatures related to two magnetic Cu$_{I}$
and Cu$_{II}$ spin sublattices. Here we present a study of these materials by
means of Raman spectroscopy. Following the temperature and polarization
dependence of the data we readily identify two distinct features at around 3000
cm$^{-1}$ and 300 cm$^{-1}$ that are related to two-magnon scattering from the
two sublattices. The estimated spin-exchange coupling constants for the
Cu$_{I}$ and Cu$_{II}$ sublattices are found to be J$_{I}\sim$139-143(132-136)
meV and J$_{II}\sim$14(11) meV for Sr(Ba) compounds. Moreover, we observe modes
at around 480 and 445 cm$^{-1}$ for the Sr and Ba containing samples
respectively, that disappears at the ordering temperature of the Cu$_{II}$. We
argue that this modes may also be of magnetic origin and possibly related to
interband transitions between the Cu$_{I}$-Cu$_{II}$ sublattices.
