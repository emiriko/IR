In this clarifying note we discuss the late decay of an Affleck-Dine
condensate by providing a no-go theorem that attributes to conserved global
charges which are identified by the net particle number in fields which are
included in the flat direction(s). For a rotating condensate, this implies
that: (1) the net baryon/lepton number density stored in the condensate is
always conserved, and (2) the total particle number density in the condensate
cannot decrease. This reiterates that, irrespective of possible
non-perturbative particle production due to $D$-terms in a multiple flat
direction case, the prime decay mode of an Affleck-Dine condensate will be
perturbative as originally envisaged. As a result, cosmological consequences of
flat directions such as delayed thermalization as a novel solution to the
gravitino overproduction problem will remain virtually intact.
