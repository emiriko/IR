In Quantum Hall effect the ground state wave function at $\nu=1$ is the
building block of all other states at different filling factors. It is
developed by the entanglement of two spinors forming a singlet state. The
inherent frustration visualized by the non-abelian matrix Berry phase is
responsible for the quantum pumped charge to flow in the Hall surface. The
Physics behind the Quantum Hall states is studied here from the view point of
topological quantum computation.
