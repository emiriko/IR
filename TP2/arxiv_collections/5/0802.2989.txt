In this paper we compute new reaction rates of the Smoluchowski equation
which takes into account correlations. The new rate K = KMF + KC is the sum of
two terms. The first term is the known Smoluchowski rate with the mean-field
approximation. The second takes into account a correlation between clusters.
For this purpose we introduce the average path of a cluster. We relate the
length of this path to the reaction rate of the Smoluchowski equation. We solve
the implicit dependence between the average path and the density of clusters.
We show that this correlation length is the same for all clusters. Our result
depends strongly on the spatial dimension d. The mean-field term KMFi,j = (Di +
Dj)(rj + ri)d-2, which vanishes for d = 1 and is valid up to logarithmic
correction for d = 2, is the usual rate found with the Smoluchowski model
without correlation (where ri is the radius and Di is the diffusion constant of
the cluster). We compute a new rate: the correlation rate K_{i,j}^{C}
(D_i+D_j)(r_j+r_i)^{d-1}M{\big(\frac{d-1}{d_f}}\big) is valid for d \leq
1(where M(\alpha) = \sum+\infty i=1i\alphaNi is the moment of the density of
clusters and df is the fractal dimension of the cluster). The result is valid
for a large class of diffusion processes and mass radius relations. This
approach confirms some analytical solutions in d 1 found with other methods. We
also show Monte Carlo simulations which illustrate some exact new solvable
models.
