Shot noise cross-correlations across single layer graphene structures are
calculated with insulators separating a superconducting region. A new feature
of specular crossed Andreev reflection comes into play due to the unique band
structure of graphene. This gives rise to a rich structure in the states of the
electric current flowing across the graphene sheet. We identified a parametric
regime where {\em positive} shot noise cross-correlations of the current appear
signifying entanglement. In contrast to previous proposals the sign of the
cross-correlations can be easily tuned by the application of a gate voltage.
