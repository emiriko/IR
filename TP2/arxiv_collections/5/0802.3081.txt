A High-Q microwave (K band) MEMS resonator is presented, which empolys
substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) and micromachined via-hole arrays by ICP
process. Nonradiation dielectric waveguide (NRD) is formed by metal filled
via-hole arrays and grounded planes. The three dimensional (3D) high
resistivity silicon substrate filled cavity resonator is fed by current probes
using CPW line. This monolithic resonator results in low cost, high performance
and easy integration with planar cicuits. The measured quality factor is beyond
180 and the resonance frequency is 21GHz.It shows a good agreement with the
simulation results. The chip size is only 4.7mm x 4.6mm x 0.5mm. Finally, as an
example of applications, a filter using two SIW resonators is designed.
