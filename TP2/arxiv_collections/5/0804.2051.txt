A series of recent papers ``Faster than Hermitian Quantum Mechanics'' and
related articles made a point of the possibility of a non-Hermitian, but
PT-symmetric, operator to play the role of a Hamiltonian. In particular, they
show that with an appropriate choice of an inner product, the evolution
generated by such an operator will conserve the norm and scalar product. Here
we observe that if one chooses such an inner product then the Hamiltonian in
question is actually Hermitian, and the whole exercise is to a certain degree
redundant.
