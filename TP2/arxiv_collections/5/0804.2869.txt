Recent innovations on the differential calculus for functions of
non-commuting variables, begun for a quaternionic variable, are now extended to
the case of a general matrix over the complex numbers. The expansion of
F(X+Delta) is given to first order in Delta for general matrix variables X and
Delta that do not commute with each other.
