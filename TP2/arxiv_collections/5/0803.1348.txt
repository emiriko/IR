In this note, we report on a work jointly done with C. Simpson on a
generalization of Reznikov's theorem which says that the Chern-Simons classes
and in particular the Deligne Chern classes (in degrees $> 1$) are torsion, of
a flat vector bundle on a smooth complex projective variety. We consider the
case of a smooth quasi--projective variety with an irreducible smooth divisor
at infinity. We define the Chern-Simons classes of the Deligne's
\textit{canonical extension} of a flat vector bundle with unipotent monodromy
at infinity, which lift the Deligne Chern classes and prove that these classes
are torsion. The details of the proof can be found in arxiv:0707.0372
[math.AG].
