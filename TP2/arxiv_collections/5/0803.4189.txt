Ultra-cold atoms which are subject to ultra-relativistic dynamics are
investigated. By using optically induced gauge potentials we show that the
dynamics of the atoms is governed by a Dirac type equation. To illustrate this
we study the trembling motion of the centre of mass for an effective two level
system, historically called Zitterbewegung. Its origin is described in detail,
where in particular the role of the finite width of the atomic wave packets is
seen to induce a damping of both the centre of mass dynamics and the dynamics
of the populations of the two levels.
