We find large classes of non-asymptotically flat Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton
(EYMD) and Einstein-Yang-Mills-Born-Infeld-Dilaton (EYMBID) black holes in
N-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime expressed in terms of the
quasilocal mass. Extension of the dilatonic YM solution to N-dimensions has
been possible by employing the generalized Wu-Yang ansatz. Another metric
ansatz, which aided in finding exact solutions is the functional dependence of
the radius function on the dilaton field. These classes of black holes are
stable against linear radial perturbations. In the limit of vanishing dilaton
we obtain Bertotti-Robinson (BR) type metrics with the topology of
$AdS_{2}\times S^{N-2}.$ Since connection can be established between dilaton
and a scalar field of Brans-Dicke (BD) type we obtain black hole solutions also
in the Brans-Dicke-Yang-Mills (BDYM) theory as well.
