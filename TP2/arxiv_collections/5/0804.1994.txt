We studied the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric perturbations to
cascading gauge theory. In particular we use KT background and the back
reaction of the generic linearized perturbation make the dilaton to run and the
$T^{(1,1)}$ gets squashed which in turn make the supersymmetry to be broken.
But if we make a special linearized perturbation in such way that the
$T^{(1,1)}$ is not squashed then the corresponding perturbation preserve
supersymmetry.
