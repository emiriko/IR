The determination of non-spherical angular momentum amplitudes in nucleons at
long ranges (low Q^{2}), was accomplished through the $p(\vec{e},e'p)\pi^0$
reaction in the Delta region at $Q^2=0.060$, 0.127, and 0.200 (GeV/c)^2 at the
Mainz Microtron (MAMI) with an accuracy of 3%. The results for the dominant
transition magnetic dipole amplitude and the quadrupole to dipole ratios have
been obtained with an estimated model uncertainty which is approximately the
same as the experimental uncertainty. Lattice and effective field theory
predictions agree with our data within the relatively large estimated
theoretical uncertainties. Phenomenological models are in good agreement with
experiment when the resonant amplitudes are adjusted to the data. To check
reaction model calculations additional data were taken for center of mass
energies below resonance and for the $\sigma_{TL'}$ structure function. These
results confirm the dominance, and general Q^2 variation, of the pionic
contribution at large distances.
