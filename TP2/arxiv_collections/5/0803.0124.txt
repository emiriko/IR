Extraordinary Hall effect (EHE) is a spin-dependent phenomenon that generates
voltage proportional to magnetization across a current carrying magnetic film.
Magnitude of the effect can be artificially increased by stimulating properly
selected spin-orbit scattering events. Already achieved sensitivity of the
EHE-based sample devices exceeds 1000 Ohm/T, which surpasses the sensitivity of
semiconducting Hall sensors. Linear field response, thermal stability, high
frequency operation, sub-micron dimensions and, above all, simplicity,
robustness and low cost manufacture are good reasons to consider a wide scale
technological application of the phenomenon for magnetic sensors and memory
devices.
