Let k be a field and f be a Siegel modular form of weight h \geq 0 and genus
g>1 over k. Using f, we define an invariant of the k-isomorphism class of a
principally polarized abelian variety (A,a)/k of dimension g. Moreover when
(A,a) is the Jacobian of a smooth plane curve, we show how to associate to f a
classical plane invariant. As straightforward consequences of these
constructions, when g=3 and k is a subfield of the complex field, we obtain (i)
a new proof of a formula of Klein linking the modular form \chi_{18} to the
square of the discriminant of plane quartics ; (ii) a proof that one can decide
when (A,a) is a Jacobian over k by looking whether the value of \chi_{18} at
(A,a) is a square in k. This answers a question of J.-P. Serre. Finally, we
study the possible generalizations of this approach for g>3.
