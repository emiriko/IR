We investigate pathwise uniqueness for the squared Bessel and
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes with additional reflection term that is multiplied
by some real number strictly between minus one and one. The reflection term is
the symmetric local time of the corresponding processes at a deterministic time
dependent curve.
