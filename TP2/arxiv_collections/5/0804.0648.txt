Within the Standard Model, we investigate the weak decays of $\Lambda_b \to
\Lambda + \gamma$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda + l^{+} l^{-}$ with the light-cone
sum rules approach. The higher twist distribution amplitudes of $\Lambda$
baryon to the leading conformal spin are included in the sum rules for
transition form factors. Our results indicate that the higher twist
distribution amplitudes almost have no influences on the transition form
factors retaining the heavy quark spin symmetry, while such corrections can
result in significant impacts on the form factors breaking the heavy quark spin
symmetry. Two phenomenological models (COZ and FZOZ) for the wave function of
$\Lambda$ baryon are also employed in the sum rules for a comparison, which can
give rise to the form factors approximately 5 times larger than that in terms
of conformal expansion. Utilizing the form factors calculated in LCSR, we then
perform a careful study on the decay rate, polarization asymmetry and
forward-backward asymmetry, with respect to the decays of $\Lambda_b \to
\Lambda \gamma$, $\Lambda l^{+}l^{-}$.
