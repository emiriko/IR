ATL is a temporal logic geared towards the specification and verification of
properties in multi-agents systems. It allows to reason on the existence of
strategies for coalitions of agents in order to enforce a given property. In
this paper, we first precisely characterize the complexity of ATL
model-checking over Alternating Transition Systems and Concurrent Game
Structures when the number of agents is not fixed. We prove that it is
\Delta^P_2 - and \Delta^P_?_3-complete, depending on the underlying multi-agent
model (ATS and CGS resp.). We also consider the same problems for some
extensions of ATL. We then consider expressiveness issues. We show how ATS and
CGS are related and provide translations between these models w.r.t.
alternating bisimulation. We also prove that the standard definition of ATL
(built on modalities "Next", "Always" and "Until") cannot express the duals of
its modalities: it is necessary to explicitely add the modality "Release".
