The Lorentz transformation is used to analyse space and time coordinates
corresponding to two spatially-separated clocks in the same inertial frame. The
time dilatation effect is confirmed, but not `relativity of simultaneity' or
`relativistic length contraction'. How these latter, spurious, effects arise
from misuse of the Lorentz transformation is also explained.
