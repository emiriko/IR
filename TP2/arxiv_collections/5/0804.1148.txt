We analyze the transport properties of bilayer quantum Hall systems at total
filling factor $\nu=1$ in drag geometries as a function of interlayer bias, in
the limit where the disorder is sufficiently strong to unbind meron-antimeron
pairs, the charged topological defects of the system. We compute the typical
energy barrier for these objects to cross incompressible regions within the
disordered system using a Hartree-Fock approach, and show how this leads to
multiple activation energies when the system is biased. We then demonstrate
using a bosonic Chern-Simons theory that in drag geometries, current in a
single layer directly leads to forces on only two of the four types of merons,
inducing dissipation only in the drive layer. Dissipation in the drag layer
results from interactions among the merons, resulting in very different
temperature dependences for the drag and drive layers, in qualitative agreement
with experiment.
