We consider a system of classical Heisenberg spins on a cubic lattice in
dimensions three or more, interacting via the dipole-dipole interaction. We
prove that at low enough temperature the system displays orientational long
range order, as expected by spin wave theory. The proof is based on reflection
positivity methods. In particular, we demonstrate a previously unproven
conjecture on the dispersion relation of the spin waves, first proposed by
Froehlich and Spencer, which allows one to apply infrared bounds for estimating
the long distance behavior of the spin-spin correlation functions.
