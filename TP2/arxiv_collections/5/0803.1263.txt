We present a careful and thorough microscopic derivation of the Kondo
Hamiltonian for single-molecule magnets (SMMs) transistors. When the molecule
is strongly coupled to metallic leads, we show that by applying a transverse
magnetic field it is possible to topologically induce or quench the Kondo
effect in the conductance of a SMM with either an integer or a half-integer
spin S>1/2. This topological Kondo effect is due to the Berry phase
interference between multiple quantum tunneling paths of the spin. We calculate
the renormalized Berry phase oscillations of the two Kondo peaks as a function
of the transverse magnetic field by means of the poor man's scaling. In
particular, we show that the Kondo exchange interaction between itinerant
electrons in the leads and the SMM pseudo spin 1/2 depends crucially on the SMM
spin selection rules for the addition and subtraction of an electron and can
range from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. We illustrate our findings with
the SMM Ni4, which we propose as a possible candidate for the experimental
observation of the conductance oscillations.
