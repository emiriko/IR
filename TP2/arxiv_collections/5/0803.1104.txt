With customer relationship management (CRM) companies move away from a mainly
product-centered view to a customer-centered view. Resulting from this change,
the effective management of how to keep contact with customers throughout
different channels is one of the key success factors in today's business world.
Company Web sites have evolved in many industries into an extremely important
channel through which customers can be attracted and retained. To analyze and
optimize this channel, accurate models of how customers browse through the Web
site and what information within the site they repeatedly view are crucial.
Typically, data mining techniques are used for this purpose. However, there
already exist numerous models developed in marketing research for traditional
channels which could also prove valuable to understanding this new channel. In
this paper we propose the application of an extension of the Logarithmic Series
Distribution (LSD) model repeat-usage of Web-based information and thus to
analyze and optimize a Web Site's capability to support one goal of CRM, to
retain customers. As an example, we use the university's blended learning web
portal with over a thousand learning resources to demonstrate how the model can
be used to evaluate and improve the Web site's effectiveness.
