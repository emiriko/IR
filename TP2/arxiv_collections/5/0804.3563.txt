The observed astrophysical phenomenon of dark matter has generated new
interest in the problem of whether the principles underlying QFT are consistent
with invisibility/inertness of energy-momentum carrying "stuff" as e.g.
"unparticles". We show that the 2-dim. model which has been used to illustrate
the meaning of unparticles belongs to the class of former infraparticles models
and the latter are known to describe electrically charged particles in d=1+3
which despite their nonlocality are our best particle physics "candles". The
"invisibility" in this case refers to the infinite infrared photon cloud with
energies below the resolution and can be made arbitrarily small by increasing
the photon registering sensitivity. This is not quite the kind of invisibility
which the unparticle community attributes to their invisible "stuff" and which
would probably contradict the asymptotic completeness property. The main aim of
the present work is to show that knowledge about this part of QFT is still in
its infancy and express the hope that the work on unparticles may rekindle a
new interest in conceptually subtle old unsolved important problems.
