We have studied the charged scalar perturbation around a dilaton black hole
in 2 +1 dimensions. The wave equations of a massless charged scalar field is
shown to be exactly solvable in terms of hypergeometric functions. The
quasinormal frequencies are computed exactly. The relation between the
quasinormal frequencies and the charge of the black hole, charge of the scalar
and the temperature of the black hole are analyzed. The asymptotic form of the
real part of the quasinormal frequencies are evaluated exactly.
