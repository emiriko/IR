The periodic Lorentz gas describes an ensemble of non-interacting point
particles in a periodic array of spherical scatterers. We have recently shown
that, in the limit of small scatterer density (Boltzmann-Grad limit), the
macroscopic dynamics converges to a stochastic process, whose kinetic transport
equation is not the linear Boltzmann equation--in contrast to the Lorentz gas
with a disordered scatterer configuration. The present paper focuses on the
two-dimensional set-up, and reports an explicit, elementary formula for the
collision kernel of the transport equation.
