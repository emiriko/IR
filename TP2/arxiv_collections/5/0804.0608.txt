We give a brief summary of algebraic aspects of string theory arising in the
noncommutative geometry setting of foliations called string diagrammatics which
we introduced jointly with Bob Penner. We furthermore discuss how this gives
rise to actions on the Hochschild complex of a Frobenius algebra. We then
explain how this leads to new quantum chains for loop spaces and a
stabilization in the semi--simple case.
