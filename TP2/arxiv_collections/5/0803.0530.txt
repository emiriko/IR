We reply to the comment of Micolich et al and demonstrate that their
criticisms are unfounded. In particular we provide a detailed discussion of our
box-counting algorithm and of the interpretation of multi-layered paintings. We
point out that in their entire body of work, Taylor et al have not provided the
scientific community with sufficient empirical support of their claims, nor
have they adequately addressed any of the problems we have identified with the
application of fractal analysis to drip paintings.
