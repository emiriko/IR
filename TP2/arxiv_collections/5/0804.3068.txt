This is an easy-to-read introduction to foundations of deterministic chaos,
deterministic diffusion and anomalous diffusion. The first part introduces to
deterministic chaos in one-dimensional maps in form of Ljapunov exponents and
dynamical entropies. The second part outlines the concept of deterministic
diffusion. Then the escape rate formalism for deterministic diffusion, which
expresses the diffusion coefficient in terms of the above two chaos quantities,
is worked out for a simple map. Part three explains basics of anomalous
diffusion by demonstrating the stochastic approach of continuous time random
walk theory for an intermittent map. As an example of experimental
applications, the anomalous dynamics of biological cell migration is discussed.
