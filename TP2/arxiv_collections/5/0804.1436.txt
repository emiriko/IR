We introduce Loop Ranking, a new ranking measure based on the detection of
closed paths, which can be computed in an efficient way. We analyze it with
respect to several ranking measures which have been proposed in the past, and
are widely used to capture the relative importance of the vertices in complex
networks. We argue that Loop Ranking is a very appropriate measure to quantify
the role of both vertices and edges in the network traffic.
