We have realized and measured a GaAs nanocavity in a slab photonic crystal
based on the design by Kuramochi et al. [Appl. Phys.Lett., \textbf{88}, 041112,
(2006)]. We measure a quality factor Q=700,000, which proves that ultra-high Q
nanocavities are also feasible in GaAs. We show that, due to larger two-photon
absorption (TPA) in GaAs, nonlinearities appear at the microwatt-level and will
be more functional in gallium arsenide than in silicon nanocavities.
