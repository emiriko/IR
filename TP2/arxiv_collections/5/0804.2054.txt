If a photon fluctuates from 'nothing', what would it look like and how would
it behave? Here we examine such a photon and the possible characteristics and
effects it may have. If contrary to theoretical expectation, it is not
short-lived, we find quantitative and qualitative similarities with the
quantitative and qualitative features of the standard big bang model. As it
also seems devoid of some of the horizon, homogenous, flatness, singularity and
temperature problems that plague the big bang model, issues surrounding this
photon's life expectancy may need to be re-visited by cosmologists.
