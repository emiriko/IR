The asymptotic solution of the Schrodinger equation with non-separable
variables is obtained for a particle confined to an infinite elliptic cylinder
potential well under applied uniform longitudinal magnetic field. Using
standard-problem method, dimension quantized eigenvalues have been calculated
when the magnetic length is large enough in comparison with the half of the
distance between the boundary ellipse focuses. In semi-classical approximation,
the confined electron (hole) states are divided into the Boundary States (BS),
Ring States (RS), Hyperbolic Caustic States (HCS), and Harmonic Oscillator
States (HOS). For large angular momentum quantum numbers and small radial
quantum numbers, the BS and RS are grouped into the Whispering Gallery mode.
They associate with particles moving along the wire cross section boundary. The
motion is limited from the wire core by the elliptic caustic. Consisting of the
HCS and HOS, the Jumping Ball modes correspond to the states of particle moving
along a wire diameter when the angular momentum quantum number is much less
than the radial quantum number. In this case, the motion is restricted by the
hyperbolic caustics and two boundary ellipse arcs. For excited hole states in
Bi wire, the energy spectrum and space probability distribution are analyzed.
