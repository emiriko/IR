We construct a supersymmetric model based on $T'\otimes Z_3\otimes Z_9$
flavor symmetry. At the leading order, the charged lepton mass matrix is not
diagonal, $T'$ is broken completely, and the hierarchy in the charged lepton
masses is generated naturally. Nearly tri-bimaximal mixing is predicted,
subleading effects induce corrections of order $\lambda^2$, where $\lambda$ is
the Cabibbo angle. Both the up quark and down quark mass matrices textures of
the well-known U(2) flavor theory are produced at the leading order, realistic
hierarchies in quark masses and CKM matrix elements are obtained. The vacuum
alignment and subleading corrections are discussed in detail.
