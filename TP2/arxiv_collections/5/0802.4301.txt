A three-family non-supersymmetric model with U(3)^3 gauge symmetry is
analyzed in the context of intersecting D-branes. This is equivalent to the
`trinification' model extended by three U(1) factors which survive as global
symmetries in the low energy effective model. The Standard Model fermions are
accommodated in the three possible bifundamental multiplets represented by
strings with endpoints attached on different brane-stacks of this particular
setup. Further, a natural Quark-Lepton hierarchy is realized due to the
existence of the additional abelian symmetries
