We cryptanalyse here two variants of the McEliece cryptosystem based on
quasi-cyclic codes. Both aim at reducing the key size by restricting the public
and secret generator matrices to be in quasi-cyclic form. The first variant
considers subcodes of a primitive BCH code. We prove that this variant is not
secure by finding and solving a linear system satisfied by the entries of the
secret permutation matrix.
  The other variant uses quasi-cyclic low density parity-check codes. This
scheme was devised to be immune against general attacks working for McEliece
type cryptosystems based on low density parity-check codes by choosing in the
McEliece scheme more general one-to-one mappings than permutation matrices. We
suggest here a structural attack exploiting the quasi-cyclic structure of the
code and a certain weakness in the choice of the linear transformations that
hide the generator matrix of the code. Our analysis shows that with high
probability a parity-check matrix of a punctured version of the secret code can
be recovered in cubic time complexity in its length. The complete
reconstruction of the secret parity-check matrix of the quasi-cyclic low
density parity-check codes requires the search of codewords of low weight which
can be done with about $2^{37}$ operations for the specific parameters
proposed.
