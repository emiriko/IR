We consider fermionic UV completions of little Higgs models and their
associated T-parity violating anomalous vertices. In particular, we investigate
strategies to avoid such parity-violating anomalies. We show that it is
unlikely a QCD-like UV completion could be used to implement a model with
anomaly-free global symmetry groups. This is because the vacuum state is
unlikely to achieve the necessary alignment. However, we will see that certain
multi-link moose models, although anomalous, possess a modified form of
T-parity that leads to a stable particle. Finally, we briefly discuss a
discriminant for detecting anomalous decays at colliders.
