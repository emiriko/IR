We study dynamic fluctuation effects of $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ thin films in
zero field around $T_c$ by doing frequency-dependent microwave conductivity
measurements at different powers. The length scales probed in the experiments
are varied systematically allowing us to analyze data which are not affected by
the finite thickness of the films, and to observe single-parameter scaling. DC
current-voltage characteristics have also been measured to independently probe
fluctuations in the same samples. The combination of DC and microwave
measurements allows us to precisely determine critical parameters. Our results
give a dynamical scaling exponent $z=1.55\pm0.15$, which is consistent with
model E-dynamics.
