We present the results of the first hadron collider search for heavy,
long-lived neutralinos that decay via lightest neutralino to gamma gravitino in
gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models. Using an integrated luminosity of
$570\pm34 pb^{-1}$ of $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV, we select
$\gamma$+jet+missing transverse energy candidate events based on the arrival
time of a high-energy photon at the electromagnetic calorimeter as measured
with a timing system that was recently installed on the CDF II detector. We
find 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3$\pm$0.7 events.
While our search strategy does not rely on model-specific dynamics, we set
cross section limits and place the world-best 95% C.L. lower limit on the
neutralino mass of 101 GeV at lifetime = 5 ns.
