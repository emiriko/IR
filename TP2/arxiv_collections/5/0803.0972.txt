A phase space treatment of special relativity of quantum systems is
developed. In this approach a quantum particle remains localized if subject to
inertial transformations, the localization occurring in a finite phase space
area. Unlike non-relativistic transformations, relativistic transformations
generally distort the phase space distribution function, being equivalent to
aberrations in optics.
