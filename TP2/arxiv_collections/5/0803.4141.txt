Numerical simulations with access to all possible meson quantum numbers,
J^{PC}, are presented using two-flavor (up and down) quenched twisted mass
lattice QCD with three different lattice spacings and four different quark
masses. The connection between the quantum numbers (P and C) and the symmetries
of the twisted mass action are discussed, as is the connection between J and
the lattice rotation group, for the 400 operators used in this study. Curve
fitting of this large data set is accomplished by using an evolutionary fitting
algorithm. Results are reported for conventional and exotic quantum numbers.
