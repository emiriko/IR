In this paper, we systematically study the contribution of the TC2 model to
the single t-quark production at the Hadron colliders, specially at the LHC.
The TC2 model can contribute to the cross section of the single t-quark
production in two different ways. First, the existence of the top-pions and
top-higgs can modify the $Wtb$ coupling via their loop contributions, and such
modification can cause the correction to the cross sections of all three
production modes. Our study shows that this kind of correction is negative and
very small in all cases. Thus it is difficult to observe such correction even
at the LHC. On the other hand, there exist the tree-level FC couplings in the
TC2 model which can also contribute to the cross sections of the $tq$ and
$t\bar{b}$ production processes. The resonant effect can greatly enhance the
cross sections of the $tq$ and $t\bar{b}$ productions. The first evidence of
the single t-quark production has been reported by the $D0$ collaboration and
the measured cross section for the single t-quark production of
$\sigma(p\bar{p}\to tb+X,tqb+X)$ is compatible at the 10% level with the
standard model prediction. Because the light top-pion can make great
contribution to the $t\bar{b}$ production, the top-pion mass should be very
large in order to make the predicted cross section in the TC2 model be
consistent with the Tevatron experiments. More detailed information about the
top-pion mass and the FC couplings in the TC2 model should be obtained with the
running of the LHC.
