In this paper, we present details of the dual fermion (DF) method to study
the non-local correction to single site DMFT. The DMFT two-particle Green's
function is calculated using continuous time quantum monte carlo (CT-QMC)
method. The momentum dependence of the vertex function is analyzed and its
renormalization based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation is performed in
particle-hole channel. We found a magnetic instability in both the dual and the
lattice fermions. The lattice fermion susceptibility is calculated at finite
temperature in this method and also in another recently proposed method, namely
dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A). The comparison between these two
methods are presented in both weak and strong coupling region. Compared to the
susceptibility from quantum monte carlo (QMC) simulation, both of them gave
satisfied results.
