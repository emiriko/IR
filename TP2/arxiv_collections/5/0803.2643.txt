"Quantum trajectories" are solutions of stochastic differential equations of
non-usual type. Such equations are called "Belavkin" or "Stochastic
Schr\"odinger Equations" and describe random phenomena in continuous
measurement theory of Open Quantum System. Many recent investigations deal with
the control theory in such model. In this article, stochastic models are
mathematically and physically justified as limit of concrete discrete
procedures called "Quantum Repeated Measurements". In particular, this gives a
rigorous justification of the Poisson and diffusion approximation in quantum
measurement theory with control. Furthermore we investigate some examples using
control in quantum mechanics.
