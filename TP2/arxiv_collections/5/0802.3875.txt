Evolutionary complexity is here measured by the number of trials/evaluations
needed for evolving a logical gate in a non-linear medium. Behavioural
complexity of the gates evolved is characterised in terms of cellular automata
behaviour. We speculate that hierarchies of behavioural and evolutionary
complexities are isomorphic up to some degree, subject to substrate specificity
of evolution and the spectrum of evolution parameters.
