We consider the motion of many confined billiard balls in interaction and
discuss their transport and chaotic properties. In spite of the absence of mass
transport, due to confinement, energy transport can take place through binary
collisions between neighbouring particles. We explore the conditions under
which relaxation to local equilibrium occurs on time scales much shorter than
that of binary collisions, which characterize the transport of energy, and
subsequent relaxation to local thermal equilibrium. Starting from the
pseudo-Liouville equation for the time evolution of phase-space distributions,
we derive a master equation which governs the energy exchange between the
system constituents. We thus obtain analytical results relating the transport
coefficient of thermal conductivity to the frequency of collision events and
compute these quantities. We also provide estimates of the Lyapunov exponents
and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy under the assumption of scale separation. The
validity of our results is confirmed by extensive numerical studies.
