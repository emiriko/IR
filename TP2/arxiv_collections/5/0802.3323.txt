A phenomenological model based on the three-dimensional theory of nonlinear
elasticity is developed to describe the phenomenon of overstretching in the
force-extension curve for dsDNA. By using the concept of a material with
multiple reference configurations a single formula is obtained to fit the
force-extension curve.
