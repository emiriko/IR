An Al-11.3Li-0.11Sc (at. %) alloy was double-aged to induce first
alpha'-Al3Sc and then delta'-Al3Li precipitates. Atom-probe tomography revealed
both single-phase delta'-precipitates and core-shell alpha'/delta'-precipitates
(with respective average radii of 16 and 27 nm, and respective volume fractions
of 12 and 9%) conferring a high strength to the alloy. Although the
delta'-shells contain little Sc (~0.027 at. %), the alpha'-cores have a high Li
content, with an average composition of Al0.72(Sc0.17 Li0.11). The Li
concentrations within the delta'-phase and the Li interfacial excess at the
delta'/alpha'-interface both exhibit wide precipitate-to-precipitate
variations.
