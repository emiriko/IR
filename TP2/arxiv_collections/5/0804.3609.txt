We investigate the static and dynamic properties of bosonic lattice systems
in which condensed and Mott insulating phases co-exist due to the presence of a
spatially-varying potential. We formulate a description of these inhomogeneous
systems and calculate the bulk energy at and near equilibrium. We derive the
explicit form of the Josephson coupling between disjoint superfluid regions
separated by Mott insulating regions. We obtain detailed estimates for the
experimentally-realized case of alternating superfluid and Mott insulating
spherical shells in a radially symmetric parabolically-confined cold atom
system.
