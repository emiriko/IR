Most of the literature on quantum vortices predicting various states of
vortex matter in three dimensions at finite temperatures in quantum fluids is
based on an assumption of an extended and homogeneous system. It is well known
not to be the case in actual Bose--Einstein condensates in traps which are
finite systems with nonuniform density. This raises the question to what extent
one can speak of different aggregate states of vortex matter (vortex lattices,
liquids and tensionless vortex tangle) in these system. To address this point,
in the present work we focus on the finite-size, boundaries and density
inhomogeneity effects on thermal vortex matter in a Bose--Einstein condensate.
To this end we perform Monte Carlo simulations on a model system describing
trapped Bose--Einstein condensates. Throughout the paper, we draw on analogies
with results for vortex matter obtained for extended systems. This work
suggests that finiteness and intrinsic inhomogeneity of the system not
withstanding, one nonetheless can approximately invoke the notion of distinct
aggregate states of vortex matter realized at certain length scales. This might
be helpful, in particular in search of possible new states of vortex matter in
Bose--Einstein condensates with multiple components and different symmetries.
