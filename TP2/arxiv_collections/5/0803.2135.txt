We extend the notion of $P_4$-sparse graphs previously introduced by
{\scshape Ho\`ang} by considering $\mathcal{F}$-sparse graphs were
$\mathcal{F}$ denotes a finite set of graphs on $p$ vertices. Thus we obtain
some results on $(P_5,\bar{P_5})$-sparse graphs already known on
$(P_5,\bar{P_5})$-free graphs. Finally we completely describe the structure of
$(P_5,\bar{P_5}, bull$)-sparse graphs, it follows that those graphs have
bounded clique-width.
