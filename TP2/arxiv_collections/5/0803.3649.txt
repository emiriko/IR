Quasi-two-dimensional transport is investigated in a system consisting of one
ferromagnetic layer placed between two insulating layers. Using the mechanism
of skew-scattering to describe the Extraordinary Hall Effect (EHE) and
calculating the conductivity tensor, we compare the quasi- two-dimensional Hall
resistance with the resistance of a massive sample. In this study a new
mechanism of EHE (geometric mechanism of EHE) due to non-ideal interfaces and
volume defects is also proposed.
