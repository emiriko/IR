We consider the direct and indirect detection signatures of WIMPs \chi^0 in
kinematic regimes with a heavier, but nearly degenerate, charged state
\chi^{+-}. For small splittings of O(10) MeV, the scattering of WIMPs off
nuclei may be dominated by inelastic recombination processes mediated by the
formation of (\chi^- N) bound states, leading to a distinct signature for
direct detection. These cross-sections are bound primarily by limits on the
abundance of heavy isotopes, and may be considerably larger than the elastic
scattering cross section in more conventional models. If the mass splitting is
too large for recombination to occur, there may still be a significant resonant
enhancement of loop-induced electromagnetic form-factors of the WIMP, which can
enhance the elastic scattering cross-section. We also discuss how this regime
affects the annihilation cross-section and indirect detection signatures, and
note the possibility of a significant mono-energetic \gamma-signal, mediated by
resonant processes near the (\chi^+\chi^-) bound state threshold.
