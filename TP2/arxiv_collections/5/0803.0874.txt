A method for solving cyclic block three-diagonal systems of equations is
generalized for solving a block cyclic penta-diagonal system of equations.
Introducing a special form of two new variables the original system is split
into three block pentagonal systems, which can be solved by the known methods.
As such method belongs to class of direct methods without pivoting.
Implementation of the algorithm is discussed in some details and the numerical
examples are present.
