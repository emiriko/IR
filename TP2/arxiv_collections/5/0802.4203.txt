Energy level quantization (ELQ) is studied to clarify the macroscopic quantum
dynamics of the d-wave Josephson junction (JJ). The influences of the nodal
quasiparticles of d-wave superconductivity on the damping effect are
numerically evaluated on the basis of a phenomenological model. The
calculation, based on realistic parameters for a Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d (Bi2212)
intrinsic JJ, shows that the observation of ELQ is possible when the sweep rate
of the bias current exceeds 10 A/sec. High-sweep- rate measurements (121A/sec)
performed on a Bi2212 intrinsic JJ result in the appearance of multiple peaks
in the switching current distribution suggesting the realization of ELQ in the
d-wave JJ.
