It is shown that $f$-electron multipole is naturally defined as spin-charge
one-electron density operator in the second-quantized form with the use of
tensor operator on the analogy of multipole expansion of electromagnetic
potential from charge distribution in electromagnetism. Due to this definition
of multipole, it is possible to determine multipole state from a microscopic
viewpoint on the basis of the standard linear response theory for multipole
susceptibility. In order to discuss multipole properties of filled
skutterudites, we analyze a seven-orbital impurity Anderson model by employing
a numerical renormalization group method. We show our results on possible
multipole states of filled skutterudite compounds.
