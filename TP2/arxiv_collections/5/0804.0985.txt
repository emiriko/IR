By means of time-resolved Kerr spectroscopy experiments we relate the energy
dissipation processes on the femtosecond (electron-spin relaxation time
$\tau_{el-sp}$) and nanosecond timescale (Gilbert relaxation $\tau_{\alpha}$)
and compare the results to the first microscopic model, which was proposed by
Koopmans. For both energy dissipation processes, Elliot-Yafet scattering is
proposed as the dominant contributor. We controllably manipulate the energy
dissipation processes by transition metal doping (Pd) and rare earth doping
(Dy) of a Permalloy film and find that while a change of $\tau_{\alpha}$ of
more than a factor two is observed, \tau_{el-sp}$ remains constant, contrary to
the predictions of the model. We explain the discrepancies by relaxation
channels not considered in the original microscopic model and identify thereby
the applicability of the model and possible necessary extensions to the model.
