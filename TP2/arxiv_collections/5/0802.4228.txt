There have been many theoretical models constructed which aim to explain the
neutrino masses and mixing patterns. While many of the models will be
eliminated once more accurate determinations of the mixing parameters,
especially $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$, are obtained, charged lepton flavor violation
(LFV) experiments are able to differentiate even further among the models. In
this paper, we investigate various rare LFV processes, such as $\ell_{i} \to
\ell_{j} + \gamma$ and $\mu-e$ conversion, in five predictive supersymmetric
(SUSY) SO(10) models and their allowed soft-SUSY breaking parameter space in
the constrained minimal SUSY standard model. Utilizing the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe dark matter constraints, we obtain lower bounds on the
branching ratios of these rare processes and find that at least three of the
five models we consider give rise to predictions for $\mu \to e + \gamma$ that
will be tested by the MEG Collaboration at PSI. In addition, the next
generation $\mu-e$ conversion experiment has sensitivity to the predictions of
all five models, making it an even more robust way to test these models. While
generic studies have emphasized the dependence of the branching ratios of these
rare processes on the reactor neutrino angle $\theta_{13}$ and the mass of the
heaviest right-handed neutrino $M_3$, we find very massive $M_3$ is more
significant than large $\theta_{13}$ in leading to branching ratios near to the
present upper limits.
