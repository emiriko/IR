The temperature equilibration rate in dense hydrogen (for both T_{i}>T_{e}
and T_i<T_e) has been calculated with molecular dynamics simulations for
temperatures between 10 and 600 eV and densities between 10^{20}/cc to
10^{24}/cc. Careful attention has been devoted to convergence of the
simulations, including the role of semiclassical potentials. We find that for
Coulomb logarithms L>1, a model by Gericke-Murillo-Schlanges (GMS) [Gericke et
al., PRE 65, 036418 (2002)] based on a T-matrix method and the approach by
Brown-Preston-Singleton [Brown et al., Phys. Rep. 410, 237 (2005)] agrees with
the simulation data to within the error bars of the simulation. For smaller
Coulomb logarithms, the GMS model is consistent with the simulation results.
Landau-Spitzer models are consistent with the simulation data for L>4.
