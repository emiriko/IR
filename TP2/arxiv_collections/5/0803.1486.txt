The Kondo lattice model enlarged by an antiferromagnetic coupling $J_{\rm
AF}$ between the localized spins is here investigated using computational
techniques. Our results suggest the existence of a d-wave superconducting phase
close to half-filling mediated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations. This
establishes a closer connection between theory and heavy fermion experiments
than currently provided by the standard Kondo lattice model with $J_{\rm
AF}$=0.
