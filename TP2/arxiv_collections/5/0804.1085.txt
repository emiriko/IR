We show that the introduction of a hyperbolic phase for Brans-Dicke (BD)
field results in a flat vacuum cosmological solution of Hubble parameter H and
fractional rate of change of BD scalar field, F which asymptotically approach
constant values. At late stages, hyperbolic phase of BD field behaves like dark
matter.
