We report on the nano-electron beam assisted fabrication of atomically sharp
iron-based tips and on the creation of a nano-soldering iron for
nano-interconnects using Fe-filled multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). High
energy electron beam machining has been proven a powerful tool to modify
desired nanostructures for technological applications and to form molecular
junctions and interconnections between carbon nanotubes. Recent studies showed
the high degree of complexity in the creation of direct interconnections
between multiwalled and CNTs having dissimilar diameters. Our technique allows
for carving a MWCNT into a nanosoldering iron that was demonstrated capable of
joining two separated halves of a tube. This approach could easily be extended
to the interconnection of two largely dissimilar CNTs, between a CNT and a
nanowire or between two nanowires.
