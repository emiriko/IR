In recent years two fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics have attracted a
great deal of interest, namely the investigation on the irreducible nonlocal
properties of Nature implied by quantum entanglement and the physical
realization of the 'Schroedinger Cat'. In the present work a macro - state
consisting of about 3.5 x 10^4 photons in a quantum superposition and entangled
with a far apart single - photon state is generated. Then, the non-separability
of the overall micro-macro system is demonstrated and the corresponding Bell's
inequalities are found to be violated. Precisely, an entangled photon pair is
created by a nonlinear optical process, then one photon of the pair is injected
into an optical parametric amplifier operating for any input polarization
state, i.e. into a phase-covariant cloning machine. Such transformation
establishes a connection between the single photon and the multi particle
fields. We then demonstrate the non-separability of the bipartite system by
adopting a local filtering technique within a positive operator valued
measurement.
