Fluids of grade n are continuous media in dynamic changes of phases avoiding
the surfaces of discontinuity and representing the capillary layers in
liquid-vapour interfaces. We recall the thermodynamic form of the equation of
motion for inviscid fluids of grade n. First integrals and theorems of
circulation are deduced. A general classification of flows is proposed.
