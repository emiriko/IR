We present an investigation for the generation of intense magnetic fields in
dense plasmas with an anisotropic electron Fermi-Dirac distribution. For this
purpose, we use a new linear dispersion relation for transverse waves in the
Wigner-Maxwell dense quantum plasma system. Numerical analysis of the
dispersion relation reveals the scaling of the growth rate as a function of the
Fermi energy and the temperature anisotropy. The nonlinear saturation level of
the magnetic fields is found through fully kinetic simulations, which indicates
that the final amplitudes of the magnetic fields are proportional to the linear
growth rate of the instability. The present results are important for
understanding the origin of intense magnetic fields in dense Fermionic plasmas,
such as those in the next generation intense laser-solid density plasma
experiments.
