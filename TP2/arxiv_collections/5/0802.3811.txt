We use a phase-separated driven two-dimensional Ising lattice gas to study
fluid interfaces exposed to shear flow parallel to the interface. The interface
is stabilized by two parallel walls with opposing surface fields and a driving
field parallel to the walls is applied which (i) either acts locally at the
walls or (ii) varies linearly with distance across the strip. Using computer
simulations with Kawasaki dynamics, we find that the system reaches a steady
state in which the magnetisation profile is the same as that in equilibrium,
but with a rescaled length implying a reduction of the interfacial width. An
analogous effect was recently observed in sheared phase-separated colloidal
dispersions. Pair correlation functions along the interface decay more rapidly
with distance under drive than in equilibrium and for cases of weak drive can
be rescaled to the equilibrium result.
