In the 80th birthday conference for Professor LU Qikeng in June 2006 I gave a
talk on the analytic approach to the finite generation of the canonical ring
for a compact complex algebraic manifold of general type. This article is my
contribution to the proceedings of that conference from my talk. In this
article I give an overview of the analytic proof and focus on explaining how
the analytic method handles the problem of infinite number of interminable
blow-ups in the intuitive approach to prove the finite generation of the
canonical ring. The proceedings of the LU Qikeng conference will appear as
