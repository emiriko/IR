Kaltofen has proposed a new approach in [Kaltofen 1992] for computing matrix
determinants. The algorithm is based on a baby steps/giant steps construction
of Krylov subspaces, and computes the determinant as the constant term of a
characteristic polynomial. For matrices over an abstract field and by the
results of Baur and Strassen 1983, the determinant algorithm, actually a
straight-line program, leads to an algorithm with the same complexity for
computing the adjoint of a matrix [Kaltofen 1992]. However, the latter is
obtained by the reverse mode of automatic differentiation and somehow is not
``explicit''. We study this adjoint algorithm, show how it can be implemented
(without resorting to an automatic transformation), and demonstrate its use on
polynomial matrices.
