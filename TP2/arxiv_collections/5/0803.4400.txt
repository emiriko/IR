We analyze the validity of perturbative renormalization group estimates
obtained within the fixed dimension approach of frustrated magnets. We
reconsider the resummed five-loop beta-functions obtained within the minimal
subtraction scheme without epsilon-expansion for both frustrated magnets and
the well-controlled ferromagnetic systems with a cubic anisotropy. Analyzing
the convergence properties of the critical exponents in these two cases we find
that the fixed point supposed to control the second order phase transition of
frustrated magnets is very likely an unphysical one. This is supported by its
non-Gaussian character at the upper critical dimension d=4. Our work confirms
the weak first order nature of the phase transition occuring at three
dimensions and provides elements towards a unified picture of all existing
theoretical approaches to frustrated magnets.
