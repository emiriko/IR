We define a deterministic ``scattering'' model for heat conduction which is
continuous in space, and which has a Boltzmann type flavor, obtained by a
closure based on memory loss between collisions. We prove that this model has,
for stochastic driving forces at the boundary, close to Maxwellians, a unique
non-equilibrium steady state.
