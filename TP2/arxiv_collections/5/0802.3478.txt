I describe preliminary experiments in documenting Excelsior versions of
spreadsheets using semantic wikis and literate programming. The objective is to
create well-structured and comprehensive documentation, easy to use by those
unfamiliar with the spreadsheets documented. I discuss why so much
documentation is hard to use, and briefly explain semantic wikis and literate
programming; although parts of the paper are Excelsior-specific, these sections
may be of more general interest.
