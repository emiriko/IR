Although more than twenty years have passed since the discovery of high
temperature cuprate superconductivity, the identification of the
superconducting order parameter is still under debate. Here, we show that the
nodal gap component is the best candidate for the superconducting order
parameter. It scales with the critical temperature $T_c$ over a wide doping
range and displays a significant temperature dependence below $T_c$ in both the
underdoped and the overdoped regimes of the phase diagram. In contrast, the
antinodal gap component does not scale with $T_c$ in the underdoped side and
appears to be controlled by the pseudogap amplitude. Our experiments establish
the existence of two distinct gaps in the underdoped cuprates.
