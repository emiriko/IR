The effect of the magnetic field on a capacitor with a superconducting
electrode is studied within the Ginzburg-Landau approach. It is shown that the
capacitance has a discontinuity at the onset of the surface superconductivity
$B_{\rm c3}$ which is expressed as a discontinuity in the penetration depth of
the electric field into metals. Estimates show that this discontinuity is
observable with recent bridges for both conventional and high-$T_{\rm c}$
superconductors of the type-II.
