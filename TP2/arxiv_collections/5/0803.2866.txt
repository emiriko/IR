The growing consensus that a strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) has
been observed at the SPS and RHIC experiments suggests a different framework
for examining heavy quark dynamics. We present both semi-analytical treatment
of Fokker-Planck (FP) evolution in pedagogical examples and numerical Langevin
simulations of evolving charm quark-antiquark pairs on top of a
hydrodynamically expanding fireball. In this way, we may conclude that the
survival probability of bound charmonia states is greater than previously
estimated, as the spatial equilibration of pairs proceeds through a ``slowly
dissolving lump'' stage related to the pair interaction.
