We consider the BPS dyonic instantons in the 5-dim supersymmetric Yang-Mills
Chern-Simons theories. Its field theoretic structures and the moduli space
dynamics in term of the ADHM data have been explored in detail. We find that
the field theoretic Chern-Simons term leads to an effective magnetic field on
instanton moduli space.
