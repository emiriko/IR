We analytically and numerically study the effects of pulsed control on the
decoherence of a qubit coupled to a quantum spin bath. When the environment is
critical, decoherence is faster and we show that the control is relatively more
effective. Two coupling models are investigated, namely a qubit coupled to a
bath via a single link and a spin star model, yielding results that are similar
and consistent.
