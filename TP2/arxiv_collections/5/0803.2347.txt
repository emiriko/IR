I review basic concepts of chiral effective field theories guided by an
historical perspective: from the first ideas to the merging with other
effective frameworks, and to the interplay with lattice field theory. The
impact of recent theoretical developments on phenomenological predictions is
reviewed with attention for rare decays, and charm physics. I conclude with a
critical look at future applications.
