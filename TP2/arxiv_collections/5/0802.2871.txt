We investigate quantitative extensions of modal logic and the modal
mu-calculus, and study the question whether the tight connection between logic
and games can be lifted from the qualitative logics to their quantitative
counterparts. It turns out that, if the quantitative mu-calculus is defined in
an appropriate way respecting the duality properties between the logical
operators, then its model checking problem can indeed be characterised by a
quantitative variant of parity games. However, these quantitative games have
quite different properties than their classical counterparts, in particular
they are, in general, not positionally determined. The correspondence between
the logic and the games goes both ways: the value of a formula on a
quantitative transition system coincides with the value of the associated
quantitative game, and conversely, the values of quantitative parity games are
definable in the quantitative mu-calculus.
