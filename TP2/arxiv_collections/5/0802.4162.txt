The phase locking behavior of spin transfer nano-oscillators (STNOs) to an
external microwave signal is experimentally studied as a function of the STNO
intrinsic parameters. We extract the coupling strength from our data using the
derived phase dynamics of a forced STNO. The predicted trends on the coupling
strength for phase locking as a function of intrinsic features of the
oscillators i.e. power, linewidth, agility in current, are central to optimize
the emitted power in arrays of mutually coupled STNOs.
