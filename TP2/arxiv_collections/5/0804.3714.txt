Radiative decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons are calculated in the
framework of the chiral Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. We use the amplitude
for triangle quark loops of anomalous type. In evaluating these loop integrals
we use two methods. In the first one, we neglect the dependence of external
momenta by reproducing the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms of effective chiral meson
Lagrangian. In the second method, we take into account the momentum dependence
of loop integrals omitting their imaginary part. This makes it possible to
allow for quark confinement. As applied both the methods is in qualitative
agreement with each other and with experimental data. The second method allows
us to describe the electron-positron annihilation with production of $\eta'$
and $\rho$ mesons in the center of mass energy range from 1.6 to 3.5$\GeV$. The
comparison with the recent experimental data is presented.
