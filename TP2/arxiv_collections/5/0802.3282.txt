The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) can be explored in relativistic heavy ion
collisions by the jet quenching signature, i.e. by the energy loss of a high
energy quark or gluon traversing the plasma. We introduce a novel QCD evolution
formalism in the leading logarithm approximation, where normal parton radiation
is interleaved with scattering on the plasma gluons occuring at a similar time
scale. The idea is elaborated in two approaches. One extends the DGLAP
evolution equations for fragmentation functions to include scatterings in the
medium, which facilitates numerical solutions for comparison with data and
provides a basis for a Monte Carlo implementation. The other approach is more
general by including also the transverse momentum dependence of the jet
evolution, which allows a separation of the scales also for the scattering term
and provides a basis for analytical investigations. The two approaches are
shown to be related and give the same characteristic softening of the jet
depending on the temperature of the plasma. A substantial effect is found at
the RHIC energy and is further enhanced at LHC. Systematic studies of data on
the energy loss could, therefore, demonstrate the existence of the QGP and
probe its properties.
