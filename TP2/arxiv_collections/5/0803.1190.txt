The metal insulator transition of nano-scaled $VO_2$ devices is drastically
different from the smooth transport curves generally reported. The temperature
driven transition occurs through a series of resistance jumps ranging over 2
decades in amplitude, indicating that the transition is caused by avalanches.
We find a power law distribution of the jump amplitudes, demonstrating an
inherent property of the $VO_2$ films. We report a surprising relation between
jump amplitude and device size. A percolation model captures the general
transport behavior, but cannot account for the statistical behavior.
