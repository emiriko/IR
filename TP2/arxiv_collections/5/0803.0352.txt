We present a first-principle study of spin-orbit coupling effects on the
Fermi surface of Sr2RuO4 and Sr2RhO4. For nearly degenerate bands, spin-orbit
coupling leads to a dramatic change of the Fermi surface with respect to
non-relativistic calculations; as evidenced by the comparison with experiments
on Sr2RhO4, it cannot be disregarded. For Sr2RuO4, the Fermi surface
modifications are more subtle but equally dramatic in the detail: spin-orbit
coupling induces a strong momentum dependence, normal to the RuO2 planes, for
both orbital and spin character of the low-energy electronic states. These
findings have profound implications for the understanding of unconventional
superconductivity in Sr2RuO4.
