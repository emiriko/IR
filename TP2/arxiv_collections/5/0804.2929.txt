Universal P-V-T equations of states are derived from the original isothermal
expressions of Birch-Murnaghan and the Vinet EoSs by using absolute reference
frame and incorporating the temperature dependence of the parameters. The
equations are tested against the experiments of perovskite [MgSiO3] and
periclase [MgO]. The determined parameters of the EoSs are valid throughout the
entire pressure and temperature ranges, which cover 0-142 GPa and 293-3000 K
and 0-109 GPa and 293-2199 K for periclase and perovskite respectively. The
root-mean-square (RMS) misfits of the universal Birch-Murnaghan EoS are 0.73
and 0.33 GPa and the misfit of the Vinet EoS are 0.74 and 0.32 GPa for
perovskite and periclase respectively.
