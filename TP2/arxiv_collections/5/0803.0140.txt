Non-critical String Cosmologies are offered as an alternative to Standard Big
Bang Cosmology. The new features encompassed within the dilaton dependent
non-critical terms affect the dynamics of the Universe\'s evolution in an
unconventional manner being in agreement with the cosmological data.
Non-criticality is responsible for a late transition to acceleration at
redshifts z=0.2. The role of the uncoupled rolling dilaton to relic abundance
calculations is discussed. The uncoupled rolling dilaton dilutes the neutralino
relic densities in supersymmetric theories by factors of ten, relaxing
considerably the severe WMAP Dark Matter constraints, while at the same time
leaves almost unaffected the baryon density in agreement with primordial
Nucleosynthesis.
