Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) is a standard technique for the study of
magnetic properties of materials in synchrotron beamlines. We present here a
new scattering geometry in the Transmission Electron Microscope through which
MCD can be observed with unprecedented spatial resolution. A convergent
electron beam is used to scan a multilayer Fe/Au sample and record energy loss
spectra. Differences in the spectra induced by the magnetic moments of the Fe
atoms can be resolved with a resolution of 2 nm. This is a breakthrough
achievement when compared both to the previous EMCD resolution (200 nm) or the
best XMCD experiments (approx. 20 nm), with an improvement of two and one order
of magnitude, respectively.
