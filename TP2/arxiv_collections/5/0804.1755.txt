We introduce a Lagrangian formulation of the Density Matrix Renormalization
Group (DMRG). We present Lagrangians which when minimised yield the optimal
DMRG wavefunction in a variational sense, both within the general matrix
product ansatz, as well as within the canonical form of the matrix product that
is constructed within the DMRG sweep algorithm. Some of the results obtained
are similar to elementary expressions in Hartree-Fock theory, and we draw
attention to such analogies. The Lagrangians introduced here will be useful in
developing theories of analytic response and derivatives in the DMRG.
