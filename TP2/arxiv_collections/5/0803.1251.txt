We use the numerical renormalization group method (NRG) to investigate a
single-impurity Anderson model with a coupling of the impurity to a
superconducting host. Analysis of the energy flow shows, in contrast to
previous belief, that NRG iterations can be performed up to a large number of
sites, corresponding to energy differences far below the superconducting gap.
This allows us to calculate the impurity spectral function very accurately for
frequencies near the gap edge, and to resolve, in a certain parameter regime,
sharp peaks in the spectral function close to the gap edge.
