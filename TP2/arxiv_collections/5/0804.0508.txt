We report the first experimental observation of bright EPR beams produced by
a type-II optical parametric oscillator operating above threshold at frequency
degeneracy. The degenerate operation is obtained by introducing a birefringent
plate inside the cavity resulting in phase locking. After filtering the pump
noise, which plays a critical role, continuous-variable EPR correlations
between the orthogonally polarized signal and idler beams are demonstrated.
