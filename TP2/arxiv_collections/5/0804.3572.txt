Adler and van Moerbeke \cite{AVM} described a reduction of 2D-Toda hierarchy
called Toeplitz lattice. This hierarchy turns out to be equivalent to the one
originally described by Ablowitz and Ladik \cite{AL} using semidiscrete
zero-curvature equations. In this paper we obtain the original semidiscrete
zero-curvature equations starting directly from the Toeplitz lattice and we
generalize these computations to the matrix case. This generalization lead us
to the semidiscrete zero-curvature equations for the non-abelian (or
multicomponent) version of Ablowitz-Ladik equations \cite{GI}. In this way we
extend the link between biorthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and
Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy to the matrix case.
