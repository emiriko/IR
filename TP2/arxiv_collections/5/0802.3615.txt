In this write-up we summarize the main result of our analysis on the thermal
dilepton production rate from the dropping rho based on the vector
manifestation (VM). In the analysis, we showed that the effect of the strong
violation of the vector dominance (VD) predicted by the VM, substantially
suppresses the dilepton production rate compared with the one predicted by
assuming the VD together with the dropping rho.
