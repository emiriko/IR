We consider tetrad fields as reference frames adapted to observers that move
along arbitrary timelike trajectories in spacetime. By means of a local Lorentz
transformation we can transform these frames into Fermi-Walker transported
frames, which define a standard of non-rotation for accelerated observers. Here
we present a simple prescription for the construction of Fermi-Walker
transported frames out of an arbitrary set of tetrad fields.
