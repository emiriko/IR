The physics of optical pumping of semiconductor electrons in the
ferromagnet/semiconductor hybrids is discussed. Optically oriented
semiconductor electrons detect the magnetic state of the ferromagnetic film. In
turn, the ferromagnetism of the hybrid can be controlled optically with the
help of the semiconductor. Spin-spin interactions near the interface
ferromagnet/semiconductor play crucial role in the optical readout and the
manipulation of ferromagnetism.
