There is much interest in the multiparty quantum communications where quantum
teleportation using high dimensional entangled quantum channel is one of the
promising tools. In this paper, we propose a more general scheme for M-party
controlled teleportation of an arbitrary N-particle quantum state using N-1
identical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs and one (M+2)-particle
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state together as quantum channel. Based on which a
2-party controlled teleportation of an arbitrary 3-particle state is tested
with our scheme as an example.
