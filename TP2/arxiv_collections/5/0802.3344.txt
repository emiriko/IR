It has been demonstrated that magnetocrystalline anisotropies in (Ga,Mn)As
are sensitive to lattice strains as small as 10^-4 and that strain can be
controlled by lattice parameter engineering during growth, through post growth
lithography, and electrically by bonding the (Ga,Mn)As sample to a
piezoelectric transducer. In this work we show that analogous effects are
observed in crystalline components of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR).
Lithographically or electrically induced strain variations can produce
crystalline AMR components which are larger than the crystalline AMR and a
significant fraction of the total AMR of the unprocessed (Ga,Mn)As material. In
these experiments we also observe new higher order terms in the
phenomenological AMR expressions and find that strain variation effects can
play important role in the micromagnetic and magnetotransport characteristics
of (Ga,Mn)As lateral nanoconstrictions.
