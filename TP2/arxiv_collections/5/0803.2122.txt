For many random Constraint Satisfaction Problems, by now, we have
asymptotically tight estimates of the largest constraint density for which they
have solutions. At the same time, all known polynomial-time algorithms for many
of these problems already completely fail to find solutions at much smaller
densities. For example, it is well-known that it is easy to color a random
graph using twice as many colors as its chromatic number. Indeed, some of the
simplest possible coloring algorithms already achieve this goal. Given the
simplicity of those algorithms, one would expect there is a lot of room for
improvement. Yet, to date, no algorithm is known that uses $(2-\epsilon) \chi$
colors, in spite of efforts by numerous researchers over the years.
  In view of the remarkable resilience of this factor of 2 against every
algorithm hurled at it, we believe it is natural to inquire into its origin. We
do so by analyzing the evolution of the set of $k$-colorings of a random graph,
viewed as a subset of $\{1,...,k\}^{n}$, as edges are added. We prove that the
factor of 2 corresponds in a precise mathematical sense to a phase transition
in the geometry of this set. Roughly, the set of $k$-colorings looks like a
giant ball for $k \ge 2 \chi$, but like an error-correcting code for $k \le
(2-\epsilon) \chi$. We prove that a completely analogous phase transition also
occurs both in random $k$-SAT and in random hypergraph 2-coloring. And that for
each problem, its location corresponds precisely with the point were all known
polynomial-time algorithms fail. To prove our results we develop a general
technique that allows us to prove rigorously much of the celebrated 1-step
Replica-Symmetry-Breaking hypothesis of statistical physics for random CSPs.
