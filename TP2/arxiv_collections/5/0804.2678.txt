We derive an energy density functional for non-relativistic spin one-half
fermions in the limit of a divergent two-body scattering length. Using an
epsilon expansion around d=4-epsilon spatial dimensions we compute the
coefficient of the leading correction beyond the local density approximation
(LDA). In the case of N fermionic atoms trapped in a harmonic potential this
correction has the form E=E_(LDA)(1+c_s (3N)^(-2/3)), where E_(LDA) is the
total energy in LDA approximation. At next-to-leading order in the epsilon
expansion we find c_s=1.68, which is significantly larger than the result for
non-interacting fermions, c_s=0.5.
