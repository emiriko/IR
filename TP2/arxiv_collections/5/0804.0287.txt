General Principle of Relativity unequivocally supports the notion of
momentum-less energy for bodies (energy-quanta) moving at the {\em same} or
{\em constant} speed relative to all the reference systems. In this
communication, we point out that whether energy-quantum is a momentum-less body
or not is verifiable using ultra-cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice,
perhaps with some minor modifications to the existing such experimental setups.
