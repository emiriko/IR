We critique the analysis by A. Feuerverger of an archaeological find
[arXiv:0804.0079] that has been alleged by some to be the tomb of Jesus of
Nazareth. We show that his analysis rests on six faulty assumptions that have
been severely criticized by historians, archaeologists, and scholars in related
disciplines. We summarize the results of an alternative computation using
Bayes' theorem that estimates a probability of less than 2% that the Talpiot
tomb belongs to Jesus of Nazareth.
