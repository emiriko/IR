We consider the possibility that the Yukawa couplings depend on the Higgs
field, with the motivation of generating the fermion mass hierarchy through
appropriate powers of the Higgs vacuum expectation value. This leads to drastic
modifications of the Higgs branching ratios, new Higgs contributions to various
flavor-violating processes, and observable rates for the top quark decay t->
hc. The underlying flavor dynamics must necessarily appear at the TeV scale and
is within the reach of the LHC.
