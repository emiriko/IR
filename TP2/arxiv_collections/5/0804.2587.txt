Rigorous electromagnetic field simulations are an essential part for
scatterometry and mask pattern design. Today mainly periodic structures are
considered in simulations. Non-periodic structures are typically modeled by
large, artificially periodified computational domains. For systems with a large
radius of influence this leads to very large computational domains to keep the
error sufficiently small. In this paper we review recent advances in the
rigorous simulation of isolated structures embedded into a surrounding media.
We especially address the situation of a layered surrounding media (mask or
wafer) with additional infinite inhomogeneities such as resist lines. Further
we detail how to extract the far field information needed for the aerial image
computation in the non-periodic setting.
