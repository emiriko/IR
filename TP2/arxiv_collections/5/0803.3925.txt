The thermodynamics of massless ideal gas of overlap quarks has been
investigated both analytically and numerically for both zero and nonzero baryon
chemical potential. Any \mu^2-divergence is shown analytically to be absent for
a class of actions with nonzero chemical potential. All such actions are shown
to violate chiral invariance. While the parameter M can be shown to be
irrelevant in the continuum limit, as expected, it is shown numerically that
the continuum limit can be reached with relatively coarser lattices for certain
ranges of M. Numerical limitations of the existing method of introduction of
chemical potential are demonstrated. Finally we also show that the energy
density for the massive overlap fermions has the correct continuum limit.
