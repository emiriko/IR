We discuss different resummations of large logarithms that arise in
hard-scattering cross sections of quarks and gluons in regions of large and
small x. The large-x logarithms are typically dominant near threshold for the
production of a specified final state. These soft and collinear gluon
corrections produce large enhancements of the cross section for many processes,
notably top quark and Higgs production, and typically the higher-order
corrections reduce the factorization and renormalization scale dependence of
the cross section. The small-x logarithms are dominant in the regime where the
momentum transfer of the hard sub-process is much smaller than the total
collision energy. These logarithms are important to describe multijet final
states in deep inelastic scattering and hadron colliders, and in the study of
parton distribution functions. The resummations at small and large x are linked
by the eikonal approximation and are dominated by soft gluon anomalous
dimensions. We will review their role in both contexts and provide some
explicit calculations at one and two loops.
