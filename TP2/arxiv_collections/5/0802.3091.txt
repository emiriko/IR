In this paper we present an electronic circuit for position or capacitance
estimation of MEMS electrostatic actuators based on a switched capacitor
technique. The circuit uses a capacitive divider configuration composed by a
fixed capacitor and the variable capacitance of the electrostatic actuator for
generating a signal that is a function of the input voltage and capacitive
ratio. The proposed circuit can be used to actuate and to sense position of an
electrostatic MEMS actuator without extra sensing elements. This approach is
compatible with the requirements of most analog feedback systems and the
circuit topology of pulsed digital oscillators (PDO).
