In this article, I review progress towards an understanding of the normal
state (in-plane) transport properties of high-$T_c$ cuprates in the light of
recent developments in both spectroscopic and transport measurement techniques.
Against a backdrop of mounting evidence for anisotropic single-particle
lifetimes in cuprate superconductors, new results have emerged that advocate
similar momentum dependence in the transport decay rate $\Gamma$({\bf k}). In
addition, enhancement of the energy scale (up to the bare bandwidth) over which
spectroscopic information on the quasiparticle response can be obtained has led
to the discovery of new, unforeseen features that surprisingly, may have a
significant bearing on the transport properties at the dc limit. With these two
key developments in mind, I consider here whether all the ingredients necessary
for a complete phenomenological description of the anomalous normal state
transport properties of high-$T_c$ cuprates are now in place.
