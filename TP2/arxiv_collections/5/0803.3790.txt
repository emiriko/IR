A series of layered CeO$_{1-x}$F$_x$FeAs compounds with x=0 to 0.20 are
synthesized by solid state reaction method. Similar to the LaOFeAs, the pure
CeOFeAs shows a strong resistivity anomaly near 145 K, which was ascribed to
the spin-density-wave instability. F-doping suppresses this instability and
leads to the superconducting ground state. Most surprisingly, the
superconducting transition temperature could reach as high as 41 K. The very
high superconducting transition temperature strongly challenges the classic BCS
theory based on the electron-phonon interaction. The very closeness of the
superconducting phase to the spin-density-wave instability suggests that the
magnetic fluctuations play a key role in the superconducting paring mechanism.
The study also reveals that the Ce 4f electrons form local moments and ordered
antiferromagnetically below 4 K, which could coexist with superconductivity.
