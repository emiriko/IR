An improved description of four-pion production in electron-positron
annihilation and in tau lepton decays is presented. The model amplitude is
fitted to recent data from BaBar which cover a wide energy range and which were
obtained exploiting the radiative return. Predicting tau decay distributions
from e+e- data and comparing these predictions with ALEPH and CLEO results, the
validity of isospin symmetry is confirmed within the present experimental
errors. A good description of two- and three-pion sub-distributions is
obtained. Special emphasis is put on the predictions for omega pi (->
pi+pi-pi0) in e+e- annihilation and in tau decay. The model amplitude is
implemented in the Monte Carlo generator PHOKHARA.
