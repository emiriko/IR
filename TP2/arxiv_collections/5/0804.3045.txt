The recent scanning tunnelling results of Alldredge et al on Bi-2212 and of
Hanaguri et al on Na-CCOC are examined from the perspective of the BCS/BEC
boson-fermion resonant crossover model for the mixed-valent HTSC cuprates. The
model specifies the two energy scales controlling the development of HTSC
behaviour and the dichotomy often now alluded to between nodal and antinodal
phenomena in the HTSC cuprates. Indication is extracted from the data as to how
the choice of the particular HTSC system sees these two basic energy scales
(cursive-U, the local pair binding energy and, Delta-sc, the nodal BCS-like gap
parameter) evolve with doping and change in degree of metallization of the
structurally and electronically perturbed mixed-valent environment.
