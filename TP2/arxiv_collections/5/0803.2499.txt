The Andreev reflection probability for a ferromagnet/isolator/superconductor
(FIS) contact at the arbitrary spin-dependent amplitudes of the electron waves
transmitted through and reflected from the potential barrier is found. It is
shown that Andreev reflection probabilities of electron and hole excitations in
the FIS contact are different. The energy levels of Andreev bound states are
found. The ballistic conductance of the point FIS contact is calculated.
