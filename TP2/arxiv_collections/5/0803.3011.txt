With high luminosity and energy at the ILC and clean SM backgrounds, the
top-charm production at the ILC should have powerful potential to probe new
physics. The littlest Higgs model with discrete symmetry named "T-parity"(LHT)
is one of the most promising new physics models. In this paper, we study the FC
processes $e^+e^-(\gamma\gamma)\to t\bar{c}$ at the ILC in the LHT model. Our
study shows that the LHT model can make a significant contribution to these
processes. When the masses of mirror quarks become large, these two processes
are accessible at the ILC. So the top-charm production at the ILC provides a
unique way to study the properties of the FC couplings in the LHT model and
furthermore test the model.
