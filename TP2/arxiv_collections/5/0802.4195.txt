For addressing optimisation tasks on finite dimensional quantum systems, we
give a comprehensive account of the foundations of gradient flows on Riemannian
manifolds including new developments: we extend former results from Lie groups
such as the full unitary group to closed subgroups like partitionings by
factorisation into tensor products, where the finest partitioning consists of
purely local unitary operations. Moreover, the common framework is kept
sufficiently general and allows for setting up gradient flows on
(sub-)manifolds, Lie (sub-)groups, quotient groups, and reductive homogeneous
spaces. Relevant convergence conditions are discussed meant to serve as
justification for recent and new achievements, and as foundation for further
research.
  Exploiting the differential geometry of quantum dynamics under different
scenarios helps to provide highly useful algorithms: (a) On an abstract level,
gradient flows may establish the exact upper bounds of pertinent quality
functions, i.e. upper bounds reachable within the underlying manifold of the
state space dynamics; (b) in a second stage referring to a concrete
experimental setting, gradient flows on the manifold of piecewise constant
control amplitudes $\R^m$ may be set up to provide (approximations to) optimal
control of quantum devices under realistic conditions.
  Illustrative examples and new applications are given relating to distance
measures of pure-state entanglement. We establish the correspondence to best
rank-1 approximations of higher-order tensors.
