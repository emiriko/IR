We study a generalization of the voter model on complex networks, focusing on
the scaling of mean exit time. Previous work has defined the voter model in
terms of an initially chosen node and a randomly chosen neighbor, which makes
it difficult to disentangle the effects of the stochastic process itself
relative to the network structure. We introduce a process with two steps, one
that selects a pair of interacting nodes and one that determines the direction
of interaction as a function of the degrees of the two nodes and a parameter
$\alpha$ which sets the likelihood of the higher degree node giving its state.
Traditional voter model behavior can be recovered within the model. We find
that on a complete bipartite network, the traditional voter model is the
fastest process. On a random network with power law degree distribution, we
observe two regimes. For modest values of $\alpha$, exit time is dominated by
diffusive drift of the system state, but as the high nodes become more
influential, the exit time becomes becomes dominated by frustration effects.
For certain selection processes, a short intermediate regime occurs where exit
occurs after exponential mixing.
