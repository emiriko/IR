We report on the calculation of the cyclotron spin-flip excitation (CSFE) in
a spin-polarized quantum Hall system at unit filling. This mode has a
double-exciton component which contributes to the CSFE correlation energy but
can not be found by means of a mean field approach. The result is compared with
available experimental data.
