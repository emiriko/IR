We investigate the new agegraphic dark energy models with generalized
uncertainty principle (GUP). It turns out that although the GUP affects the
early universe, it does not change the current and future dark energy-dominated
universe significantly. Furthermore, this model could describe the
matter-dominated universe in the past only when the parameter $n$ is chosen to
be $n>n_c$, where the critical value determined to be $n_c=2.799531478$.
