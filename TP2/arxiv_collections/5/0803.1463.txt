We investigate the possibility of using a dissipative process to prepare a
quantum system in a desired state. We derive for any multipartite pure state a
dissipative process for which this state is the unique stationary state and
solve the corresponding master equation analytically. For certain states, like
the Cluster states, we use this process to show that the jump operators can be
chosen quasi-locally, i.e. they act non-trivially only on a few, neighboring
qubits. Furthermore, the relaxation time of this dissipative process is
independent of the number of subsystems. We demonstrate the general formalism
by considering arbitrary MPS-PEPS states. In particular, we show that the
ground state of the AKLT-model can be prepared employing a quasi--local
dissipative process.
