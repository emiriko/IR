We point out that the standard chromomagnetic penguin dipole operator has a
counterpart corresponding to off-shell momenta for external quarks. By
employing the chiral quark model, we show that this new dipole penguin operator
has the same bosonisation as the standard Q_6 operator. Accordingly, this new
operator enlarges by ~ 5 % the referent Q_6 contribution, which gives the
dominant contribution to the CP-violating ratio epsilon'/epsilon and also gives
an important contribution to the Delta I = 1/2 amplitude.
