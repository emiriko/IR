The contribution presents an analysis of a rate-independent non-local damage
model, recently proposed by (Mielke and Roubicek, 2006). An analytical as well
as numerical solution of a simple one-dimensional bifurcation problem is
performed, demonstrating that, for the elementary localization test, the model
is free of pathological features.
