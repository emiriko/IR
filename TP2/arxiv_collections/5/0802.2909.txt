A random Lie group action on a compact manifold generates a discrete time
Markov process. The main object of this paper is the evaluation of associated
Birkhoff sums in a regime of weak, but sufficiently effective coupling of the
randomness. This effectiveness is expressed in terms of random Lie algebra
elements and replaces the transience or Furstenberg's irreducibility hypothesis
in related problems. The Birkhoff sum of any given smooth function then turns
out to be equal to its integral w.r.t. a unique smooth measure on the manifold
up to errors of the order of the coupling constant. Applications to the theory
of products of random matrices and a model of a disordered quantum wire are
presented.
