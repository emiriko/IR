We will analyze two particular features of an exponential gravitational
Lagrangian. On the one hand, while this choice of the Lagrangian density allows
for two free parameters, only one scale, the cosmological constant, arises as
fundamental when the proper Einsteinian limit is to be recovered. On the other
hand, the vacuum energy arising from $f(R)$ theories such that $f(0)\neq 0$
needs a cancellation mechanism, by which the present value of the cosmological
constant can be recast.
