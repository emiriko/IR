We propose a method for controllable generation of non-local entangled pairs
using spinor atoms loaded in an optical superlattice. Our scheme iteratively
increases the distance between entangled atoms by controlling the coupling
between the double wells. When implemented in a finite linear chain of 2N
atoms, it creates a triplet valence bond state with large persistency of
entanglement (of the order of N). We also study the non-equilibrium dynamics of
the one-dimensional ferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian and show that the time
evolution of a state of decoupled triplets on each double well leads to the
formation of a highly entangled state where short-distance antiferromagnetic
correlations coexist with longer-distance ferromagnetic ones. We present
methods for detection and characterization of the various dynamically generated
states. These ideas are a step forward towards the use of atoms trapped by
light as quantum information processors and quantum simulators.
