This paper deals with the vibration analysis of an asymmetric composite beam
composed of glass a piezoelectric material. The Bernoulli's beam theory is
adopted for mechanical deformations, and the electric potential field of the
piezoelectric material is assumed such that the divergence-free requirement of
the electrical displacements is satisfied. The accuracy of the analytic model
is assessed by comparing the resonance frequencies obtained by the analytic
model with those obtained by the finite element method. The model developed can
be used as a tool for designing piezoelectric actuators such as micro-pumps.
