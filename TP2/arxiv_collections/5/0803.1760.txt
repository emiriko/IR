We show that it is possible to generate entanglement between two distant
Bose-Einstein condensates by detection of Hanbury Brown-Twiss type correlations
in photons Bragg-scattered by the condensates. Upon coincident detection of two
photons by two detectors, the projected joint state of two condensates is shown
to be non-Gaussian. We verify the existence of entanglement by showing that the
partially transposed state is negative. Further we use the inequality in terms
of higher order moments to confirm entanglement. Our proposed scheme can be
generalized for multiple condensates and also for spinor condensates with Bragg
scattering of polarized light with the latter capable of producing hyper
entanglement.
