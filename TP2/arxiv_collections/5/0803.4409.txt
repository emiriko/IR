A new approach to thermo-quantum diffusion is proposed and a nonlinear
quantum Smoluchowski equation is derived, which describes classical diffusion
in the field of the Bohm quantum potential. A nonlinear thermo-quantum
expression for the diffusion front is obtained, being a quantum generalization
of the classical Einstein law. The quantum diffusion at zero temperature is
also described and a new dependence of the position dispersion on time is
derived. A stochastic Bohm-Langevin equation is also proposed.
