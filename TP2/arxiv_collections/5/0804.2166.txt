Let $A_t$ be a family of abelian varieties over a number field $k$
parametrized by a rational coordinate $t$, and suppose the generic fiber of
$A_t$ is geometrically simple. For example, we may take $A_t$ to be the
Jacobian of the hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)(x-t)$ for some polynomial $f$.
We give two upper bounds for the number of $t \in k$ of height at most $B$ such
that the fiber $A_t$ is geometrically non-simple. One bound comes from
arithmetic geometry, and shows that there are only finitely many such $t$; but
one has very little control over how this finite number varies as $f$ changes.
Another bound, from analytic number theory, shows that the number of
geometrically non-simple fibers grows quite slowly with $B$; this bound, by
contrast with the arithmetic one, is effective, and is uniform in the
coefficients of $f$. We hope that the paper, besides proving the particular
theorems we address, will serve as a good example of the strengths and
weaknesses of the two complementary approaches.
