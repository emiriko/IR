A shallow potential well in a near-perfect quantum wire will bind a
single-electron and behave like a quantum dot, giving rise to spin-dependent
resonances of propagating electrons due to Coulomb repulsion and Pauli
blocking. It is shown how this may be used to generate full entanglement
between static and flying spin-qubits near resonance in a two-electron system
via singlet or triplet spin-filtering. In a quantum wire with many electrons,
the same pairwise scattering may be used to explain conductance, thermopower
and shot-noise anomalies, provided the temperature/energy scale is sufficiently
high for Kondo-like many-body effects to be negligible.
