We demonstrate a simple scheme to achieve fast, runaway evaporative cooling
of optically trapped atoms by tilting the optical potential with a magnetic
field gradient. Runaway evaporation is possible in this trap geometry due to
the weak dependence of vibration frequencies on trap depth, which preserves
atomic density during the evaporation process. Using this scheme, we show that
Bose-Einstein condensation with ~10^5 cesium atoms can be realized in 2~4 s of
forced evaporation. The evaporation speed and energetics are consistent with
the three-dimensional evaporation picture, despite the fact that atoms can only
leave the trap in the direction of tilt.
