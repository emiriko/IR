We investigate the origin of holographic dark energy models which were
recently proposed to explain the dark energy-dominated universe. For this
purpose, we introduce the spacetime foam uncertainty of $\delta l \ge l_{\rm
p}^{\alpha}l^{\alpha-1}$. It was argued that the case of $\alpha=2/3$ could
describe the dark energy with infinite statistics, while the case of
$\alpha=1/2$ can describe the ordinary matter with Bose-Fermi statistics.
However, two cases may lead to the holographic energy density if the latter
recovers from the geometric mean of UV and IR scales. Hence the dark energy
with infinite statistics based on the entropy bound is not an ingredient for
deriving the holographic dark energy model. Furthermore, it is shown that the
agegraphic dark energy models are the holographic dark energy model with
different IR length scales.
