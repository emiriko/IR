We report a novel field-sensitive tunneling barrier by embedding C60 in SiO2
for nonvolatile memory applications. C60 is a better choice than ultra-small
nanocrystals due to its monodispersion. Moreover, C60 provides accessible
energy levels to prompt resonant tunneling through SiO2 at high fields.
However, this process is quenched at low fields due to HOMO-LUMO gap and large
charging energy of C60. Furthermore, we demonstrate an improvement of more than
an order of magnitude in retention to program/erase time ratio for a metal
nanocrystal memory. This shows promise of engineering tunnel dielectrics by
integrating molecules in the future hybrid molecular-silicon electronics.
