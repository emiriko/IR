A condensation transition was predicted for growing technological networks
evolving by preferential attachment and competing quality of their nodes, as
described by the fitness model.
  When this condensation occurs a node acquires a finite fraction of all the
links of the network. Earlier studies based on steady state degree distribution
and on the mapping to Bose-Einstein condensation, were able to identify the
critical point. Here we characterize the dynamics of condensation and we
present evidence that below the condensation temperature there is a slow down
of the dynamics and that a single node (not necessarily the best node in the
network) emerges as the winner for very long times. The characteristic time t*
at which this phenomenon occurs diverges both at the critical point and at $T
-> 0$ when new links are attached deterministically to the highest quality node
of the network.
