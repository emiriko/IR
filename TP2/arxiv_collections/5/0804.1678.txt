The magneto-elastic interaction in cubic helimagnets with B20 symmetry is
considered. It is shown that this interaction is responsible for negative
contribution to the square of the spin-wave gap $\Delta$ which is alone has to
disrupt assumed helical structure. It is suggested that competition between
positive part of $\Delta^2_I$ which stems from magnon-magnon interaction and
its negative magneto-elastic part leads to the quantum phase transition
observed at high pressure in $Mn Si$ and $Fe Ge$. This transition has to occur
when $\Delta^2=0$. For $Mn Si$ from rough estimations at ambient pressure both
parts $\Delta_I$ and $|\Delta_{ME}|$ are comparable with the experimentally
observed gap. The magneto-elastic interaction is responsible also for $2\m k$
modulation of the lattice where $\m k$ is the helix wave-vector and
contribution to the magnetic anisotropy.
  Experimental observation by $x$-ray and neutron scattering the lattice
modulation allows determine the strength of anisotropic part of the
magneto-elastic interaction responsible for above phenomena and the lattice
helicity.
