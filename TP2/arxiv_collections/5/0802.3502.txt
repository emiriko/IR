An analytical solution of the equations describing impurity diffusion due to
the migration of nonequilibrium impurity interstitial atoms was obtained for
the case of the Robin boundary condition on the surface of a semiconductor. The
solution obtained can be useful for verification of approximate numerical
solutions, for simulation of a number of processes of interstitial diffusion,
and for modeling impurity diffusion in doped layers with the decananometer
thickness because in these layers a disequilibrium between immobile
substitutionally dissolved impurity atoms, migrating self-interstitials, and
migrating interstitial impurity atoms can take place. To illustrate the latter
cases, a model of nitrogen diffusion in gallium arsenide was developed and
simulation of nitrogen redistribution from a doped epi-layer during thermal
annealing of GaAs substrate was done. The calculated impurity concentration
profile agrees well with experimental data. The fitting to the experimental
profiles allowed us to derive the values of the parameters that describe
interstitial impurity diffusion.
