We develop a purely ordinal model for aggregation functionals for lattice
valued functions, comprising as special cases quantiles, the Ky Fan metric and
the Sugeno integral. For modeling findings of psychological experiments like
the reflection effect in decision behaviour under risk or uncertainty, we
introduce reflection lattices. These are complete linear lattices endowed with
an order reversing bijection like the reflection at 0 on the real interval
$[-1,1]$. Mathematically we investigate the lattice of non-void intervals in a
complete linear lattice, then the class of monotone interval-valued functions
and their inner product.
