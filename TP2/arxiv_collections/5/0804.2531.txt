We report the investigation of the dynamic conductance fluctuation of
disordered mesoscopic conductors including 1D, 2D and quantum dot systems. Our
numerical results show that in the quasi-ballistic regime the average emittance
is negative indicating the expected inductive-like behavior. However, in the
diffusive and localized regime, the average emittance is still negative. This
disagrees qualitatively with the result obtained from the random matrix theory.
Our analysis suggests that this counter-intuitive result is due to the
appearance of non-diffusive elements in the system, the necklace states (or the
precursor of necklace states in the diffusive regime) whose existence has been
confirmed experimentally in an optical system.
