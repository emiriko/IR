On a Riemannian compact manifold, we give existence and multiplicity results
for solutions of elliptic PDE by introducing isometry invariances. When the
groups we used have finite orbits, we get multiplicity results for equations
with the classical critical Sobolev exponent, for instance the Yamabe equation.
When there is no finite orbits, the multiplicity is obtained for equations with
overcritical exponents.
