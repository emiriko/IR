We reprove that the approximate degree of the OR function on n bits is
Omega(sqrt(n)). We consider a linear program which is feasible if and only if
there is an approximate polynomial for a given function, and apply the duality
theory. The duality theory says that the primal program has no solution if and
only if its dual has a solution. Therefore one can prove the nonexistence of an
approximate polynomial by exhibiting a dual solution, coined the dual
polynomial. We construct such a polynomial.
