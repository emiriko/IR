Polymer electrolytes typically exhibit diminished ionic conductivity due to
the presence of correlation effects between the cations and anions.
Microscopically, transient ionic aggregates, e.g. {\it ion-pairs}, {\it
ion-triplets} or higher order ionic clusters, engender ionic correlations.
Employing {\it all-atom} simulation of a model polymer electrolyte comprising
of poly(ethylene oxide) and lithium iodide, the ionic correlations are explored
through construction of elementary functions between pairs of the ionic species
that qualitatively explains the spatio-temporal nature of these correlations.
Furthermore, commencing from the exact Einstein-like equation describing the
collective diffusivity of the ions in terms of the average diffusivity of the
ions (i.e. the self terms) and the correlations from distinct pairs of ions,
several phenomenological parameters are introduced to keep track of the
simplification procedure that finally boils down to the recently proposed
phenomenological model by Stolwijk-Obeidi (SO) [N. A. Stolwijk and S. Obeidi,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 125901, 2004]. The approximation parameters, which can be
retrieved from simulations, point to the necessity of additional information in
order to fully describe the correlation effects apart from merely the fraction
of ion-pairs which apparently accounts for the correlations originating from
only the nearest neighbor structural correlations. These parameters are close
to but not exactly unity as assumed in the SO model. Finally, as an application
of the extended SO model one is able to estimate the dynamics of the free and
non-free ions as well as their fractions from the knowledge of the single
particle diffusivities and the collective diffusivity of the ions.
