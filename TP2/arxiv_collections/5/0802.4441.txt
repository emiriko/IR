We experimentally observed a Hong-Ou-Mandle dip with photon pairs generated
in a periodically poled reverse-proton-exchange lithium niobate waveguide with
an integrated mode demultiplexer at a wavelength of 1.5 um. The visibility of
the dip in the experiment was 80% without subtraction of any noise terms at a
peak pump power of 4.4 mW. The new technology developed in the experiment can
find various applications in the research field of linear optics quantum
computation in fiber or quantum optical coherence tomography with near infrared
photon pairs.
