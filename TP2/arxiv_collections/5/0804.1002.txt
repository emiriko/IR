Lattice numerical simulations for planar closed random walks and their
winding sectors are presented. The frontiers of the random walks and of their
winding sectors have a Hausdorff dimension $d_H=4/3$. However, when properly
defined by taking into account the inner 0-winding sectors, the frontiers of
the random walks have a Hausdorff dimension $d_H\approx 1.77$.
