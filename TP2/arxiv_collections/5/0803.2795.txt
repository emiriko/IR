We present a new approach to obtaining the lower order terms for
$n$-correlation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Our approach is
based on the `ratios conjecture' of Conrey, Farmer, and Zirnbauer. Assuming the
ratios conjecture we prove a formula which explicitly gives all of the lower
order terms in any order correlation. Our method works equally well for random
matrix theory and gives a new expression, which is structurally the same as
that for the zeta function, for the $n$-correlation of eigenvalues of matrices
from U(N).
