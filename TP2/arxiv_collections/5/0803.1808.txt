We present a microwave characterization of a DyBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-x}$
single domain, grown by the top-seeded melt-textured technique. We report the
(a,b) plane field-induced surface resistance, $\Delta R_s(H)$, at 48.3 GHz,
measured by means of a cylindrical metal cavity in the end-wall-replacement
configuration. Changes in the cavity quality factor Q against the applied
magnetic field yield $\Delta R_s(H)$ at fixed temperatures. The temperature
range [70 K ; T_c] was explored. The magnetic field $\mu_0 H <$ 0.8 T was
applied along the c axis. The field dependence of $\Delta R_s(H)$ does not
exhibit the steep, step-like increase at low fields typical of weak-links. This
result indicates the single-domain character of the sample under investigation.
$\Delta R_s(H)$ exhibits a nearly square-root dependence on H, as expected for
fluxon motion. From the analysis of the data in terms of motion of Abrikosov
vortices we estimate the temperature dependences of the London penetration
depth $\lambda$ and the vortex viscosity $\eta$, and their zero-temperature
values $\lambda(0)=$165 nm and $\eta(0)=$ 3 10$^{-7}$ Nsm$^{-2}$, which are
found in excellent agreement with reported data in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-x}$
single crystals. Comparison of microwave properties with those of related
samples indicate the need for reporting data as a function of T/T_c in order to
obtain universal laws.
