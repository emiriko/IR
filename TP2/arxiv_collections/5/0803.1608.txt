We calculate spectrum of diffractively produced gluons in onium-heavy nucleus
collisions at high energies. We show that it exhibits a characteristic
dependence on nucleus atomic number A and energy/rapidity. We argue that this
dependence offers a unique possibility for determining the low-x structure of
nuclear matter. Applications to RHIC, LHC and EIC experimental programs are
discussed.
