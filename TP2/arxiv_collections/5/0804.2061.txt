Chiral tunneling through a harmonically driven potential barrier in graphene
monolayer is considered in this work. Since the quasiparticles in this system
are chiral in nature, tunneling is highly anisotropic, we determine the
transmission probabilities for the central and sidebands as the incident angle
of the electron beam is changed . Furthermore, we investigate how the
transmission probabilities change as the width, amplitude and frequency of the
oscillating barrier is changed. An interesting result of our study is that
perfect transmission for normal incidence that has been reported for a static
barrier persists for the oscillating barrier, manifestation of Klein tunneling
in a time harmonic potential.
