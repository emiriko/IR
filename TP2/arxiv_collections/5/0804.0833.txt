If a homogeneous plane light-like shell collides head-on with a homogeneous
plane electromagnetic shock wave having a step-function profile then no
backscattered gravitational waves are produced. We demonstrate, by explicit
calculation, that if the matter is accompanied by a homogeneous plane
electromagnetic shock wave with a step-function profile then backscattered
gravitational waves appear after the collision.
