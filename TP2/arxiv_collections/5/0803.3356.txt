It is shown that accounting for the relativistic structure of the deuteron
allows to explain the ratio of the Drell-Yan pair production cross-section at
the low Bjorken $x$ off the deuteron and the proton. Thus, the sea quark
distributions in the nucleon should be studied with accounting for the effects
of the relativistic structure of the deuteron. The suggested approach reduces
theoretical uncertainty in extracting the ratio $\bar u/\bar d$ from the data
and it is important for the clarification of the nature of the sea quark
asymmetry in the nucleon.
