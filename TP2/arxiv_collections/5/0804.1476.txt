We present an update of the theoretical predictions for the cross section of
top-quark pair production at Tevatron and LHC. In particular we employ
improvements due to soft gluon resummation at next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy. We expand the resummed results and derive analytical
finite-order cross sections through next-to-next-to-leading order which are
exact in all logarithmically enhanced terms near threshold. These results are
the best present estimates for the top-quark pair production cross section. We
investigate the scale dependence as well as the sensitivity on the parton
luminosities.
