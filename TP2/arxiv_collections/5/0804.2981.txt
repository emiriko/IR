Several quantities of interest in quantum information, including entanglement
and purity, are nonlinear functions of the density matrix and cannot, even in
principle, correspond to proper quantum observables. Any method aimed to
determine the value of these quantities should resort to indirect measurements
and thus corresponds to a parameter estimation problem whose solution, i.e the
determination of the most precise estimator, unavoidably involves an
optimization procedure. We review local quantum estimation theory and present
explicit formulas for the symmetric logarithmic derivative and the quantum
Fisher information of relevant families of quantum states. Estimability of a
parameter is defined in terms of the quantum signal-to-noise ratio and the
number of measurements needed to achieve a given relative error. The
connections between the optmization procedure and the geometry of quantum
statistical models are discussed. Our analysis allows to quantify quantum noise
in the measurements of non observable quantities and provides a tools for the
characterization of signals and devices in quantum technology.
