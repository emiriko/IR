Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the first quantum information task to reach
the level of mature technology, already fit for commercialization. It aims at
the creation of a secret key between authorized partners connected by a quantum
channel and a classical authenticated channel. The security of the key can in
principle be guaranteed without putting any restriction on the eavesdropper's
power.
  The first two sections provide a concise up-to-date review of QKD, biased
toward the practical side. The rest of the paper presents the essential
theoretical tools that have been developed to assess the security of the main
experimental platforms (discrete variables, continuous variables and
distributed-phase-reference protocols).
