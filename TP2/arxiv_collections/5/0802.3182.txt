We present the first measurement of two-particle momentum correlations in
jets produced in $p\bar p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV. Results are
obtained for charged particles within a restricted cone with an opening angle
of 0.5 radians around the jet axis and for events with dijet masses between 66
and 563 GeV/c$^{2}$. A comparison of the experimental data to theoretical
predictions obtained for partons within the framework of resummed perturbative
QCD in the next-to-leading log approximation (NLLA) shows that the parton
momentum correlations survive the hadronization stage of jet fragmentation,
giving further support to the hypothesis of local parton-hadron duality. The
extracted value of the NLLA parton shower cutoff scale $Q_\mathit{eff}$ set
equal to $\Lambda_\mathit{QCD}$ is found to be $(1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.7})\times 100$
MeV.
