We have investigated the negative-parity states and electromagnetic
transitions in $^{151,153}$Ho and $^{151,153}$Dy within the framework of the
interacting boson fermion model 2 (IBFM-2). Spin assignments for some states
with uncertain spin are made based on this calculation. Calculated excitation
energies, electromagnetic transitions and branching ratios are compared with
available experimental data and a good agreement is obtained. The model wave
functions have been used to study $\beta$-decays from Ho to Dy isotones, and
the calculated $\log ft$ values are close to the experimental data.
