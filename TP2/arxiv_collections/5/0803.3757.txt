Regression adjustments are often made to experimental data. Since
randomization does not justify the models, bias is likely; nor are the usual
variance calculations to be trusted. Here, we evaluate regression adjustments
using Neyman's nonparametric model. Previous results are generalized, and more
intuitive proofs are given. A bias term is isolated, and conditions are given
for unbiased estimation in finite samples.
