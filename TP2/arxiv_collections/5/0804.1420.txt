First, it is shown that the creation of the spinless ion pairs in the
lattice, which are hold by the binding with neighbor ion pairs together
regarded as covalent. These ion pairs are created by the repulsive potential
interaction of two ions which is bound as linear oscillator. The repulsive
S-wave scattering between ion pairs and electrons is transformed to the
attractive effective interaction between electrons which leads to a creation of
electron pairs by a binding energy depending on the condensate fraction of ion
pairs $\frac{N_0}{N}$. In this respect, the absence of ion pairs in the
condensate destroys a binding energy of electron pairs and in turn so-called
superconductimg phase. As new result presented theory is that the number of the
superconducting bosons is not changed in the superconducting phase.
