We used Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) to
investigate the decay of Ne$_2$ after K-shell photoionization. The breakup into
Ne$^{1+}$ / Ne$^{2+}$ shows interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) occurring after a
preceding atomic Auger decay. The molecular frame angular distributions of the
photoelectron and the ICD electron show distinct, asymmetric features, which
imply localization of the K-vacancy created at one of the two atomic sites of
the Ne$_2$ and an emission of the ICD electron from a localized site. The
experimental results are supported by calculations in frozen core Hartree-Fock
approach.
