This paper pursues the study carried out by the authors in "Stability and
Hopf bifurcation in a hexagonal governor system", focusing on the codimension
one Hopf bifurcations in the hexagonal Watt governor differential system. Here
are studied the codimension two, three and four Hopf bifurcations and the
pertinent Lyapunov stability coefficients and bifurcation diagrams, ilustrating
the number, types and positions of bifurcating small amplitude periodic orbits,
are determined. As a consequence it is found an open region in the parameter
space where two attracting periodic orbits coexist with an attracting
equilibrium point.
