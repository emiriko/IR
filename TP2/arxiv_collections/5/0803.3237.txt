We consider quantum-memory assisted protocols for discriminating quantum
channels. We show that for optimal discrimination of memory channels, memory
assisted protocols are needed. This leads to a new notion of distance for
channels with memory. For optimal discrimination and estimation of sets of
unitary channels memory-assisted protocols are not required.
