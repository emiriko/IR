We show how the charge input signal applied to the gate electrode in double
quantum dot may be converted to a pulse in the Kondo cotunneling current as a
spin response of a nano-device in a strong Coulomb blockade regime. The
stochastic component of the input signal comes as the infrared cutoff of Kondo
transmission.
