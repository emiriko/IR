We find universal scaling relations of the pinning effect on the Hall
resistivity $\rho_{xy}$ and Hall angle $\theta_{H}$. Considering the extended
power law form of $\rho_{xx}$ and the microscopic analysis of $\sigma_{xy}$, we
obtain unified $\rho_{xy}$ equations for superconductors with and without
double sign reversal. These equations reasonably explain the striking
universality in doping dependence found by Nagoaka et al., which contradicts
the prediction of the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation based on s-wave
coupling theory [PRL {\bf{80}},3594 (1998)]. A full comparison of experiment
with prediction from theoretical models is proposed.
