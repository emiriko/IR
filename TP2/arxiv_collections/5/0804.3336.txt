A meadow is a zero totalised field (0^{-1}=0), and a cancellation meadow is a
meadow without proper zero divisors. In this paper we consider differential
meadows, i.e., meadows equipped with differentiation operators. We give an
equational axiomatization of these operators and thus obtain a finite basis for
differential cancellation meadows. Using the Zariski topology we prove the
existence of a differential cancellation meadow.
