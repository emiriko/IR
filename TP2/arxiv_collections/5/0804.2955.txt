We consider sub-Poissonian single-mode laser with external synchronization
and analyze its applicability to the problems of quantum information. Using
Heisenberg-Langevin theory we calculate the quadrature variances of the field
emitted by this laser. It is shown that such systems can demonstrate strong
quadrature squeezing. Taking into account that the emitted field is temporally
multi-mode the application of such sources to multichannel quantum
teleportation and dense coding protocols is discussed.
