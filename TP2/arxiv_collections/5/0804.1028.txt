In the present paper we find a new interpretation of Narayana polynomials
N_n(x) which are the generating polynomials for the Narayana numbers N_{n,k}
counting Dyck paths of length n and with exactly k peaks. Strangely enough
Narayana polynomials also occur as limits as n->oo of the sequences of
eigenpolynomials of the Schur-Szego composition map sending (n-1)-tuples of
polynomials of the form (x+1)^{n-1}(x+a) to their Schur-Szego product, see
below. As a corollary we obtain that every N_n(x) has all roots real and
non-positive. Additionally, we present an explicit formula for the density and
the distribution function of the asymptotic root-counting measure of the
polynomial sequence {N_n(x)}.
