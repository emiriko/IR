The electromagnetic mean squared radii, <r^2>_E and <r^2>_M, of Lambda(1405)
are calculated in the chiral unitary model. We describe the excited baryons as
dynamically generated resonances in the octet meson and octet baryon
scattering. We evaluate values of <r^2>_E and <r^2>_M for the Lambda(1405) on
the resonance pole and obtain their complex values. We also consider
Lambda(1405) obtained by neglecting decay channels. For the latter case, we
obtain negative and larger absolute electric mean squared radius than that of
typical ground state baryons. This implies that Lambda(1405) has structure that
K^- is widely spread around p.
