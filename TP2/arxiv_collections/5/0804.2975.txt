I study the direct hadroproduction of J\psi associated with a charm-quark
pair at leading order in alpha_S and v in NRQCD. This process provides an
interesting signature that could be studied at the Tevatron. I consider both
colour-singlet and colour-octet transitions. I compare our results to the
fragmentation approximation and discuss the associated experimental signatures.
