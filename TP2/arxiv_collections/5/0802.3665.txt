The dynamics of transportation through towns and cities is strongly affected
by the topology of the connections and routes. The current work describes an
approach combining complex networks and self-avoiding random walk dynamics in
order to quantify in objective and accurate manner, along a range of spatial
scales, the accessibility of places in towns and cities. The transition
probabilities are estimated for several lengths of the walks and used to
calculate the outward accessibility of each node. The potential of the
methodology is illustrated with respect to the characterization and
improvements of the accessibility of the town of Sao Carlos.
