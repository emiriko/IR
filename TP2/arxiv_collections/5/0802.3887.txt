We search for pair production of supersymmetric top quarks (~t_1), followed
by R-parity violating decay ~t_1 -> tau b with a branching ratio beta, using
322 pb^-1 of ppbar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV collected by the CDF II
detector at Fermilab. Two candidate events pass our final selection criteria,
consistent with the standard model expectation. We set upper limits on the
cross section sigma(~t_1 ~tbar_1)*beta^2 as a function of the stop mass
m(~t_1). Assuming beta=1, we set a 95% confidence level limit m(~t_1)>153
GeV/c^2. The limits are also applicable to the case of a third generation
scalar leptoquark (LQ_3) decaying LQ_3 -> tau b.
