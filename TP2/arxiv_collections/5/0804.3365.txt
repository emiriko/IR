An effective formalism for quantum constrained systems is presented which
allows manageable derivations of solutions and observables, including a
treatment of physical reality conditions without requiring full knowledge of
the physical inner product. Instead of a state equation from a constraint
operator, an infinite system of constraint functions on the quantum phase space
of expectation values and moments of states is used. The examples of linear
constraints as well as the free non-relativistic particle in parameterized form
illustrate how standard problems of constrained systems can be dealt with in
this framework.
