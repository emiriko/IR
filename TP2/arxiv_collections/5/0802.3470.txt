We consider a phenomenologically viable SO(10) grand unification model which
allows perturbative calculations up to the Planck scale or the string scale. We
use a set of Higgs superfields {10 + 16bar + 16 + 45}. In this framework, the
data fitting of the charged fermion mass matrices is re-examined. This model
can indeed reproduce the low-energy experimental data relating the charged
fermion masses and mixings. As for the neutrino sector, we take the neutrino
oscillation data as input data to construct right-handed Majorana neutrino mass
matrix and get a prediction for the physics related to the right-handed
neutrinos, e.g. the leptogenesis and for the proton decay. We propose two kinds
of phenomenologically viable model, quoted as Model 1 and Model 2. We show that
one of the models (Model 2) is consistent with all experimental constraints.
