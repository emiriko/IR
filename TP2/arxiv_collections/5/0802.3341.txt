We present a set of well-posed constraint-preserving boundary conditions for
a first-order in time, second-order in space, harmonic formulation of the
Einstein equations. The boundary conditions are tested using robust stability,
linear and nonlinear waves, and are found to be both less reflective and
constraint preserving than standard Sommerfeld-type boundary conditions.
