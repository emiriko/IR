We propose a new method to obtain approximate solutions for the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an arbitrary potential that possesses bound
states. This method, relying on the auxiliary field technique, allows in many
cases to find analytical solutions. It offers a convenient way to study the
qualitative features of the energy spectrum of bound states in any potential.
In particular, we illustrate our method by solving the case of central
potentials with power-law form and with logarithmic form. For these types of
potentials, we propose very accurate analytical energy formulae which improve a
lot the corresponding formulae that can be found in literature.
