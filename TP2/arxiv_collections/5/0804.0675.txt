Frequency sum rules are derived in extended quantum systems of non
relativistic fermions from a minimal set of assumptions on dynamics in infinite
volume, for ground and thermal states invariant under space translations or a
lattice subgroup. For the jellium Coulomb model, they imply the one point
result for the plasmon energy spectrum in the zero momentum limit. In general,
the density waves energy spectrum is shown to converge, in the limit of large
wavelenght, to a point measure at zero frequency, for any number of fermion
fields and potentials with integrable second derivatives. For low momentum,
<\omega^2(k)> ~ k^2 for potentials V with r^2 d_i d_j V integrable,
<\omega^2(k)> ~ k^{a-d+2} for potentials decaying at infinity as 1/r^a, d-2 < a
< d, d the space dimensions. For one component models with short range
interactions, the fourth momentum of the frequency is expressed, at lowest
order in k, purely in terms of the three point correlation function of the
density.
