Fractal scatterings in weak solitary wave interactions is analyzed for
generalized nonlinear Schr\"odiger equations (GNLS). Using asymptotic methods,
these weak interactions are reduced to a universal second-order map. This map
gives the same fractal scattering patterns as those in the GNLS equations both
qualitatively and quantitatively. Scaling laws of these fractals are also
derived.
