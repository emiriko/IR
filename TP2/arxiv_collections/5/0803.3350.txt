The semileptonic decays of the lowest-lying double-heavy baryons is treated
in a quark model. For the $\Xi_{bb}$, hyperfine mixing in the spin wave
function leaves the total rate for decay into the lowest lying daughter baryons
essentially unchanged, but changes the relative rates into the $\Xi_{bc}$ and
$\Xi_{bc}^\prime$. The same pattern is obtained in the decays of the
$\Omega_{bb}$. For the $\Xi_{bc}$, this mixing leads to factor of about 17
suppression in the decay rate to the $\Xi_{cc}^*$, and a factor of two
suppression in the total decay rate. For the $\Omega_{bc}$, the decay to the
$\Omega_{cc}^*$ is suppressed by a factor of more than 30 from the unmixed
case, and the total decay rate is decreased to about 40% of the decay rate
obtained when mixing is ignored.
