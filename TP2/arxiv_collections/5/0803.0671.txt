We consider the electronic transport through a Rashba quantum dot coupled to
ferromagnetic leads. We show that the interference of localized electron states
with resonant electron states leads to the appearance of the Fano-Rashba
effect. This effect occurs due to the interference of bound levels of
spin-polarized electrons with the continuum of electronic states with an
opposite spin polarization. We investigate this Fano-Rashba effect as a
function of the applied magnetic field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling.
