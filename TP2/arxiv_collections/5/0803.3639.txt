We introduce parabolic induction and restriction functors for rational
Cherednik algebras, and study their basic properties. Then we discuss
applications of these functors to representation theory of rational Cherednik
algebras. In particular, we prove the Gordon-Stafford theorem about Morita
equivalence of the rational Cherednik algebra for type A and its spherical
subalgebra, without the assumption that c is not a half-integer, which was
required up to now. Also, we classify representations from category O over the
rational Cherednik algebras of type A which do not contain an S_n-invariant
vector, and confirm a conjecture of Okounkov and the first author on the number
of such representations. In the second version we have added a result on the
simplicity of the spherical Cherednik algebra of type A for -1<c<0, and a
strengthened version of the main result of arXiv:math/0312474, as well as an
appendix by the second author containing arXiv:0706.4308, on the reducibility
of the polynomial representation of the trigonometric Cherednik algebra.
