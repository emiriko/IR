We report temperature- and magnetic field-dependent bulk muon spin rotation
measurements in a c-axis oriented superconductor CaC6 in the mixed state. Using
both a simple second moment analysis and the more precise analytical
Ginzburg-Landau model, we obtained a field independent in-plane magnetic
penetration depth {\lambda}ab (0) = 72(3) nm. The temperature dependencies of
the normalized muon spin relaxation rate and of the normalized superfluid
density result to be identical, and both are well represented by the clean
limit BCS model with 2\Delta/kB Tc = 3.6(1), suggesting that CaC6 is a fully
gapped BCS superconductor in the clean limit regime.
