A thorough analysis of Galilean symmetries for the gravitational well problem
on a noncommutative plane is presented. A complete closure of the one-parameter
centrally extended Galilean algebra is realised for the model. This implies
that the field theoretic model constructed to describe noncommutative
gravitational quantum well in \cite{ani} is indeed independent of the
coordinate choice. Hence the energy spectrum predicted by the model can be
associated with the experimental results to establish the upper-bound on
time-space noncommutative parameter. Interestingly, noncommutativity is shown
to increase the gravitational pull on the neutron trapped in the gravitational
well.
