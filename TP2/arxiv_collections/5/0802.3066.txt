A new type of integrated temperature and humidity sensor applying
LTCC-technology has been developed and characterized. In this approach, sensing
elements are implemented using heated metal resistors (Pt-elements), where one
is exposed to the humid environment that causes the sensor element to cool down
with increased humidity, while the other one is sealed from the environment.
Sensor design is based on FEA (Finite Element Analyses) where the critical
design parameters have been analyzed with regard to the performance
characteristic of the device. The set-up of sensor element will be shown and
the functional capability will be demonstrated by experimental results.
