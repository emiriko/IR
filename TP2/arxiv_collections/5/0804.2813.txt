We prove that the effective low-energy, nonlinear Schroedinger equation for a
particle in the presence of a quasiperiodic potential is the potential-free,
nonlinear Schroedinger equation on noncommutative space. Thus quasiperiodicity
of the potential can be traded for space noncommutativity when describing the
envelope wave of the initial quasiperiodic wave.
