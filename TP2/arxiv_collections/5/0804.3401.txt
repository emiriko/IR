This article surveys quantum computational complexity, with a focus on three
fundamental notions: polynomial-time quantum computations, the efficient
verification of quantum proofs, and quantum interactive proof systems.
Properties of quantum complexity classes based on these notions, such as BQP,
QMA, and QIP, are presented. Other topics in quantum complexity, including
quantum advice, space-bounded quantum computation, and bounded-depth quantum
circuits, are also discussed.
