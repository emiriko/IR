We have measured the normal state temperature dependence of the Hall effect
and magnetoresistance in epitaxial MgB2 thin films with variable disorders
characterized by the residual resistance ratio RRR ranging from 4.0 to 33.3. A
strong nonlinearity of the Hall effect and magnetoresistance have been found in
clean samples, and they decrease gradually with the increase of disorders or
temperature. By fitting the data to the theoretical model based on the
Boltzmann equation and ab initio calculations for a four-band system, for the
first time, we derived the scattering rates of these four bands at different
temperatures and magnitude of disorders. Our method provides a unique way to
derive these important parameters in multiband systems.
