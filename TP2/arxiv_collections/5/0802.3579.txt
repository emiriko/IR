We investigate cross-correlations in the tunneling currents through two
parallel quantum dots coupled to independent electrodes and gates and
interacting via an inter-dot Coulomb interaction. The correlations reveal
additional information, beyond what can be learned from the current or
conductance, about the dynamics of transport processes of the system. We find
qualitatively different scenarios for the dependence of the cross-correlations
on the two gate voltages. Reducing the temperature below the inter-dot Coulomb
interaction, regions of a given sign change from spherical shapes to angular
L-shapes or stripes. Similar shapes have been observed in recent experiments.
