We study the leading order finite size correction (Luscher's mu-term)
associated to moving one-particle states, arbitrary scattering states and
finite volume form factors in 1+1 dimensional integrable models. Our method is
based on the idea that the mu-term is intimately connected to the inner
structure of the particles, ie. their composition under the bootstrap program.
We use an appropriate analytic continuation of the Bethe-Yang equations to
quantize bound states in finite volume and obtain the leading mu-term
(associated to symmetric particle fusions) by calculating the deviations from
the predictions of the ordinary Bethe-Yang quantization. Our results are
compared to numerical data of the E8 scattering theory obtained by truncated
fermionic space approach. As a by-product it is shown that the bound state
quantization does not only yield the correct mu-term, but also provides the sum
over a subset of higher order corrections as well.
