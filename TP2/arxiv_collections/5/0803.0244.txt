Let $\theta$ be a Young function and consider the space
$\mathcal{F}_{\theta}(\C)$ of all entire functions with $\theta$-exponential
growth. In this paper, we are interested in the solutions $f\in
\mathcal{F}_{\theta}(\C)$ of the convolution equation $T\star f=0$, called
mean-periodic functions, where $T$ is in the topological dual of
$\mathcal{F}_{\theta}(\C)$. We show that each mean-periodic function can be
represented in an explicit way as a convergent series of exponential
polynomials.
