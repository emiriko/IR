For modern Gas sensors, high sensitivity and low power are expected. This
paper discusses design, simulation and fabrication of new Micromachined Thermal
Converters (MTCs) based on GaAs developed for Gas sensors. Metal oxide gas
sensors generally work in high temperature mode that is required for chemical
reactions to be performed between molecules of the specified gas and the
surface of sensing material. There is a low power consumption required to
obtain the operation temperatures in the range of 200 to 500 oC. High thermal
isolation of these devices solves consumption problem and can be made by
designing of free standing micromechanical hot plates. Mechanical stability and
a fast thermal response are especially significant parameters that can not be
neglected. These characteristics can be achieved with new concept of GaAs
thermal converter.
