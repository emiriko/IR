It was pointed out recently that oscillation of the neutron $n$ into mirror
neutron $n'$, a sterile twin of the neutron with exactly the same mass, could
be a very fast process with the the baryon number violation, even faster than
the neutron decay itself. This process is sensitive to the magnetic fields and
it could be observed by comparing the neutron lose rates in the UCN storage
chambers for different magnetic backgrounds. We calculate the probability of
$n-n'$ oscillation in the case when a mirror magnetic field $\vec{B}'$ is
non-zero and show that in this case it can be suppressed or resonantly enhanced
by applying the ordinary magnetic field $\vec{B}$, depending on its strength
and on its orientation with respect to $\vec{B}'$. The recent experimental
data, under this hypothesis, still allow the $n-n'$ oscillation time order 1 s
or even smaller. Moreover, they indicate that the neutron losses are sensitive
to the orientation of the magnetic field. %at about $3\sigma$ level. If these
hints will be confirmed in the future experiments, this would point to the
presence of the mirror magnetic field on the Earth of the order of 0.1 G, or
some equivalent spin-dependent force of the other origin that makes a
difference between the neutron and mirror neutron states.
