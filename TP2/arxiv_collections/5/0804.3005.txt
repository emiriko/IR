We suggest to interface nanomechanical systems via an optical quantum bus to
atomic ensembles, for which means of high precision state preparation,
manipulation and measurement are available. This allows in particular for a
Quantum Non-Demolition Bell measurement, projecting the coupled system, atomic
ensemble - nanomechanical resonator, into an entangled EPR-state. The
entanglement is observable even for nanoresonators initially well above their
ground states and can be utilized for teleportation of states from an atomic
ensemble to the mechanical system.
