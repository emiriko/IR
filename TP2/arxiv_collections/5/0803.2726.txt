We present a brief discussion about expressions of decay widths of exclusive
nonleptonic and semileptonic B decays at tree level including $l=0$ and $l=1$
mesons in final state. Our analysis is carried out assuming factorization
hypothesis and using parametrizations of hadronic matrix elements given in WSB
and ISGW quark models. Special interest is focused on dynamics of these
processes and several important ratios between decay widths to determine form
factors and decay constants are given.
