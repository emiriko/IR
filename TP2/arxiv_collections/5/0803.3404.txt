This survey paper examines the effective model theory obtained with the BSS
model of real number computation. It treats the following topics: computable
ordinals, satisfaction of computable infinitary formulas, forcing as a
construction technique, effective categoricity, effective topology, and
relations with other models for the effective theory of uncountable structures.
