In relativistic potential model of heavy-light mesons it is essential to
incorporate the chiral radiative corrections before comparing the model
predictions with data. Once the radiative corrections are taken into account
the potential model can explain the unusual mass spectra and absence of the
spin orbit-inversion in P-wave states.
