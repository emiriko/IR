We perform a complete "Michel parameter" analysis of all possible helicity
structures which can appear in the process $B \to X_c \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$. We
take into account the full set of operators parametrizing the effective
Hamiltonian and include the complete one-loop QCD corrections as well as the
non-perturbative contributions. The moments of the leptonic energy as well as
the combined moments of the hadronic energy and hadronic invariant mass are
calculated including the non-standard contributions.
