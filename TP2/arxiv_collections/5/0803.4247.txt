The recently suggested modification of the transverse electric contribution
to the Lifshitz formula (S. K. Lamoreaux, arXiv:0801.1283) is discussed. We
show that this modification is inconsistent with the data of two precise
experiments, and violates the Nernst heat theorem. The preprint's suggestion
concerning the resolution of the "apparent violation of the Third Law of
Thermodynamics" is shown to be incorrect.
