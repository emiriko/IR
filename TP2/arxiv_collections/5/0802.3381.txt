I present calculations of soft and collinear corrections to the cross
sections for single top quark production, and for Higgs production via b bbar
-> H at the Tevatron and the LHC. I show that the corrections provide
significant enhancements to the cross sections in both cases. For single top
production the soft gluon corrections dominate the cross section, particularly
in the s channel and in tW production. For Higgs production it is shown that
purely collinear terms have to be included as well to provide an accurate
calculation.
