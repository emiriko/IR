The pseudo-one dimensional brannerite type compound CoV2O6 has been studied
by magnetisation and heat capacity measurements in the temperature range 1.8 <
T < 300 K and in applied fields of up to 9 T. Our measurements show an unusual
balance of exchange interactions (CW= 2.8(2) K) and a single antiferromagnetic
transition at TN = 7 K. M(H) isotherms recorded below 5 K show a metamagnetic
transition and a 1/3 magnetisation plateau. From 5-7 K, only the metamagnetic
transition is observed. For T < TN < ~ 25 K, our heat capacity and
magnetisation measurements show evidence for strong low dimensional
ferromagnetic fluctuations. We propose a simple phase diagram, discuss the
principle features and emphasise the importance of Ising anisotropy.
