We obtained the spectrum of probability of the bremsstrahlung emission
accompanying the $\alpha$-decay of $^{226}{\rm Ra}$ (E$_{\alpha}$=4.8 MeV) by
measuring the $\alpha$-$\gamma$ coincidences and using the model presented in
our previous study on the $\alpha-$decay of $^{214}{\rm Po}$ (E$_{\alpha}$=7.7
MeV). We compare the experimental data with the quantum mechanical calculation
and find a good agreement between theory and experiment. We discuss the
differences between the photon spectra connected with the $\alpha$-decay of the
$^{226}{\rm Ra}$ and $^{214}{\rm Po}$ nuclei. For the two mentioned nuclei we
analyze the bremsstrahlung emission contributions from the tunneling and
external regions of the nucleus barrier into the total spectrum, and we find
the destructive interference between these contributions. We also find that the
emission of photons during tunneling of the $\alpha$-particle gives an
important contribution to the bremsstrahlung spectrum in the whole E$_{\gamma}$
energy range of the studied $^{226}$Ra nucleus.
