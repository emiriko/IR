In this paper we report the fabrication and superconducting properties of
GdO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$FeAs. It is found that when x is equal to 0.17,
GdO$_{0.83}$F$_{0.17}$FeAs is a superconductor with the onset transition
temperature T$_{c}^{on}\approx$ 36.6K. Resistivity anomaly near 130K was
observed for all samples up to x = 0.17, such a phenomenon is similar to that
of LaO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$FeAs. Hall coefficient indicates that
GdO$_{0.83}$F$_{0.17}$FeAs is conducted by electron-like charge carriers.
