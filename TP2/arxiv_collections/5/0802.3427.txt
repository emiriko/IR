General Relativity and Standard Model are considered as a theory of dynamical
scale symmetry with definite initial data compatible with the accepted Higgs
mechanism. In this theory the Early Universe behaves like a factory of
electroweak bosons and Higgs scalars, and it gives a possibility to identify
three peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum with the
contributions of photonic decays and annihilation processes of primordial
Higgs, W, and Z bosons in agreement with the QED coupling constant, Weinberg's
angle, and Higgs' particle mass of about 118 GeV.
