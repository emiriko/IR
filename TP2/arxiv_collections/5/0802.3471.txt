The continuous Moufang loops are characterized as the algebraic systems where
the associativity law is perturbed minimally. The minimal perturbation of
associativity is characterized by the first- order partial differential
equations, which in a natural way generalize the Lie and Maurer-Cartan
equations from the theory of Lie groups.
