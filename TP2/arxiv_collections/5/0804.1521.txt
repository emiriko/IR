We present a tri-bimaximal lepton mixing scheme where the neutrinoless double
beta decay rate (bb0v) has a lower bound which correlates with the ratio alpha
= Dmsol/Dmatm well determined by current data, as well as with the unknown
Majorana CP phase phi12 characterizing the solar neutrino sub-system. For the
special value phi12 = pi/2 (opposite CP-sign neutrinos) the bb0v rate vanishes
at tree level when Dmsol/Dmatm = 3/80, only allowed at 3 sigma. For all other
cases the rate is nonzero, and lies within current and projected experimental
sensitivities close to phi12=0. We suggest two model realizations of this
scheme in terms of an A4xZ2 and A4xZ4 flavour symmetries.
