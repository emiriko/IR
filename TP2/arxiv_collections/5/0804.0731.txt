The classical dynamics of a charged particle traveling in a laser field
modeled by an elliptically polarized monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave
is discussed within the time reparametrization invariant form of the
non-relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The exact parametric representation
for a particle's orbit in an arbitrary plane wave background beyond the dipole
approximation and including effect of the magnetic field is derived. For an
elliptically polarized monochromatic plane wave the particle's trajectory, as
an explicit function of the laboratory frame's time, is given in terms of the
Jacobian elliptic functions, whose modulus is proportional to the laser's
intensity and depends on the polarization of radiation. It is shown that the
system exposes the ``intensity duality'', correspondence between the motion in
the backgrounds with various intensities. In virtue of the modular properties
of the Jacobian functions, by starting with the representative ``fundamental
solution'' and applying a certain modular transformations one can obtain the
particle's orbit in the monochromatic plane wave background with arbitrarily
prescribed characteristics.
