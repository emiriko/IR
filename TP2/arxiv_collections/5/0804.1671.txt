We review recent developments in the modelling of the phase diagram and the
kinetics of crystallization of carbon. In particular, we show that a particular
class of bond-order potentials (the so-called LCBOP models) account well for
many of the known structural and thermodynamic properties of carbon at high
pressures and temperatures. We discuss the LCBOP models in some detail. In
addition, we briefly review the ``history'' of experimental and theoretical
studies of the phase behaviour of carbon. Using a well-tested version of the
LCBOP model (viz. LCBOPI+) we address some of the more controversial hypotheses
concerning the phase behaviour of carbon, in particular: the suggestion that
liquid carbon can exist in two phases separated by a first-order phase
transition and the conjecture that diamonds could have formed by homogeneous
nucleation in Uranus and Neptune.
