We discuss the relation between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields
as governed by the Einstein-Maxwell field equations. It is emphasized that the
tendency of the gravitational field to induce electromagnetic effects increases
as the size of the system goes down. In particular, the gravitational field,
according to general relativity, tends to become dominated by the spin at
distances of the order of the Compton wavelength. The relevant quantity which
governs this behavior is the ratio S/M^2 where S is the (spin) angular
momentum. For an electron, S/M^2 ~ 10^44. Therefore, gravitomagnetic effects
will play a significant role in the subatomic domain. To analyze this situation
we use the asymptotic structure in the form of the multipole fields. Some
important consequences for the electromagnetic fields of charged particles with
spin are pointed out. In particular, the gravitational field may induce
corrections to the Coulomb field which can be tested experimentally.
