We derive variationally the HFB equations for a trapped self-interacting Bose
gas at finite temperature. In the Thomas-Fermi limit, we obtain simple
expressions for the condensate, the non condensate and the anomalous densities.
Their behavior in terms of the condensate fraction meets qualitatively the
experimental data. In particular, the non condensate and the anomalous
densities are peaked at the center of the trap and not at the edges as
predicted by the self-consistent HFB calculations.
