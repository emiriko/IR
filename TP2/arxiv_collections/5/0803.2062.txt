For n at least 3, let SAut(F_n) denote the unique subgroup of index two in
the automorphism group of a free group. The standard linear action of SL(n,Z)
on R^n induces non-trivial actions of SAut(F_n) on R^n and on S^{n-1}. We prove
that SAut(F_n) admits no non-trivial actions by homeomorphisms on acyclic
manifolds or spheres of smaller dimension. Indeed, SAut(F_n) cannot act
non-trivially on any generalized Z_2-homology sphere of dimension less than
n-1, nor on any Z_2-acyclic Z_2-homology manifold of dimension less than n. It
follows that SL(n,Z) cannot act non-trivially on such spaces either. When n is
even, we obtain similar results with Z_3 coefficients.
