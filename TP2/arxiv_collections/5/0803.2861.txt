We study a trapped system of fermions with an attractive zero-range two-body
interaction using the Shell-Model Monte Carlo method. The method provides {\em
ab initio} results in the low $N$ limit where mean-field theory is not
applicable. The energy and pairing properties are presented as functions of
interaction strength, particle number, and temperature. In the interesting
region where typical matrix elements of the two-body interaction are comparable
to the level spacing of the trap we find large odd-even effects and signatures
of shell structure. As a function of temperature, we observe the disappearance
of these effects as in a phase transition.
