We consider the deposition of a film of viscous liquid on a flat plate being
withdrawn from a bath, experimentally and theoretically. For any plate speed
$U$, there is a range of ``thick'' film solutions whose thickness scales like
$U^{1/2}$ for small $U$. These solutions are realized for a partially wetting
liquid, while for a perfectly wetting liquid the classical
Landau-Levich-Derjaguin (LLD) film is observed, whose thickness scales like
$U^{2/3}$. The thick film is distinguished from the LLD film by a dip in its
spatial profile at the transition to the bath. We calculate the phase diagram
for the existence of stationary film solutions as well as the film profiles,
and find excellent agreement with experiment.
