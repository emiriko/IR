In view of its relation to Big-Bang Nucleo-Synthesis and a reported
discrepancy between nuclear models and data taken at S-DALINAC, electro-induced
deuteron break-up 2H(e,e' p)n is studied at momentum transfer q<100MeV and
close to threshold in the low-energy nuclear Effective Field Theory without
dynamical pions. The result at N2LO for electric dipole currents and at NLO for
magnetic ones converges order-by-order better than quantitatively predicted and
contains no free parameter. It is at this order determined by simple,
well-known observables. Decomposing the doubly differential cross-section into
the longitudinal-plus-transverse (L+T), transverse-transverse (TT) and
longitudinal-transverse interference (LT) terms, we find excellent agreement
with a potential-model calculation by Arenh"ovel et al using the Bonn
potential. Theory and data also agree well on \sigma_{L+T}. There is however no
space on the theory-side for the discrepancy of up to 30%, 3-\sigma between
theory and experiment in \sigma_{LT}. From universality, we conclude that no
theoretical approach with the correct deuteron asymptotic wave-function can
explain the data. Un-determined short-distance contributions that could affect
\sigma_{LT} enter only at high orders, i.e. at the few-percent level. We notice
some issues with the kinematics and normalisation of the data reported.
