We show that the gluon fusion amplitude in the gauge-Higgs unification
scenario is finite in any dimension regardless of its nonrenormalizability.
This result is supported by the fact that the local operator describing the
gluon fusion process is forbidden by the higher dimensional gauge invariance.
We explicitly calculate the gluon fusion amplitude in an arbitrary dimensional
gauge-Higgs unification model and indeed obtain the finite result.
