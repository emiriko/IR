An experimental scheme is proposed that allows direct measurement of the
concurrence of a two-qubit cavity system. It is based on the cavity-QED
technology using atoms as flying qubits and relies on the identity of the
two-particle visibility of the atomic probability with the concurrence of the
cavity system. The scheme works for any arbitrary pure initial state of the
two-qubit cavity system.
