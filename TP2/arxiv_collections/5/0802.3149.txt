Let A,B denote binary forms of order d, and let C_{2r-1} = (A,B)_{2r-1} be
the sequence of their linear combinants for r between 1 and (d+1)/2. It is
known that C_1 and C_3 together determine the pencil generated by A and B, and
hence indirectly the higher C_{2r-1}. In this paper we exhibit explicit
formulae for all r>2, which allow us to recover C_{2r-1} from the knowledge of
C_1 and C_3. The calculations make use of the symbolic method of classical
invariant theory, as well as the quantum theory of angular momentum. Our
theorem pertains to the second exterior power representation of S_d, for the
group SL_2. We give an example for the group SL_3 to show that such a result
may hold for other categories of representations.
