Using Chetaev's theorem on stable trajectories in dynamics in the presence of
perturbation forces we obtain a generalized stability condition for Hamiltonian
systems that has the form of the Schrodinger equation. We show that the energy
of the perturbation forces generating generalized Chetaev's stability condition
is of electromagnetic nature and exactly coincides with Bohm's "quantum"
potential. We stress that not taking into account the reality of Bohm's
electromagnetic Psi-field turns out to be the fundamental reason of violation
of the famous Bell inequality, in the recent most precise direct experiments,
as well as in theoretical calculations based on the simple Wigner model. We
discuss the possibility of direct experiments, alternative to Bell's ideology
and related, e.g. with observation of nuclear stochastic resonance during the
alpha-decay process, which cannot occur in the framework of the probabilistic
interpretation of quantum mechanics, but has to occur in the alternative Bohm
interpretation.
