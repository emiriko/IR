A variable coefficient Korteweg de Vries (VCKdV) system is derived by
considering the time-dependent basic flow and boundary conditions from a
nonlinear, inviscid, nondissipative, and equivalent barotropic vorticity
equation in a beta-plane. One analytical solution obtained from the VCKdV
equation can be successfully used to explain the evolution of atmospheric
dipole-type blocking (DB) life cycles. Analytical diagnoses show that
background mean westerlies have great influence on evolution of DB during its
life cycle. A weak westerly is necessary for blocking development and the
blocking life period shortens, accompanied with the enhanced westerlies. The
shear of the background westerlies also plays an important role in the
evolution of blocking. The cyclonic shear is preferable for the development of
blocking but when the cyclonic shear increases, the intensity of blocking
decreases and the life period of DB becomes shorter. Weak anticyclonic shear
below a critical threshold is also favorable for DB formation. Time-dependent
background westerly (TDW) in the life cycle of DB has some modulations on the
blocking life period and intensity due to the behavior of the mean westerlies.
Statistical analysis regarding the climatological features of observed DB is
also investigated. The Pacific is a preferred region for DB, especially at high
latitudes. These features may associate with the weakest westerlies and the
particular westerly shear structure over the northwestern Pacific.
