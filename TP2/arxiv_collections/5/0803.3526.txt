We predict the possibility to generate a finite stationary spin current by
applying an unbiased ac driving to a quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric periodic
structure with Rashba spin-orbit interaction and strong dissipation. We show
that under a finite coupling strength between the orbital degrees of freedom
the electron dynamics at low temperatures exhibits a pure spin ratchet
behavior, {\it i.e.} a finite spin current and the absence of charge transport
in spatially asymmetric structures. It is also found that the equilibrium spin
currents are not destroyed by the presence of strong dissipation.
