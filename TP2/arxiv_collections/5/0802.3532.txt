Hydrodynamic forcing plays an important role in shaping the dynamics of
marine organisms, in particular of plankton. In this work we study the
planktonic biological activity in the wake of an island which is close to an
upwelling region. Our research is based on numerical analysis of a kinematic
flow mimicking the hydrodynamics in the wake, coupled to a three-component
plankton model. Depending on model parameters different phenomena are
described: a) The lack of transport of nutrients and plankton across the wake,
so that the influence of upwelling on primary production on the other side of
the wake is blocked. b) For sufficiently high vorticity, the role of the wake
in facilitating this transport and leading to an enhancement of primary
production. Finally c) we show that under certain conditions the interplay
between wake structures and biological growth leads to plankton blooms inside
mesoscale hydrodynamic vortices that act as incubators of primary production.
