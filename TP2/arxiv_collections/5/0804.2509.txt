I revisit the infinite-size variant of the Density Matrix Renormalization
Group (iDMRG) algorithm for obtaining a fixed-point translationally invariant
matrix product wavefunction in the context of one-dimensional quantum systems.
A crucial ingredient of this algorithm is an efficient transformation for
obtaining the matrix elements of the wavefunction as the lattice size is
increased, and I introduce here a versatile transformation that is demonstrated
to be much more effective than previous versions. The resulting algorithm has a
surprisingly close relationship to Vidal's Time Evolving Block Decimation for
infinite systems, but allows much faster convergence. Access to a
translationally invariant matrix product state allows the calculation of
correlation functions based on the transfer matrix, which directly gives the
spectrum of all correlation lengths. I also show some advantages of the Matrix
Product Operator (MPO) technique for constructing expectation values of higher
moments, such as the exact variance $<(H-E)^2>$.
