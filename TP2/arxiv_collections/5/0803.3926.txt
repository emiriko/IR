In the recent paper [arXiv:0802.2216, 15 Feb 2008], Kashuba argued that the
intrinsic conductivity of graphene independent of temperature originated in
strong electron-hole scattering. We propose a much more explicit derivation
based on a scaling theory approach. We also give an explanation of a rapid
increase in graphene conductivity caused by applied gate voltage.
