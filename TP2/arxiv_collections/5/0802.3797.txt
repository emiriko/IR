By gauging an Abelian electromagnetic (em) solution through a non-Abelian
transformation and in accordance with a theorem proved long time ago, we
construct a simple class of colliding Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) plane waves.
The solution is isometric to the Wu-Yang charged Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole
and shares much of the properties satisfied by colliding Einstein-Maxwell (EM)
plane waves. In the linear polarization limit with unit degenerate charge it
reduces to the Bell-Szekeres (BS) solution for colliding em shock waves.
