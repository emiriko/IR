We present a microscopical explanation of the entropy of the BTZ black hole
using discrete spin foam models of quantum gravity. The entropy of a black hole
is given in geometrical terms which lead us to think that its statistical
description must be given in terms of a quantum geometry. In this paper we
present it in terms of spin foam geometrical observables at the horizon of the
black hole.
