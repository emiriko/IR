Top-gated, few-layer graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) fabricated on
thermally-decomposed semi-insulating 4H-SiC substrates are demonstrated.
Physical vapor deposited SiO2 is used as the gate dielectric. A two-dimensional
hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms with the correct lattice vectors,
observed by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, confirms the
formation of multiple graphene layers on top of the SiC substrates. The
observation of n-type and p-type transition further verifies Dirac Fermions
unique transport properties in graphene layers. The measured electron and hole
mobility on these fabricated graphene FETs are as high as 5400 cm2/Vs and 4400
cm2/Vs respectively, which are much larger than the corresponding values from
conventional SiC or silicon.
