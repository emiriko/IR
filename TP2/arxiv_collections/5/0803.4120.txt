We analyse within the "flavoured" leptogenesis scenario of baryon asymmetry
generation, the interplay of the "low energy" CP-violation, originating from
the PMNS neutrino mixing matrix $U$, and the "high energy" CP-violation which
can be present in the matrix of neutrino Yukawa couplings, $\lambda$, and can
manifest itself only in "high" energy scale processes. The type I see-saw model
with three heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos having hierarchical spectrum
is considered. The "orthogonal" parametrisation of the matrix of neutrino
Yukawa couplings, which involves a complex orthogonal matrix $R$, is employed.
In this approach the matrix $R$ is the source of "high energy" CP-violation.
Results for normal hierarchical (NH) and inverted hierarchical (IH) light
neutrino mass spectrum are derived in the case of decoupling of the heaviest RH
Majorana neutrino. It is shown that taking into account the contribution to
$Y_B$ due to the CP-violating phases in the neutrino mixing matrix $U$ can
change drastically the predictions for $Y_B$, obtained assuming only "high
energy" CP-violation from the $R$-matrix is operative in leptogenesis. In the
case of IH spectrum, in particular, there exist significant regions in the
corresponding parameter space where the purely "high energy" contribution in
$Y_B$ plays a subdominant role in the production of baryon asymmetry compatible
with the observations.
