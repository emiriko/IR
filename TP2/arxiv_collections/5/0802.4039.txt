We present a theoretical model for the propagation of non self-interacting
atom laser beams. We start from a general propagation integral equation, and we
use the same approximations as in photon optics to derive tools to calculate
the atom laser beam propagation. We discuss the approximations that allow to
reduce the general equation whether to a Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral calculated
by using the stationary phase method, or to the eikonal. Within the paraxial
approximation, we also introduce the ABCD matrices formalism and the beam
quality factor. As an example, we apply these tools to analyse the recent
experiment by Riou et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 070404 (2006)].
