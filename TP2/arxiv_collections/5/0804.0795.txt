In high-transition temperature (high-Tc) copper oxides, it is generally
believed that antiferromagnetism plays a fundamental role in the
superconducting mechanism because superconductivity occurs when mobile
electrons or holes are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. The
recent discovery of superconductivity in the rare-earth (R) iron-based oxide
systems [RO1-xFxFeAs] has generated enormous interest because these materials
are the first noncopper oxide superconductors with Tc exceeding 50 K. The
parent (nonsuperconducting) LaOFeAs material is metallic but shows anomalies
near 150 K in both resistivity and dc magnetic susceptibility. While optical
conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a
spin-density-wave (SDW) instability that is suppressed with doping electrons to
form superconductivity, there has been no direct evidence of the SDW order.
Here we use neutron scattering to demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt
structural distortion below ~150 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal
(space group P4/nmm) to monoclinic (space group P112/n) at low temperatures,
and then followed with the development of long range SDW-type antiferromagnetic
order at ~134 K with a small moment but simple magnetic structure. Doping the
system with flourine suppresses both the magnetic order and structural
distortion in favor of superconductivity. Therefore, much like high-Tc copper
oxides, the superconducting regime in these Fe-based materials occurs in close
proximity to a long-range ordered antiferromagnetic ground state. Since the
discovery of long
