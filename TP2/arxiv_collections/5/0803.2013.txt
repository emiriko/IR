Spin-momentum transfer between a spin-polarized current and a ferromagnetic
layer can induce steady-state magnetization precession, and has recently been
proposed as a working principle for ubiquitous radio-frequency devices for
radar and telecommunication applications. However, to-date, the development of
industrially attractive prototypes has been hampered by the inability to
identify systems which can provide enough power. Here, we demonstrate that
microwave signals with device-compatible output power levels can be generated
from a single magnetic tunnel junction with a lateral size of 100 nm, seven
orders of magnitude smaller than conventional radio-frequency oscillators. We
find that in MgO magnetic tunnel junctions the perpendicular torque induced by
the spin-polarized current on the local magnetization can reach 25% of the
in-plane spin-torque term, while exhibiting a different bias-dependence. Both
findings contrast with the results obtained on all-metallic structures -
previously investigated -, reflecting the fundamentally different transport
mechanisms in the two types of structures.
