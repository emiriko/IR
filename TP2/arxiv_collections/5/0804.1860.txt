A method of a consistent consideration of the phonon contributions to mass
and gap operators in non-magic nuclei is developed in the so-called g^2
approximation, where g is the low-lying phonon creation amplitude. It includes
simultaneous accounting for both the usual non-local terms and the phonon
tadpole ones. The relations which allow the tadpoles to be calculated without
any new parameters are derived. As an application of the results, the role of
the phonon tadpoles in the single-particle strength distribution and in the
single-particle energies and gap values has been considered. Relation to the
problem of the surface nature of pairing is discussed.
