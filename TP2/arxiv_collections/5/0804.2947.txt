It is argued that Weyl's theory of gravitation and electricity came out of
`mathematical justice': out of the equal rights direction and length. Such
mathematical justice was manifestly at work in the context of discovery, and is
enough (together with a couple of simple and natural operations) to derive all
of source-free electromagnetism. Weyl's repeated references to coordinates and
gauge are taken to express equal treatment of direction and length.
