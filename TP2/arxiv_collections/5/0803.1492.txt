Reversibility of the Fleming-Viot process with mutation, selection, and
recombination is well understood. In this paper, we study the reversibility of
a system of Fleming-Viot processes that live on a countable number of colonies
interacting with each other through migrations between the colonies. It is
shown that reversibility fails when both migration and mutation are
non-trivial.
