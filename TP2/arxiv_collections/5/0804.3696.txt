We deal with the restriction phenomenon for the Fourier transform. We prove
that each of the restriction conjectures for the sphere, the paraboloid, the
elliptic hyperboloid in $\mathbb{R}^n$ implies that for the cone in
$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We also prove a new restriction estimate for any surface in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ locally isometric to the plane and of finite type.
