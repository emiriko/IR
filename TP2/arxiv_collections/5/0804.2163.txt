A general approach to find out exact cosmological solutions in f(R)-gravity
is discussed. Instead of taking into account phenomenological models, we
assume, as a physical criterium, the existence of Noether symmetries in the
cosmological f(R) Lagrangian. As a result, the presence of such symmetries
selects viable models and allow to solve the equations of motion. We discuss
also the case in which no Noether charge is present but general criteria can be
used to achieve solutions.
