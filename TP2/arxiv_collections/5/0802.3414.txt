We study a simple reconfigurable robot model which has not been previously
examined: cubic robots comprised of three-dimensional cubic modules which can
slide across each other and rotate about each others' edges. We demonstrate
that the cubic robot model is universal, i.e., that an n-module cubic robot can
reconfigure itself into any specified n-module configuration. Additionally, we
provide an algorithm that efficiently plans and executes cubic robot motion.
Our results directly extend to a d-dimensional model.
