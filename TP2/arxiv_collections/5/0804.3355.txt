When either electron or hole doped at concentrations $x\sim 0.1$, the LaOFeAs
family displays remarkably high temperature superconductivity with T$_c$ up to
55 K. In the most energetically stable $\vec Q_M = (\pi,\pi)$ antiferromagnetic
(AFM) phase comprised of tetragonal-symmetry breaking alternating chains of
aligned spins, there is a deep pseudogap in the Fe 3d states centered at the
Fermi energy, and very strong magnetophonon coupling is uncovered. Doping (of
either sign) beyond $x \sim 0.1$ results in Fe 3d heavy mass carriers ($m^*\sim
4-8$) with a large Fermi surface. Calculated Fe-Fe transverse exchange
couplings $J_{ij}(R)$ reveal that exchange coupling is strongly dependent on
the AFM symmetry and Fe-As distance.
