The stated aim of this conference is to debate the continuing evolution of IS
in businesses and other organisations. This paper seeks to contribute to this
debate by exploring the concept of appropriation from a number of different
epistemological, cultural and linguistic viewpoints to allow us to explore 'the
black box' of appropriation and to gain a fuller understanding of the term. At
the conceptual level, it will examine some of the different ways in which
people have attempted to explain the relationship between the objective and
concrete features of technology and the subjective and shifting nature of the
people and organisation within which that technology is deployed. At the
cultural and linguistic level the paper will examine the notion as it is found
in the Francophone literature, where the term has a long and rich history, and
the Anglophone literature where appropriation is seen as a rather more
specialist term. The paper will conclude with some observations on the ongoing
nature of the debate, the value of reading beyond the literature with which one
is familiar and the rewards that come from exploring different historical (and
linguistic) viewpoints.
