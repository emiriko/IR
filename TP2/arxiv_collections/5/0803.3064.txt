We have constructed star models consisting of four parts: (i) a homogeneous
inner core with anisotropic pressure (ii) an infinitesimal thin shell
separating the core and the envelope; (iii) an envelope of inhomogeneous
density and isotropic pressure; (iv) an infinitesimal thin shell matching the
envelope boundary and the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. We have analyzed
all the energy conditions for the core, envelope and the two thin shells. We
have found that, in order to have static solutions, at least one of the regions
must be constituted by dark energy. The results show that there is no physical
reason to have a superior limit for the mass of these objects but for the ratio
of mass and radius.
