The X(3872) resonance is considered as a hadronic molecule, a loosely-bound
state of charmed D0 and D*0 mesons, since its mass is very close to the D*0
barD0 threshold. Assuming structure and quantum numbers of X(3872) as (D0
barD*0 - D*0 barD0)/sqrt(2) and J(PC) = 1(++), we calculate the X(3872) to
gamma J/psi decay using a phenomenological Lagrangian approach. We also
estimate the contribution of an additional c bar(c) component in the X(3872) to
this decay width, which is shown to be suppressed relative to the one of the
molecular configuration.
