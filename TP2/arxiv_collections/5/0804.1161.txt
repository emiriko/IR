Monte-Carlo simulations are used in the gravitational wave burst detection
community to demonstrate and compare the properties of different search
techniques. We note that every Monte-Carlo simulation has a corresponding
optimal search technique according to both the non-Bayesian Neyman-Pearson
criterion and the Bayesian approach, and that this optimal search technique is
the Bayesian statistic. When practical, we recommend deriving the optimal
statistic for a credible Monte-Carlo simulation, rather than testing ad hoc
statistics against that simulation.
