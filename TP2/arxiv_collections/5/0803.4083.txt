We show how to derive a simple integrator for the Langevin equation and
illustrate how it is possible to check the accuracy of the obtained
distribution on the fly, using the concept of effective energy introduced in a
recent paper [J. Chem. Phys. 126, 014101 (2007)]. Our integrator leads to
correct sampling also in the difficult high-friction limit. We also show how
these ideas can be applied in practical simulations, using a Lennard-Jones
crystal as a paradigmatic case.
