Algebraic specifications of data types provide a natural basis for testing
data types implementations. In this framework, the conformance relation is
based on the satisfaction of axioms. This makes it possible to formally state
the fundamental concepts of testing: exhaustive test set, testability
hypotheses, oracle. Various criteria for selecting finite test sets have been
proposed. They depend on the form of the axioms, and on the possibilities of
observation of the implementation under test. This last point is related to the
well-known oracle problem. As the main interest of algebraic specifications is
data type abstraction, testing a concrete implementation raises the issue of
the gap between the abstract description and the concrete representation. The
observational semantics of algebraic specifications bring solutions on the
basis of the so-called observable contexts. After a description of testing
methods based on algebraic specifications, the chapter gives a brief
presentation of some tools and case studies, and presents some applications to
other formal methods involving datatypes.
