The Fisher-Shannon information and a statistical measure of complexity are
calculated in the position and momentum spaces for the wave functions of the
quantum isotropic harmonic oscillator. We show that these magnitudes are
independent of the strength of the harmonic potential. Moreover, for each level
of energy, it is found that these two indicators take their minimum values on
the orbitals that correspond to the classical (circular) orbits in the
Bohr-like quantum image, just those with the highest orbital angular momentum.
