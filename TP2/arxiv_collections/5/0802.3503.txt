In this paper, we investigate tunable control of the group velocity of a weak
probe field propagating through an f-deformed Bose-Einstein condensate of
three-level atoms beyond the rotating wave approximation. For this purpose, we
use an f- deformed generalization of an effective two-level quantum model of
the three-level configuration without the rotating wave approximation in which
the Gardiners phonon operators for Bose-Einstein condensate are deformed by an
operator- valued function,f(n), of the particle- number operator n .
Corrections produced by the counter- rotating terms appear in the first order
as an intensity- dependent detuning and in the second order as an intensity-
dependent atom-field coupling. We consider the collisions between the atoms as
a special kind of f- deformation where the collision rate k is regarded as the
deformation parameter. We demonstrate the enhanced effect of subluminal and
superluminal propagation based on electromagnetically induced transparency and
electromagnetically induced absorption, respectively. In particular, we find
that (i) the absorptive and dispersive properties of the deformed condensate
can be controlled effectively in the absence of the rotating wave approximation
by changing the deformation parameter k, the total number of atoms N and the
counter- rotating terms parameter, (ii) by increasing the values of k, 1/N and
the counter- rotating terms parameter, the group velocity of the probe pulse
changes, from subluminal to superluminal and (iii) beyond the rotating wave
approximation, the subluminal and superluminal behaviors of the probe field are
enhanced.
