In the recent work Fletcher et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., v.99, p.145001 (2007)]
reported on the novel experimental technique, enabling to measure the
temperature of the expanding ultracold plasmas over a considerable time
interval (up to 60-70 {\mu}s). It was unexpectedly found that the electron
temperature dropped with time as T_e(t) ~ t^{-\alpha} with \alpha = 1.2 +/- 0.1
\approx 1 instead of \alpha = 2, which would be expected for the adiabatic
cooling of electrons in the cloud expanding linearly in time. The above-cited
authors supposed that 'the difference is likely due to the significant heating
effects from 3-body recombination' (i.e. the inelastic processes), but they did
not provide sufficient quantitative estimates supporting such a conclusion. The
aim of the present comment is to mention that the experimentally revealed
t^{-1}-dependence can be explained under quite general assumptions by the
purely elastic processes in the ultracold plasma, as it was done a few years
ago in our work [Yu.V. Dumin, J. Low Temp. Phys., v.119, p.377 (2000)].
  Therefore, t^{-1}-dependence revealed in the above-cited experiment should be
primarily a manifestation of "virialization" of the electron velocities in the
regime of strong electron-ion correlations, while the heat release by inelastic
processes should be of secondary importance (it might be responsible,
particularly, for changing the exponent from -1 to -1.2). This is confirmed
also by our ab initio molecular-dynamic simulations taking into account the
strong electron-ion correlations (i.e. not based on the PIC method, Vlasov
approximation for electrons, etc., which are applicable only to small-angular
scattering).
