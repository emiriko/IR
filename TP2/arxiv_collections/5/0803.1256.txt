Using the Surface Evolver software, we perform numerical simulations of
point-like deformations in a two-dimensional foam. We study perturbations which
are infinitesimal or finite, isotropic or anisotropic, and we either conserve
or do not conserve the number of bubbles. We measure the displacement fields
around the perturbation. Changes in pressure decrease exponentially with the
distance to perturbation, indicating a screening over a few bubble diameters.
