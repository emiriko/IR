A field theoretical method for the fluctuating hydrodynamics with preserving
fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDR) is reformulated. It is shown that the
long time behavior within the first-loop order perturbation under the
assumption that the correlations include the momentum decay fast enough, is
equivalent to that for the standard mode-coupling theory.
