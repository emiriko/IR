Force-induced reversible transformations between coiled and normal polymorphs
of bacterial flagella have been observed in recent optical-tweezer experiment.
We introduce a discrete elastic rod model with two competing helical states
governed by a fluctuating spin-like variable that represents the underlying
conformational states of flagellin monomers. Using hybrid Brownian dynamics
Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that a helix undergoes shape transitions
dominated by domain wall nucleation and motion in response to externally
applied uniaxial tension. A scaling argument for the critical force is
presented in good agreement with experimental and simulation results.
Stretching rate-dependent elasticity including a buckling instability are
found, also consistent with the experiment.
