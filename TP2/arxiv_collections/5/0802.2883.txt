Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) magnetic and electrical transport
measurements were performed to study a single crystal of Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3, a
colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) material. While the magnetic field induced
transformation of this phase separated compound consisting of an
antiferromagnetic insulating phase (AFI) and a ferromagnetic insulating phase
(FI), is continuous at high temperature (above 5K), at lower temperature a step
like transformation is observed (around 5T at 2K). Macroscopic magnetization
measurements and SANS indicate that this transformation occurs by the formation
of mesoscopic ferromagnetic metallic (FM) domains in the AFI phase, and,
eventually, in the FI phase. Although above 5K this transformation is
continuous, below 5K a magnetization step marks the abrupt transition from a
large scale FI/AFI phase separation to a large scale phase separation between
AFI, FI and FM phases. Our results suggest that relaxation of elastic strains
inherent to the coexistence of these different phases plays a crucial role in
the mechanism of these transformations. The occurrence of magnetization steps
could result from an intrinsic behavior of the AFI phase at low temperature.
