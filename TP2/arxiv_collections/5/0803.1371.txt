We study the stability of five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes with equal
angular momenta which have an enlarged symmetry, U(2). Using this symmetry, we
derive master equations for a part of metric perturbations which are relevant
to the stability. Based on the master equations, we prove the stability of
Myers-Perry black holes under these perturbations. Our result gives a strong
evidence for the stability of Myers-Perry black holes with equal angular
momenta.
