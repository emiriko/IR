We perform a comprehensive and detailed comparison of the physics reach of
Beta-beam neutrino experiments between two pairs of plausible source ions, (8B,
8Li) and (18Ne, 6He). We study the optimal choices for the baseline, boost
factor, and luminosity. We take a 50 kton iron calorimeter, a la ICAL@INO, as
the far detector. We follow two complementary approaches for our study: (i)
Fixing the number of useful ion decays and boost factor of the beam, and
optimizing for the sensitivity reach between the two pairs of ions as a
function of the baseline. (ii) Matching the shape of the spectrum between the
two pairs of ions, and studying the requirements for baseline, boost factor,
and luminosity. We find that for each pair of ions there are two baselines with
very good sensitivity reaches: a short baseline with $L [km]/ \gamma \simeq
2.6$ (8B+8Li) and $L [km]/\gamma \simeq 0.8$ (18Ne+6He), and a long ``magic''
baseline. For $\gamma \sim 500$, one would optimally use 18Ne and 6He at the
short baseline for CP violation, 8B and 8Li at the magic baseline for the mass
hierarchy, and either 18Ne and 6He at the short baseline or 8B and 8Li at the
magic baseline for the $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ discovery.
