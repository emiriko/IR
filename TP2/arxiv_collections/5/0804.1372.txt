We report the first measurement of the optical phonon dispersion in optimally
doped single layer Bi2Sr1.6La0.4Cu2O6+delta using inelastic x-ray scattering.
We found a strong softening of the Cu-O bond stretching phonon at about
q=(0.25,0,0) from 76 to 60 meV, similar to the one reported in other cuprates.
A direct comparison with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements
taken on the same sample, revealed an excellent agreement in terms of energy
and momentum between the ARPES nodal kink and the soft part of the bond
stretching phonon. Indeed, we find that the momentum space where a 63 meV kink
is observed can be connected with a vector q=(xi,0,0) with xi~0.22, which
corresponds exactly to the soft part of the bond stretching phonon mode. This
result supports an interpretation of the ARPES kink in terms of electron-phonon
coupling.
