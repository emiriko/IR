Researchers have found that the metabolisms of organisms appear to scale
proportionally to a 3/4 power of their mass. Mathematics in this article
suggests that the capacity of an isotropically radiating energy supply scales
up by a 4/3 power as its size (and therefore the degrees of freedom of its
circulatory system) increases. Accordingly, cellular metabolism scales
inversely by a 3/4 power, likely to prevent the 4/3 scaling up of the energy
supply overheating the cell. The same 4/3 power scaling may explain
cosmological dark energy.
