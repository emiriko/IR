Finite flux of the (time-reversal-symmetric) pseudo-magnetic field, which
represents the effect of wrinkling of the graphene sheet for example, is shown
to be a catalyst for spontaneous breaking of the time-reversal symmetry of
Dirac fermions in two dimensions. Possible experimental consequences of this
effect for graphene are discussed.
