In regression with random design, we study the problem of selecting a model
that performs well for out-of-sample prediction. We do not assume that any of
the candidate models under consideration are correct. Our analysis is based on
explicit finite-sample results. Our main findings differ from those of other
analyses that are based on traditional large-sample limit approximations
because we consider a situation where the sample size is small relative to the
complexity of the data-generating process, in the sense that the number of
parameters in a `good' model is of the same order as sample size. Also, we
allow for the case where the number of candidate models is (much) larger than
sample size.
