We have developed a time-dependent three-dimensional model of isotropic,
adiabatic, and compressible magnetohydrodynamic plasma to understand nonlinear
cascades of density fluctuations in local interstellar medium. Our simulations,
describing evolution of initial supersonic, super Alfv\'enic plasma modes,
indicate that nonlinear interactions lead to damping of plasma motion. During
the process, turbulent cascades are governed predominantly by the Alfv\'enic
modes and velocity field fluctuations evolve towards a state charachterized by
near incompressibility. Consequently, density field is advected passively by
the velocity field. Our findings thus demonstrate that the observed density
fluctuations in the interstellar medium are the structures passively convected
by the background velocity field.
