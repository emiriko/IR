Chaotic scattering with an internal degree of freedom and the possibility to
generate directed transport of angular momentum is studied in a specific model,
a magnetic dipole moving in a periodically modulated magnetic field confined to
a compact region in space. We show that this system is an irregular scatterer
in large parts of its parameter space. If in addition all spatio-temporal
symmetries are broken, directed transport of mass as well as angular momentum
occurs. The sensitive parameter dependence of the corresponding currents
includes frequent sign reversals. Zeros of either quantity entail the exclusive
occurrence of the other and thus give rise in particular to angular-momentum
separation without mass transport as a classical analogue of spin-polarized
currents.
