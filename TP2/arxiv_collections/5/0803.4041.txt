x dependences of Tc in YBa2Cu3O6+x and Y1-b(Ca)bBa2Cu3O6+x (b=0.1 and b=0.2)
have been calculated assuming that the net doping of CuO2 layers is a sum of
contributions from CuO chains and from substitution of Y3+ by Ca2+. We applied
the concept of minimal (critical) chain length lcr needed to trigger charge
transfer from chains to planes. The model proposed assumes that only a certain
part, say kappa, of those chain-holes that are created beyond the first lcr-2
holes in chains of length l>lcr, are able to attract electrons from CuO2
bilayer. Our analysis points to the conclusion that parameter lcr should be
equal to 4 (four oxygen atoms in a chain), or very close to it (3, or 5).
Calculated x dependences of doping, p(x), at constant (room) temperature and
for three different substitution levels b=0, 0.1, and 0.2, are found to be in
excellent agreement with available experimental data. These p(x) dependences
are combined with universal (parabolic) phase relation Tc(p) to obtain three
Tc(x) dependences that also remarkably correlate with those reported in
experiments. The results obtained indicate that in long chains (x=1) the
probability for a chain-hole to capture an electron (expressing hole ability to
become transferred) decreases with the concentration of 3d Cu electrons in CuO2
layers, ranking from kappa=40%(42%) in YBa2Cu3O6+x, over kappa=36% in
Y0.9(Ca)0.1Ba2Cu3O6+x to kappa=33% in Y0.8(Ca)0.2Ba2Cu3O6+x. We estimate that
in these three systems the wavelength of charge corrugations in long chains (at
x=1) should be ranking around lambda=1.38nm, lambda=1.25nm, lambda=1.20nm,
respectively.
