Five fundamental scales of mass follow from holographic limitations, a
self-similar law for angular momentum and the basic scaling laws for a fractal
universe with dimension 2. The five scales correspond to the observable
universe, clusters, galaxies, stars and the nucleon. The fundamental scales
form naturally a self-similar hierarchy, generating new relationships among the
parameters of the nucleon,the cosmological constant and the Planck scale. There
is implied a sixth fundamental scale thatcorresponds to the electrostatic force
within an atom. Identifying the implied scale as such leads to new
relationships among the fundamental charge, the mass of the electron and
cosmological parameters. Theseconsiderations also suggest that structures on
the scale of galaxies and larger must be bound by non-Newtonian forces.
