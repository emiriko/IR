We study the $\sigma$ meson in QCD sum rules using a two quark interpolating
field with derivatives. In the constituent quark model, the $\sigma$ meson is
composed of a quark and an antiquark in the relative p-wave state and is thus
expected to have a larger overlap with an interpolating field that measures the
derivative of the relative quark wave-function. While the sum rule with a
current without derivatives gives a pole mass of around 1 GeV, the present sum
rule with a derivative current gives a mass of around 550 MeV and a width of
400 MeV, that could be identified with the $\sigma$ meson.
