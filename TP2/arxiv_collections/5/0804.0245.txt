We present a notion of frame multiresolution analysis on the Heisenberg
group, abbreviated by FMRA, and study its properties. Using the irreducible
representations of this group, we shall define a sinc-type function which is
our starting point for obtaining the scaling function. Further, we shall give a
concrete example of a wavelet FMRA on the Heisenberg group which is analogous
to the Shannon
  MRA on $\RR$.
