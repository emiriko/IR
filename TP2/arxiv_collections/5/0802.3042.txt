Today, hot embossing and injection molding belong to the established plastic
molding processes in microengineering. Based on experimental findings, a
variety of microstructures have been replicated so far using the processes.
However, with increasing requirements regarding the embossing surface and the
simultaneous decrease of the structure size down into the nanorange, increasing
know-how is needed to adapt hot embossing to industrial standards. To reach
this objective, a German-Canadian cooperation project has been launched to
study hot embossing theoretically by a process simulation and experimentally.
The present publication shall report about the first results of the simulation
- the modeling and simulation of large area replication based on an eight inch
microstructured mold.
