Phonon modes found in low frequency Raman scattering from $CdS_{1-x}Se_x$
nanocrystals embedded in borosilicate glass arising from confined acoustic
phonons are investigated. In addition to the breathing modes and quadrupolar
modes, two additional modes are found in the spectra. In order to assign the
new modes, confined acoustic phonon frequencies are calculated using CFM, CSM
and the Lamb model. Based on the ratio of the frequencies of the new modes to
those of the quadrupolar mode, the new modes are assigned to first overtone of
the quadrupolar mode (l=2, n=1) and l=1, n=0 torsional mode. The appearance of
the forbidden torsional mode is attributed to nonspherical appearance shape of
the nanoparticle found from high-resolution TEM.
