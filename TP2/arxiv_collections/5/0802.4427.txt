We present a study of the gravitational waveforms from a series of spinning,
equal-mass black hole binaries focusing on the harmonic content of the waves
and the contribution of the individual harmonics to the signal-to-noise ratio.
The gravitational waves were produced from two series of evolutions with black
holes of initial spins equal in magnitude and anti-aligned with each other. In
one series the magnitude of the spin is varied; while in the second, the
initial angle between the black-hole spins and the orbital angular momentum
varies. We also conduct a preliminary investigation into using these waveforms
as templates for detecting spinning binary black holes. Since these runs are
relativity short, containing about two to three orbits, merger and ringdown, we
limit our study to systems of total mass greater than 50 solar masses. This
choice ensures that our waveforms are present in the ground-based detector band
without needing addition gravitational wave cycles. We find that while the mode
contribution to the signal-to-noise ratio varies with the initial angle, the
total mass of the system caused greater variations in the match.
