This paper introduces a new measure-conjugacy invariant for actions of free
groups. Using this invariant, it is shown that two Bernoulli shifts over a
finitely generated free group are measurably conjugate if and only if their
base measures have the same entropy. This answers a question of Ornstein and
Weiss.
