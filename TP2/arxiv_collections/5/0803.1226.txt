We present the analytical description of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a
2DEG ferromagnet within the Keldysh formalism. These results unify all three
linear response approaches to anomalous Hall transport and close a long
standing debate. We are able to identify a new extrinsic AHE regime dominated
by a hybrid skew scattering mechanism. This new contribution is inversely
proportional to the impurity concentration, resembling the normal skew
scattering, {\em but} independent of the impurity-strength, resembling the
side-jump mechanism. Within the Kubo formalism this regime is captured by
higher order diagrams which, although weak, dominate when both subbands are
occupied; this regime can be detected by variable remote doping experiments
that we describe.
