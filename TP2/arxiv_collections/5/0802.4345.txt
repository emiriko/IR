Minkowski Space is the simplest four-dimensional Lorentzian Manifold, being
topologically trivial and globally flat, and hence the simplest model of
spacetime--from a General-Relativistic point of view. But this does not mean
that it is altogether structurally trivial. In fact, it has a very rich
structure, parts of which will be spelled out in detail in this contribution.
This will contain elementary aspects of affine spaces, various paths to the
Poincare group, the lattices of causally and chronologically complete regions,
and last but not least, the Noether-Herglotz theorem.
