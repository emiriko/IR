An imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure will lead to a
change in body weight (mass) and body composition (fat and lean masses). A
quantitative understanding of the processes involved, which currently remains
lacking, will be useful in determining the etiology and treatment of obesity
and other conditions resulting from prolonged energy imbalance. Here, we show
that the long-term dynamics of human weight change can be captured by a
mathematical model of the macronutrient flux balances and all previous models
are special cases of this model. We show that the generic dynamical behavior of
body composition for a clamped diet can be divided into two classes. In the
first class, the body composition and mass are determined uniquely. In the
second class, the body composition can exist at an infinite number of possible
states. Surprisingly, perturbations of dietary energy intake or energy
expenditure can give identical responses in both model classes and existing
data are insufficient to distinguish between these two possibilities. However,
this distinction is important for the efficacy of clinical interventions that
alter body composition and mass.
