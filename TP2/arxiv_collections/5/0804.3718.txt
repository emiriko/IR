The scattering of a charged scalar field on Coulomb potential is studied
using solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation which have a definite momentum.
One obtains that in contrast with what happens on Minkowski case the modulus of
momentum is not conserved in the scattering process on de Sitter space.
