We investigate theoretically the rates of non-radiative decay of excited
semiconducting nanotubes by a variety of decay mechanisms and compare with
experimental findings. We find that the multi-phonon decay (MPD) of free
excitons is too slow to be responsible for the experimentally observed
lifetimes. However, MPD lifetimes of localized excitons could be 2-3 orders of
magnitude shorter. We also propose a new decay mechanism that relies on a
finite doping of nanotubes and involves exciton decay into an optical phonon
and an intraband electron-hole pair. The resulting lifetime is in the range of
5 to 100 ps, even for a moderate doping level.
