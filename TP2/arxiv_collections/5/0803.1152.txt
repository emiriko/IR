The exclusive process 3He(e,e'p)2H has been analyzed by a non-factorized and
parameter-free approach based upon realistic few-body wave functions
corresponding to the $AV18$ interaction and treating the rescattering of the
struck nucleon within a generalized eikonal approximation. The results of our
calculations, compared with recent JLab experimental data, show that the
left-right asymmetry exhibits a clear dependence upon the final state
interaction demonstrating the breaking down of the factorization approximation
at "negative" and large (> 300 MeV/c) values of the missing momentum.
