Maximizing the precision in estimating parameters in a quantum system subject
to instrumentation constraints is cast as a convex optimization problem. We
account for prior knowledge about the parameter range by developing a
worst-case and average case objective for optimizing the precision. Focusing on
the single parameter case, we show that the optimization problems are {\em
linear programs}. For the average case the solution to the linear program can
be expressed analytically and involves a simple search: finding the largest
element in a list. An example is presented which compares what is possible
under constraints against the ideal with no constraints, the Quantum Fisher
Information.
