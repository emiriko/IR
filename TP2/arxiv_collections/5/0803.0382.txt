Climate change is a reality of today. Paleoclimatic proxies and climate
predictions based on coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models
provide us with temperature data. Using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, we are
investigating the statistical connection between the climate types of the
present and these local temperatures. We are relating this issue to some
well-known historic climate shifts. Our main result is that the temperature
fluctuations with or without a temperature scale attached to them, can be used
to classify climates in the absence of other indicators such as pan evaporation
and precipitation.
