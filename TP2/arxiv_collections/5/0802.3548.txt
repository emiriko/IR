Classical Hecke operators on Maass forms are unitarely equivalent, up to a
commuting phase, to completely positive maps on II$_1$ factors, associated to a
pair of isomorphic subfactors, and an intertwining unitary. This representation
is obtained through a quantized representation of the Hecke operators. in this
representation, the Hecke operators act on the Berezin's quantization,
deformation algebra of the fundamental domain of $\PSL(2,\Z)$ in the upper
halfplane. The Hecke operators are inheriting from the ambient, non-commutative
algebra on which they act, a rich structure of matrix inequalities. Using this
construction we obtain that, for every prime $p$, the essential spectrum of the
classical Hecke operator $T_p$ is contained in the interval $[-2\sqrt p, 2\sqrt
p]$, predicted by the Ramanujan Petersson conjectures. In particular, given an
open interval containing $[-2\sqrt p, 2\sqrt p]$, there are at most a finite
number of possible exceptional eigenvalues lying outside this interval. The
main tool for obtaining this representation of the Hecke operators (unitarely
equivalent to the classical representation, up to commuting phase) is a Schurr
type, positive "square root" of the state on $\PGL(2,\Q)$, measuring the
displacement of fundamental domain by translations in $\PGL(2,\Q)$. The "square
root" is obtained from the matrix coefficients of the discrete series
representations of $\PSL(2,\R)$ restricted to $\PGL(2, \Q)$. The methods in
this paper may also be applied to any finite index, modular subgroup
$\Gamma_0(p^n)$, $n\geq 1$, of $\PSL(2,\Z)$. In this case the essential norm of
the Hecke operator is equal to the norm of the corresponding convolution
operator on the cosets Hilbert space $\ell^2((\Gamma_0(p^n))\backslash
\PSL(2,\Z[1/p])$.
