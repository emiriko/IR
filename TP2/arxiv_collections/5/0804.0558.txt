We are interested in the problem of multiagent systems development for risk
detecting and emergency response in an uncertain and partially perceived
environment. The evaluation of the current situation passes by three stages
inside the multiagent system. In a first time, the situation is represented in
a dynamic way. The second step, consists to characterise the situation and
finally, it is compared with other similar known situations. In this paper, we
present an information modelling of an observed environment, that we have
applied on the RoboCupRescue Simulation System. Information coming from the
environment are formatted according to a taxonomy and using semantic features.
The latter are defined thanks to a fine ontology of the domain and are managed
by factual agents that aim to represent dynamically the current situation.
