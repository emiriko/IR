Two strongly coupled quantum dots are theoretically and experimentally
investigated. In the conductance measurements of a GaAs based low-dimensional
system additional features to the Coulomb blockade have been detected at low
temperatures. These regions of finite conductivity are compared with
theoretical investigations of a strongly coupled quantum dot system and good
agreement of the theoretical and the experimental results has been found.
