The honeycomb lattice of graphene is a unique two-dimensional (2D) system
where the quantum mechanics of electrons is equivalent to that of relativistic
Dirac fermions. Novel nanometer-scale behavior in this material, including
electronic scattering, spin-based phenomena, and collective excitations, is
predicted to be sensitive to charge carrier density. In order to probe local,
carrier-density dependent properties in graphene we have performed
atomically-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on
mechanically cleaved graphene flake devices equipped with tunable back-gate
electrodes. We observe an unexpected gap-like feature in the graphene tunneling
spectrum which remains pinned to the Fermi level (E_F) regardless of graphene
electron density. This gap is found to arise from a suppression of electronic
tunneling to graphene states near E_F and a simultaneous giant enhancement of
electronic tunneling at higher energies due to a phonon-mediated inelastic
channel. Phonons thus act as a "floodgate" that controls the flow of tunneling
electrons in graphene. This work reveals important new tunneling processes in
gate-tunable graphitic layers.
