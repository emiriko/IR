An expression is derived for calculating microcanonical-ensemble averages of
the kinetic energies of atoms of different types in clusters isolated from the
environment. This expression is a natural generalization of the solution to the
problem of hard spheres with different masses to a system with a many-particle
interatomic interaction potential. The dynamics of a C8H8 cubane is simulated
numerically. The data on the numerical simulation confirm the validity of the
results obtained.
