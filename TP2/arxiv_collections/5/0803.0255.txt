We examine the Brown-Rho scaling for meson masses in the strong coupling
limit of lattice QCD with one species of staggered fermion. Analytical
expression of meson masses is derived at finite temperature and chemical
potential. We find that meson masses are approximately proportional to the
equilibrium value of the chiral condensate, which evolves as a function of
temperature and chemical potential.
