We show that a simple gravitational theory can provide a holographically dual
description of a superconductor. There is a critical temperature, below which a
charged condensate forms via a second order phase transition and the (DC)
conductivity becomes infinite. The frequency dependent conductivity develops a
gap determined by the condensate. We find evidence that the condensate consists
of pairs of quasiparticles.
