Developments in Mobile Computing are putting pressure on the software
industry to research new modes of interaction that do not rely on the
traditional keyboard and mouse combination. Computer users suffering from
Repetitive Strain Injury also seek an alternative to keyboard and mouse devices
to reduce suffering in wrist and finger joints. Voice-control is an alternative
approach to spreadsheet development and debugging that has been researched and
used successfully in other domains. While voice-control technology for
spreadsheets is available its effectiveness has not been investigated. This
study is the first to compare the performance of a set of expert spreadsheet
developers that debugged a spreadsheet using voice-control technology and
another set that debugged the same spreadsheet using keyboard and mouse. The
study showed that voice, despite its advantages, proved to be slower and less
accurate. However, it also revealed ways in which the technology might be
improved to redress this imbalance.
