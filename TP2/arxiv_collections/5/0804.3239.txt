In this report the SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X gauge model with minimal scalar
sector, two Higgs triplets, is presented in detail. One of the vacuum
expectation values $u$ is a source of lepton-number violations and a reason for
mixing among charged gauge bosons--the standard model W^\pm and the bilepton
gauge bosons Y^\pm as well as among the neutral non-Hermitian bilepton X^0 and
neutral gauge bosons--the Z and the new Z'. An exact diagonalization of the
neutral gauge boson sector is derived and bilepton mass splitting is also
given. Because of these mixings, the lepton-number violating interactions exist
in both charged and neutral gauge boson sectors. Constraints on vacuum
expectation values of the model are estimated and u \simeq O(1) GeV, v \simeq
v_weak = 246 GeV, and \omega \simeq O(1) TeV. In this model there are three
physical scalars, two neutral and one charged, and eight Goldstone bosons--the
needed number for massive gauge bosons. The minimal scalar sector can provide
all fermions including quarks and neutrinos consistent masses in which some of
them require one-loop radiative corrections.
