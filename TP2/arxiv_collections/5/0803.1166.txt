The microscopic origin of the magnetically-driven ferroelectricity in
collinear AFM-E orthorhombic manganites is explained by means of
first-principles Wannier functions. We show that the polarization is mainly
determined by the "asymmetric electron hopping" of orbitally-polarized Mn eg
states, implicit in the peculiar in-plane zig-zag spin arrangement in the AFM-E
configuration. In ortho-HoMnO3, Wannier function centers are largely displaced
with respect to corresponding ionic positions, implying that the final
polarization is strongly affected by a purely electronic contribution, at
variance with standard ferroelectrics where the ionic-displacement is dominant.
However, the final value of the polarization is the result of competing
effects, as shown by the opposite signs of the contributions to the
polarization coming from the Mn eg and t2g states. Furthermore, a systematic
analysis of the link between ferroelectricity and the spin, orbital and lattice
degrees of freedom in the manganite series has been carried out, in the aim of
ascertaining chemical trends as a function of the rare-earth ion. Our results
show that the Mn-O-Mn angle is the key quantity in determining the exchange
coupling: upon decreasing the Mn-O-Mn angle, the first- (second-) nearest
neighbor ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) interaction decreases (remains
constant), in turn stabilizing either the AFM-A or the AFM-E spin configuration
for weakly or strongly distorted manganites, respectively. The Mn eg
contribution to the polarization dramatically increases with the Mn-O-Mn angle
and decreases with the "long" Mn-O bond length, whereas the Mn t2g contribution
decreases with the "short" Mn-O bond-length, partially cancelling the former
term.
