We prove almost sure Euler hydrodynamics for a large class of attractive
particle systems on $\Z$ starting from an arbitrary initial profile. We
generalize earlier works by Sepp\"al\"ainen (1999) and Andjel et al. (2004).
Our constructive approach requires new ideas since the subadditive ergodic
theorem (central to previous works) is no longer effective in our setting.
