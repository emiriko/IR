We examine recent extensions of the standard model with an up-type vectorlike
isosinglet T quark that mixes dominantly with the top quark. We take under
scrutiny the nondecoupling effects which may reveal such a new heavy fermion
through loop diagrams relevant for rare decays such as K-->pi nu nu-bar,
B-->pi(K) nu nu-bar, and B_{s,d}-->mu^+ mu^-. After demonstrating in detail the
cancellation between the leading nondecoupling terms, we show that two residual
forms ~ s^2 ln{m_T^2} and ~ s^4 m_T^2 act in complementary way, so that the
maximal allowed values of the decay rates are practically independent of m_T.
While they correspond to ~ 20% or ~ 30% corrections to the SM rates for K-->pi
nu nu-bar and B-->pi(K) nu nu-bar, an increase by ~ 50% for B_{s,d}-->mu^+ mu^-
decays offers a possibility to reveal an additional isosinglet state by
measurements of these decays at the Large Hadron Collider.
