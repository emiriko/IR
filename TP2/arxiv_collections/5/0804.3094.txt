We consider the double exchange model at very low densities. The conditions
for the formation of self-trapped magnetic polarons are analyzed using an
independent polaron model. The issue of phase separation in the low density
region of the temperature-density phase diagram is discussed. We show how
electrostatic and localization effects can lead to the substantial suppression
of the phase separated regime. By examining connections between the resulting
phase and the polaronic phase, we conclude that they reflect essentially the
same physical situation of a ferromagnetic droplet containing one single
electron. In the ultra diluted regime, we explore the possible stabilization of
a Wigner crystal of magnetic polarons. Our results are compared with the
experimental evidence for a polaronic phase in europium hexaboride, and we are
able to reproduce the experimental region of stability of the polaronic phase.
We further demonstrate that phase-separation is a general feature expected in
metallic ferromagnets whose bandwidth depends on the magnetization.
