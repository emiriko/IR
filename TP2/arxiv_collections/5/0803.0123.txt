Geometric torsions are torsions of acyclic complexes of vector spaces which
consist of differentials of geometric quantities assigned to the elements of a
manifold triangulation. We use geometric torsions to construct invariants for a
manifold with a triangulated boundary. These invariants can be naturally united
in a vector, and a change of the boundary triangulation corresponds to a linear
transformation of this vector. Moreover, when two manifolds are glued by their
common boundary, these vectors undergo scalar multiplication, i.e., they work
according to M. Atiyah's axioms for a topological quantum field theory.
