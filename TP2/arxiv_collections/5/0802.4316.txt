The spin lattice relaxation of I=3/2 quadrupolar spin system due to domain
walls in order-disorder ferroelectrics has been studied and a general method is
proposed for the measurement of domain width in nano ferroelectrics. Based on
the fact that electric polarization undergoes spiral orientation as one moves
from one domain to the other, it is assumed that at low temperatures the spins
at and near domain walls undergo relaxation due to possible easy reorientation
of electric polarization in domain walls even though such a relaxation in the
main body of the domain has almost ceased. The spins present inside the domain
undergo relaxation through transfer of magnetization to the domain walls
through a spin diffusion process by nearest neighbour interaction. Rate
equations for spin populations are formed by representing the ferroelectric
domain by a one-dimensional chain of equidistant spins having dipolar coupling.
Spin populations are calculated as a function of time for different ratios of
quadrupolar to dipolar transition probabilities for a sample subjected to
selective rf pulse. Expression for spin- lattice relaxation time T1 is derived
in terms of domain width and ratio of quadrupolar to dipolar transition
probabilities. It is found that the domain width can be estimated provided the
value of spin lattice relaxation time T1 is known for the corresponding crystal
with normal sized grains. The results are quite general and can be applied to
any order disorder ferroelectric with nano sized domains and having spin I=3/2
nuclei.
