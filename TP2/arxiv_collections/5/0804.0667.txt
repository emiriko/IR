We propose a new method for computing the temperature dependence of the heat
capacity in complex molecular systems. The proposed scheme is based on the use
of the Langevin equation with low frequency color noise. We obtain the
temperature dependence of the correlation time of random noises, which enables
to model the partial thermalization of high-frequency vibrations, which is a
pure quantum effect. By applying the method to carbon nanotubes, we show that
the consideration of the color noise in the Langevin equation allows to
reproduce the temperature evolution of the specific heat with good accuracy.
