We show that a laser pulse designed as an adiabatic ramp followed by a kick
allows one to reach a perfect postpulse molecular alignment, free of
saturation. The mechanism is based on an optimized distribution of the energy
between a weakly efficient but non saturating adiabatic ramp and an efficient
but saturating impulsive field. Unprecedent degrees of alignment are predicted
using state-of-the-art pulse shaping techniques and non-destructive field
intensities. The scheme can be extended to reach high degrees of orientation of
polar molecules using designed half-cycle pulses.
