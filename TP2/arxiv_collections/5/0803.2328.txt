Quantum phase is not a direct observable and is usually determined by
interferometric methods. We present a method to map complete electron wave
functions, including internal quantum phase information, from measured
single-state probability densities. We harness the mathematical discovery of
drum-like manifolds bearing different shapes but identical resonances, and
construct quantum isospectral nanostructures possessing matching electronic
structure but divergent physical structure. Quantum measurement (scanning
tunneling microscopy) of these "quantum drums" [degenerate two-dimensional
electron states on the Cu(111) surface confined by individually positioned CO
molecules] reveals that isospectrality provides an extra topological degree of
freedom enabling robust quantum state transplantation and phase extraction.
