We present a randomized approximation algorithm for counting contingency
tables, mxn non-negative integer matrices with given row sums R=(r_1, ..., r_m)
and column sums C=(c_1, ..., c_n). We define smooth margins (R,C) in terms of
the typical table and prove that for such margins the algorithm has
quasi-polynomial N^{O(ln N)} complexity, where N=r_1+...+r_m=c_1+...+c_n.
Various classes of margins are smooth, e.g., when m=O(n), n=O(m) and the ratios
between the largest and the smallest row sums as well as between the largest
and the smallest column sums are strictly smaller than the golden ratio
(1+sqrt{5})/2 = 1.618. The algorithm builds on Monte Carlo integration and
sampling algorithms for log-concave densities, the matrix scaling algorithm,
the permanent approximation algorithm, and an integral representation for the
number of contingency tables.
