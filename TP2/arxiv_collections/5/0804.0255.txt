The so called magnetic scenario recently suggested in \cite{Liao_ES_mono}
emphasizes the role of monopoles in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP)
near/above the deconfinement temperature, and specifically predicts that they
help reduce its viscosity by the so called "magnetic bottle" effect. Arguments
for "magnetic liquid" in 1-2$T_c$ based on lattice measurement of monopole
density were provided in \cite{Chernodub}. Here we present results for
monopole-(anti)monopole correlation functions from the same classical molecular
dynamics simulations, which are found to be in very good agreement with recent
lattice results \cite{D'Alessandro:2007su}. We show that the magnetic Coulomb
coupling does run in the direction $opposite$ to the electric one, as expected,
and it is roughly inverse of the asymptotic freedom formula for the electric
one. However, as $T$ decreases to $T_c$, the magnetic coupling never gets weak,
with the plasma parameter always large enough ($\Gamma>1$). This nicely agrees
with empirical evidences from RHIC experiments, implying that magnetic objects
cannot have large mean free path and should also form a good liquid with low
viscosity.
