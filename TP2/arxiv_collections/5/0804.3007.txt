We examine the reach of a Beta-beam experiment with two detectors at
carefully chosen baselines for exploring neutrino mass parameters. Locating the
source at CERN, the two detectors and baselines are: (a) a 50 kton iron
calorimeter (ICAL) at a baseline of around 7150 km which is roughly the magic
baseline, e.g., ICAL@INO, and (b) a 50 kton Totally Active Scintillator
Detector at a distance of 730 km, e.g., at Gran Sasso. We choose 8B/8Li source
ions with a boost factor \gamma of 650 for the magic baseline while for the
closer detector we consider 18Ne/6He ions with a range of Lorentz boosts. We
find that the locations of the two detectors complement each other leading to
an exceptional high sensitivity. With \gamma=650 for 8B/8Li and \gamma=575 for
18Ne/6He and total luminosity corresponding to 5\times (1.1 \times 10^{18}) and
5\times (2.9\times 10^{18}) useful ion decays in neutrino and antineutrino
modes respectively, we find that our two detector set-up can probe maximal CP
violation and establish the neutrino mass ordering if \sin^22\theta_{13} is
1.4\times 10^{-4} and 2.7\times 10^{-4}, respectively, or more. The sensitivity
reach for \sin^22\theta_{13} itself is 5.5 \times 10^{-4}. With a factor of 10
higher luminosity, the corresponding \sin^22\theta_{13} reach of this set-up
would be 1.8\times 10^{-5}, 4.6\times 10^{-5} and 5.3\times 10^{-5}
respectively for the above three performance indicators. CP violation can be
discovered for 64% of the possible \delta_{CP} values for \sin^22\theta_{13}
\geq 10^{-3} (\geq 8\times 10^{-5}), for the standard luminosity (10 times
enhanced luminosity). Comparable physics performance can be achieved in a
set-up where data from CERN to INO@ICAL is combined with that from CERN to the
Boulby mine in United Kingdom, a baseline of 1050 km.
