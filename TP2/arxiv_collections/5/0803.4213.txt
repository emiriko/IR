We find the analytical expression for the threshold intensity necessary to
launch ultra-slow light pulses in a metamaterial with simultaneous cubic
electric and magnetic nonlinearity. The role played respectively by the
permittivity, the permeability, the electric cubic nonlinearity, the magnetic
cubic nonlinearity and the pulse duration is clearly identified and discussed.
