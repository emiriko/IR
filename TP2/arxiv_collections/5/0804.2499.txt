Pristine coastal shallow systems are usually dominated by extensive meadows
of seagrass species, which are assumed to take advantage of nutrient supply
from sediment. An increasing nutrient input is thought to favour phytoplankton,
epiphytic microalgae, as well as opportunistic ephemeral macroalgae that
coexist with seagrasses. The primary cause of shifts and succession in the
macrophyte community is the increase of nutrient load to water; however
temperature plays also an important role. A competition model between rooted
seagrass (Zostera marina), macroalgae (Ulva sp), and phytoplankton has been
developed to analyse the succession of primary producer communities in these
systems. Successions of dominance states, with different resilience
characteristics, are found when modifying the input of nutrients and the
seasonal temperature and light intensity forcing.
