We have compared the respective efficiencies of off-axis and phase-shifting
holography in terms of noise and aliases removal. The comparison is made by
analyzing holograms of an USAF target backlit with laser illumination, recorded
with a charge-coupled device camera. We show that it is essential to remove the
LO beam noise, especially at low illumination levels.
