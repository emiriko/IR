We present a simple yet generic model for the behavior of a system of many
surface-attached flexible polymers with rigid side chains. Beyond its potential
application in describing the dynamics of the extracellular matrix of mammalian
cells, the model itself shows an interesting phase transition behavior since
the underlying models (a two-dimensional Potts model and a XY-model) undergo
different phase transitions.
