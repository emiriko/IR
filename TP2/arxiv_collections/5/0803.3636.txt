Recent progress towards the non-fission ignition of thermonuclear
micro-explosions raises the prospect for a revival of the nuclear bomb
propulsion idea, both for the fast transport of large payloads within the solar
system and the launch into earth orbit without the release of fission products
into the atmosphere. To reach this goal three areas of research are of
importance: 1)Compact thermonuclear ignition drivers. 2)Fast ignition and
deuterium burn. 3)Space-craft architecture involving magnetic insulation and
GeV electrostatic potentials
