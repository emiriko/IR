We study a non-Hermitian $PT-$symmetric generalization of an $N$-particle,
two-mode Bose-Hubbard system, modeling for example a Bose-Einstein condensate
in a double well potential coupled to a continuum via a sink in one of the
wells and a source in the other. The effect of the interplay between the
particle interaction and the non-Hermiticity on characteristic features of the
spectrum is analyzed drawing special attention to the occurrence and unfolding
of exceptional points (EPs). We find that for vanishing particle interaction
there are only two EPs of order $N+1$ which under perturbation unfold either
into $[(N+1)/2]$ eigenvalue pairs (and in case of $N+1$ odd, into an additional
zero-eigenvalue) or into eigenvalue triplets (third-order eigenvalue rings) and
$(N+1)\mod 3$ single eigenvalues, depending on the direction of the
perturbation in parameter space. This behavior is described analytically using
perturbational techniques. More general EP unfoldings into eigenvalue rings up
to $(N+1)$th order are indicated.
