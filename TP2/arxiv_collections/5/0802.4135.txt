A 2D foam can be characterised by its distribution of bubble areas, and of
number of sides. Both distributions have an average and a width (standard
deviation). There are therefore at least two very different ways to
characterise the disorder. The former is a geometrical measurement, while the
latter is purely topological. We discuss the common points and differences
between both quantities. We measure them in a foam which is sheared, so that
bubbles move past each other and the foam is "shuffled" (a notion we discuss).
Both quantities are strongly correlated; in this case (only) it thus becomes
sufficient to use either one or the other to characterize the foam disorder. We
suggest applications to the analysis of other systems, including biological
tissues.
