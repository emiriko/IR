By studying the action of the Weyl group of a simple Lie algebra on its root
lattice, we construct torsion free subgroups of small and explicitly determined
index in a large infinite class of Coxeter groups. One spin-off is the
construction of hyperbolic manifolds of very small volume in up to 8
dimensions.
