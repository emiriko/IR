We report the observation of nonclassical light generated via photon blockade
in a photonic crystal cavity with a strongly coupled quantum dot. By tuning the
frequency of the probe laser with respect to the cavity and quantum dot
resonance we can probe the system in either photon blockade or photon-induced
tunneling regime. The transition from one regime to the other is confirmed by
the measurement of the second order correlation that changes from anti-bunching
to bunching.
