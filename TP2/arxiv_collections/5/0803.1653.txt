For the linearized setting of the dynamics of complex bodies we construct
variational integrators and prove their convergence by making use of BV
estimates on the rate fields. We allow for peculiar substructural inertia and
internal dissipation, all accounted for by a d'Alembert-Lagrange-type
principle.
