Nonlocal symmetries for exactly integrable two-field evolutionary systems of
the third order have been computed. Differentiation of the nonlocal symmetries
with respect to spatial variable gives a few nonevolutionary systems for each
evolutionary system. Zero curvature representations for some new nonevolution
systems are presented.
