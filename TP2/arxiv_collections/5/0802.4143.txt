The vector mesons in three-flavor quark matter with chiral and diquark
condensates are studied using the in-medium QCD sum rules. The diquark
condensate leads to a mass splitting between the flavor-octet and
flavor-singlet channels. At high density, the singlet vector meson disappears
from the low-energy spectrum, while the octet vector mesons survive as light
excitations with a mass comparable to the fermion gap. A possible connection
between the light gluonic modes and the flavor-octet vector mesons at high
density is also discussed.
