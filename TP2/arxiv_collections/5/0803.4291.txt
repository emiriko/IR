We study the momentum and the quark mass dependence of the axial nucleon to
Delta(1232) transition form factors in the framework of non-relativistic chiral
effective field theory to leading-one-loop order. The outcome of our analysis
provides a theoretical guidance for chiral extrapolations of lattice QCD
results with dynamical fermions.
