A simple flashing ratchet model in two dimensions is proposed to simulate the
hand-over-hand motion of two head molecular motors like kinesin. Extensive
Langevin simulations of the model are performed. Good qualitative agreement
with the expected behavior is observed. We discuss different regimes of motion
and efficiency depending of model parameters.
