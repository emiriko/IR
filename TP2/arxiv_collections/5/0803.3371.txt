The prevalent role of force in traditional quantum mechanics is outlined,
with special reference to approximate calculations for stationary states. It
will be explored how far this force concept can be made useful in the concerned
area. The basic idea is to differentiate the Schroedinger stationary equation
once. Thus, one can eliminate the unknown energy as well, and then examine how
a force-based approach can be beneficial in providing quickly the nodal
information and in assessing the quality of an approximate function. Further,
it will be demonstrated how the minimization of a suitable quantity derived
from force may constitute a variational principle for bound states. The
strategy applies also to Siegert states where traditional energy extremization
principle ceases to work. Additionally, the utility of the force concept in
semiclassical mechanics will be investigated.
