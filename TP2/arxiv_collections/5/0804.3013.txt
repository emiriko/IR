Hadron generation in the Geant4 simulation tool kit is compared with
inclusive spectra of secondary protons and pions from the interactions with
beryllium nuclei of +8.9 GeV/c protons and pions, and of -8.0 GeV/c pions. The
data were taken in 2002 at the CERN Proton Synchrotron with the HARP
spectrometer. We report on significant disagreements between data and simulated
data especially in the polar-angle distributions of secondary protons and
pions.
