We present a comprehensive investigation of the electron-nuclear system of
negatively charged InGaAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots under the influence
of weak external magnetic fields (up to 2 mT). We demonstrate that, in contrast
to conventional semiconductor systems, these small fields have a profound
influence on the electron spin dynamics, via the hyperfine interaction. Quantum
dots, with their comparatively limited number of nuclei, present
electron-nuclear behavior that is unique to low-dimensional systems. We show
that the conventional Hanle effect used to measure electron spin relaxation
times, for example, cannot be used in these systems when the spin lifetimes are
long. An individual nucleus in the QD is subject to milli-Tesla effective
fields, arising from the interaction with its nearest-neighbors and with the
electronic Knight field. The alignment of each nucleus is influenced by
application of external fields of the same magnitude. A polarized nuclear
system, which may have an effective field strength of several Tesla, may easily
be influenced by these milli-Tesla fields. This in turn has a dramatic effect
on the electron spin dynamics, and we use this technique to gain a measure of
both the dipole-dipole field and the maximum Knight field in our system, thus
allowing us to estimate the maximum Overhauser field that may be generated at
zero external magnetic field. We also show that one may fine-tune the angle
which the Overhauser field makes with the optical axis.
