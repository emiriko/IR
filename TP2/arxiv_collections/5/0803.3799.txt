We explore electron transport through a quantum dot coupled to the source and
drain charge reservoirs We trace the transition from the Coulomb blockade
regime to Kondo regime in the electron transport through the dot occuring when
we gradually strengthen the coupling of the dot to the charge reservoirs. The
current-voltage $(I-V)$ characteristics are calculated using the equations of
motion approach within the nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism (NEGF)
beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation. We show that within the Coulomb blockade
regime the $I-V$ characteristics for the quantum dot containing a single
spin-degenerated level with the energy $E_0 $ include two steps whose locations
are determined by the values of $ E_0 $ and the energy of Coulomb interaction
of electrons in the dot $U.$ The heights of the steps are related as $2:1$
which is consistent with the results obtained by means of the transition rate
equations.
