Suspensions of self-propelled particles are studied in the framework of
two-dimensional (2D) Stokesean hydrodynamics. A formula is obtained for the
effective viscosity of such suspensions in the limit of small concentrations.
This formula includes the two terms that are found in the 2D version of
Einstein's classical result for passive suspensions. To this, the main result
of the paper is added, an additional term due to self-propulsion which depends
on the physical and geometric properties of the active suspension. This term
explains the experimental observation of a decrease in effective viscosity in
active suspensions.
