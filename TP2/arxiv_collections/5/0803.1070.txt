Using Langevin simulations, we find that simple 'generic' bead-and-spring
homopolymer chains in a sufficiently bad solvent spontaneously develop helical
order during the process of collapsing from an initially stretched
conformation. The helix formation is initiated by the unstable modes of the
straight chain, which drive the system towards a long-lived metastable
transient state. The effect is most pronounced if hydrodynamic interactions are
screened.
