The synthesis and characterization of the pyrochlore solid solutions,
Y2Ti2-xNbxO7-y, Lu2Ti2-xNbxO7-y, Y2Ti2-xTaxO7-y and Lu2TiTaO7-y (-0.4<y<0.5),
is described. Synthesis at 1600 C, and 10-5 Torr yields oxygen deficiency in
all systems. All compounds are found to be paramagnetic and semiconducting,
with the size of the local moments being less, in some cases substantially
less, than the expected value for the number of nominally unpaired electrons
present. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that all compounds can be fully
oxidized while retaining the pyrochlore structure, yielding oxygen rich
pyrochlores as white powders. Powder neutron diffraction of Y2TiNbO7-based
samples was done. Refinement of the data for oxygen deficient Y2TiNbO6.76
indicates the presence of a distribution of oxygen over the 8b and 48f sites.
Refinement of the data for oxygen rich Y2TiNbO7.5 shows these sites to be
completely filled, with an additional half filling of the 8a site. The magnetic
and TGA data strongly suggest a preference for a Ti3+/(Nb,Ta)5+ combination, as
opposed to Ti4+/(Nb,Ta)4+, in this pyrochlore family. In addition, the evidence
clearly points to Ti3+ as the source of the localized moments, with no evidence
for localized Nb4+ moments.
