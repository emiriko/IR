Local structure in the colossal thermal expansion material Ag$_3$[Co(CN)$_6$]
is studied here using a combination of neutron total scattering and reverse
Monte Carlo (RMC) analysis. We show that the large thermal variations in cell
dimensions occur with minimal distortion of the [Co(CN)$_6$] coordination
polyhedra, but involve significant flexing of the Co--CN--Ag--NC--Co linkages.
We find real-space evidence in our RMC configurations for the importance of
low-energy rigid unit modes (RUMs), particularly at temperatures below 150 K.
Using a reciprocal-space analysis we present the phonon density of states at
300 K and show that the lowest-frequency region is dominated by RUMs and
related modes. We also show that thermal variation in the energies of Ag$...$Ag
interactions is evident in both the Ag partial pair distribution function and
in the Ag partial phonon density of states. These findings are discussed in
relation to the thermodynamic properties of the material.
