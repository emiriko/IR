We propose a method to prepare a sample of fermionic atoms in a
three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice at unprecedentedly low temperatures and
uniform filling factors. The process involves adiabatic loading of atoms into
multiple energy bands of an optical lattice followed by a filtering stage
whereby atoms from all but the ground band are removed. Of critical importance
is the use of a non-harmonic trapping potential, taken here to be the radial
profile of a high-order Laguerre-Gaussian laser beam, to provide external
confinement for the atoms. For realistic experimental parameters, this
procedure should produce samples with temperatures $\sim10^{-3}$ of the Fermi
temperature. This would allow the investigation of the low-temperature phase
diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model as well as the initialization of a
high-fidelity quantum register.
