We prove sharp estimates for the dilation operator $f(x)\longmapsto f(\lambda
x)$, when acting on Wiener amalgam spaces $W(L^p,L^q)$. Scaling arguments are
also used to prove the sharpness of the known convolution and pointwise
relations for modulation spaces $M^{p,q}$, as well as the optimality of an
estimate for the Schr\"odinger propagator on modulation spaces.
