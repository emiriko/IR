We show a global adelic analog of the classical Margulis Lemma from
hyperbolic geometry. We introduce a conjugation invariant normalized height
$\hat{h}(F)$ of a finite set of matrices $F$ in $GL_{n}(\bar{\Bbb{Q}})$ which
is the adelic analog of the minimal displacement on a symmetric space. We then
show, making use of theorems of Bilu and Zhang on the equidistribution of
Galois orbits of small points, that $\hat{h}(F)>\epsilon $ as soon as $F$
generates a non-virtually solvable subgroup of $SL_{n}(\bar{\Bbb{Q}}),$ where
$\epsilon =\epsilon (n)>0$ is an absolute constant.
