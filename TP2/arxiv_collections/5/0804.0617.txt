We study the real-time dynamics of a pair hole/doubly-occupied-site, namely a
holon and a doublon, in a 1D Hubbard insulator with on-site and
nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion. Our analysis shows that the pair is
long-lived and the expected decay mechanism to underlying spin excitations is
actually inefficient. For a nonzero inter-site Coulomb repulsion, we observe
that part of the wave-function remains in a bound state. Our study also
provides insight on the holon-doublon propagation in real space. Due to the
one-dimensional nature of the problem, these particles move in opposite
directions even in the absence of an applied electric field. The potential
relevance of our results to solar cell applications is discussed.
