Three-dimensional MEMS magnetometers with use of residual stresses in thin
multilayers cantilevers are presented. Half-loop cantilevers based on
Lorentz-force deflection convert magnetic flux in changes, thanks to
piezoresistive transducers mounted in Wheatstone bridge. Magnetic field in the
order of 10 Gauss was measured with a sensitivity of 0.015 mV/Gauss. A Finite
Element Model of the device has been developed with Ansys for static and
dynamic simulations. Novel out-of-plane ferromagnetic nickel plate magnetometer
is also presented.
