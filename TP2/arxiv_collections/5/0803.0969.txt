We have studied the normal-to-superconducting phase transition in
optimally-doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ in zero external magnetic field
using a variety of different samples and techniques. Using DC transport
measurements, we find that the dynamical critical exponent $z=1.54\pm0.14$, and
the static critical exponent $\nu=0.66\pm0.10$ for both films (when
finite-thickness effects are included in the data analysis) and single crystals
(where finite-thickness effects are unimportant). We also measured thin films
at different microwave frequencies and at different powers, which allowed us to
systematically probe different length scales to avoid finite-thickness effects.
DC transport measurements were also performed on the films used in the
microwave experiments to provide a further consistency check. These microwave
and DC measurements yielded a value of z consistent with the other results,
$z=1.55\pm0.15$. The neglect of finite-thickness, finite-current, and
finite-frequency effects may account for the wide ranges of values for $\nu$
and $z$ previously reported in the literature.
