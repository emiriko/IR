MacDonald and co-workers recently predicted that high current densities could
affect the magnetic order of antiferromagnetic (AFM) multilayers, in ways
similar to those that occur in ferromagnetic (F) multilayers, and that changes
in AFM magnetic order can produce an antiferromagnetic Giant Magnetoresistance
(AGMR). Four groups have now studied current-driven effects on exchange bias at
F/AFM interfaces. In this paper, we first briefly review the main predictions
by MacDonald and co-workers, and then the results of experiments on exchange
bias that these predictions stimulated.
