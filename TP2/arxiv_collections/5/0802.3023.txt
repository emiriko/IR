We present the first measurement of the gluon polarisation in the nucleon
based on the photon-gluon fusion process tagged by charmed meson production and
decay to charged K and pi. The data were collected in polarised muon scattering
off a polarised deuteron target by the COMPASS collaboration at CERN during
2002-2004. The result of this LO analysis is <Delta g/g>_x = -0.47 +- 0.44
(stat) +- 0.15 (syst) at <x> ~= 0.11 and a scale mu^2 ~ 13 (GeV/c)^2.
