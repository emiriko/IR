We study the quantum dynamics/fluctuation of the cycloidal helical magnet in
terms of the Schwinger boson approach. In sharp contrast to the classical
fluctuation, the quantum fluctuation is collinear in nature which gives rise to
the collinear spin density wave state slightly above the helical cycloidal
state as the temperature is lowered. Physical properties such as the reduced
elliptic ratio of the spiral, the neutron scattering and infrared absorption
spectra are discussed from this viewpoint with the possible relevance to the
quasi-one dimensional LiCu$_2$O$_2$ and LiCuVO$_4$.
