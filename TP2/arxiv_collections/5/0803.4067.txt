We consider a photo--Carnot engine that consists of a single--mode radiation
field in an optical cavity. One the heat reservoirs is made of a beam of
thermally entangled pairs of two--level atoms that interact resonantly with the
cavity. We express the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine in terms of the
quantum discord of the atomic pair and find that it can exceed its classical
value. Our results show that useful work can be extracted from quantum
correlations, indicating that the latter are a valuable resource in quantum
thermodynamics.
