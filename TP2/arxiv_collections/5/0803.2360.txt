We present a new module of the micrOMEGAs package for the calculation of
WIMP-nuclei elastic scattering cross sections relevant for the direct detection
of dark matter through its interaction with nuclei in a large detector. With
this new module, the computation of the direct detection rate is performed
automatically for a generic model of new physics which contains a WIMP
candidate. This model needs to be implemented within micrOMEGAs2.1.
