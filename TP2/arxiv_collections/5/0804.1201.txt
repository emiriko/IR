In Proteomics, only the de novo peptide sequencing approach allows a partial
amino acid sequence of a peptide to be found from a MS/MS spectrum. In this
article a preliminary work is presented to discover a complete protein sequence
from spectral data (MS and MS/MS spectra). For the moment, our approach only
uses MS spectra. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been designed with a new
evaluation function which works directly with a complete MS spectrum as input
and not with a mass list like the other methods using this kind of data. Thus
the mono isotopic peak extraction step which needs a human intervention is
deleted. The goal of this approach is to discover the sequence of unknown
proteins and to allow a better understanding of the differences between
experimental proteins and proteins from databases.
