Using the ``Quality Factor'' (QF) method, we analyse the scaling properties
of deep-inelastic processes at HERA and fixed target experiments for x<0.01. We
look for scaling formulae of the form sigma(tau), where tau(log Q^2, Y) is a
scaling variable suggested by the asymptotic properties of QCD evolution
equations with rapidity Y. We consider four cases: ``Fixed Coupling'',
corresponding to the original geometric scaling proposal and motivated by the
asymptotic properties of the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation with fixed QCD
coupling constant, two versions ``Running Coupling I,II'' of the scaling
suggested by the BK equation with running coupling, and ``Diffusive Scaling''
suggested by the QCD evolution equation with Pomeron loops. The Quality
Factors, quantifying the phenomenological validity of the candidate scaling
variables, are fitted on the total and DVCS cross-section data from HERA and
predictions are made for the elastic vector-meson and for the diffractive
cross-sections at fixed small x_pom or beta. The first three scaling formulae
have comparably good QF while the fourth one is disfavored. Adjusting initial
conditions gives a significant improvement of the ``Running Coupling II''
scaling.
