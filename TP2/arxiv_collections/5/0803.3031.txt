Graphene is only one atom thick, optically transparent, chemically inert and
an excellent conductor. These properties seem to make this material an
excellent candidate for applications in various photonic devices that require
conducting but transparent thin films. In this letter we demonstrate liquid
crystal devices with electrodes made of graphene which show excellent
performance with a high contrast ratio. We also discuss the advantages of
graphene compared to conventionally-used metal oxides in terms of low
resistivity, high transparency and chemical stability.
