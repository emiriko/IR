We describe higher-dimensional theories whose low-energy 4D descriptions
contain larger gauge or global symmetry groups. As an example, we construct a
Higgsless SU(2) x U(1) model of electroweak symmetry breaking. The 5D SU(2)
gauge invariance contains both the weak SU(2) gauge group and a custodial
symmetry that protects the rho parameter. Fermions obtain isospin-violating
masses while maintaining universal gauge couplings among all three generations.
As a further example, we construct a model of chiral color based on a single
SU(3).
