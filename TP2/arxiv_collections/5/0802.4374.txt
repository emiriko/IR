The nature of scalar wave functions near the horizon of Reissner Nordstrom
(RN) extremal and Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) extremal black holes are found
using WKB approximation and the effect of reflection of waves from the horizon.
The absorption cross section $\sigma_{abs}$ when RN extremal and SdS extremal
black holes placed in a Klein-Gordon field is calculated.
