We derive conservation laws from interactions of actively-interacting
braid-like excitations of embedded framed spin networks in Quantum Gravity.
Additionally we demonstrate that actively-interacting braid-like excitations
interact in such a way that the product of interactions involving two
actively-interacting braid-like excitations produces a resulting
actively-interacting form.
