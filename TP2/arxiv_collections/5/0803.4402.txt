Entanglement is an essential resource in current experimental implementations
for quantum information processing. We review a class of experiments exploiting
photonic entanglement, ranging from one-way quantum computing over quantum
communication complexity to long-distance quantum communication. We then
propose a set of feasible experiments that will underline the advantages of
photonic entanglement for quantum information processing.
