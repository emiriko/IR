A public database system archiving a direct numerical simulation (DNS) data
set of isotropic, forced turbulence is described in this paper. The data set
consists of the DNS output on $1024^3$ spatial points and 1024 time-samples
spanning about one large-scale turn-over timescale. This complete $1024^4$
space-time history of turbulence is accessible to users remotely through an
interface that is based on the Web-services model. Users may write and execute
analysis programs on their host computers, while the programs make
subroutine-like calls that request desired parts of the data over the network.
The users are thus able to perform numerical experiments by accessing the 27
Terabytes of DNS data using regular platforms such as laptops. The architecture
of the database is explained, as are some of the locally defined functions,
such as differentiation and interpolation. Test calculations are performed to
illustrate the usage of the system and to verify the accuracy of the methods.
The database is then used to analyze a dynamical model for small-scale
intermittency in turbulence. Specifically, the dynamical effects of pressure
and viscous terms on the Lagrangian evolution of velocity increments are
evaluated using conditional averages calculated from the DNS data in the
database. It is shown that these effects differ considerably among themselves
and thus require different modeling strategies in Lagrangian models of velocity
increments and intermittency.
