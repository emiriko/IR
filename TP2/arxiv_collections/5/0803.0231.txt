The general theory of relativity is used to show that the total energy-mass
of the visible Universe could be produced by an energy-mass source with the
Planck power. The source was supposedly born at the phase of cosmic inflation
and acts continuously throughout the lifetime of our Universe. The model allows
one to treat dark energy as a real form of energy without using the hypothesis
of anti-gravity.
