We will investigate some aspects of Stueckelberg's work, which have
contributed to the development of modern physics. On the one hand, the
definition of diffuse boundaries in the calculation of scattering amplitudes
will be reviewed, and compared with the other proposals by physicists of that
time. On the other hand, the applications of Stueckelberg's description of a
massive vector field in the Standard Model will be discussed.
