Avalanche behavior of gravitationally-forced granular layers on a rough
inclined plane are investigated experimentally for different materials and for
a variety of grain shapes ranging from spherical beads to highly anisotropic
particles with dendritic shape. We measure the front velocity, area and the
height of many avalanches and correlate the motion with the area and height. We
also measure the avalanche profiles for several example cases. As the shape
irregularity of the grains is increased, there is a dramatic qualitative change
in avalanche properties. For rough non-spherical grains, avalanches are faster,
bigger and overturning in the sense that individual particles have down-slope
speeds $u_p$ that exceed the front speed $u_f$ as compared with avalanches of
spherical glass beads that are quantitatively slower, smaller and where
particles always travel slower than the front speed. There is a linear increase
of three quantities i) dimensionless avalanche height ii) ratio of particle to
front speed and iii) the growth rate of avalanche speed with increasing
avalanche size with increasing $\tan\theta_r$ where $\theta_r$ is the bulk
angle of repose, or with increasing $\beta_P$, the slope of the depth averaged
flow rule, where both $\theta_r$ and $\beta_P$ reflect the grain shape
irregularity. These relations provide a tool for predicting important dynamical
properties of avalanches as a function of grain shape irregularity. A
relatively simple depth-averaged theoretical description captures some
important elements of the avalanche motion, notably the existence of two
regimes of this motion.
