The spin-orbit interaction is a crucial element of many semiconductor
spintronic technologies. Here we report the first experimental observation, by
magneto-optical spectroscopy, of a remarkable consequence of the spin-orbit
interaction for holes confined in the molecular states of coupled quantum dots.
As the thickness of the barrier separating two coupled quantum dots is
increased, the molecular ground state changes character from a bonding orbital
to an antibonding orbital. This result is counterintuitive, and antibonding
molecular ground states are never observed in natural diatomic molecules. We
explain the origin of the reversal using a four band k.p model that has been
validated by numerical calculations that account for strain. The discovery of
antibonding molecular ground states provides new opportunities for the design
of artificially structured materials with complex molecular properties that
cannot be achieved in natural systems.
