We make a systematic study of Li isotopes (A=9,10,11) in the tensor optimized
shell model for 9Li and treat the additional valence neutrons in the cluster
model approach by taking into account the Pauli-blocking effect caused by the
tensor and pairing correlations. We describe the tensor correlations in 9Li
fully in the tensor-optimized shell model, where the variation of the size
parameters of the single particle orbits is essential for getting strong tensor
correlations. We have shown in our previous study that in $^{10,11}$Li the
tensor and pairing correlations in 9Li are Pauli-blocked by additional valence
neutrons, which make the p-shell configurations pushed up in energy. As a
result, the $s^2$ valence neutron component increases to reveal the halo
structure of 11Li and the inversion phenomenon of the single particle spectrum
in 10Li arises. Following the previous study, we demonstrate the reliability of
our framework by performing a detailed systematic analysis of the structures of
$^{9,10,11}$Li, such as the charge radius, the spatial correlation of halo
neutrons of 11Li and the electromagnetic properties of Li isotopes. The
detailed effects of the Pauli-blocking on the spectroscopic properties of
$^{10,11}$Li are also discussed. It is found that the blocking acts strongly
for the 11Li ground state rather than for 10Li and for the dipole excited
states of 11Li, which is mainly caused by the interplay between the tensor
correlation in 9Li and the halo neutrons. The results obtained in these
analyses clearly show that the inert core assumption of 9Li is not realistic to
explain the anomalous structures observed in $^{10,11}$Li. For the dipole
excitation spectrum of 11Li, the effect of the final state interactions is
discussed in terms of the dipole strength function.
