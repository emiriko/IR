The relativistic hydrodynamics together with the single-freeze-out
statistical hadronization model is used to describe the midrapidity hadron
production in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. At the
highest RHIC energy our approach gives a quite satisfactory global description
of soft hadronic observables including the HBT radii. With the increased
initial energy, from RHIC to LHC, we expect the saturation of the pion elliptic
flow and the moderate increase of the correlation radii.
