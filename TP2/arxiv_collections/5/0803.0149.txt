We study the quantum version of the random $K$-Satisfiability problem in the
presence of the external magnetic field $\Gamma$ applied in the transverse
direction. We derive the replica-symmetric free energy functional within static
approximation and the saddle-point equation for the order parameter: the
distribution $P[h(m)]$ of functions of magnetizations. The order parameter is
interpreted as the histogram of probability distributions of individual
magnetizations. In the limit of zero temperature and small transverse fields,
to leading order in $\Gamma$ magnetizations $m \approx 0$ become relevant in
addition to purely classical values of $m \approx \pm 1$. Self-consistency
equations for the order parameter are solved numerically using Quasi Monte
Carlo method for K=3. It is shown that for an arbitrarily small $\Gamma$
quantum fluctuations destroy the phase transition present in the classical
limit $\Gamma=0$, replacing it with a smooth crossover transition. The
implications of this result with respect to the expected performance of quantum
optimization algorithms via adiabatic evolution are discussed. The
replica-symmetric solution of the classical random $K$-Satisfiability problem
is briefly revisited. It is shown that the phase transition at T=0 predicted by
the replica-symmetric theory is of continuous type with atypical critical
exponents.
