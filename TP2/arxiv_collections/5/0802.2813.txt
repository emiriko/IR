We investigate electronic transport through pentacene thin-films intercalated
with potassium. From temperature-dependent conductivity measurements we find
that potassium-intercalated pentacene shows metallic behavior in a broad range
of potassium concentrations. Surprisingly, the conductivity exhibits a
re-entrance into an insulating state when the potassium concentration is
increased past one atom per molecule. We analyze our observations theoretically
by means of electronic structure calculations, and we conclude that the
phenomenon originates from a Mott metal-insulator transition, driven by
electron-electron interactions.
