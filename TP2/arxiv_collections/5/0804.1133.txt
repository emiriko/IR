This effort examines the intersection of the emerging field of quantum
computing and the more established field of evolutionary computation. The goal
is to understand what benefits quantum computing might offer to computational
intelligence and how computational intelligence paradigms might be implemented
as quantum programs to be run on a future quantum computer. We critically
examine proposed algorithms and methods for implementing computational
intelligence paradigms, primarily focused on heuristic optimization methods
including and related to evolutionary computation, with particular regard for
their potential for eventual implementation on quantum computing hardware.
