We present the two-loop QCD amplitude for the interaction of two gluons and a
CP-even Higgs boson in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We apply a
novel numerical method for the evaluation of Feynman diagrams with infrared,
ultraviolet and threshold singularities. We discuss subtleties in the
ultraviolet renormalization of the amplitude with conventional dimensional
regularization, dimensional reduction, and the four dimensional helicity
scheme. Finally, we show numerical results for scenarios of supersymmetry
breaking with a rather challenging phenomenology in which the Higgs signal in
the MSSM is suppressed in comparison to the Standard Model.
