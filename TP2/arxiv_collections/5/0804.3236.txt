A new class of deformation of the matrix model of M-theory is considered. The
deformation is analogous to the so-called $\b$-deformation of $D=3+1$, $\mN=4$
Super Yang-Mills theory, which preserves the conformal symmetry. It is shown
that the deformed matrix model can be considered as a matrix model of M-theory
on a certain curved background in eleven-dimensional supergravity, under a
scaling limit involving the deformation parameter and $N$ (the size of the
matrices). The background belongs to the so-called pp-wave type metric with a
non-constant four-form flux depending linearly on transverse coordinates. Some
stable solutions of the deformed model are studied, which correspond to
membranes with the torus topology. In particular, it is found that apparently
distinct configurations of membranes, having different winding numbers, are
indistinguishable in the matrix model. Simultaneous introduction of both
$\b$-deformation and mass-deformation is also considered, and, in particular, a
situation is found in which the stable membrane configuration interpolates
between a torus and a sphere, depending on the values of the deformation
parameters.
