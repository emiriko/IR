We show an analysis of multi-dimensional time series via entropy and
statistical linguistic techniques. We define three markers encoding the
behavior of the series, after it has been translated into a multi-dimensional
symbolic sequence. The leading component and the trend of the series with
respect to a mobile window analysis result from the entropy analysis and label
the dynamical evolution of the series. The diversification formalizes the
differentiation in the use of recurrent patterns, from a Zipf law point of
view. These markers are the starting point of further analysis such as
classification or clustering of large database of multi-dimensional time
series, prediction of future behavior and attribution of new data. We also
present an application to economic data. We deal with measurements of money
investments of some business companies in advertising market for different
media sources.
