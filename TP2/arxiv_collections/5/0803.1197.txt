The gravitational Bohr radius (GBR) characterizes the size of a hypothetical
ground state hydrogen atom wherein the binding interaction between its nucleus
and its electronic structure is purely gravitational. The conventional
calculation of the GBR, based on the standard Newtonian gravitational coupling
constant, yields an astronomical size for the "gravitational atom". On the
other hand, a discrete fractal cosmological paradigm asserts that the
gravitational coupling constant that applies within Atomic Scale systems is
roughly 38 orders of magnitude larger than the conventional gravitational
constant. According to calculations based on predictions of this discrete
fractal paradigm, the value of the GBR is actually on the order of 2 pi times
the standard Bohr radius. Implications of this revised gravitational Bohr
radius are discussed.
