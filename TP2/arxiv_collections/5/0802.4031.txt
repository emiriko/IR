We present an analytical framework to study the escape rate from a metastable
state under the influence of two external multiplicative cross-correlated noise
processes. Starting from a phenomenological stationary Langevin description
with multiplicative noise processes, we have investigated the Kramers' theory
for activated rate processes in a nonequilibrium open system (one-dimensional
in nature) driven by two external cross-correlated noise processes which are
Gaussian, stationary and delta correlated. Based on the Fokker-Planck
description in phase space, we then derive the escape rate from a metastable
state in the moderate to large friction limit to study the effect of degree of
correlation on the same. By employing numerical simulation in the presence of
external cross-correlated additive and multiplicative noises we check the
validity of our analytical formalism for constant dissipation, which shows a
satisfactory agreement between both the approaches for the specific choice of
noise processes. It is evident both from analytical development and the
corresponding numerical simulation that the enhancement of rate is possible by
increasing the degree of correlation of the external fluctuations.
