We discuss two approaches that are used frequently to describe
quantum-classical hybrid system. One is the well-known mean-field theory and
the other adopts a set of hybrid brackets which is a mixture of quantum
commutators and classical Poisson brackets. We prove that these two approaches
are equivalent.
