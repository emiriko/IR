We study by Quantum Monte Carlo simulations the local superfluid response of
small (up to 27 molecules) parahydrogen clusters, down to temperatures as low
as 0.05 K. We show that at low temperature superfluidity is not confined at the
surface of the clusters, as recently claimed by Khairallah et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 98, 183401 (2007)]. Rather, even clusters with a pronounced shell
structure are essentially uniformly superfluid. Superfluidity occurs as a
result of long exchange cycles involving all molecules.
