We investigate the determination of the pole associated to $\sigma$ from
$\pi\pi$ scattering data below the $K\bar{K}$ threshold, including the new
precise data from $K_{e4}$ decay reported recently by the NA48/2 Collaboration.
Using a large class of analytic parametrizations based on expansions in powers
of conformal variables, we obtain for the mass and width of $\sigma$ values
which are consistent with those calculated recently using ChPT and Roy
equations, but have larger theoretical uncertainties.
