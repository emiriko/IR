We have measured the magnetoresistance of a dc superconducting quantum
interference device in the form of an interrupted mesoscopic normal-metal loop
in contact with two superconducting electrodes. Below the transition
temperature of the superconducting electrodes, large $h/2e$ periodic
magnetoresistance oscillations are observed. By adding a small dc bias to the
ac measurement current, $h/4e$ oscillations can be produced. Lowering the
temperature further leads to even larger oscillations, and eventually to sharp
switching from the superconducting state to the normal state. This
flux-dependent resistance could be utilized to make highly sensitive flux
detector.
