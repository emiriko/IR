A search for mixing in the neutral D meson system has been performed using
semileptonic D0 -> K(*)- e+ \nu and D0 -> K(*)- \mu+ \nu decays. Neutral D
mesons from D*+ -> D0 \pi_s^+ decays are used and the flavor at production is
tagged by the charge of the slow pion. The measurement is performed using 492
fb^-1 of data recorded by the Belle detector. From the yield of right-sign and
wrong-sign decays arising from non-mixed and mixed events, respectively, we
measure the ratio of the time-integrated mixing rate to the unmixed rate to be
R_M = (1.3 +- 2.2 +- 2.0) x 10^-4. This corresponds to an upper limit of R_M <
6.1 x 10^-4 at the 90% C.L.
