The impact of radiofrequency (rf) currents on the direct current (dc) driven
switching dynamics in current-perpendicular-to-plane nanoscale spin valves is
demonstrated. The rf currents dramatically alter the dc driven free layer
magnetization reversal dynamics as well as the dc switching level. This occurs
when the frequency of the rf current is tuned to a frequency range around the
dc driven magnetization precession frequencies. For these frequencies,
interactions between the dc driven precession and the injected rf induce
frequency locking and frequency pulling effects that lead to a measurable
dependence of the critical switching current on the frequency of the injected
rf. Based on macrospin simulations, including dc as well as rf spin torque
currents, we explain the origin of the observed effects.
