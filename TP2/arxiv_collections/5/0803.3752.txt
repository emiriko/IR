We examine the possibility to extract information about the DN and DbarN
interactions from the pbar d to D Dbar N reaction. We utilize the notion that
the open-charm mesons are first produced in the annihilation of the antiproton
on one nucleon in the deuteron and subsequently rescatter on the other (the
spectator) nucleon. The latter process is then exploited for investigating the
DN and DbarN interactions. We study different methods for isolating the
contributions from the D^0p and D^-p rescattering terms.
