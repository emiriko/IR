We define the complexity of DNA sequences as the information content per
nucleotide, calculated by means of some Lempel-Ziv data compression algorithm.
It is possible to use the statistics of the complexity values of the functional
regions of different complete genomes to distinguish among genomes of different
domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya). We shall focus on the
distribution function of the complexity of noncoding regions. We show that the
three domains may be plotted in separate regions within the two-dimensional
space where the axes are the skewness coefficient and the curtosis coefficient
of the aforementioned distribution. Preliminary results on 15 genomes are
introduced.
