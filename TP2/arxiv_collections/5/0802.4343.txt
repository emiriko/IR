One of the most promising candidate ground states for the quantum
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the Kagome lattice is the valence bond
solid (VBS) with a 36-site unit cell. We present a theory of triplet excitation
spectra about this ground state using bond operator formalism. In particular we
obtain dispersions of all 18 triplet modes in the reduced Brillouin zone. In
the bond operator mean-field theory, it is found that a large number of triplet
modes are non-dispersive. In particular, the lowest triplet excitation is
non-dispersive and degenerate with a dispersive mode at the zone center. Away
from the zone center, the lowest triplet is separated from two other flat modes
by a small energy gap. Quantum fluctuations are considered by taking into
account scattering processes of two triplets and their bound state formation,
which leads to a downward renormalization of the lowest spin triplet gap. The
dispersion of the lowest triplet excitation in the VBS state is compared with
the dispersive lower bound of the triplet continuum expected in competing spin
liquid phases. Implications to future neutron scattering experiments are
discussed.
