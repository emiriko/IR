In this article we aim to estimate the bounds on the noncommutative scale
$\Lambda_{NC}$ and to extract the 95% exclusion contours for some
$\theta_{\mu\nu}$ components using the recent measurements of the top quark
width and the $W$ boson polarization in top pair events from CDF experiment at
Tevatron.
