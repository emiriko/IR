The intricate biochemical processes underlying avian magnetoreception, the
sensory ability of migratory birds to navigate using earths magnetic field,
have been narrowed down to spin-dependent recombination of radical-ion pairs to
be found in avian species retinal proteins. The avian magnetic field detection
is governed by the interplay between magnetic interactions of the radicals
unpaired electrons and the radicals recombination dynamics. Critical to this
mechanism is the long lifetime of the radical-pair spin coherence, so that the
weak geomagnetic field will have a chance to signal its presence. It is here
shown that a fundamental quantum phenomenon, the quantum Zeno effect, is at the
basis of the radical-ion-pair magnetoreception mechanism. The quantum Zeno
effect naturally leads to long spin coherence lifetimes, without any
constraints on the systems physical parameters, ensuring the robustness of this
sensory mechanism. Basic experimental observations regarding avian magnetic
sensitivity are seamlessly derived. These include the magnetic sensitivity
functional window and the heading error of oriented bird ensembles, which so
far evaded theoretical justification. The findings presented here could be
highly relevant to similar mechanisms at work in photosynthetic reactions. They
also trigger fundamental questions about the evolutionary mechanisms that
enabled avian species to make optimal use of quantum measurement laws.
