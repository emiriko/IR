The exciton-exciton interaction is investigated for quasi-two-dimensional
quantum structures. A bosonization scheme is applied including the full spin
structure. For generating the effective interaction potentials, the
Hartree-Fock and Heitler-London approaches are improved by a full two-exciton
calculation which includes the van der Waals effect. With these potentials the
biexciton formation in bilayer systems is investigated. For coupled quantum
wells the two-body scattering matrix is calculated and employed to give a
modified relation between exciton density and blue shift. Such a relation is of
central importance for gauging exciton densities in experiments which pave the
way toward Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons.
