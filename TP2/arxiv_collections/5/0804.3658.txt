Traditional models of macroeconomic dynamics are fundamentally incorrect. The
reason lies in a misunderstanding of peculiarities of the analysis of
infinitesimal quantities. However, even those types of solutions that are
envisaged by the above-mentioned models are nonrepresentative in the sense of
the reflection of realities. It became obvious that the techniques of the
theory of linear differential equations were insufficient here. Accordingly,
the scientists' attention switched to the theory of nonlinear differential
equations. At the same time, balance and, accordingly, the model with matrix
properties are objectively inherent in the economic system. For the reduction
of this model to a differential form, there exist rather elementary means that
proved to be unclaimed. Macroeconomic rhetoric - the power of the accelerator,
a lag on the part of demand, etc. - accompanied by the use of a lot of abstract
coefficients prevailed. However, there is no organic interrelation between
matrix and nonlinear differential equations. On the contrary, it can be said
that linear theory of integral equations originated in matrix analysis. The
Fredholm linear integral equation of the second kind with a parameter-dependent
kernel proves to be rather representative with regard to the class of possible
solutions. It seems that it can be used for the description of any zigzags of
the economy. The price one has to pay for this is the nontriviality of existing
theory.
