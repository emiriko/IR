We analyze some unphysical features of the geodesic approach to matter
coupling in a compactified Kaluza-Klein scenario, like the q/m puzzle and the
huge massive modes. We propose a new approach, based on Papapetrou multipole
expansion, that provides a new equation for the motion of a test particle. We
show how this equation provides right couplings and does not generate huge
massive modes.
