A novel scheme is presented for fault-tolerant quantum computation based on
the cluster model. Some relevant logical cluster states are constructed in
concatenation by post-selection through verification, without necessity of
recovery operation, where a suitable code such as the Steane's 7-qubit code is
adopted for transversal operations. This simple concatenated construction of
verified cluster states achieves a high noise threshold ~1%, and restrains the
divergence of resources.
