Recent experiments [1],[2] which measured the spectrum of the Goldstone
collective mode of coherently precessing state in 3He-B are discussed using the
presentation of the coherent spin precession in terms of the Bose-Einstein
condensation of magnons. The mass in the spectrum of the Goldstone boson --
phonon in the superfluid magnon liquid -- is induced by the symmetry breaking
field, which is played by the RF magnetic field
