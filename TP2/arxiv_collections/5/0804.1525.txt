We investigate the entanglement properties of a three--parameter family of
states that are part of the magic simplex of two qutrits, which is a simplex of
states that are mixtures of maximally entangled two--qutrit Bell states. Using
entanglement witnesses we reveal large regions of bound entangled and separable
states.
