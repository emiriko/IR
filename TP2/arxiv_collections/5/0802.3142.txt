This work concerns estimation of multidimensional nonlinear regression models
using multilayer perceptron (MLP). The main problem with such model is that we
have to know the covariance matrix of the noise to get optimal estimator.
however we show that, if we choose as cost function the logarithm of the
determinant of the empirical error covariance matrix, we get an asymptotically
optimal estimator.
