We examine analytically the ghost propagator Dyson-Schwinger Equation (DSE)
in the deep IR regime and prove that a finite ghost dressing function at
vanishing momentum is an alternative solution (solution II) to the usually
assumed divergent one (solution I). We furthermore find that the Slavnov-Taylor
identities discriminate between these two classes of solutions and strongly
support the solution II. The latter turns out to be also preferred by lattice
simulations within numerical uncertainties.
