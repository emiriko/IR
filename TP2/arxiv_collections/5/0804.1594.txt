We study the influence of spin exchange interaction of impurity scattering on
critical temperature of anisotropic impure superconductors. The model of random
nonmagnetic and magnetic impurity are revised to cover the effect of spin
exchange interaction . The sign of magnitude of the second-order Born
scattering have been changed after consideration the spin exchange interaction
effect that also effect to form of Tc equation. We can get the general Tc
equation that can be described anisotropic impure superconductors well and
cover all model done before.
