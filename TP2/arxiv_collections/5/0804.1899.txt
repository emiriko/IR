It is shown that in static and spherically symmetric configurations of the
system of Maxwell field coupled to 3D gravity with torsion, at least one of the
Maxwell field components has to vanish. Restricting our attention to the
electric sector of the theory, we find an interesting exact solution,
corresponding to the azimuthal electric field. Its geometric structure is to a
large extent influenced by the values of two different central charges,
associated to the asymptotic AdS structure of spacetime.
