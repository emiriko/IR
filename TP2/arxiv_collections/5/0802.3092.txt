The preamplifier is a critical component of gyrometer's electronics. Indeed
the resolution of the sensor is limited by its signal to noise ratio, and the
gyrometer's thermal stability is limited by its gain drift. In this paper, five
different kinds of preamplifiers are presented and compared. Finally, the
design of an integrated preamplifier is shown in order to increase the gain
stability while reducing its noise and size.
