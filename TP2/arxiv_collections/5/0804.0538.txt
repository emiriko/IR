Solid isotopic helium mixtures have been studied by path-integral Monte Carlo
simulations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. This method allowed us to
study the molar volume as a function of temperature, pressure, and isotopic
composition. At 25 K and 0.2 GPa, the relative difference between molar volumes
of isotopically-pure crystals of 3He and 4He is found to be about 3%. This
difference decreases under pressure, and for 12 GPa it is smaller than 1%. For
isotopically-mixed crystals, a linear relation between lattice parameters and
concentrations of helium isotopes is found, in agreement with Vegard's law. The
virtual crystal approximation, valid for isotopic mixtures of heavier atoms,
does not give reliable results for solid solutions of helium isotopes.
