Intelligent agents offer a new and exciting way of understanding the world of
work. In this paper we apply agent-based modeling and simulation to investigate
a set of problems in a retail context. Specifically, we are working to
understand the relationship between human resource management practices and
retail productivity. Despite the fact we are working within a relatively novel
and complex domain, it is clear that intelligent agents could offer potential
for fostering sustainable organizational capabilities in the future. The
project is still at an early stage. So far we have conducted a case study in a
UK department store to collect data and capture impressions about operations
and actors within departments. Furthermore, based on our case study we have
built and tested our first version of a retail branch simulator which we will
present in this paper.
