The coexistence of superfluid and Mott insulator, due to the quadratic
confinement potential in current optical lattice experiments, makes the
accurate detection of the superfluid-Mott transition difficult. Studying
alternative trapping potentials which are experimentally realizable and have a
flatter center, we find that the transition can be better resolved, but at the
cost of a more difficult tuning of the particle filling. When mapping out the
phase diagram using local probes and the local density approximation we find
that the smoother gradient of the parabolic trap is advantageous.
