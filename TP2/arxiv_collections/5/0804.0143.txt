A computational model of the construction of word meaning through exposure to
texts is built in order to simulate the effects of co-occurrence values on word
semantic similarities, paragraph by paragraph. Semantic similarity is here
viewed as association. It turns out that the similarity between two words W1
and W2 strongly increases with a co-occurrence, decreases with the occurrence
of W1 without W2 or W2 without W1, and slightly increases with high-order
co-occurrences. Therefore, operationalizing similarity as a frequency of
co-occurrence probably introduces a bias: first, there are cases in which there
is similarity without co-occurrence and, second, the frequency of co-occurrence
overestimates similarity.
