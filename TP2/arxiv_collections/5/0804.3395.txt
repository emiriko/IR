We study the interplay between the spin-liquid and Kondo physics, as related
to the non-magnetic part of the phase diagram of heavy fermion materials.
Within the unrestricted mean-field treatment of the infinite-$U$ 2D
Anderson-Heisenberg model, we find that there are two topologically distinct
non-degenerate uniform heavy Fermi liquid states that may form as a consequence
of the Kondo coupling between spinons and conduction electrons. For certain
carrier concentrations the uniform Fermi liquid becomes unstable with respect
to formation of a new kind of anharmonic "Kondo stripe" state with
inhomogeneous Kondo screening strength and the charge density modulation. These
feature are experimentally measurable, and thus may help to establish the
relevance of the spin-liquid correlations to heavy fermion materials.
