Let A be an asymptotic basis for N_0 of some order. By an essentiality of A
one means a subset P such that A\P is no longer an asymptotic basis of any
order and such that P is minimal among all subsets of A with this property. A
finite essentiality of A is called an essential subset. In a recent paper,
Deschamps and Farhi asked the following two questions : (i) does every
asymptotic basis of N_0 possess some essentiality ? (ii) is the number of
essential subsets of size at most k of an asymptotic basis of order h bounded
by a function of k and h only (they showed the number is always finite) ? We
answer the latter question in the affirmative, and the former in the negative
by means of an explicit construction, for every integer h >= 2, of an
asymptotic basis of order h with no essentialities.
