We write down a maximally supersymmetric one parameter deformation of the
field theory action of Bagger and Lambert. We show that this theory on RxT^2 is
invariant under the superalgebra of the maximally supersymmetric Type IIB plane
wave. It is argued that this theory holographically describes the Type IIB
plane wave in the discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ).
