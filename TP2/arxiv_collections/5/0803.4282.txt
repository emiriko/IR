In this paper we compare two classical one-factor diffusion models which are
used to model the term structure of interest rates. One of them is based on the
Wiener-Bachelier process while the second one is based on the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We show essential differences between the prices of
European call options on a zero-coupon bond in these models.
