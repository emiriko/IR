We construct a consistent supersymmetric action for brane chiral and vector
multiplets in a six-dimensional chiral gauged supergravity. A nonzero brane
tension can be accommodated by allowing for a brane-localized Fayet-Iliopoulos
term proportional to the brane tension. When the brane chiral multiplet is
charged under the bulk U(1)_R, we obtain a nontrivial coupling to the extra
component of the U(1)_R gauge field strength as well as a singular scalar
self-interaction term. Dimensionally reducing to 4D on a football
supersymmetric solution, we discuss the implication of such interactions for
obtaining the U(1)_R D-term in the 4D effective supergravity. By assuming the
bulk gaugino condensates and nonzero brane F- and/or D-term for the uplifting
potential, we have all the moduli stabilized with a vanishing cosmological
constant. The brane scalar with nonzero R charge then gets a soft mass of order
the gravitino mass. The overall sign of the soft mass squared depends on the
sign of the R charge as well as whether the brane F- or D-term dominates.
