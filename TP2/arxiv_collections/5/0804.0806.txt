We examine a proposal by Sherson and Moelmer to generate
polarization-squeezed light in terms of the quantum stochastic calculus (QSC).
We investigate the statistics of the output field and confirm their results
using the QSC formalism. In addition, we study the atomic dynamics of the
system and find that this setup can produce up to 3 dB of atomic spin
squeezing.
