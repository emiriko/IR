We describe SAFIUS, a secure accountable file system that resides over an
untrusted storage. SAFIUS provides strong security guarantees like
confidentiality, integrity, prevention from rollback attacks, and
accountability. SAFIUS also enables read/write sharing of data and provides the
standard UNIX-like interface for applications. To achieve accountability with
good performance, it uses asynchronous signatures; to reduce the space required
for storing these signatures, a novel signature pruning mechanism is used.
SAFIUS has been implemented on a GNU/Linux based system modifying OpenGFS.
Preliminary performance studies show that SAFIUS has a tolerable overhead for
providing secure storage: while it has an overhead of about 50% of OpenGFS in
data intensive workloads (due to the overhead of performing
encryption/decryption in software), it is comparable (or better in some cases)
to OpenGFS in metadata intensive workloads.
