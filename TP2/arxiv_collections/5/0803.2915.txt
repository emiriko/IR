The atomic electric dipole moment (EDM) currently searched by a number of
experimental groups requires that both parity and time-reversal invariance be
violated. According to current theoretical understanding, the EDM is induced by
the nuclear Schiff moment. The enhancement of the Schiff moment by the
combination of static quadrupole and octupole deformation was predicted
earlier. Here we study a further idea of the possible enhancement in the
absence of static deformation but in a nuclear system with soft collective
vibrations of two types. Both analytical approximation and numerical solution
of the simplified problem confirm the presence of the enhancement. We discuss
related aspects of nuclear structure which should be studied beyond mean-field
and random phase approximations.
