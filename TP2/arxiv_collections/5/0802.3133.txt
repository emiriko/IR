The antisymmetrised two-electron functions are constructed for the point
group T$_{h}$, i.e. the symmetry group of unconventional superconductor PrOs$%
_{4}$Sb$_{14}$., and its subgroup D$_{2h}$.The nodal structure of these
function depending on the wavevector group is investigated. Theoretical nodal
structure of these functions made possible to explain the experimental nodal
structure PrOs$_{4}$Sb$_{14}$. as a result of time-reversal symmetry violation.
