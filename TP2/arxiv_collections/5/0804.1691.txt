Using a proposed generalization of the pair distribution function for a gas
of non-interacting particles obeying fractional exclusion statistics in
arbitrary dimensionality, we derive the statistical correlations in the
asymptotic limit of vanishing or low temperature. While Friedel-like
oscillations are present in nearly all non-bosonic cases at T=0, they are
characterized by exponential damping at low temperature. We discuss the
dependence of these features on dimensionality and on the value of the
statistical parameter alpha.
