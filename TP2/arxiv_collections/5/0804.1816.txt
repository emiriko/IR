The surface evolution model based on geometric partial differential equation
is used to numerically study the kinetics of dewetting and dynamic morphologies
for the localized pinhole defect in the surface of the ultrathin solid film
with the strongly anisotropic surface energy. Depending on parameters such as
the initial depth and width of the pinole, the strength of the attractive
substrate potential and the strength of the surface energy anisotropy, the
pinhole may either extend to the substrate and thus rupture the film, or evolve
to the quasiequilibrium shape while the rest of the film surface undergoes
phase separation into a hill-and-valley structure followed by coarsening.
Overhanging (non-graph) morphologies are possible for deep, narrow (slit-like)
pinholes.
