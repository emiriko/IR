The results of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity (rho), and
heat capacity measurements as a function of temperature are reported for the
alloys, Ce2Rh(1-x)Co(x)Si3, crystallizing in an AlB2-derived hexagonal
strcture. Ce2RhSi3 exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at 7 K. The Neel
temperature decreases gradually with the increase in Co concentration. For x
greater than 0.6, no magnetic ordering is observed down to 0.5 K.
Interestingly, the x= 0.6 alloy exhibits signatutes of non-Fermi liquid
behavior, while the Co end member is a Fermi liquid. Thus, a transformation of
magnetic ordering state to non-magnetism via non-Fermiliquid state by
isoelectronic chemical doping is evident in this solid solution. The electrical
resistivity data for x= 0.2 and 0.3 alloys show an upturn at respective Neel
temperatures, establishing the formation of a magnetism-induced pseudo-gap for
these intermediate compositions alone as though there is a gradual Fermi
surface transformation as the quantum critical point is approached.
