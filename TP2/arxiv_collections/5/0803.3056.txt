The static and dynamic magnetic properties of the Nd$_3$Ga$_5$SiO$_{14}$
compound, which appears as the first materialization of a rare-earth
kagome-type lattice, were re-examined, owing to contradictory results in the
previous studies. Neutron scattering, magnetization and specific heat
measurements were performed and analyzed, in particular by fully taking account
of the crystal electric field effects on the Nd$^{3+}$ ions. One of the novel
findings is that the peculiar temperature independent spin dynamics observed
below 10 K expresses single-ion quantum processes. This would short-circuit the
frustration induced cooperative dynamics, which would emerge only at very low
temperature.
