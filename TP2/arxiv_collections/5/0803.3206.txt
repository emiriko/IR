We explore the role of Mo in Fe:Mo nanocatalyst thermodynamics for
low-temperature chemical vapor deposition growth of single walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs). By using the size-pressure approximation and ab initio
modeling, we prove that for both Fe-rich (~80% Fe or more) and Mo-rich (~50% Mo
or more) Fe:Mo clusters, the presence of carbon in the cluster causes
nucleation of Mo2C. This enhances the activity of the particle since it
releases Fe, which is initially bound in a stable Fe:Mo phase, so that it can
catalyze SWCNT growth. Furthermore, the presence of small concentrations of Mo
reduce the lower size limit of low-temperature steady-state growth from ~0.58nm
for pure Fe particles to ~0.52nm. Our ab initio-thermodynamic modeling explains
experimental results and establishes a new direction to search for better
catalysts.
