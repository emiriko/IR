The ground-state properties of the recent reported proton emitter 145Tm have
been studied within the axially or triaxially deformed relativistic mean field
(RMF) approaches, in which the pairing correlation is taken into account by the
BCS-method with a constant pairing gap. It is found that triaxiality and
pairing correlations play important roles in reproducing the experimental one
proton separation energy. The single-particle level, the proton emission orbit,
the deformation parameters beta = 0.22 and gamma = 28.98 and the corresponding
spectroscopic factor for 145Tm in the triaxial RMF calculation are given as
well.
