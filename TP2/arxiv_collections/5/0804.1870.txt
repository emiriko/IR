A prescription for obtaining supergravity solutions for planar (p,q)-string
networks is presented, based on earlier results. It shows that networks may be
looked upon as tropical curves emerging as the spine of the amoeba of a
holomorphic curve in M-theory. The Kaehler potential of supergravity is
identified with the corresponding Ronkin function. Implications of this
identification in counting dyons is discussed.
