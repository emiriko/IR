Typical arguments against scientific misconduct generally fail to support
current policies on research fraud: they may not prove wrong what is usually
considered research misconduct and they tend to make wrong things that are not
normally seen as scientific fraud, in particular honest errors. I also point
out that sanctions are not consistent with the reasons why scientific fraud is
supposed to be wrong either. Moreover honestly seeking truth should not be
contrived as a moral rule -- it is instead a necessary condition for work to
qualify as scientific.
