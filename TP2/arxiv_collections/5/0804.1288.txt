The EtabFDC is a matrix-element event generator package for $\eta_b$
hadroproduction at LHC. It generates $pp\to\eta_b X$ events for all possible
parton-level $2\to2$ leading-order processes with three commonly used $\eta_b$
decay channels being implemented. The \pythia interface is used for
parton-shower and hadronization to obtain the hadronic events. The FORTRAN
codes of this package are generated by FDC (Feynman Diagram Calculation) system
automatically.
