The mutual influence of dynamics and structure is a central issue in complex
systems. In this paper we study by simulation slow evolution of network under
the feedback of a local-majority-rule opinion process. If performance-enhancing
local mutations have higher chances of getting integrated into its structure,
the system can evolve into a highly heterogeneous small-world with a global hub
(whose connectivity is proportional to the network size), strong local
connection correlations and power law-like degree distribution. Networks with
better dynamical performance are achieved if structural evolution occurs much
slower than the network dynamics. Structural heterogeneity of many biological
and social dynamical systems may also be driven by various dynamics-structure
coupling mechanisms.
