Parton equilibration studies for thermally equilibrated but chemically
non-equilibrated quark-gluon-plasma (QGP), likely to be formed at the
relativistic colliders at BNL and CERN is presented.Parton equilibration is
studied enforcing baryon number conservation. Process like quark-flavor
interchanging is also taken into consideration.The degree of equilibration is
studied comparatively for the various reactions/ constraints that are being
considered.
