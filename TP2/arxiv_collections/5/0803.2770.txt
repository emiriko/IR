Two new relative entropy quantities, called the min- and max-relative
entropies, are introduced and their properties are investigated. The well-known
min- and max- entropies, introduced by Renner, are obtained from these. We
define a new entanglement monotone, which we refer to as the max-relative
entropy of entanglement, and which is an upper bound to the relative entropy of
entanglement. We also generalize the min- and max-relative entropies to obtain
smooth min- and max- relative entropies. These act as parent quantities for the
smooth Renyi entropies, and allow us to define the analogues of the mutual
information, in the Smooth Renyi Entropy framework. Further, the spectral
divergence rates of the Information Spectrum approach are shown to be obtained
from the smooth min- and max-relative entropies in the asymptotic limit.
