The states of a boson pair in a one-dimensional double-well potential are
investigated. Properties of the ground and lowest excited states of this system
are studied, including the two-particle wavefunction, momentum pair
distribution and entanglement. The effects of varying both the barrier height
and the effective interaction strength are investigated.
