We report on time-resolved photoluminescence from semiconductor microcavities
showing that an optically controllable mechanism exists to turn on and off
memory effects in a polariton system. By increasing the laser pumping pulse
intensity we observe revivals of the decaying time-resolved photoluminescence
signal, a manifestly non-Markovian behavior of the optically active polaritons.
Based on an open quantum system approach we perform a comprehensive analytical
and numerical study of the coupling of optically active polaritons to a
structured reservoir to confirm the origin of the observed features. Our
findings show that negative detunings and strong excitation should occur
simultaneously for memory effects to take place.
