Superconducting LaOFeAs family of even electron metallic systems have
striking resemblance to odd electron cuprates. We suggest that this resemblance
is caused by presence of two coupled 2D resonating valence bond systems in
LaOFeAs . Bond charge repulsion and Hund coupling fuse the 2 species of valence
bonds into closed strings with a Haldane gap, resulting in a quantum string
liquid. A pair of doped holes (electrons) creates an open string and remain at
the ends as holon(doublon). Charge -2e spin singlet strings condense to produce
high Tc superconductivity. Higher Tc's are likely in our string route to High
Tc superconductivity, when competing orders are taken care of.
