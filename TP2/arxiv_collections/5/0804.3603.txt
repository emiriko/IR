We study the field theoretical model of a real scalar field in presence of
spacial inhomogeneity in form of a finite width mirror (material layer). The
interaction of the scalar field with the defect is described with
position-dependent mass term. We calculate the propagator of the theory, the
Casimir energy and the pressure on the boundaries of the layer. We discuss the
renormalization procedure for the model in dimensional regularization.
