The influence of controlable parameters like temperature and wavelength on
the trajectories of light in a nematic liquid crystal with topological defects
is studied through a geometric model. The model incorporates phenomenological
details as how the refractive indices depend on such parameters. The deflection
of light by the topological defect is then shown to be greater at lower
temperatures and shorter wavelengths.
