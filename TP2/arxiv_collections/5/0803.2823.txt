Recent experimental advances have made it possible to study excited structure
in superheavy nuclei. The observed states have often been interpreted as
quasi-particle excitations. We show that in superheavy nuclei collective
vibrations systematically appear as low-energy excitation modes. By using the
microscopic Triaxial Projected Shell Model, we make a detailed prediction on
gamma-vibrational states and their E2 transition probabilities to the ground
state band in Fermium and Nobelium isotopes where active structure research is
going on, and in 270Ds, the heaviest isotope where decay data have been
obtained for the ground-state and for an isomeric state.
