In this work we show that for a quasi-2D system of size $\Omega$ and
thickness $t$ the resistance goes as $(2\rho/\pi t)\ln(\Omega/W)$, diverging
logarithmically with the size. Measurements in highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite (HOPG) as well as numerical simulations confirm this relation.
Furthermore, we present an experimental method that allows us to obtain the
carriers mean free path $l(T)$, the Fermi wavelength $\lambda(T)$ and the
mobility $\mu(T)$ directly from experiments without adjustable parameters.
Measuring the electrical resistance through microfabricated constrictions in
HOPG and observing the transition from ohmic to ballistic regime we obtain that
$0.2 \mu$m $\lesssim l \lesssim 10 \mu$m, $0.1 \mu$m $\lesssim \lambda \lesssim
2 \mu$m and a mobility $5 \times 10^4$ cm$^2$/Vs $ \lesssim \mu \lesssim 4
\times 10^7$ cm$^2$/Vs when the temperature decreases from 270K to 3K. A
comparison of these results with those from literature indicates that
conventional, multiband Boltzmann-Drude approaches are inadequate for oriented
graphite. The upper value obtained for the mobility is much larger than the
mobility graphene samples of micrometer size can have.
