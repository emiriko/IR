Let $G$ be a finitely generated polyfree group. If $G$ has nonzero Euler
characteristic then we show that $Aut(G)$ has a finite index subgroup in which
every automorphism has infinite Reidemeister number. For certain $G$ of length
2, we show that the number of Reidemeister classes of every automorphism is
infinite.
