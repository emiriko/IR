We compute the complete supersymmetric next-to-leading order corrections to
the production of a light Higgs boson in weak boson fusion. The size of the
electroweak corrections is of similar order as the next-to-leading order
corrections in the Standard Model. The supersymmetric QCD corrections turn out
to be significantly smaller than their electroweak counterparts. These
higher--order corrections are an important ingredient to a precision analysis
of the (supersymmetric) Higgs sector at the LHC, either as a known correction
factor or as a contribution to the theory error.
