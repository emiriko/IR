We address issues on the origin of gravity and the dark energy (or the
cosmological constant) from the perspectives of emergent gravity. We discuss
how the emergent gravity reveals a noble, radically different picture about the
origin of spacetime, which is crucial for a tenable solution of the
cosmological constant problem. In particular, the emergent gravity naturally
explains the dynamical origin of flat spacetime, which is absent in Einstein
gravity.
