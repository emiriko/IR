Room-temperature absorption spectroscopy of formaldehyde has been performed
in the 30140-30790cm^-1 range. Using tunable ultraviolet continuous-wave laser
light, individual rotational lines are well resolved in the Doppler-broadened
spectrum. Making use of genetic algorithms, the main features of the spectrum
are reproduced. Spectral data is made available as Supporting Information.
