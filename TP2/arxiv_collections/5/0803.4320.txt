We study dynamical decoupling in a multi-qubit setting, where it is combined
with quantum logic gates. This is illustrated in terms of computation using
Heisenberg interactions only, where global decoupling pulses commute with the
computation. We derive a rigorous error bound on the trace distance or fidelity
between the desired computational state and the actual time-evolved state, for
a system subject to coupling to a bounded-strength bath. The bound is expressed
in terms of the operator norm of the effective Hamiltonian generating the
evolution in the presence of decoupling and logic operations. We apply the
bound to the case of periodic pulse sequences and find that in order maintain a
constant trace distance or fidelity, the number of cycles -- at fixed pulse
interval and width -- scales in inverse proportion to the square of the number
of qubits. This sets a scalability limit on the protection of quantum
computation using periodic dynamical decoupling.
