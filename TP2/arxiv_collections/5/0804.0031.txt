While a set of covariance matrices corresponding to different populations are
unlikely to be exactly equal they can still exhibit a high degree of
similarity. For example, some pairs of variables may be positively correlated
across most groups, while the correlation between other pairs may be
consistently negative. In such cases much of the similarity across covariance
matrices can be described by similarities in their principal axes, the axes
defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrices. Estimating the degree
of across-population eigenvector heterogeneity can be helpful for a variety of
estimation tasks. Eigenvector matrices can be pooled to form a central set of
principal axes, and to the extent that the axes are similar, covariance
estimates for populations having small sample sizes can be stabilized by
shrinking their principal axes towards the across-population center. To this
end, this article develops a hierarchical model and estimation procedure for
pooling principal axes across several populations. The model for the
across-group heterogeneity is based on a matrix-valued antipodally symmetric
Bingham distribution that can flexibly describe notions of ``center'' and
``spread'' for a population of orthonormal matrices.
