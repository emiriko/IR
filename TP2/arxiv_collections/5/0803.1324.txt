We address the nature of the Mott transition in the Hubbard model at
half-filling using cluster Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). We compare
cluster DMFT results with those of single site DMFT. We show that inclusion of
the short range correlations on top of the on-site correlations, already
treated exactly in single site DMFT, do not change the nature of the transition
between the paramagnetic metal and the paramagnetic Mott insulator, which
remains first order. However, the short range correlations reduce substantially
the critical $U$ and modify the shape of transition lines. Moreover, they lead
to very different physical properties of the metallic and insulating phases
near the transition, in particular in the region of the phase diagram where the
two solutions coexist. Approaching the transition from the metallic side, we
find an anomalous metallic state with very low coherence scale at temperatures
as low as $T=0.01t$. The insulating state is characterized by the relatively
narrow Mott gap with pronounced peaks at the gap edge.
