The nonlinear turbulent interactions between acoustic gravity waves are
investigated using two dimensional nonlinear fluid simulations. The acoustic
gravity waves consist of velocity and density perturbations and propagate
across the density gradients in the vertical direction in the Earth's
atmosphere. We find that the coupled two component model exhibits generation of
large scale velocity potential flows along the vertical direction, while the
density perturbations relax towards an isotropic random distribution. The
characteristic turbulent spectrum associated with the system has a
Kolmogorov-like feature and tends to relax towards a $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum, where
$k$ is a typical wavenumber. The cross field diffusion associated with the
velocity potential grows linearly and saturates in the nonlinear phase.
