If G is a finitely generated group, and A an algebraic group, then Hom(G,A)
is a possibly reducible algebraic variety denoted by R_A(G). Here we define the
profile function, P_d(R_A(G)), of the representation variety of G over A to be
P_d(R_A(G))=(N_d(R_A(G)),...,N_0(R_A(G))), where N_i(R_A(G)) stands for the
number of irreducible components of R_A(G) of dimension i, where 0\leq i\leq d,
and d=Dim(R_A(G)). We then use this invariant in the study of fg groups and
prove various results. In particular, we show that if G an orientable surface
group of genus g\geq 1, then P_d(R_{SL(2,C)}(G))\neq P_d(R_{PSL(2,C)}(G)). We
also show that the same holds for G a torus knot group with presentation
<x,y;x^p=y^t> where both p,t are greater than 2, and that the same also holds
when G is a the fundamental group of a compact non-orientable surface of genus
g\geq 3. Further, we show that if a group G can be n+1 generated, and presented
by <x_1,...,x_n,y ; W=y^p>, where W is a non-trivial word in F_n=<x_1,...,x_n>,
and A=PSL(2, C), that then Dim(R_{A}(G)) is equal to Max{3n, Dim(R_{A}(G'))+2
\} \leq 3n+1, where G'=<x_1,...,x_n; W=1>. We also give a condition
guaranteeing that the resulting algebraic variety is reducible.
