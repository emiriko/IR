We aim to construct the optimal solutions to the undiscounted continuous-time
infinite horizon optimization problems, the objective functionals of which may
be unbounded. We identify the condition under which the limit of the solutions
to the finite horizon problems is optimal for the infinite horizon problems
under the overtaking criterion.
