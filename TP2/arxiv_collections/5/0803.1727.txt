The time evolution of pseudorapidity distributions of produced charged
hadrons in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV is investigated. Results of
a nonequilibrium-statistical Relativistic Diffusion Model with three sources
are compared with a macroscopic "bounce back" model that does not allow for
statistical equilibration at large times, but instead leads to motion reversal.
When compared to the data, the results of the diffusion approach are more
precise, thus emphasizing that the system is observed to be on its way to
thermal equilibrium.
