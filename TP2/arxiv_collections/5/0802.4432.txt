These are lecture notes for a course to be held. They provide a full
discussion of certain analytic aspects of the uniformisation theory of
(singular) holomorphic foliations by curves on compact Kaehler manifolds, with
emphasis on their consequences on positivity properties of the corresponding
canonical bundles.
