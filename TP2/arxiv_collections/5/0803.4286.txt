A new approach to high pressure magnetically-confined plasmas is necessary to
design efficient fusion devices. This paper presents an equilibrium combining
two solutions of the Grad-Shafranov equation, which describes the
magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium in toroidal geometry. The outer equilibrium is
paramagnetic and confines the inner equilibrium, whose strong diamagnetism
permits to balance large pressure gradients. The existence of both equilibria
in the same volume yields a dual equilibrium structure. Their combination also
improves free-boundary mode stability.
