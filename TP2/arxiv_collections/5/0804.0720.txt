Dispersive interactions of matter qubits with bright squeezed light in a
high-Q cavity is studied. Numerical simulation shows that higher fidelity of
operations to obtain a certain phase shift of the pulse through the dispersive
light-matter interaction may be reached using bright squeezed light than that
using bright coherent light.
