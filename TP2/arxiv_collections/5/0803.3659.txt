The fundamental theory and the semiclassical description of loop quantum
cosmology (LQC) have been studied in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker and Bianchi
I models. As an extension to include both anisotropy and intrinsic curvature,
this paper investigates the cosmological model of Kantowski-Sachs spacetime
with a free massless scalar field at the level of phenomenological dynamics
with the LQC discreteness corrections. The LQC corrections are implemented in
two different improved quantization schemes. In both schemes, the big bang and
big crunch singularities of the classical solution are resolved and replaced by
the big bounces when the area or volume scale factor approaches the critical
values in the Planck regime measured by the reference of the scalar field
momentum. Symmetries of scaling are also noted and suggest that the fundamental
spatial scale (area gap) may give rise to a temporal scale. The bouncing
scenarios are in an analogous fashion of the Bianchi I model, naturally
extending the observations obtained previously.
