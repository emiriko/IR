We introduce a simple, practical approach with probabilistic
information-theoretic security to mitigate one of quantum key distribution's
major limitations: the short maximum transmission distance (~200 km) possible
with present day technology. Our scheme uses classical secret sharing
techniques to allow secure transmission over long distances through a network
containing randomly-distributed compromised nodes. The protocol provides
arbitrarily high confidence in the security of the protocol, with modest
scaling of resource costs with improvement of the security parameter. Although
some types of failure are undetectable, users can take preemptive measures to
make the probability of such failures arbitrarily small.
