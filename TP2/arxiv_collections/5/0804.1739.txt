We examine the possibility that the superconductivity in the newly discovered
FeAs materials may be caused by the Coulomb interaction between d-electrons of
the iron atoms. We find that when the Hund's rule ferromagnetic interaction is
strong enough, the leading pairing instability is in spin-triplet p-wave
channel in the weak coupling limit. The resulting superconducting gap has nodal
lines on the 3D Fermi surfaces. The k dependent hybridization of several
orbitals around a Fermi pocket is the key for the appearance of the
spin-triplet p-wave pairing.
