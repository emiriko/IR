The quanta of electrical conductance is derived for a one-dimensional
electron gas both by making use of the quasi-classical motion of a quantum
fluid and by using arguments related to the uncertainty principle. The result
is extended to a nanowire of finite cross-section area and to electrons in
magnetic field, and the quantization of the electrical conductance is shown. An
additional application is made to the two-dimensional electron gas.
