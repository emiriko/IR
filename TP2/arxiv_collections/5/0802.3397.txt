We provide a simple and realistic model to study memory effects in a lossy
bosonic quantum channel over arbitrary number of uses. The noise correlation
among different uses is introduced by contiguous modes interactions which
results in an exponential decay of the correlations over channel uses (modes).
This model allows us to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the channel for
classical information transmission.
