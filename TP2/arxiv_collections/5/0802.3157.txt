In this talk, we review our recent work about the dynamical studies of
$Z^+(4430)$ and X(3872). $Z^+(4430)$ can not be explained as a $D_1'D^*$ or
$D_1D^*$ molecular state only considering one pion exchange potential without
the cutoff, which needs to be confirmed by introducing sigma exchange potential
and adding the cutoff in the effective potential. One also excludes the
possibility of X(3872) as a $DD^*$ molecular state by one pion and one sigma
exchanges with the cutoff. Fortunately there exists an S-wave $BB^*$ bound
state with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$. we suggest future experiment to search this state.
