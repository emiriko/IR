I discuss how the Large Hadron Collider era should broaden our view of
particle physics research, and apply this thinking to the case of Hidden
Worlds. I focus on one of the simplest representative cases of a Hidden World,
and detail the rich implications it has for LHC physics, including universal
suppression of Higgs boson production, trans-TeV heavy Higgs boson signatures,
heavy-to-light Higgs boson decays, weakly coupled exotic gauge bosons, and
Higgs boson decays to four fermions via light exotic gauge bosons. Some
signatures may be accessible in the very early stages of collider operation,
whereas others motivate a later high-lumonosity upgrade.
