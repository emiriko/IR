It has recently been suggested that at a reasonably large chemical potential
a confining quarkyonic matter is formed that consists of the quark Fermi sea
and confined hadrons on top of this Fermi sea. We study some properties of this
matter. It is demonstrated that below the chiral restoration point there are
gapless excitations of this matter through excitations of the Goldstone bosons.
Above the chiral restoration point the single quarks are still removed from the
spectrum of excitations and the only possible excitations are confined
color-singlet hadrons with finite mass. Hence there appears a gap in the
excitation spectrum of the quarkyonic matter that should be crucially important
for its properties above the chiral restoration point. This gap is of a new
type and is not related with the condensation of the fermionic system into a
quasibosonic system. It is only due to such properties as confinement and
manifest chiral symmetry at the same time.
