We present the second report of our systematic search for strongly lensed
quasars from the data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From extensive
follow-up observations of 136 candidate objects, we find 36 lenses in the full
sample of 77,429 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the SDSS Data Release
5. We then define a complete sample of 19 lenses, including 11 from our
previous search in the SDSS Data Release 3, from the sample of 36,287 quasars
with i<19.1 in the redshift range 0.6<z<2.2, where we require the lenses to
have image separations of 1"<\theta<20" and i-band magnitude differences
between the two images smaller than 1.25 mag. Among the 19 lensed quasars, 3
have quadruple-image configurations, while the remaining 16 show double images.
This lens sample constrains the cosmological constant to be
\Omega_\Lambda=0.84^{+0.06}_{-0.08}(stat.)^{+0.09}_{-0.07}(syst.) assuming a
flat universe, which is in good agreement with other cosmological observations.
We also report the discoveries of 7 binary quasars with separations ranging
from 1.1" to 16.6", which are identified in the course of our lens survey. This
study concludes the construction of our statistical lens sample in the full
SDSS-I data set.
