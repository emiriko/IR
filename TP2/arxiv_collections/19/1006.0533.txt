We present modeling approaches to explain mechanisms of control of uniformity
(narrow distribution) of sizes and shapes in synthesis of nanosize crystals and
micron-size colloids. We consider those situations when the nanocrystals are
formed by burst nucleation. The colloids are then self-assembled by aggregation
of nanocrystals. The coupled kinetic processes are both controlled by
diffusional transport, yielding well-defined colloid dispersions used in many
applications. We address aspects of modeling of particle structure selection,
ranging from nucleation to growth by aggregation and to mechanisms of emergence
of particle shapes.
