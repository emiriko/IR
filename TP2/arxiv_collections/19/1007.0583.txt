In this article we consider semigroups of transformations of cellular
automata which act on a fixed shift space. In particular, we are interested in
two properties of these semigroups which relate to "largeness". The first
property is ID and the other property is maximal commutativity (MC). A
semigroup has the ID property if the only infinite invariant closed set (with
respect to the semigroup action) is the entire space. We shall consider two
examples of semigroups: one is spanned by cellular automata transformations
that represent multiplications by integers on the one-dimensional torus and the
other one consists of all the cellular automata transformations which are
linear (when the symbols set is the ring of integers mod n). It will be shown
that the two properties of these semigroups depend on the number of symbols s.
The multiplication semigroup is ID and MC if and only if s is not a power of
prime. The linear semigroup over the mentioned ring is always MC but is ID if
and only if s is prime. When the symbol set is endowed with a finite field
structure (when possible) the linear semigroup is both ID and MC. In addition,
we associate with each semigroup which acts on a one sided shift space a
semigroup acting on a two sided shift space, and vice versa, in such a way that
preserves the ID and the MC properties.
