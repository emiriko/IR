We discuss the importance of observing supernova neutrinos. By analyzing the
SN1987A observations of Kamiokande-II, IMB and Baksan, we show that they
provide a 2.5{\sigma} support to the standard scenario for the explosion. We
discuss in this context the use of neutrinos as trigger for the search of the
gravity wave impulsive emission. We derive a bound on the neutrino mass using
the SN1987A data and argue, using simulated data, that a future galactic
supernova could probe the sub-eV region.
