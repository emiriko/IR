The vacuum fluctuations of all quantum fields filling the universe are
supposed to leave enormous energy and pressure contributions which are
incompatible with observations. It has been recently suggested that, when the
effective nature of quantum field theories is properly taken into account,
vacuum fluctuations behave as a relativistic gas rather than as a cosmological
constant. Accordingly, zero-point energies are tremendously diluted by the
universe expansion but provide an extra contribution to radiation energy.
Ongoing and future cosmological observations could offer the opportunity to
scrutinize this scenario. The presence of such additional contribution to
radiation energy can be tested by using primordial nucleosynthesis bounds or
measured on Cosmic Background Radiation anisotropy.
