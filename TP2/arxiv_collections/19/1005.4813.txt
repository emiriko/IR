We study the recently introduced ${\mathbb Z}_2$ pump consisting of a family
of one-dimensional bulk insulators with time reversal restriction on the
pumping cycle. We find that the scattering matrices of these pumps are
dichotomized by a topological index. We show that the class of pumps
characterized by a nontrivial topological index allows, in contrast to its
topologically trivial counterpart, for the noiseless pumping of quantized spin,
even in the absence of spin conservation. This distinction sheds light on the
${\mathbb Z}_2$ classification of two-dimensional time reversal invariant
insulators.
