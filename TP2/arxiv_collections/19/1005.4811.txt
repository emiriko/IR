We study thermodynamics of nuclear matter in a two-flavored parity doublet
model within the mean field approximation. Parameters of the model are chosen
to reproduce correctly the properties of the nuclear ground state. The model
predicts two phase transitions in nuclear matter, a liquid-gas phase transition
at normal nuclear density and a chiral transition at higher density. At finite
temperature the pion decay constant exhibits a considerable reduction at
intermediate values of chemical potential, which is traced back to the presence
of the liquid-gas transition, and approaches zero at higher chemical potential
associated with the chiral symmetry restoration. A "transition" from meson-rich
to baryon-rich matter is also discussed.
