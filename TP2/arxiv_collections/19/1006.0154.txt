We present and compare different numerical schemes for the integration of the
variational equations of autonomous Hamiltonian systems whose kinetic energy is
quadratic in the generalized momenta and whose potential is a function of the
generalized positions. We apply these techniques to Hamiltonian systems of
various degrees of freedom, and investigate their efficiency in accurately
reproducing well-known properties of chaos indicators like the Lyapunov
Characteristic Exponents (LCEs) and the Generalized Alignment Indices (GALIs).
We find that the best numerical performance is exhibited by the
\textit{`tangent map (TM) method'}, a scheme based on symplectic integration
techniques which proves to be optimal in speed and accuracy. According to this
method, a symplectic integrator is used to approximate the solution of the
Hamilton's equations of motion by the repeated action of a symplectic map $S$,
while the corresponding tangent map $TS$, is used for the integration of the
variational equations. A simple and systematic technique to construct $TS$ is
also presented.
