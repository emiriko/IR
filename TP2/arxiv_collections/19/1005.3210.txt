We report on an analysis of RXTE data of the transient neutron star low-mass
X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) XTE J1701-462, obtained during its 2006-2007 outburst.
The X-ray properties of the source changed between those of various types of
NS-LMXB subclasses. At high luminosities the source switched between two types
of Z source behavior and at low luminosities we observed a transition from Z
source to atoll source behavior. These transitions between subclasses primarily
manifest themselves as changes in the shapes of the tracks in X-ray color-color
and hardness-intensity diagrams, but they are accompanied by changes in the kHz
quasi-periodic oscillations, broad-band variability, burst behavior, and/or
X-ray spectra. We find that the low-energy X-ray flux is a good parameter to
track the gradual evolution of the tracks in color-color and hardness-intensity
diagrams, allowing us to resolve the evolution of the source in greater detail
than before and relate the observed properties to other NS-LMXBs. We further
find that during the transition from Z to atoll, characteristic behavior known
as the atoll upper banana can equivalently be described as the final stage of a
weakening Z source flaring branch, thereby blurring the line between the two
subclasses. Our findings strongly suggest that the wide variety in behavior
observed in NS-LXMBs with different luminosities can be linked through changes
in a single variable parameter, namely the mass accretion rate, without the
need for additional differences in the neutron star parameters or viewing
angle. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for the spectral
changes observed in NS LMXBs and suggest that, contrary to what is often
assumed, the position along the color-color tracks of Z sources is not
determined by the instantaneous mass accretion rate.
