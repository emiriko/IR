Let us consider a reference frame for which the pseudo-Euclidean geometry is
valid (prefered frame). The equations of Maxwell in empty space have a simple
form and are derived from a Lagrangian. In a medium magnetic permeability and
electric permittivity exist. The equations of Maxwell are also well-known in a
medium but they cannot be derived as in empty space. In addition to the
pseudo-Euclidean geometry a tensor of rank two is stated with which the proper
time in a medium is defined. The theory of Maxwell now follows along the lines
of the empty space. Reference frames which are uniformly moving with regard to
the prefered frame which have an anisotropic geometry are studied by many
authors and are called non-prefered reference frames. The equations of Maxwell
of a medium in a non-prefered reference frame are derived by the use of the
transformation formulae from the prefered to the non-prefered frame. A
Lagrangian for the equations of Maxwell of a medium similar to the one in empty
space is also given.
