We investigate the expressiveness of backward jumps in a framework of
formalized sequential programming called program algebra. We show that - if
expressiveness is measured in terms of the computability of partial Boolean
functions - then backward jumps are superfluous. If we, however, want to
prevent explosion of the length of programs, then backward jumps are essential.
