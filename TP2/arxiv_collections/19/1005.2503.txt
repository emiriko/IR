A feasible route towards implementing long-distance quantum key distribution
(QKD) systems relies on probabilistic schemes for entanglement distribution and
swapping as proposed in the work of Duan, Lukin, Cirac, and Zoller (DLCZ)
[Nature 414, 413 (2001)]. Here, we calculate the conditional throughput and
fidelity of entanglement for DLCZ quantum repeaters, by accounting for the DLCZ
self-purification property, in the presence of multiple excitations in the
ensemble memories as well as loss and other sources of inefficiency in the
channel and measurement modules. We then use our results to find the generation
rate of secure key bits for QKD systems that rely on DLCZ quantum repeaters. We
compare the key generation rate per logical memory employed in the two cases of
with and without a repeater node. We find the cross-over distance beyond which
the repeater system outperforms the non-repeater one. That provides us with the
optimum inter-node distancing in quantum repeater systems. We also find the
optimal excitation probability at which the QKD rate peaks. Such an optimum
probability, in most regimes of interest, is insensitive to the total distance.
