This paper presents a complex systems overview of a power grid network. In
recent years, concerns about the robustness of the power grid have grown
because of several cascading outages in different parts of the world. In this
paper, cascading effect has been simulated on three different networks, the
IEEE 300 bus test system, the IEEE 118 bus test system, and the WSCC 179 bus
equivalent model, using the DC Power Flow Model. Power Degradation has been
discussed as a measure to estimate the damage to the network, in terms of load
loss and node loss. A network generator has been developed to generate graphs
with characteristics similar to the IEEE standard networks and the generated
graphs are then compared with the standard networks to show the effect of
topology in determining the robustness of a power grid. Three mitigation
strategies, Homogeneous Load Reduction, Targeted Range-Based Load Reduction,
and Use of Distributed Renewable Sources in combination with Islanding, have
been suggested. The Homogeneous Load Reduction is the simplest to implement but
the Targeted Range-Based Load Reduction is the most effective strategy.
