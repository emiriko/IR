It follows from Bell's theorem and quantum mechanics that the detection of a
particle of an entangled pair can (somehow) "force" the other distant particle
of the pair into a well-defined state (which is equivalente to a reduction of
the state vector): no property previously shared by the particles can explain
the predicted correlations. This result has been corroborated by experiment.
However, it has not been experimantally proved-and it is far from obvious-that
the absence of detection, as in null-result (NR) experiments could have the
very same effect. In this paper a way to try to bridge this gap is suggested.
As already shown for the case of EPR correlations, if NR detections cannot
induce a reduction of the state vector, then faster-than-light (FTL)
communication becomes possible, at least in pr\'inciple. But it will be
demonstrated that-as entertained by Bohm-this does not necessarily lead to a
causal paradox, or to the rejection of the Lorentz transformations.
