In this paper we investigate how germs of real functions can change under
deformation. In particular we look at deformations of germs of isolated
singularities from R_n to R_k (n >= k) and the relation with there natural
stratification in some tame categorie (algebraic, analytic, semi-algebraic,
subanalytic, o-minimal straucture polynomially bounded). The word tame in this
paper will refer to one of these categories.
