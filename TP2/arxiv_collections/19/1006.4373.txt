Electrostatic control of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in an oxide
semiconductor could potentially impact the emerging field of oxide electronics.
Vanadium dioxide is of particular interest due to the fact that the MIT happens
in the vicinity of room temperature and it is considered to exhibit the Mott
transition. We present a detailed account of our experimental investigation
into three-terminal field effect transistor-like devices using thin film VO2 as
the channel layer. The gate is separated from the channel through an insulating
gate oxide layer, enabling true probing of the field effect with minimal or no
interference from large leakage currents flowing directly from the electrode.
The influence of the fabrication of multiple components of the device,
including the gate oxide deposition, on the VO2 film characteristics is
discussed. Further, we discuss the effect of the gate voltage on the device
response, point out some of the unusual characteristics including temporal
dependence. A reversible unipolar modulation of the channel resistance upon the
gate voltage is demonstrated for the first time in optimally engineered
devices. The results presented in this work are of relevance towards
interpreting gate voltage response in such oxides as well as addressing
challenges in advancing gate stack processing for oxide semiconductors.
