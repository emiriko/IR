We report on the comparison of production characteristics of secondary
protons and charged pions in the interactions of protons and charged pions with
momentum between 3 GeV/c and 15 GeV/c with beryllium, copper, and tantalum
nuclei, with simulations by the FLUKA and Geant4 Monte Carlo tool kits. Overall
production cross-sections are reasonably well reproduced, within factors of
two. In more detail, there are areas with poor agreement that are
unsatisfactory and call for modelling improvements. Overall, the current FLUKA
simulation fares better than the current Geant4 simulation.
