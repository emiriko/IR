We propose a procedure based on symplectic tomography for reconstructing the
unknown parameters of a convolutionless non-Markovian Gaussian noisy evolution.
Whenever the time-dependent master equation coefficients are given as a
function of some unknown time-independent parameters, we show that these
parameters can be reconstructed by means of a finite number of tomograms. Two
different approaches towards reconstruction, integral and differential, are
presented and applied to a benchmark model made of a harmonic oscillator
coupled to a bosonic bath. For this model the number of tomograms needed to
retrieve the unknown parameters is explicitly computed.
