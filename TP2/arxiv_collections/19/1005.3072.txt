The correction of errors is of fundamental importance for the development of
contemporary computing devices and of robust communication protocols. In this
paper we propose a scheme for the implementation of the three-qubit quantum
repetition code, exploiting the interaction of Rydberg atoms with the quantized
mode of a microwave cavity field. Quantum information is encoded within two
circular Rydberg states of the atoms and encoding and decoding process are
realized within two separate microwave cavities. We show that errors due to
phase noise fluctuations could be efficiently corrected using a
state-of-the-art apparatus.
