We report the detection of a large glitch in the pulsar B0919+06
(J0922+0638). The glitch occurred in 2009 November 5 (MJD 55140) and was
characterized by a fractional increase in the rotation frequency of
Deltanu/nu=1.3x10^{-6}. A large glitch happens in the pulsar whose rotation has
unstable character. We present the results of the analysis of the rotation
behavior of this pulsar over the 30-year time span from 1979 to 2009. These
results show that the pulsar's rotation frequency underwent continuous, slow
oscillations which look like glitch-like events. During the 1991-2009 interval,
the pulsar experienced a continuous sequence of 12 slow glitches with a
fractional increase in the rotation frequency Deltanu/nu=1.5x10^{-9}. All the
slow glitches observed have a similar signature related to a slow increase in
the rotation frequency during 200 days and the subsequent relaxation back to
the pre-glitch value during 400 days. We show that a continuous sequence of
such slow glitches is characterized by practically identical amplitudes equal
to Deltanu=3.5x10^{-9} Hz and identical time intervals between glitches of
about 600 days and is well described by a periodic sawtooth-like function. The
detection of two different phenomena, such as a large glitch and a sequence of
slow glitches, indicates the presence of two types of discontinuities in the
rotation frequency of the pulsar B0919+06. These discontinuities can be
classified as normal and slow glitches.
