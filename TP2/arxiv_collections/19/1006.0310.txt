A monopolist sells goods with possibly a characteristic consumers dislike
(for instance, he sells random goods to risk averse agents), which does not
affect the production costs. We investigate the question whether using
undesirable goods is profitable to the seller. We prove that in general this
may be the case, depending on the correlation between agents types and
aversion. This is due to screening effects that outperform this aversion. We
analyze, in a continuous framework, both 1D and multidimensional cases.
