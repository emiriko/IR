We apply relativistic configuration-interaction method coupled with many-body
perturbation theory (CI+MBPT) to describe low-energy dielectronic
recombination. We combine the CI+MBPT approach with the complex rotation method
(CRM) and compute the dielectronic recombination spectrum for Li-like carbon
recombining into Be-like carbon. We demonstrate the utility and evaluate the
accuracy of this newly-developed CI+MBPT+CRM approach by comparing our results
with the results of the previous high-precision study of the CIII system
[Mannervik et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 313 (1998)].
