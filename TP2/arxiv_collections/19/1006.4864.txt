We study the scaling exponents of a 1+1-dimensional directed polymer in a
Brownian random environment introduced by O'Connell and Yor. For a version of
the model with boundary conditions that are stationary in a space-time sense we
identify the exact values of the exponents. For the version without the
boundary conditions we get the conjectured upper bounds on the exponents.
