The usual procedures to extract effective refractive indices for
negative-index metamaterials are complicated by branching ambiguities in the
inverse cosine function. The existing methods to eliminate ambiguities either
involve calculations with varying geometries which are inherently flawed, as
metamaterial properties depend strongly on geometry, or are more subjective as
one must inspect and select branches to yield effec- tive parameters as a
continuous function of frequency. We propose that the Kramers-Kronig relations,
which hold for negative-index materials, naturally guide the selection of the
proper branches, and in fact predict negative refractive index where other
extraction procedures alone might not. The experimental realization of high
quality negative-index materials requires a robust and reliable index retrieval
procedure; the combined extraction/Kramers-Kronig retrieval can be used to
design optimal metama- terials in a simple, systemmatic, and general manner.
