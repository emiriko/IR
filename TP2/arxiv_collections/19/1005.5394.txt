We report a reduction of the frequency noise in coplanar waveguide
superconducting resonators. The reduction of 7 dB is achieved by removing the
exposed dielectric substrate surface from the region with high electric fields
and by using NbTiN. In a model-analysis the surface of NbTiN is found to be a
negligible source of noise, experimentally supported by a comparison with NbTiN
on SiOx resonators. The reduction is additive to decreasing the noise by
widening the resonators.
