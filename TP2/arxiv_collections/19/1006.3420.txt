We consider the R\'enyi entropies $S_n(\ell)$ in the one dimensional spin-1/2
Heisenberg XX chain in a magnetic field. The case n=1 corresponds to the von
Neumann ``entanglement'' entropy. Using a combination of methods based on the
generalized Fisher-Hartwig conjecture and a recurrence relation connected to
the Painlev\'e VI differential equation we obtain the asymptotic behaviour,
accurate to order ${\cal O}(\ell^{-3})$, of the R\'enyi entropies $S_n(\ell)$
for large block lengths $\ell$. For n=1,2,3,10 this constitutes the 3,6,10,48
leading terms respectively. The o(1) contributions are found to exhibit a rich
structure of oscillatory behaviour, which we analyze in some detail both for
finite $n$ and in the limit $n\to\infty$.
