Recent experiments shown that graphene epitaxially grown on Silicon Carbide
(SiC) can exhibit a energy gap of 0.26 eV, making it a promising material for
electronics. With an accurate model, we explore the design parameter space for
a fully ballistic graphene-on-SiC Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs), and
assess the DC and high frequency figures of merit. The steep subthreshold
behavior can enable I_{ON}/I_{OFF} ratios exceeding 10^4 even with a low supply
voltage of 0.15 V, for devices with gatelength down to 30 nm. Intrinsic
transistor delays smaller than 1 ps are obtained. These factors make the device
an interesting candidate for low-power nanoelectronics beyond CMOS.
