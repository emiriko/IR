AC Electroosmosis (ACEO) has many advantages such as low power consumption,
non-moving parts, and easy to integrate etc., so it is widely used for low
concentration microfluid manipulation in low frequency range. Classical ACEO
theory assumes that electric double layer (EDL) is the main cause of electric
field induced flow, and gives electric-flow field coupling equations for ACEO
flow rate. But the calculation data usually are tens times faster than the
experimental velocities. In this paper, electrode surface topography is
included to solve ACEO flow rate. With electrode surface roughness as the
characteristic parameter, equivalent EDL model is set up to modify the
classical EDL model. The relationship between flow rate and electrode surface
roughness is studied. Experiment results agree with the simulation very well,
proving the feasibility of equivalent EDL model.
