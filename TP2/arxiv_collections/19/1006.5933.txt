The point-contact (PC) spectra of the Andreev reflection dV/dI curves of the
superconducting rare-earth nickel borocarbide ErNi2B2C (Tc=11 K) have been
analyzed in the "one-gap" and "two-gap" approximations using the generalized
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (GBTK) model and the Beloborod'ko (BB) model allowing
for the pair-breaking effect of magnetic impurities. Experimental and
calculated curves have been compared not only in shape, but in magnitude as
well, which provide more reliable data for determining the temperature
dependence of the energy gap (or superconducting order parameter) \Delta(T).
The anisotropic effect of antiferromagnetic ordering at T_N =6 K on the
superconducting gap/order parameter has been determined: as the temperature is
lowered, \Delta(T) decreases by 25% in the c-direction and only by 4% in the
ab-plane. It is found that the pair-breaking parameter increases in the
vicinity of the magnetic transitions, the increase being more pronounced in the
c-direction. The efficiency of the models was tested for providing \Delta(T)
data for ErNi2B2C from Andreev reflection spectra.
