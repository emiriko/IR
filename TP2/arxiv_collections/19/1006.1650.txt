Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model yield exotic Higgs decays.
Some of these, particularly those in which the Higgs decays to light quarks or
gluons, can be very difficult to discover experimentally. Here we introduce a
new set of jet substructure techniques designed to search for such a Higgs when
its dominant decay is into gluons via light, uncolored resonances. We study
this scenario in both V+h and tt+h production channels, and find both channels
lead to discovery at the LHC with more than 5 sigma significance at 100 inverse
femtobarn.
