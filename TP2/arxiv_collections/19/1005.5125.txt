The IEEE 802.16 technology (WiMAX) is a promising technology for providing
last-mile connectivity by radio link due to its high speed data rates, low cost
of deployment, and large coverage area. However, the maximum number of channels
defined in the current system may cause a potential bottleneck and limit the
overall system capacity. The aim of this paper is to compare the impact on
system performance of different solutions used to mitigate the impairments due
to the radio channel. In particular, taking into account the WiMAX system
capacity as well as application delays, the paper presents the simulation
results obtained when a static QPSK 1/2 Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) is
adopted. Then, the study is aimed at evaluating the improvements introduced by
the adoption of an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and an AMC jointly with
Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ). Results indicate that the best strategy
is to use an aggressive AMC table with the HARQ.
