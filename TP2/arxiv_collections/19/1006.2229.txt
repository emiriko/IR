We study chaos dynamics of spinning particles in Kerr spacetime of rotating
black holes use the Papapetrou equations by numerical integration. Because of
spin, this system exists many chaos solutions, and exhibits some exceptional
dynamic character. We investigate the relations between the orbits chaos and
the spin magnitude S, pericenter, polar angle and Kerr rotation parameter a by
means of a kind of brand new Fast Lyapulov Indicator (FLI) which is defined in
general relativity. The classical definition of Lyapulov exponent (LE) perhaps
fails in curve spacetime. And we emphasize that the Poincar\'e sections cannot
be used to detect chaos for this case. Via calculations, some new interesting
conclusions are found: though chaos is easier to emerge with bigger S, but not
always depends on S monotonically; the Kerr parameter a has a contrary action
on the chaos occurrence. Furthermore, the spin of particles can destroy the
symmetry of the orbits about the equatorial plane. And for some special initial
conditions, the orbits have equilibrium points.
