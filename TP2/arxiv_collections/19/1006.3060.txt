We publish 16 Doppler imaging temperature maps for the years 1994-2002 of the
active RS CVn star II Peg. The six maps from 1999-2002 are based on previously
unpublished observations. Through Doppler imaging we want to study the spot
evolution of the star and in particular compare this with previous results
showing a cyclic spot behaviour and persistent active longitudes. The
observations were collected with the SOFIN spectrograph at the Nordic Optical
Telescope. The temperature maps were calculated using a Doppler imaging code
based on Tikhonov regularization. During 1994-2001, our results show a
consistent trend in the derived longitudes of the principal and secondary
temperature minima over time such that the magnetic structure appears to rotate
somewhat more rapidly than the orbital period of this close binary. A sudden
phase jump of the active region occured between the observing seasons of 2001
and 2002. No clear trend over time is detected in the derived latitudes of the
spots, indicating that the systematic motion could be related to the drift of
the spot generating mechanism rather than to differential rotation. The derived
temperature maps are quite similar to the ones obtained earlier with a
different methods, the main differences occurring in the spot latitudes and
relative strength of the spot structures. We observe both longitude and
latitude shifts in the spot activity of II Peg. However, our results are not
consistent with the periodic behaviour presented in previous studies.
