We present calculations for a magnetised hybrid wind model for Asymptotic
Giant Branch (AGB) stars. The model incorporates a canonical Weber-Davis (WD)
stellar wind with dust grains in the envelope of an AGB star. The resulting
hybrid picture preserves traits of both types of winds. It is seen that this
combination requires that the dust-parameter ($\Gamma_{d}$) be less than unity
in order to achieve an outflow. The emergence of critical points in the wind
changes the nature of the dust-driven outflow, simultaneously, the presence of
a dust condensation radius changes the morphology of the magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) solutions for the wind. In this context, we additionally investigate the
effect of having magnetic-cold spots on the equator of an AGB star and its
implications for dust formation; which are seen to be consistent with previous
findings.
