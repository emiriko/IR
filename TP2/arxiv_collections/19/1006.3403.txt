The Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager is an instrument, specially designed
for investigation of the wave processes in the Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere.
In order to determine the kinematics parameters of a wave, the values of a
physical quantity in different space points and their changes in the time
should be known. An approach for image processing of registered spectrograms is
proposed. A detailed description is made of the steps of this approach, related
to recovering CCD pixel values, influenced by cosmic particles, dark image
correction and filter parameters determination.
