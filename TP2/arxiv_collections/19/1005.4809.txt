Topological phase transitions can occur in the dissipative dynamics of a
quantum system when the ratio of matrix elements for competing transport
channels is varied. Here we establish a relation between such behavior in a
class of non-Hermitian quantum walk problems [M. S. Rudner and L. S. Levitov,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 065703 (2009)] and nuclear spin pumping in double quantum
dots, which is mediated by the decay of a spin-blockaded electron triplet state
in the presence of spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. The transition occurs
when the strength of spin-orbit coupling exceeds the strength of the net
hyperfine coupling, and results in the complete suppression of nuclear spin
pumping. Below the transition point, nuclear pumping is accompanied by a strong
reduction in current due to the presence of non-decaying "dark states" in this
regime. Due to its topological character, the transition is expected to be
robust against dephasing of the electronic degrees of freedom.
