The LSND and MiniBoone seeming anomalies in neutrino oscillations are usually
attributed to physics beyond the Standard model. It is, however, possible that
they may be an artefact of the theoretical treatment of particle oscillations
that ignores fine points of quantum measurement theory relevant to the
experiments. In this paper, we construct a rigorous measurement-theoretic
framework for the description of particle oscillations, employing no
assumptions extrinsic to quantum theory. The formalism leads to a non-standard
oscillation formula; at low energy it predicts an `anomalous' oscillation
wavelength, while at high energy it differs from the standard expression by a
factor of 2. The key novelties in the formalism are the treatment of a
particle's time of arrival at the detector as a genuine quantum observable, the
theoretical precision in the definition of quantum probabilities, and the
detailed modeling of the measurement process. The article also contains an
extensive critical review of existing theoretical treatments of particle
oscillations, identifying key problems and showing that these are overcome by
the proposed formalism.
