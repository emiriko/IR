In the quantum Hall effect regime, taking place in a two-dimensional-electron
gas under strong magnetic field, currents flow along the edges of the sample.
For some particle-hole conjugate states of the fractional regime, e.g., with
filling between 1/2 and 1 of the lowest Landau level; early predictions
suggested the presence of counter-propagating edge currents in addition to the
expected ones. When this did not agree with the measured conductance, it was
suggested that disorder and interactions will lead to counterpropagating modes
that carry only energy - the so called neutral modes. In addition, a neutral
upstream mode (Majorana mode) was also expected for selected wavefunctions
proposed for the even denominator filling 5/2. Here we report on the direct
observation of counter-propagating neutral modes in fillings 2/3, 3/5 and 5/2.
This was done by injecting such modes and allowing them to impinge on a narrow
constriction, which partly reflected them, with two main observed effects: (a)
A resultant shot noise proportional to the applied voltage on the injecting
contact; (b) With simultaneously injecting also a charge mode, the presence of
the neutral mode was found to significantly affect the Fano factor and the
temperature of the backscattered charge mode. In particular, such observation
for filling 5/2, may single out the non-abelian wavefunctions for the state.
