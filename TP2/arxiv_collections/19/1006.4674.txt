A major goal of ultracold atomic physics is quantum simulation of spin
Hamiltonians in optical lattices. Progress towards this goal requires the
attainment of extremely low temperatures. Here we demonstrate a new cooling
method which consists of applying a time-varying magnetic field gradient to a
spin mixture of ultracold atoms. We have used this method to prepare isolated
spin distributions at positive and negative spin temperatures of +/-50
picokelvin. The spin system can also be used to cool other degrees of freedom,
and we have used this coupling to reduce the temperature of an apparently
equilibrated sample of rubidium atoms in a Mott insulating state to 350
picokelvin. These are the lowest temperatures ever measured in any system.
