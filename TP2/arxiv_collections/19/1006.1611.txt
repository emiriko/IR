We analyze the dynamics of individual kilometer-size planetesimals in
circumstellar orbits of a tight binary system. We include both the
gravitational perturbations of the secondary star and a non-linear gas drag
stemming from an eccentric gas disk with a finite precession rate. We consider
several precession rates and eccentricities for the gas, and compare the
results with a static disk in circular orbit.
  The disk precession introduces three main differences with respect to the
classical static case: (i) The equilibrium secular solutions generated by the
gas drag are no longer fixed points in the averaged system, but limit cycles
with frequency equal to the precession rate of the gas. The amplitude of the
cycle is inversely dependent on the body size, reaching negligible values for
$\sim 50$ km size planetesimals. (ii) The maximum final eccentricity attainable
by small bodies is restricted to the interval between the gas eccentricity and
the forced eccentricity, and apsidal alignment is no longer guaranteed for
planetesimals strongly coupled with the gas. (iii) The characteristic
timescales of orbital decay and secular evolution decrease significantly with
increasing precession rates, with values up to two orders of magnitude smaller
than for static disks.
  Finally, we apply this analysis to the $\gamma$-Cephei system and estimate
impact velocities for different size bodies and values of the gas eccentricity.
For high disk eccentricities, we find that the disk precession decreases the
velocity dispersion between different size planetesimals, thus contributing to
accretional collisions in the outer parts of the disk. The opposite occurs for
almost circular gas disks, where precession generates an increase in the
relative velocities.
