It is shown by simple and straightforward considerations that discreteness of
basic physical variables is, at least, essential for generalized statistical
mechanics with non-logarithmic entropy to be thermodynamically applicable to
classical systems. As a result, continuous Hamiltonian systems with long-range
interactions and the so-called q-Gaussian momentum distributions are seen to be
outside the scope of nonextensive statistical mechanics.
