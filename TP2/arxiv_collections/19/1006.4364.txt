For extrasolar planets discovered using the radial velocity method, the
spectral characterization of the host star leads to a mass-estimate of the star
and subsequently of the orbiting planet. In contrast, if also the orbital
velocity of the planet would be known, the masses of both star and planet could
be determined directly using Newton's law of gravity, just as in the case of
stellar double-line eclipsing binaries. Here we report on the detection of the
orbital velocity of extrasolar planet HD209458b. High dispersion ground-based
spectroscopy during a transit of this planet reveals absorption lines from
carbon monoxide produced in the planet atmosphere, which shift significantly in
wavelength due to the change in the radial component of the planet orbital
velocity. These observations result in a mass determination of the star and
planet of 1.00+-0.22 Msun and 0.64+-0.09 Mjup respectively. A ~2 km/sec
blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal with respect to the systemic velocity
of the host star suggests the presence of a strong wind flowing from the
irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet within the
0.01-0.1 mbar atmospheric pressure range probed by these observations. The
strength of the carbon monoxide signal suggests a CO mixing ratio of 1-3x10-3
in this planet's upper atmosphere.
