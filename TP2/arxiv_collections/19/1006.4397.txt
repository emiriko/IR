Although an exchange of genetic information by recombination plays an
important role in the evolution of viruses, it is not clear how it generates
diversity. {\it Geminiviruses} are plant viruses which have ambisense
single-stranded circular DNA genomes and one of the most economically important
plant viruses in agricultural production. Small circular single-stranded DNA
satellites, termed DNA-$\beta$, have recently been found associated with some
geminivirus infections. In this paper we analyze a satellite molecule
DNA-$\beta$ of geminiviruses for recombination events using phylogenetic and
statistical analysis and we find that one strain from ToLCMaB has a
recombination pattern and is possibly recombinant molecule between two strains
from two species, PaLCuB-[IN:Chi:05] (major parent) and ToLCB-[IN:CP:04] (minor
parent).
