The scalar partners of top and bottom quarks are expected to be the lightest
squarks in supersymmetric theories, with potentially large cross sections at
hadron colliders. We present predictions for the production of top and bottom
squarks at the Tevatron and the LHC, including next-to-leading order
corrections in supersymmetric QCD and the resummation of soft gluon emission at
next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. We discuss the impact of the higher-order
corrections on total cross sections and transverse-momentum distributions, and
provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty due to scale variation and
the parton distribution functions.
