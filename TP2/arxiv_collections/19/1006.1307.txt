We analyse some QR decomposition algorithms, and show that the I/O complexity
of the tile based algorithm is asymptotically the same as that of matrix
multiplication. This algorithm, we show, performs the best when the tile size
is chosen so that exactly one tile fits in the main memory. We propose a
constant factor improvement, as well as a new recursive cache oblivious
algorithm with the same asymptotic I/O complexity. We design Hessenberg,
tridiagonal, and bidiagonal reductions that use banded intermediate forms, and
perform only asymptotically optimal numbers of I/Os; these are the first I/O
optimal algorithms for these problems. In particular, we show that known slab
based algorithms for two sided reductions all have suboptimal asymptotic I/O
performances, even though they have been reported to do better than the
traditional algorithms on the basis of empirical evidence.
  We propose new tile based variants of multishift QR and QZ algorithms that
under certain conditions on the number of shifts, have better seek and I/O
complexities than all known variants.
  We show that techniques like rescheduling of computational steps, appropriate
choosing of the blocking parameters and incorporating of more matrix-matrix
operations, can be used to improve the I/O and seek complexities of matrix
computations.
