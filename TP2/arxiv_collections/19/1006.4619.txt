We study a highly efficient, matter-wave amplification mechanism in a
longitudinally-excited, Bose-Einstein condensate and reveal a very large
enhancement due to nonlinear gain from a sixmatter- optical, wave-mixing
process involving four photons. Under suitable conditions this
opticallydegenerate, four-photon process can be stronger than the usual
two-photon inelastic light scattering mechanism, leading to nonlinear growth of
the observed matter-wave scattering independent of any enhancement from bosonic
stimulation. Our theoretical framework can be extended to encompass even
higher-order, nonlinear superradiant processes that result in higher-order
momentum transfer.
