We consider the proximity effect between a singlet s-wave superconductor and
the edge of a Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) topological insulator. We establish that
Andreev reflection at a QSH edge state/superconductor interface is perfect
while nonlocal Andreev processes through the superconductor are totally
suppressed. We compute the corresponding conductance and noise.
