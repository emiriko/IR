In this paper we propose a higher dimensional Cosmology based on FRW model
and brane-world scenario. We consider the warp factor in the brane-world
scenario as a scale factor in 5-dimensional generalized FRW metric, which is
called as bulk scale factor, and obtain the evolution of it with space-like and
time-like extra dimensions. It is then showed that, additional space-like
dimensions can produce exponentially bulk scale factor under repulsive strong
gravitational force in the empty universe at a very early stage.
