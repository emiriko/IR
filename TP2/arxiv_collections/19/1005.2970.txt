QCD corrections to inclusive Higgs boson production at the LHC are evaluated
at next-to-next-to leading order. By performing asymptotic expansion of the
cross section near the limit of infinitely heavy top quark we obtained a few
first top mass-suppressed terms. The corrections to the hadronic cross sections
are found to be small compared to the scale uncertainty, thus justifying the
use of heavy top quark approximation in many published results.
