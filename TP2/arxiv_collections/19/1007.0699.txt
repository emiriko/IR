The present article focuses on studying the extent to which the nonuniqueness
that is inherent in the standard quantum mechanical calculation of
arrival/transit time distribution can be exploited to enable an empirical
scrutiny of any causal trajectory model such as the Bohmian scheme. For this
purpose, we consider the example of spin-1/2 neutral particles corresponding to
a wave packet which passes through a spin rotator(SR) that contains constant
magnetic field confined within a region - in such a case, the transit time
distribution can be measured in terms of the spin distribution of particles
emerging from the SR. In particular, we investigate the way one can compare the
Bohmian predictions obtained for this example with that using one of the
quantum approaches, say, the probability current density based scheme. Here the
Bohmian calculational procedure involves a couple of critical subtleties that
lead to some specific directions for further studies.
