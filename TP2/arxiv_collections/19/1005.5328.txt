The measurement result of the moved distance for a free mass m during the
time t between two position measurements cannot be predicted with uncertainty
smaller than sqrt{hbar t/2m}. This is formulated as a standard quantum limit
(SQL) and it has been proven to always hold for the following position
measurement: a probe is set in a prescribed position before the measurement.
Just after the interaction of the mass with the probe, the probe position is
measured, and using this value, the measurement results of the pre-measurement
and post-measurement positions are estimated.
