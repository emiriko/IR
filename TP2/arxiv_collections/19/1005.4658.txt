The altitude distribution of optical turbulence is derived from the MASS
instrument data by solving an inverse problem. In this paper, some
modifications of the profile restoration are described. The principal change is
the introduction of the Non Negative Least Squares algorithm which has good
regularizing properties. An averaging of scintillation indices was replaced
with averaging of obtained solutions what leads to clearer physical results. It
is shown that restoration with a number of turbulent layers as large as 14-15
can be successfully performed.
