Graph games of infinite length are a natural model for open reactive
processes: one player represents the controller, trying to ensure a given
specification, and the other represents a hostile environment. The evolution of
the system depends on the decisions of both players, supplemented by chance.
  In this work, we focus on the notion of randomised strategy. More
specifically, we show that three natural definitions may lead to very different
results: in the most general cases, an almost-surely winning situation may
become almost-surely losing if the player is only allowed to use a weaker
notion of strategy. In more reasonable settings, translations exist, but they
require infinite memory, even in simple cases. Finally, some traditional
problems becomes undecidable for the strongest type of strategies.
