A scanning tunneling microscope can probe the inelastic spin excitations of a
single magnetic atom in a surface via spin-flip assisted tunneling in which
transport electrons exchange spin and energy with the atomic spin. If the
inelastic transport time, defined as the average time elapsed between two
inelastic spin flip events, is shorter than the atom spin relaxation time, the
STM current can drive the spin out of equilibrium. Here we model this process
using rate equations and a model Hamiltonian that describes successfully spin
flip assisted tunneling experiments, including a single Mn atom, a Mn dimer and
Fe Phthalocyanine molecules. When the STM current is not spin polarized, the
non-equilibrium spin dynamics of the magnetic atom results in non-monotonic
$dI/dV$ curves. In the case of spin polarized STM current, the spin orientation
of the magnetic atom can be controlled parallel or anti-parallel to the
magnetic moment of the tip. Thus, spin polarized STM tips can be used both to
probe and to control the magnetic moment of a single atom.
