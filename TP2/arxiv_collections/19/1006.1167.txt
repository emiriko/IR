The weak antilocalization effect is observed in a p-type Hg0.8Cd0.2Te thin
film with thickness ~10 micrometers. Based on the analysis of composition,
carrier species and excellent fitting of data with a model concerning weak
antilocalization effect in Te crystal, the most plausible explanation is that
the observed weak antilocalization effect is caused by Te-precipitation.
