We derive the Leading-Order master equation to extract the polarized gluon
distribution G(x;Q^2) = x \deltag(x;Q^2) from polarized proton structure
function, g1p(x;Q^2). By using a Laplace-transform technique, we solve the
master equation and derive the polarized gluon distribution inside the proton.
The test of accuracy which are based on our calculations with two different
methods confirms that we achieve to the correct solution for the polarized
gluon distribution. We show that accurate experimental knowledge of g1p(x;Q^2)
in a region of Bjorken x and Q^2, is all that is needed to determine the
polarized gluon distribution in that region. Therefore, to determine the gluon
polarization \deltag /g,we only need to have accurate experimental data on
un-polarized and polarized structure functions (F2p (x;Q^2) and g1p(x;Q^2)).
