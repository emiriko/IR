In 1998 [8], Patarin proposed an efficient cryptosystem called Little Dragon
which was a variant a variant of Matsumoto Imai cryptosystem C*. However
Patarin latter found that Little Dragon cryptosystem is not secure [8], [3]. In
this paper we propose a cryptosystem Little Dragon Two which is as efficient as
Little Dragon cryptosystem but secure against all the known attacks. Like
Little Dragon cryptosystem the public key of Little Dragon Two is mixed type
that is quadratic in plaintext and cipher text variables. So the public key
size of Little Dragon Two is equal to Little Dragon Cryptosystem. Our public
key algorithm is bijective and can be used for both encryption and signatures.
