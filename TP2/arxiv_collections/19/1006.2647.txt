We study the s-channel single top quark production at the LHC in the context
of extra dimension theories, including the Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition. It
is shown that the presence of the first KK excitation of $W$ gauge boson can
reduce the total cross section of s-channel single top production considerably
if $M_{W_{KK}}\sim2.2 \rm TeV$ ($3.5 \rm TeV$) for $7\rm TeV$ ($14\rm TeV$) in
proton-proton collisions. Then the results will be compared with the impacts of
other beyond Standard Model (SM) theories on the cross section of single top
s-channel. The possibility of distinguishing different models via their effects
on the production cross section of the s-channel is discussed.
