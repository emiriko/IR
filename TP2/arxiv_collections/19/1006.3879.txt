This work deals with $F(T)$ gravity models driven by real scalar fields with
usual and phantom dynamics. We illustrate the results with examples of current
interest, and we find some analytical solutions for scale factors and scalar
fields. The results indicate that torsion-scalar models also admit the
accelerated expansion of the universe.
