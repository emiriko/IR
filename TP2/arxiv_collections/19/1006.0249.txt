The heaviest members of the SM -- the gauge bosons $W,Z$ and the top quarks
and antiquarks -- may form collective bag-like excitations of the Higgs vacuum
provided their number is large enough, both at zero and finite temperatures.
Since Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV) is significantly modified inside
them, they are called "bags". In this work we argue that creation of such
objects can explain certain numerical studies of cosmological baryogenesis.
Using as an example a hybrid model, combining inflationary preheating with cold
electroweak transition, we identify "spots of unbroken phase" found in
numerical studies of this scenario with such $W-Z$ bags. We argue that the
baryon number violation should happen predominantly inside these objects, and
show that the rates calculated in numerical simulations can be analytically
explained using finite-size pure gauge sphaleron solutions, developed
previously in the QCD context by Carter, Ostrovsky and Shuryak (COS).
Furthermore, we point out significant presence of the top quarks/antiquarks in
these bag (which were not included in those numerical studies). Although the
basic sphaleron exponent remains unchanged by the top's presence, we find that
tops help to stabilize them for a longer time. Another enhancement of the
transition rate comes from the "recycling" of the tops in the topological
transition. Inclusion of the fermions (tops) enhances the sphaleron rate by up
to 2 orders of magnitude. We finally discuss the magnitude of the CP violation
needed to explain the observed baryonic asymmetry of the Universe, and give
arguments that the difference in the top-antitop population in the bag of the
right magnitude can arise both from CP asymmetries in the top decays and in top
propagation into the bags, due to Farrar-Shaposhnikov effect.
