In the last decade there has been increasing interest in the fields of random
matrices, interacting particle systems, stochastic growth models, and the
connections between these areas. For instance, several objects appearing in the
limit of large matrices arise also in the long time limit for interacting
particles and growth models. Examples of these are the famous Tracy-Widom
distribution functions and the Airy_2 process. The link is however sometimes
fragile. For example, the connection between the eigenvalues in the Gaussian
Orthogonal Ensembles (GOE) and growth on a flat substrate is restricted to
one-point distribution, and the connection breaks down if we consider the joint
distributions. In this paper we first discuss known relations between random
matrices and the asymmetric exclusion process (and a 2+1 dimensional
extension). Then, we show that the correlation functions of the eigenvalues of
the matrix minors for beta=2 Dyson's Brownian motion have, when restricted to
increasing times and decreasing matrix dimensions, the same correlation kernel
as in the 2+1 dimensional interacting particle system under diffusion scaling
limit. Finally, we analyze the analogous question for a diffusion on (complex)
sample covariance matrices.
