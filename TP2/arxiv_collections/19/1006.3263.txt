The photon detection efficiencies of multi-pixel Geiger-mode avalanche
photodiodes manufactured by different produ cers are estimated. A new fit
method of the response spectra to low-intensity light, taking into ac count
after-pulse and cross-talk effects is proposed to yield the initial number of
photons. The value of photon detection efficiency is calculated using a
calibrated photodetector as a reference.
