Andreev reflection-where an electron in a normal metal backscatters off a
superconductor into a hole-forms the basis of low energy transport through
superconducting junctions. Andreev reflection in confined regions gives rise to
discrete Andreev bound states (ABS), which can carry a supercurrent and have
recently been proposed as the basis of qubits [1-3]. Although signatures of
Andreev reflection and bound states in conductance have been widely reported
[4], it has been difficult to directly probe individual ABS. Here, we report
transport measurements of sharp, gate-tunable ABS formed in a
superconductor-quantum dot (QD)-normal system, which incorporates graphene. The
QD exists in the graphene under the superconducting contact, due to a
work-function mismatch [5, 6]. The ABS form when the discrete QD levels are
proximity coupled to the superconducting contact. Due to the low density of
states of graphene and the sensitivity of the QD levels to an applied gate
voltage, the ABS spectra are narrow, can be tuned to zero energy via gate
voltage, and show a striking pattern in transport measurements.
