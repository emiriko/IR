GaAs nanowires are grown by molecular beam epitaxy using a self-catalyzed,
Ga-assisted growth technique. Position control is achieved by nano-patterning a
SiO2 layer with arrays of holes with a hole diameter of 85 nm and a hole pitch
varying between 200 nm and 2 \mum. Gallium droplets form preferentially at the
etched holes acting as catalyst for the nanowire growth. The nanowires have
hexagonal cross-sections with {110} side facets and crystallize predominantly
in zincblende. The interdistance dependence of the nanowire growth rate
indicates a change of the III/V ratio towards As-rich conditions for large hole
distances inhibiting NW growth.
