The charge transfer in low energy (0.25 to 150 eV/amu) H($nl$) + He$^+(1s)$
collisions is investigated using a quasi-molecular approach for the $n=2,3$ as
well as the first two $n=4$ singlet states. The diabatic potential energy
curves of the HeH$^+$ molecular ion are obtained from the adiabatic potential
energy curves and the non-adiabatic radial coupling matrix elements using a
two-by-two diabatization method, and a time-dependent wave-packet approach is
used to calculate the state-to-state cross sections. We find a strong
dependence of the charge transfer cross section in the principal and orbital
quantum numbers $n$ and $l$ of the initial or final state. We estimate the
effect of the non-adiabatic rotational couplings, which is found to be
important even at energies below 1 eV/amu. However, the effect is small on the
total cross sections at energies below 10 eV/amu. We observe that to calculate
charge transfer cross sections in a $n$ manifold, it is only necessary to
include states with $n^{\prime}\leq n$, and we discuss the limitations of our
approach as the number of states increases.
