The work of Fisenko S. I., & Fisenko I. S. (2009). The old and new concepts
of physics, 6 (4), 495, shows the key fact of the existence of gravitational
radiation as a radiation of the same level as electromagnetic. The obtained
results strictly correspond to the framework of relativistic theory of
gravitation and quantum mechanics. The given work contributes into further
elaboration of the findings considering their application to dense
high-temperature plasma of multiple-charge ions. This is due to quantitative
character of electron gravitational emission spectrum such that amplification
of gravitational emission may take place only in multiple-charge ion
high-temperature plasma.
