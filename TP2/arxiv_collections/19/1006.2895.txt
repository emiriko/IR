Rejoinder to Moed [arXiv:1005.4906]: Our main objection is against developing
new indicators which, like some of the older ones (for example, the "crown
indicator" of CWTS), do not allow for indicating error because they do not
provide a statistics, but are based, in our opinion, on a violation of the
order of operations. The claim of validity for the SNIP indicator is hollow
because the normalizations are based on field classifications which are not
valid. Both problems can perhaps be solved by using fractional counting.
