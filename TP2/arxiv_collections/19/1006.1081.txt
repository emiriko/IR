In this paper we study the spin transport in frustrated antiferromagnetic FCC
films by Monte Carlo simulation. In the case of Ising spin model, we show that
the spin resistivity versus temperature exhibits a discontinuity at the phase
transition temperature: an upward jump or a downward fall, depending on how
many parallel and antiparallel localized spins interacting with a given
itinerant spin. The surface effects as well as the difference of two degenerate
states on the resistivity are analyzed. Comparison with non frustrated
antiferromagnets is shown to highlight the frustration effect. We also show and
discuss the results of the Heisenberg spin model on the same lattice.
