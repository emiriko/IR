The problem of infrared divergence of the effective electromagnetic field
produced by elementary particles is revisited using the non-equilibrium model
of an electron interacting with low-temperature photons. It is argued that the
infrared singularity of the effective field can be interpreted as a
thermalization of the electron. It is shown that this thermalization is
negligible in actual field measurements as it is completely dominated by the
usual quantum spreading.
