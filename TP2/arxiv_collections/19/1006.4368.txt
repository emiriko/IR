We present several entanglement criteria in terms of the quantum Fisher
information that help to relate various forms of multipartite entanglement to
the sensitivity of phase estimation. We show that genuine multipartite
entanglement is necessary to reach the maximum sensitivity in some very general
metrological tasks using a two-arm linear interferometer. We also show that it
is needed to reach the maximum average sensitivity in a certain combination of
such metrological tasks.
