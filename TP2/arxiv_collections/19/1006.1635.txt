We study the modifications induced by spacetime anisotropy on the Casimir
effect in the case of two parallel plates. Nonperturbative and perturbative
regimes are analyzed. In the first case the Casimir force either vanishes or it
reverses its direction which, in any case, makes the proposal untenable. On the
other hand, the perturbative model enables us to incorporate appropriately the
effects of spacetime anisotropy.
