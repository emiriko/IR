The sunspot area fluctuations for the northern and the southern hemispheres
of the Sun over the epoch of 12 cycles (12-23) are investigated. Because of the
asymmetry of their probability distributions, the positive and the negative
fluctuations are considered separately. The auto-correlation analysis of them
shows three quasi-periodicities at 10, 17 and 23 solar rotations. The wavelets
gives the 10-rotation quasi-periodicity. For the original and the negative
fluctuations the correlation coefficient between the wavelet and the
auto-correlation results is about 0.9 for 90% of the auto-correlation peaks.
For the positive fluctuations it is also 0.9 for 70% of the peaks. For 90% of
cycles in both hemispheres the auto-correlation analysis of negative
fluctuations shows that two longer periods can be represented as the multiple
of the shortest period. For positive fluctuations such dependences are found
for more than 50% of cases.
