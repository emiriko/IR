We start by introducing a new definition of solutions to heat-based SPDEs
driven by space-time white noise: SDDEs (stochastic differential-difference
equations) limits solutions. In contrast to the standard direct definition of
SPDEs solutions; this new notion, which builds on and refines our SDDEs
approach to SPDEs from earlier work, is entirely based on the approximating
SDDEs. It is applicable to, and gives a multiscale view of, a variety of SPDEs.
We extend this approach in related work to other heat-based SPDEs (Burgers,
Allen-Cahn, and others) and to the difficult case of SPDEs with
multi-dimensional spacial variable. We focus here on one-spacial-dimensional
reaction-diffusion SPDEs; and we prove the existence of a SDDEs limit solution
to these equations under less-than-Lipschitz conditions on the drift and the
diffusion coefficients, thus extending our earlier SDDEs work to the nonzero
drift case. The regularity of this solution is obtained as a by-product of the
existence estimates. The uniqueness in law of our SPDEs follows, for a large
class of such drifts/diffusions, as a simple extension of our recent Allen-Cahn
uniqueness result. We also examine briefly, through order parameters
$\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ multiplied by the Laplacian and the noise, the
effect of letting $\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2\to 0$ at different speeds. More
precisely, it is shown that the ratio $\epsilon_2/\epsilon_1^{1/4}$ determines
the behavior as $\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2\to 0$.
