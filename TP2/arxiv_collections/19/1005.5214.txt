Using the three versions of proximity potentials, namely proximity 1977,
proximity 1988, and proximity 2000, we present a pocket formula for fusion
barrier heights and positions. This was achieved by analyzing as many as 400
reactions with mass between 15 and 296. Our parametrized formula can reproduced
the exact barrier heights and positions within an accuracy of $\pm1%$. A
comparison with the experimental data is also in good agreement.
