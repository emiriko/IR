Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems based on shape using invariant
image moments, viz., Moment Invariants (MI) and Zernike Moments (ZM) are
available in the literature. MI and ZM are good at representing the shape
features of an image. However, non-orthogonality of MI and poor reconstruction
of ZM restrict their application in CBIR. Therefore, an efficient and
orthogonal moment based CBIR system is needed. Legendre Moments (LM) are
orthogonal, computationally faster, and can represent image shape features
compactly. CBIR system using Exact Legendre Moments (ELM) for gray scale images
is proposed in this work. Superiority of the proposed CBIR system is observed
over other moment based methods, viz., MI and ZM in terms of retrieval
efficiency and retrieval time. Further, the classification efficiency is
improved by employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Improved
retrieval results are obtained over existing CBIR algorithm based on Stacked
Euler Vector (SERVE) combined with Modified Moment Invariants (MMI).
