Observations from the X-ray telescope (XRT) on Hinode are used to study the
nature of X-ray bright points, sources of coronal jets. Several jet events in
the coronal holes are found to erupt from small-scale, S-shaped bright regions.
This finding suggests that coronal micro-sigmoids may well be progenitors of
coronal jets. Moreover, the presence of these structures may explain numerous
observed characteristics of jets such as helical structures, apparent
transverse motions, and shapes. In analogy to large-scale sigmoids giving rise
to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), a promising future task would perhaps be to
investigate whether solar eruptive activity, from coronal jets to CMEs, is
self-similar in terms of properties and instability mechanisms.
