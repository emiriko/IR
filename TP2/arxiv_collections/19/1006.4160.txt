We present the final results from a high sampling rate, multi-month,
spectrophotometric reverberation mapping campaign undertaken to obtain either
new or improved Hbeta reverberation lag measurements for several relatively
low-luminosity AGNs. We have reliably measured thetime delay between variations
in the continuum and Hbeta emission line in six local Seyfert 1 galaxies. These
measurements are used to calculate the mass of the supermassive black hole at
the center of each of these AGNs. We place our results in context to the most
current calibration of the broad-line region (BLR) R-L relationship, where our
results remove outliers and reduce the scatter at the low-luminosity end of
this relationship. We also present velocity-resolved Hbeta time delay
measurements for our complete sample, though the clearest velocity-resolved
kinematic signatures have already been published.
