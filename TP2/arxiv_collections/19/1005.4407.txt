We analyze the power of the Tevatron dataset to exclude or discover fourth
generation neutrinos. In a general framework, one can have mixed left- and
right-handed neutrinos, with Dirac and Majorana neutrinos as extreme cases. We
demonstrate that a single Tevatron experiment can make powerful statements
across the entire mixing space, extending LEP's mass limits of 60-80 GeV up to
150-175 GeV, depending on the mixing.
