In the paper being commented on it is proposed a new method for the detection
of the electron EDM using the solid GdIG. There, it is argued that a sample
electric polarization appears when the sample is magnetized; the common belief
is that the electron EDM must be collinear with its magnetic moment. All this
is objected and it is suggested that the polarization of the sample can be
explained by the direct, Lorentz covariant, interaction between B^{a} and an
EDM d^{a}.
