A web-based, interactive system for the remote processing of imaging data
sets (i.e., EUV, X-ray and microwave) and the automated interactive detection
of wave and oscillatory phenomena in the solar atmosphere is presented.The
system targets localised, but spatially resolved, phenomena, such as kink,
sausage, and longitudinal propagating and standing waves. The system implements
the methods of Periodmapping for pre-analysis, and Pixelised Wavelet Filtering
for detailed analysis of the imaging data cubes. The system is implemented on
the dedicated data processing server http://pwf.iszf.irk.ru, which is situated
at the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, Irkutsk, Russia. The input data
in the .sav, .fits or .txt formats can be submitted via the local and/or global
network (the Internet). The output data can be in the png, jpeg and binary
formats, on the user's request. The output data are periodmaps; narrowband
amplitude, power, phase and correlation maps of the wave's sources at
significant harmonics and in the chosen spectral intervals, and mpeg-movies of
their evolution. The system was tested by the analysis throughout the EUV and
microwave emission from the active region NOAA 10756 on 4 May 2005 observed
with TRACE and the Nobeyama Radioheliograph. The similarity of the spatial
localisation of three-minute propagating waves, near the footpoint of locally
open magnetic field lines determined by the potential field extrapolation, in
both the transition region and the corona was established. In the transition
region the growth of the three-minute amplitude was found to be accompanied by
the decrease in the line of sight angle to the wave propagation direction.
