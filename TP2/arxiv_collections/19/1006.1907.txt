A dynamical model of the natural conflict triad is investigated. The conflict
interacting substances of the triad are: some biological population, a living
resource, and a negative factor (e.g., infection diseases). We suppose that
each substance is multi-component. The main coexistence phases for substances
are established: the equilibrium point (stable state), the local cyclic orbits
(attractors), the global periodic oscillating trajectories, and the evolution
close to chaotic. The bifurcation points and obvious thresholds between phases
are exhibited in the computer simulations.
