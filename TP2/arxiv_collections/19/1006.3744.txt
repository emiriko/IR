ISIS (In-situ Storage Imaging Sensor) is a novel CMOS sensor with multiple
charge storage capability developed for the ILC vertex detector by the Linear
Collider Flavour Identification (LCFI) collaboration. This paper reports test
results for ISIS2, the second generation of ISIS sensors implemented in a 0.18
micron CMOS process. The local charge storage and charge transfer were
unambiguously demonstrated.
