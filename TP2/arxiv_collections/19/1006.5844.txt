We present a theory which describes the transport properties of the
interfacial region with respect to heat and mass transfer. Postulating the
local Gibbs relation for a continuous description inside the interfacial
region, we derive the description of the Gibbs surface in terms of excess
densities and fluxes along the surface. We introduce overall interfacial
resistances and conductances as the coefficients in the force-flux relations
for the Gibbs surface. We derive relations between the local resistivities for
the continuous description inside the interfacial region and the overall
resistances of the surface for transport between the two phases for a mixture.
It is shown that interfacial resistances depend among other things on the
enthalpy profile across the interface. Since this variation is substantial the
coupling between heat and mass flow across the surface are also substantial. In
particular, the surface puts up much more resistance to the heat and mass
transfer then the homogeneous phases over a distance comparable to the
thickness of the surface. This is the case not only for the pure heat
conduction and diffusion but also for the cross effects like thermal diffusion.
For the excess fluxes along the surface and the corresponding thermodynamic
forces we derive expressions for excess conductances as integrals over the
local conductivities along the surface. We also show that the curvature of the
surface affects only the overall resistances for transport across the surface
and not the excess conductivities along the surface.
