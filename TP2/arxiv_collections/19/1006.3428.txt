In this letter we consider a correspondence between holographic dark energy
and variable modified Chaplygin gas to obtain a holographic dark energy model
of the universe. The corresponding potential of the scalar field has been
reconstructed which describes the modified variable Chaplygin gas. The
stability of the holographic dark energy in this case is also discussed.
