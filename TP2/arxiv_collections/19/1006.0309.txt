The aim of this article is to complete results of [M.00] and [B.08] and to
show that they imply a rather general existence theorem for meromorphic
quotient of strongly quasi-proper meromorphic equivalence relations. In this
context, generic equivalence classes are asked to be pure dimensionnal closed
analytic subset with finitely many irreducible components. As an application of
these methods we prove a Stein factorization theorem for a strongly
quasi-proper map
