A search has been performed on 683 pb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the ALEPH
detector at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP), collider at centre-of-mass
energies from 183 to 209 $\mathrm{GeV}$ looking for a Higgs boson decaying into
four $\tau$ leptons via intermediate pseudoscalar $a$ particles, for a Higgs
mass range of 70 to 114 $\mathrm{GeV} / c^2$ and an $a$ mass range of 4 to 12
$\mathrm{GeV} / c^2$. No excess above background is seen and a limit is placed
on $\xi^2 = \frac{\sigma(e^+ e^-\ra Z+h)}{\sigma_{SM}(e^+ e^-\ra
Z+h)}\times(h\ra aa)\times(a\ra \tau^+\tau^-)^2$ in the $m_h, m_a$ plane. For
$m_h < 107 \; \mathrm{GeV} / c^2$ and $m_a < 10 \; \mathrm{GeV} / c^2$, $\xi^2
> 1$ can be excluded at the 95\% confidence level.
