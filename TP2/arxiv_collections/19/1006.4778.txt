The process of natural aging in pure ternary Al-Mg-Si alloys was studied by
positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy in real time in order to clarify
the sequence and kinetics of clustering and precipitation. It was found that
natural aging takes place in at least five stages in these alloys, four of
which were directly observed. This is interpreted as the result of complex
interactions between vacancies and solute atoms or clusters. One of the early
stages of positron lifetime evolution coincides with a clustering process
observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and involves the formation
of a positron trap with \sim 0.200 ns lifetime. In later stages, a positron
trap with a higher lifetime develops in coincidence with the DSC signal of a
second clustering reaction. Mg governs both the kinetics and the lifetime
change in this stage. Within the first 10 min after quenching, a period of
nearly constant positron lifetime was found for those Mg-rich alloys that later
show an insufficient hardness response to artificial aging, the so-called
"negative effect." The various processes observed could be described by two
effective activation energies that were found by varying the aging temperature
from 10 to 37\degree C.
