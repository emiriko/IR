In this paper we show, through the study of concrete examples, that,
depending on the cosmic dynamics of the energy density of matter degrees of
freedom living in the brane, Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane effects can be
important not only at short distances (UV regime), but also at large
cosmological scales (IR regime). Our first example relies on the study, by
means of the dynamical systems tools, of a toy model based in a non-linear
electrodynamics (NLED) Lagrangian. Then we show that other, less elaborated
models, such as the inclusion of a scalar phantom field, and of a tachyon
phantom field -- trapped in the brane -- produce similar results. The form of
the RS correction seems to convert what would have been future attractors in
general relativity into saddle points. The above "mixing of scales" effect is
distinctive only of theories that modify the right-hand-side (matter part) of
the Friedmann equation, so that, for instance, DGP-brane models do not show
this feature.
