We study multipartite correlations and non-locality in an isotropic Ising
ring under transverse magnetic field at both zero and finite temperature. We
highlight parity-induced differences between the multipartite Bell-like
functions used in order to quantify the degree of non-locality within a ring
state and reveal a mechanism for the passive protection of multipartite quantum
correlations against thermal spoiling effects that is clearly related to the
macroscopic properties of the ring model.
