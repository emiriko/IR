The Lady Maisry ballads afford us a framework within which to segment a
storyline into its major components. Segments and as a consequence nodal points
are discussed for nine different variants of the Lady Maisry story of a (young)
woman being burnt to death by her family, on account of her becoming pregnant
by a foreign personage. We motivate the importance of nodal points in textual
and literary analysis. We show too how the openings of the nine variants can be
analyzed comparatively, and also the conclusions of the ballads.
