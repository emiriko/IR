We provide a review to holographic models based on Einstein-dilaton gravity
with a potential in 5 dimensions. Such theories, for a judicious choice of
potential are very close to the physics of large-N YM theory both at zero and
finite temperature. The zero temperature glueball spectra as well as their
finite temperature thermodynamic functions compare well with lattice data. The
model can be used to calculate transport coefficients, like bulk viscosity, the
drag force and jet quenching parameters, relevant for the physics of the
Quark-Gluon Plasma.
