We propose an experiment using optically trapped and cooled dielectric
microspheres for the detection of short-range forces. The center-of-mass motion
of a microsphere trapped in vacuum can experience extremely low dissipation and
quality factors of $10^{12}$, leading to yoctonewton force sensitivity.
Trapping the sphere in an optical field enables positioning at less than 1
$\mu$m from a surface, a regime where exotic new forces may exist. We expect
that the proposed system could advance the search for non-Newtonian gravity
forces via an enhanced sensitivity of $10^5-10^7$ over current experiments at
the 1 $\mu$m length scale. Moreover, our system may be useful for
characterizing other short-range physics such as Casimir forces.
