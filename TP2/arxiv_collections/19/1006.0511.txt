We present the results of a detailed spectroscopic study of the long period
($P=0.856$ days) RR Lyrae star, KP Cyg. We derived abundances of many chemical
elements including the light species, iron-group elements and elements of the
s-processes. Most RR Lyrae stars with periods longer than 0.7 days are
metal-deficient objects. Surprisingly, our results show that KP Cyg is very
metal rich ([Fe/H] $= +0.18\pm 0.23$). By comparison with a number of short
period ($P=1\sim 6$ days), metal-rich CWB stars, we suggest that KP Cyg may be
a very short period CWB star (BL Her star) rather than an RR Lyrae star. As
seen in some CWB stars, KP Cyg shows strong excesses of carbon and nitrogen in
its atmosphere. This indicates that the surface of KP Cyg has been polluted by
material that has undergone helium burning (to enhance carbon) and proton
capture (to transform carbon into nitrogen). We also note that UY CrB, whose
period is 0.929 days, also shows an enhancement of C and N, and that two carbon
cepheids of short period, V553 Cen and RT TrA, show similar excesses of carbon
and nitrogen.
