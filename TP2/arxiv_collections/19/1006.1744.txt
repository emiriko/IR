In this work we describe an efficient implementation of a hierarchy of
algorithms for the decomposition of dense matrices over the field with two
elements (GF(2)). Matrix decomposition is an essential building block for
solving dense systems of linear and non-linear equations and thus much research
has been devoted to improve the asymptotic complexity of such algorithms. In
this work we discuss an implementation of both well-known and improved
algorithms in the M4RI library. The focus of our discussion is on a new variant
of the M4RI algorithm - denoted MMPF in this work -- which allows for
considerable performance gains in practice when compared to the previously
fastest implementation. We provide performance figures on x86_64 CPUs to
demonstrate the viability of our approach.
