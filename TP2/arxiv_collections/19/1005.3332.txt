We present an analytical derivation of the Sachs Wolfe effect sourced by a
primordial magnetic field, generated by a causal process, such as a first order
phase transition in the early universe. As for the topological defects case, we
apply the general relativistic junction conditions to match the perturbation
variables before and after the phase transition, in such a way that the total
energy momentum tensor is conserved across the transition. We find that the
relevant contribution to the magnetic Sachs Wolfe effect comes from the metric
perturbations at next-to-leading order in the large scale limit. The leading
order term is strongly suppressed due to the presence of free-streaming
neutrinos. We derive the neutrino compensation effect and confirm that the
magnetic Sachs Wolfe spectrum from a causal magnetic field behaves as
l(l+1)C_l^B ~ l^2 as found in the latest numerical analyses.
