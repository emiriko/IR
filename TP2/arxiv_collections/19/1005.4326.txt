We study the energy released from phase-transition induced collapse of
neutron stars, which results in large amplitude stellar oscillations. To model
this process we use a Newtonian hydrodynamic code, with a high resolution
shock-capturing scheme. The physical process considered is a sudden phase
transition from normal nuclear matter to a mixed phase of quark and nuclear
matter. We show that both the temperature and the density at the neutrinosphere
oscillate with time. However, they are nearly 180 degree out of phase.
Consequently, extremely intense, pulsating neutrino/antineutrino and leptonic
pair fluxes will be emitted. During this stage several mass ejecta can be
ejected from the stellar surface by the neutrinos and antineutrinos. These
ejecta can be further accelerated to relativistic speeds by the
electron/positron pairs, created by the neutrino and antineutrino annihilation
outside the stellar surface. We suggest that this process may be a possible
mechanism for short Gamma-Ray Bursts.
