We construct Anosov diffeomorphisms on manifolds that are homeomorphic to
infranilmanifolds yet have exotic smooth structures. These manifolds are
obtained from standard infranilmanifolds by connected summing with certain
exotic spheres. Our construction produces Anosov diffeomorphisms of high
codimension on infranilmanifolds with irreducible exotic smooth structures.
