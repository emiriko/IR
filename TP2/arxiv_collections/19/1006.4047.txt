We give a probabilistic numerical method for solving a partial differential
equation with fractional diffusion and nonlinear drift. The probabilistic
interpretation of this equation uses a system of particles driven by L\'evy
alpha-stable processes and interacting with their drift through their empirical
cumulative distribution function. We show convergence to the solution for the
associated Euler scheme.
