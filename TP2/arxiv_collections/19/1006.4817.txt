It is shown that the temperature dependence of the value of energy gap in
superconductors can be classified as the order-disorder transition with its
characteristic features. The obtained relationship between the critical
temperature and the critical magnetic field of the condensate of electrically
charged particles is in accordance with measurement data of superconductors.
