We attempt a slingshot model interpretation of the unusual association of
some 1&1/3 dozen nonstellar galaxian objects around the parent optical galaxy
of the giant radio galaxy DA 240 (= 0748.6+55.8 (J2000)). Similar
interpretation may be possible for another large radio galaxy 3C 31 (= NGC 383
= 0104.6+32.1 (1950.0)).
