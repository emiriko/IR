Eta bound states in nuclei are sensitive to the flavour-singlet component in
the eta. The bigger the singlet component, the more attraction and the greater
the binding. eta-etaprime mixing plays an important role in understanding the
value of the eta-nucleon scattering length a_{\eta N}. Working with the Quark
Meson Coupling model, we find a factor of two enhancement from mixing relative
to the prediction with a pure octet eta.
