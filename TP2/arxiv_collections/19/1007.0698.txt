The chargino/neutralino pair production is one of the benchmarking processes
of ILC. These processes are interesting not only because it allows high
precision measurement of chargino and neutralino masses, but also for the
reason that the separation of W and Z bosons through their hadronic decay
products requires excellent jet resolution being a good benchmark of the
detector performance. The analysis based on the SiD detector concept with four
jets and missing energy final state will be presented. The uncertainty of
chargino and neutralino cross sections can be determined with precision of 0.9%
and 4.2% respectively. The mass uncertainties are obtained with a template
fitting method achieving precision of better than 1 GeV.
