We present a search for flavor changing neutral currents via quark-gluon
couplings in a sample of single top quark final states corresponding to 2.3
fb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron Collider. We select events containing a single top quark candidates
with an additional jet, and obtain separation between signal and background
using Bayesian neural networks. We find consistency between background
expectation and observed data, and set limits on flavor changing neutral
current gluon couplings of the top quark to up quarks (tgu) and charm quarks
(tgc). The cross section limits at the 95% C.L. are sigma_tgu<0.20pb and
sigma_tgc<0.27pb. These correspond to limits on the top quark decay branching
fractions of B(t->gu)<2.0*10^-4 and B(t->gc)<3.9*10^-3.
