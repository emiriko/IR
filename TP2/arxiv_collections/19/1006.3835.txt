The construction of needlet-type wavelets on sections of the spin line
bundles over the sphere has been recently addressed in Geller and Marinucci
(2008), and Geller et al. (2008,2009). Here we focus on an alternative proposal
for needlets on this spin line bundle, in which needlet coefficients arise from
the usual, rather than the spin, spherical harmonics, as in the previous
constructions. We label this system mixed needlets and investigate in full
their properties, including localization, the exact tight frame
characterization, reconstruction formula, decomposition of functional spaces,
and asymptotic uncorrelation in the stochastic case. We outline astrophysical
applications.
