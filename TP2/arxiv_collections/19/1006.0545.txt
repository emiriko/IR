The puzzle of recently observed insulating phase of graphene at filling
factor $\nu=0$ in high magnetic field quantum Hall (QH) experiments is
investigated. We show that the magnetic field driven Peierls-type lattice
distortion (due to the Landau level degeneracy) and random bond fluctuations
compete with each other, resulting in a transition from a QH-metal state at
relative low field to a QH-insulator state at high enough field at $\nu=0$. The
critical field that separates QH-metal from QH-insulator depends on the bond
fluctuation. The picture explains well why the field required for observing the
insulating phase is lower for a cleaner sample.
