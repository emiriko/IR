Noether's Theorem yields conservation laws for a Lagrangian with a
variational symmetry group. The explicit formulae for the laws are well known
and the symmetry group is known to act on the linear space generated by the
conservation laws. The aim of this paper is to explain the mathematical
structure of both the Euler-Lagrange system and the set of conservation laws,
in terms of the differential invariants of the group action and a moving frame.
For the examples we demonstrate, knowledge of this structure allows the
Euler-Lagrange equations to be integrated with relative ease. Our methods take
advantage of recent advances in the theory of moving frames by Fels and Olver,
and in the symbolic invariant calculus by Hubert. The results here generalise
those appearing in Kogan and Olver [1] and in Mansfield [2]. In particular, we
show results for high dimensional problems and classify those for the three
inequivalent SL(2) actions in the plane.
