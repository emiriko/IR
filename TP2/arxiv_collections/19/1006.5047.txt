Spectrum is a scarce commodity, and considering the spectrum scarcity faced
by the wireless-based service providers led to high congestion levels.
Technical inefficiencies from pooled spectrum (this is nothing but the "common
carrier principle" adopted in oil/gas/electricity pipelines/networks.), since
all ad hoc networks share a common pool of channels, exhausting the available
channels will force ad hoc networks to block the services. Researchers found
that cognitive radio (CR) technology may resolve the spectrum scarcity. CR
network proved to next generation wireless communication system that proposed
as a way to reuse under-utilised spectrum of licensee user (primary network) in
an opportunistic and non-interfering basis. A CR is a self-configuring entity
in a wireless networking that senses its environment, tracks changes, and
frequently exchanges information with their networks. Adding this layer of such
intelligence to the ad hoc network by looking at the overall geography of the
network known as cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs). However, CRAHN
facing challenges and condition become worst while tracks changes i.e.
reallocation of another under-utilised channels while primary network user
arrives. In this paper, channels or resource reallocation technique based on
bio-inspired computing algorithm for CRAHN has been proposed.
