We characterise the class of one-cogenerated Pfaffian ideals whose natural
generators form a Gr\"obner basis with respect to any anti-diagonal term-order.
We describe their initial ideals as well as the associated simplicial
complexes, which turn out to be shellable and thus Cohen-Macaulay. We also
provide a formula for computing their multiplicity.
