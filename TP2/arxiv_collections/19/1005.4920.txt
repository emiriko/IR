Pulse splitting is a crucial and common process in nonlinear fiber optics.
When an intense laser pulse is launched into a highly nonlinear fiber, a stream
of fundamental solitons is generated, their temporal separations increasing
during propagation. This is due to the onset of a variety of perturbations,
including higher-order dispersion and the Raman effect. Recently, it has been
experimentally observed that the well-known law determining the amplitudes and
the temporal widths of each soliton, however, breaks down due to the unexpected
formation of metastable 2-peak localised states with constant temporal
separation between the two maxima. In the vicinity of certain 'magic' input
powers the formation of 2-peak states is quite common in many types of highly
nonlinear photonic crystal fibers. In this study, we provide a full theoretical
understanding of the above recent observations. Based on a 'gravity-like'
potential approach we derive simple equations for the 'magic' peak power ratio
and the temporal separation between pulses forming these 2-peak states. We
develop a model to calculate the magic input power of the input pulse around
which the phenomenon can be observed. We also predict the existence of exotic
multipeak states that strongly violate the perturbative pulse splitting law,
and we study their stability and excitation conditions.
