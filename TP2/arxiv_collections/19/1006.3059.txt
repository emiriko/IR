We provide a class of optimal nondecomposable entanglement witnesses for 4N x
4N composite quantum systems or, equivalently, a new construction of
nondecomposable positive maps in the algebra of 4N x 4N complex matrices. This
construction provides natural generalization of the Robertson map. It is shown
that their structural physical approximations give rise to entanglement
breaking channels.
