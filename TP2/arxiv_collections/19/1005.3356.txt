We study the entanglement of a multipartite quantum state. An inequality
between the bipartite concurrence and the multipartite concurrence is obtained.
More effective lower and upper bounds of the multipartite concurrence are
obtained. By using the lower bound, the entanglement of more multipartite
states are detected.
