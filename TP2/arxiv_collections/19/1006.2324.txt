We consider self-localization of a small number of Bose particles immersed in
a large homogeneous superfluid mixture of fermions in three and one dimensional
spaces. Bosons distort the density of surrounding fermions and create a
potential well where they can form a bound state analogous to a small polaron
state. In the three dimensional volume we observe the self-localization for
repulsive interactions between bosons and fermions. In the one dimensional case
bosons self-localize as well as for attractive interactions forming, together
with a pair of fermions at the bottom of the Fermi sea, a vector soliton. We
analyze also thermal effects and show that small non-zero temperature affects
the pairing function of the Fermi-subsystem and has little influence on the
self-localization phenomena.
