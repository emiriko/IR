The first stars to form in the history of the universe may have been powered
by dark matter annihilation rather than by fusion. This new phase of stellar
evolution may have lasted millions to billions of years. These dark stars can
grow to be very large, > 10^5 solar masses, and are relatively cool (~10^4 K).
They are also very bright, being potentially detectable in the upcoming James
Webb Space Telescope or even the Hubble Space Telescope. Once the dark matter
runs out, the dark stars have a short fusion phase, before collapsing into
black holes (BH). The resulting BH could serve as seeds for the (unexplained)
supermassive black holes at high redshift and at the centers of galaxies.
