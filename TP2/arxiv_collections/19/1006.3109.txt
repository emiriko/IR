We study the resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) spectra of CeB_{6} in an
antiferroquadrupole (AFQ) ordering phase, near the Ce L_3 edge under the
applied magnetic field H // (-1,1,0). On the basis of a localized electron
model equipped with a mechanism that the RXS signal is brought about by the
intra-atomic Coulomb interaction in Ce, we calculate the RXS spectra. The
obtained spectra exhibit two contributions around the electric dipole (E1) and
quadrupole (E2) positions, and differ drastically when the orientation of H is
reversed. The difference is brought about by the cross terms between the
even-rank AFQ and magnetic-induced odd-rank contributions. At the E1 region,
the relevant cross term is the one within the E1 process, while at the E2
region, they are ones within the E2 process and between the E1 and E2
processes. These findings capture the characteristic features the recent
experimental data show, and provide a strong support and information of the
field-induced multipole orderings. We also evaluate the RXS spectra near the
L_{2} edge. Though the results show no E2 contribution, we find that the
intensity around the E1 transition, which is as large as that at the L_{3}
edge, can be detected experimentally.
