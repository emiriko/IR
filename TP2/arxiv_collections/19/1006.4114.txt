This paper proposed a new method to build the large scale DNA sequences
search system based on web search engine technology. We give a very brief
introduction for the methods used in search engine first. Then how to build a
DNA search system like Google is illustrated in detail. Since there is no local
alignment process, this system is able to provide the ms level search services
for billions of DNA sequences in a typical server.
