We present a Chandra monitoring campaign of the highly variable Seyfert
galaxy UGC 4203 (the "Phoenix Galaxy") which revealed variations in the X-ray
absorbing column density on time scales of two weeks. This is the third, clear
case, after NGC 1365 and NGC 7582, of dramatic N_H variability on short time
scales observed in a "changing look" source, i.e. an AGN observed in the past
in both a reflection-dominated and a Compton-thin state. The inferred limits on
the distance of the X-ray absorber from the center suggest that the X-ray
"torus" could be one and the same with the broad emission line region. This
scenario, first proposed for an "ad-hoc" picture for NGC 1365, may be the
common structure of the circumnuclear medium in AGN.
