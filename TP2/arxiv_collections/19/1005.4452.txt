In this work we present an alternative to a full dome digital projection
system. The system presented is based upon a single projector coupled to the
optical lens (fisheye and objective lens) to scatter the light onto the dome
surface. This alternative projection system offers many advantages as
manufacturing lower cost and high quality of the image projection. From the
practical applications, the system is ideal for use in planetariums lessons.
