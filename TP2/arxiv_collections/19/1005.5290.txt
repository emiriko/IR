We present results concerning the non-perturbative evaluation of the
ghost-gluon running QCD coupling constant from $N_f=2$ twisted-mass lattice
calculations. A novel method for calibrating the lattice spacing, independent
of the string tension and hadron spectrum is presented with results in
agreement with previous estimates. The value of $\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}$ is
computed from the running of the QCD coupling only after extrapolating to zero
dynamical quark mass and after removing a non-perturbative OPE contribution
that is assumed to be dominated by the dimension-two $\VEV{A^2}$ gluon
condensate. The effect due to the dynamical quark mass in the determination of
$\Lams$ is discussed.
