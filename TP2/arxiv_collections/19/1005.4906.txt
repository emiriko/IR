This paper is a reply to the article "Scopus's Source Normalized Impact per
Paper (SNIP) versus a Journal Impact Factor based on Fractional Counting of
Citations", published by Loet Leydesdorff and Tobias Opthof (arXiv:1004.3580v2
[cs.DL]). It clarifies the relationship between SNIP and Elsevier's Scopus.
Since Leydesdorff and Opthof's description of SNIP is not complete, it
indicates four key differences between SNIP and the indicator proposed by the
two authors, and argues why the former is more valid than the latter.
Nevertheless, the idea of fractional citation counting deserves further
exploration. The paper discusses difficulties that arise if one attempts to
apply this principle at the level of individual (citing) papers.
