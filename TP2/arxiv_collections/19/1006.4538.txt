A mobile agent is a program that is not bound to the system on which it began
execution, but rather travels amongst the hosts in the network with its code
and current execution state (i.e. Distributed Environment).The implementation
of distributed applications can be based on a multiplicity of technologies,
e.g. plain sockets, Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Remote Method Invocation
(RMI), Java Message Service (JMS), .NET Remoting, or Web Services. These
technologies differ widely in complexity, interoperability, standardization,
and ease of use. The Mobile Agent technology is emerging as an alternative to
build a smart generation of highly distributed systems. In this work, we
investigate the performance aspect of agent-based technologies for information
retrieval. We present a comparative performance evaluation model of Mobile
Agents versus .Net remoting by means of an analytical approach. A quantitative
measurements are performed to compare .Net remoting and mobile agents using
communication time, code size (agent code), Data size, number of node as
performance parameters in this research work. The results depict that Mobile
Agent paradigm offers a superior performance compared to .Net remoting
paradigm, offers fast computational speed; procure lower invocation cost by
making local invocations instead of remote invocations over the network,
thereby reducing network bandwidth.
