MICADO is the adaptive optics imaging camera for the E-ELT. It has been
designed and optimised to be mounted to the LGS-MCAO system MAORY, and will
provide diffraction limited imaging over a wide (about 1 arcmin) field of view.
For initial operations, it can also be used with its own simpler AO module that
provides on-axis diffraction limited performance using natural guide stars. We
discuss the instrument's key capabilities and expected performance, and show
how the science drivers have shaped its design. We outline the technical
concept, from the opto-mechanical design to operations and data processing. We
describe the AO module, summarise the instrument performance, and indicate some
possible future developments.
