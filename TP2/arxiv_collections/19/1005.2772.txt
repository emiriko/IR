Turbulence and turbulent mixing in natural fluids begins with big bang
turbulence powered by spinning combustible combinations of Planck particles and
Planck antiparticles. Particle prograde accretions on a spinning pair releases
42% of the particle rest mass energy to produce more fuel for turbulent
combustion. Negative viscous stresses and negative turbulence stresses work
against gravity, extracting mass-energy and space-time from the vacuum.
Turbulence mixes cooling temperatures until strong-force viscous stresses
freeze out turbulent mixing patterns as the first fossil turbulence. Cosmic
microwave background temperature anisotropies show big bang turbulence fossils
along with fossils of weak plasma turbulence triggered as plasma photon-viscous
forces permit gravitational fragmentation on supercluster to galaxy mass
scales. Turbulent morphologies and viscous-turbulent lengths appear as linear
gas-proto-galaxy-clusters in the Hubble ultra-deep-field at z~7. Proto-galaxies
fragment into Jeans-mass-clumps of primordial-gas-planets at decoupling: the
dark matter of galaxies. Shortly after the plasma to gas transition,
planet-mergers produce stars that explode on overfeeding to fertilize and
distribute the first life.
