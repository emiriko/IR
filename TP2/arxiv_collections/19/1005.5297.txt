The ground states of two types of distorted mixed diamond chains with spins 1
and 1/2 are investigated using exact diagonalization, DMRG, and mapping onto
low-energy effective models. In the undistorted case, the ground state consists
of an array of independent spin-1 clusters separated by singlet dimers. The
lattice distortion induces an effective interaction between cluster spins. When
this effective interaction is antiferromagnetic, several Haldane phases appear
with or without spontaneous translational symmetry breakdown (STSB). The
transition between the Haldane phase without STSB and that with $(n+1)$-fold
STSB ($n$ = 1, 2, and 3) belongs to the same universality class as the
$(n+1)$-clock model. In contrast, when the effective interaction is
ferromagnetic, the quantized and partial ferrimagnetic phases appear with or
without STSB. An effective low-energy theory for the partial ferrimagnetic
phase is presented.
