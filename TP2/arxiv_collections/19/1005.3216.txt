We combine results from searches by the CDF and D0 collaborations for a
standard model Higgs boson (H) in the process gg->H->W+W- in p=pbar collisions
at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. With 4.8 fb-1 of
integrated luminosity analyzed at CDF and 5.4 fb-1 at D0, the 95% Confidence
Level upper limit on \sigma(gg->H) x B(H->W+W-) is 1.75 pb at m_H=120 GeV, 0.38
pb at m_H=165 GeV, and 0.83 pb at m_H=200 GeV. Assuming the presence of a
fourth sequential generation of fermions with large masses, we exclude at the
95% Confidence Level a standard-model-like Higgs boson with a mass between 131
and 204 GeV.
