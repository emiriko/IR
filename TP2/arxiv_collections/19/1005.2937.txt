We propose and demonstrate experimentally a new method based on the spatial
entanglement for the absolute calibration of analog detector. The idea consists
on measuring the sub-shot-noise intensity correlation between two branches of
parametric down conversion, containing many pairwise correlated spatial modes.
We calibrate a scientific CCD camera and a preliminary evaluation of the
statistical uncertainty indicates the metrological interest of the method.
