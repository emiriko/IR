We report on the attainment of a spin-polarized Fermi sea of 87-Sr in thermal
contact with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 84-Sr. Interisotope collisions
thermalize the fermions with the bosons during evaporative cooling. A
degeneracy of T/T_F=0.30(5) is reached with 2x10^4 87-Sr atoms together with an
almost pure 84-Sr BEC of 10^5 atoms.
