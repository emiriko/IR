Deterministic execution offers many benefits for debugging, fault tolerance,
and security. Running parallel programs deterministically is usually difficult
and costly, however - especially if we desire system-enforced determinism,
ensuring precise repeatability of arbitrarily buggy or malicious software.
Determinator is a novel operating system that enforces determinism on both
multithreaded and multi-process computations. Determinator's kernel provides
only single-threaded, "shared-nothing" address spaces interacting via
deterministic synchronization. An untrusted user-level runtime uses distributed
computing techniques to emulate familiar abstractions such as Unix processes,
file systems, and shared memory multithreading. The system runs parallel
applications deterministically both on multicore PCs and across nodes in a
cluster. Coarse-grained parallel benchmarks perform and scale comparably to -
sometimes better than - conventional systems, though determinism is costly for
fine-grained parallel applications.
