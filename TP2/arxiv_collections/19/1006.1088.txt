The quantum master equation is introduced for the density matrix representing
Bogoliubov-BCS quasiparticles. A constraint to relate the loss and gain factors
is taken into account to preserve the form of the density matrix. Such an
equation can be reduced to the semiclassical equation, and can be extended for
the coexistence of different order parameters.
