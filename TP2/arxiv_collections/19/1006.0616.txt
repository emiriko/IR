The paper deals with a theoretical investigation of the peristaltic transport
of a physiological fluid in a porous asymmetric channel under the action of a
magnetic field. The stream function, pressure gradient and axial velocity are
studied by using appropriate analytical and numerical techniques. Effects of
different physical parameters such as permeability, phase difference, wave
amplitude and magnetic parameter on the velocity, pumping characteristics,
streamline pattern and trapping are investigated with particular emphasis. The
computational results are presented in graphical form. The results are found to
be in perfect agreement with those of a previous study carried out for a
non-porous channel in the absence of a magnetic field.
