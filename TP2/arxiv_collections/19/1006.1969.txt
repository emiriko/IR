Fundamental thermodynamic concepts and an earlier elastic solid-state point
defect model are employed to formulate an analytical second-order olynomial
function describing the density scaling of the diffusion coefficient in viscous
liquids. The scaling exponent is correlated, within the approximations made in
the present approach, with the pressure derivative of the isothermal bulk
modulus. Our findings are compared with computer simulation results.
