Hawking's prediction of thermal radiation by black holes has been shown by
Unruh to be expected also in condensed matter systems. We show here that in a
black hole-like configuration realised in a BEC this particle creation does
indeed take place and can be unambiguously identified via a characteristic
pattern in the density-density correlations. This opens the concrete
possibility of the experimental verification of this effect.
