Strong correlation effects, which are often associated to the approach to a
Mott insulating state, in some cases may be observed even far from
half-filling. This typically happens whenever the inter-site Coulomb repulsion
induces a tendency towards charge ordering, an effect that confines the
electrons, and in turn favors local moment formation, i.e. Mott localization. A
distinct intermediate regime then emerges as a precursor of such a Wigner-Mott
transition, which is characterized by both charge and spin correlations,
displaying large mass enhancements and strong renormalizations of other Fermi
liquid parameters. Here we present a careful study of a quarter filled extended
Hubbard model - a simple example where such physics can be studied in detail,
and discuss its relevance for the understanding of the phenomenology of
low-density two dimensional electron gases.
