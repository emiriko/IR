We report on the limitations of sky subtraction accuracy for long duration
fibre-optic multi-object spectroscopy of faint astronomical sources during long
duration exposures. We show that while standard sky subtraction techniques
yield accuracies consistent with the Poisson noise limit for exposures of 1
hour duration, there are large scale systematic defects that inhibit the
sensitivity gains expected on the summation of longer duration exposures. For
the AAOmega system at the Anglo-Australian Telescope we identify a limiting
systematic sky subtraction accuracy which is reached after integration times of
4-10 hours. We show that these systematic defects can be avoided through the
use of the fibre nod-and-shuffle observing mode, but with potential cost in
observing efficiency. Finally we demonstrate that these disadvantages can be
overcome through the application of a Principle Components Analysis sky
subtraction routine. Such an approach minimise systematic residuals across long
duration exposures allowing deep integrations.
  We apply the PCA approach to over 200 hours of on-sky observations and
conclude that for the AAOmega system the residual error in long duration
observations falls at a rate proportional to t^-0.32 in contrast to the t^-0.5
rate expected from theoretical considerations. With this modest rate of
decline, the PCA approach represents a more efficient mode of observation than
the nod-and-shuffle technique for observations in the sky limited regime with
durations of 10-100 hours (even before accounting for the additional
signal-to-noise and targeting efficiency losses often associated with the N+S
technique).[abridged]
