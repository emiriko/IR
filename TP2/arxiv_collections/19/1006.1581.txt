The behavior of the transition temperature and critical current density for a
Mo/Nb repeated bilayer system as a function of the number of periods was
explored. The measured values of the transition temperature are compared to the
theoretical predictions for the proximity effect in the dirty limit. We find
that the transition temperature does not decrease as the number of periods
increase. In addition, inductive critical current density measurements also
show a scaling that indicates the superconductivity properties are not
dependent on the number of bilayers.
