A cellular automata (CA) configuration is constructed that exhibits emergent
failover. The configuration is based on standard Game of Life rules. Gliders
and glider-guns form the core messaging structure in the configuration. The
blinker is represented as the basic computational unit, and it is shown how it
can be recreated in case of a failure. Stateless failover using primary-backup
mechanism is demonstrated. The details of the CA components used in the
configuration and its working are described, and a simulation of the complete
configuration is also presented.
