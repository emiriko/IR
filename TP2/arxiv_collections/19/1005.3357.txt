We report the result of VLBI observation of the giant radio galaxy J1313+696
(4C +69.15) at 2.3/8.4 GHz, only the core component of the giant radio galaxy
was detected in the VLBI observation at the dual frequencies. The result shows
a steep spectrum core with $\alpha=-0.82$ ($S \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) between
2.3 GHz and 8.4 GHz. The steep spectrum core may be a sign of renewed activity.
Considering also the upper limit flux density of 2.0 mJy at 0.6 GHz from Konar
et al. 2004 the core has a GHz-peaked spectrum, implying that the core is
compact and absorbed. Further high resolution VLBI observations are needed to
identify if the steep spectrum core is consisting of a core and steep spectrum
jet.
