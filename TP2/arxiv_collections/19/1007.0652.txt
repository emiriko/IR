A competition model on $\N^{2}$ between three clusters and governed by
directed last passage percolation is considered. We prove that coexistence,
i.e. the three clusters are simultaneously unbounded, occurs with probability
$6-8\log2$. When this happens, we also prove that the central cluster almost
surely has a positive density on $\N^{2}$. Our results rely on three couplings,
allowing to link the competition interfaces (which represent the borderlines
between the clusters) to some particles in the multi-TASEP, and on recent
results about collision in the multi-TASEP.
