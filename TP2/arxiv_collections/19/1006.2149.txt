We consider extensions of Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) spacetimes to the
dissipative case. For doing that we previously carry out a systematic study on
LTB. This study is based on two different aspects of LTB. On the one hand, a
symmetry property of LTB will be presented. On the other hand, the description
of LTB in terms of some fundamental scalar functions (structure scalars)
appearing in the orthogonal splitting of Riemann tensor will be provided. We
shall consider as "natural" generalizations of LTB (hereafter referred to as
GLTB) either those metrics admitting some similar kind of symmetry as LTB, or
those sharing structure scalars with similar dependence on the metric.
