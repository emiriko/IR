In this article we introduce PINGSoft, a set of IDL routines designed to
visualise and manipulate, in an interactive and friendly way, Integral Field
Spectroscopic data. The package is optimised for large databases and a fast
visualisation rendering. PINGSoft includes routines to extract regions of
interest by hand or within a given geometric aperture, to integrate the spectra
within a given region, to convert between different IFS formats, to read, edit
and write IFS data files, and some other miscellaneous codes especially useful
in astronomy and spectroscopy. Here we describe its major characteristics and
requirements, providing examples and describing its capabilities. The PINGSoft
package is freely available at http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/research/pings
