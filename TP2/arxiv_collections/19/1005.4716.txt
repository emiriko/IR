We investigate out-of-the equilibrium properties of the electron liquid in a
two-dimensional disordered superconductor subject to the electric bias and
temperature gradient. We calculate kinetic coefficients and Nyquist noise, and
find that they are characterized by distinct effective temperatures:
$T_{\mathrm{e}}$, characterizing single-particle excitations,
$T_{\mathrm{Cp}}$, describing the Cooper pairs, and $T_{\mathrm{eh}}$,
corresponding to electron-hole or dipole excitations. Tuning the ratio between
the electric $j$ and thermal $j_{\mathrm{th}}$ currents and the boundary
conditions one can heat different kind of excitations and control their
corresponding temperatures. We propose the experimental setting for determining
these effective temperatures.
