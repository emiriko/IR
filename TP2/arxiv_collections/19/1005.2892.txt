A description of all normal Hopf subalgebras of a semisimple Drinfeld double
is given. This is obtained by considering an analogue of Goursat's lemma
concerning fusion subcategories of Deligne products of two fusion categories.
As an application we show that the Drinfeld double of any abelian extension is
also an abelian extension.
