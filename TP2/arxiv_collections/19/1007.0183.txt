The expansion of electromagnetic post-solitons emerging from the interaction
of a 30 ps, $3\times 10^{18}$ W cm$^{-2}$ laser pulse with an underdense
deuterium plasma has been observed up to 100 ps after the pulse propagation,
when large numbers of post-solitons were seen to remain in the plasma. The
temporal evolution of the post-solitons has been accurately characterized with
a high spatial and temporal resolution. The observed expansion is compared to
analytical models and three dimensional particle-in-cell results providing
indication of the polarisation dependence of the post-soliton dynamics.
