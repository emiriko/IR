The acceleration of ultra high energy cosmic rays is conjectured to occur
through various interactions with the electromagnetic fields in different
astrophysical objects, like magnetic matter clumps, besides the well-known
shock and stochastic Fermi mechanisms. It is apparent that the latter are not
depending on the particle's charge, quantitatively. Based on this model, a
considerable portion of the dynamics, that derives a charged particle parallel
to a magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and under the influence of a force
$\mathbf{F}$, is assumed to be composed of an acceleration by a non-magnetic
force $\mathbf{F}_{\parallel}$ and a gyromotion along $\mathbf{B}$ direction,
plus drifts in the direction of $\mathbf{F}_{\perp}$. The model and its
formalism are introduced. Various examples for drift motions and accelerating
forces are suggested. The formalism is given in a non-relativistic version.
Obviously, the translation into the relativistic version is standard. In a
forthcoming work, a quantitative estimation of the energy gained by charged
cosmic rays in various astrophysical objects will be evaluated.
