Context. White dwarfs (WDs) in cataclysmic variables (CVs) are important
experimental laboratories where the electron degeneracy is taking place on a
macroscopic scale. Magnetic CVs increase in number especially in the hard X-ray
band (>10 keV) thanks to sensitive hard X-ray missions.
  Aims. From X-ray spectroscopy, we estimate the masses of nearby WDs in
moderately-magnetized CVs, or Intermediate Polars (IPs).
  Methods. Using the Suzaku satellite, we aquired wide-band spectra of 17 IPs,
covering 3-50 keV. An accretion column model of Suleimanov et al. (2005) and an
optically-thin thermal emission code were used to construct a spectral emission
model of IPs with resolved Fe emission lines. By simultaneously fitting the Fe
line complex and the hard X-ray continuum of individual spectra, the shock
temperature and the WD mass were determined with a better accuracy than in
previous studies.
  Results. We determined the WD masses of the 17 IPs with statistical fitting
errors of ~0.1-0.2 Msun in many cases. The WD mass of a recently-found IP, IGR
J17195-4100, was also estimated for the first time (1.03+0.24-0.22 Msun). The
average WD mass of the sample is 0.88 \pm 0.25 Msun. When our results were
compared with previous X-ray mass determinations, we found significant
deviation in a few systems although the reason of this is unclear. The iron
abundance of the accreting gas was also estimated, and confirmed the previously
reported sub-solar tendency in all sources with better accuracy.
