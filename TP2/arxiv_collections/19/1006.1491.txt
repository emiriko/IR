Whether entanglement in a state can be detected, distilled, and quantified
without full state reconstruction is a fundamental open problem. We demonstrate
a new scheme encompassing these three tasks for arbitrary two-qubit
entanglement, by constructing the optimal entanglement witness for
polarization-entangled mixed-state photon pairs without full state
reconstruction. With better efficiency than quantum state tomography, the
entanglement is maximally distilled by newly developed tunable polarization
filters, and quantified by the expectation value of the witness, which equals
the concurrence. This scheme is extendible to multiqubit
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement.
