We have identified several lithium-rich low-mass (0.08<M<0.3 Msun) stars
within 5.5 deg of the young open cluster Eta Chamaeleontis, nearly four times
the radius of previous search efforts. Of these stars we propose 4 new probable
cluster members, and 3 possible members requiring further investigation. These
findings are consistent with a dynamical origin for the current configuration
of the cluster, without the need to invoke an abnormal Initial Mass Function
deficient in low-mass objects. Candidates were selected on the basis of DENIS
and 2MASS photometry, NOMAD astrometry and extensive follow-up spectroscopy.
