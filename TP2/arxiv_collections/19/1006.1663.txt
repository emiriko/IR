The emergence of new higher education institutions has created the
competition in higher education market, and data warehouse can be used as an
effective technology tools for increasing competitiveness in the higher
education market. Data warehouse produce reliable reports for the institution's
high-level management in short time for faster and better decision making, not
only on increasing the admission number of students, but also on the
possibility to find extraordinary, unconventional funds for the institution.
Efficiency comparison was based on length and amount of processed records,
total processed byte, amount of processed tables, time to run query and
produced record on OLTP database and data warehouse. Efficiency percentages was
measured by the formula for percentage increasing and the average efficiency
percentage of 461.801,04% shows that using data warehouse is more powerful and
efficient rather than using OLTP database. Data warehouse was modeled based on
hypercube which is created by limited high demand reports which usually used by
high level management. In every table of fact and dimension fields will be
inserted which represent the loading constructive merge where the ETL
(Extraction, Transformation and Loading) process is run based on the old and
new files.
