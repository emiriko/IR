The effect of stellar scintillation on the accuracy of photometric
measurements is analyzed. We obtain a convenient form of estimaton of this
effect in the long exposure regime, when the turbulence shift produced by the
wind is much larger than the aperture of the telescope. A simple method is
proposed to determine index $S_3$ introduced by perture of the Kenyon et al.
(2006), directly from the measurements with the Multi Aperture Scintillation
Sensor (MASS) without information on vertical profile of the wind. The
statistics $S_3$ resulting from our campaign of 2005 -- 2007 at Maidanak
observatory is presented. It is shown that these data can be used to estimate
high-altitude winds at pressure level 70 -- 100 mbar. Comparison with the wind
speed retrieved from the NCEP/NCAR global models shows a good agreement. Some
prospects for retrieval of the wind speed profile from the MASS measurements
are outlined.
