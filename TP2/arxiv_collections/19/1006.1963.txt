The 0+ states of 8He are studied in a five-body 4He+n+n+n+n cluster model.
Many-body resonances are treated on the correct boundary condition as Gamow
states using the complex scaling method. The 0+_2 state of 8He is predicted as
a five-body resonance in the excitation energy of 6.3 MeV with a width of 3.2
MeV, which mainly has a (p_{3/2})^2(p_{1/2})^2 configuration. In this state,
number of the 0+ neuron pair shows almost two, which is different from the
ground state having a large amount of the 2+ pair component. The monopole
transition of 8He from the ground state into the five-body unbound states is
also evaluated. It is found that the 7He+n component mostly exhausts the
strength, while the 0+_2 contribution is negligible. The final states are
dominated by 6He+n+n, not 4He+n+n+n+n. The results indicate the sequential
breakup process of 8He to 7He+n to 6He+n+n by the monopole excitation.
