In this paper, the performances of the quasi-Newton BFGS algorithm, the
NEWUOA derivative free optimizer, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES), the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm and Particle Swarm
Optimizers (PSO) are compared experimentally on benchmark functions reflecting
important challenges encountered in real-world optimization problems.
Dependence of the performances in the conditioning of the problem and
rotational invariance of the algorithms are in particular investigated.
