Localization lengths of the electrons and holes in InGaN/GaN quantum wells
have been calculated using numerical solutions of the effective mass
Schr\"odinger equation. We have treated the distribution of indium atoms as
random and found that the resultant fluctuations in alloy concentration can
localize the carriers. By using a locally varying indium concentration function
we have calculated the contribution to the potential energy of the carriers
from band gap fluctuations, the deformation potential and the spontaneous and
piezoelectric fields. We have considered the effect of well width fluctuations
and found that these contribute to electron localization, but not to hole
localization. We also simulate low temperature photoluminescence spectra and
find good agreement with experiment.
