We investigate a method to directly measure the phase of a laser beam
reflected from a metallic film after excitation of surface plasmon polaritons.
This method permits real time access to the phase information, it increases the
possible speed of data acquisition, and it may thus prove useful for increasing
the sensitivity of surface plasmon based sensors.
