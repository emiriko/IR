A pseudorandom point in an ergodic dynamical system over a computable metric
space is a point which is computable but its dynamics has the same statistical
behavior as a typical point of the system.
  It was proved in [Avigad et al. 2010, Local stability of ergodic averages]
that in a system whose dynamics is computable the ergodic averages of
computable observables converge effectively. We give an alternative, simpler
proof of this result.
  This implies that if also the invariant measure is computable then the
pseudorandom points are a set which is dense (hence nonempty) on the support of
the invariant measure.
