Quantum communication relies on optical implementations of channels, memories
and repeaters. In the absence of perfect devices, a minimum requirement on
real-world devices is that they preserve quantum correlations, meaning that
they have some thoughput of a quantum mechanical nature. Previous work has
verified throughput in optical devices while using minimal resources. We extend
this approach to the quantitative regime. Our method is illustrated in a
setting where the input consists of two coherent states while the output is
measured by two homodyne measurement settings.
