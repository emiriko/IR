Pre-calculated libraries of molecular fragment configurations have previously
been used as a basis for both equilibrium sampling (via "library-based Monte
Carlo") and for obtaining absolute free energies using a polymer-growth
formalism. Here, we combine the two approaches to extend the size of systems
for which free energies can be calculated. We study a series of all-atom
poly-alanine systems in a simple dielectric "solvent" and find that precise
free energies can be obtained rapidly. For instance, for 12 residues, less than
an hour of single-processor is required. The combined approach is formally
equivalent to the "annealed importance sampling" algorithm; instead of
annealing by decreasing temperature, however, interactions among fragments are
gradually added as the molecule is "grown." We discuss implications for future
binding affinity calculations in which a ligand is grown into a binding site.
