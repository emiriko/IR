The universal transpose of quantum states is an anti-unitary transformation
that is not allowed in quantum theory. In this work, we investigate
approximating the universal transpose of quantum states of two-level systems
(qubits) using the method known as the structural physical approximation to
positive maps. We also report its experimental implementation in linear optics.
The scheme is optimal in that the maximal fidelity is attained and also
practical as measurement and preparation of quantum states that are
experimentally feasible within current technologies are solely applied.
