Temporal analysis of radiation from Astrophysical sources like Active
Galactic Nuclei, X-ray Binaries and Gamma-ray bursts provide information on the
geometry and sizes of the emitting regions. Establishing that two light-curves
in different energy bands are correlated and measuring the phase and time-lag
between them is an important and frequently used temporal diagnostic. In the
present work, expressions to estimate the errors on the cross-correlation,
phase and time-lag between two light-curves are presented and the same have
been verified using simulations. Earlier estimates depended upon numerically
expensive simulations or on dividing the light-curves in large number of
segments to find the variance. The estimates presented here allow for analysis
of light-curves with relatively small (~1000) number of points, as well as to
obtain information on the longest time-scales available. The error estimation
is verified using simulations of light-curves derived from both white and 1/f
stochastic processes with measurement errors. As a demonstration, we apply this
technique to the XMM-Newton light-curves of the Active Galactic Nucleus, Akn
564.
