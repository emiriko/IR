We report a systematic empirical study of nanoparticle internalization into
cells via non-specific pathways. The nanoparticles were comprised of commercial
quantum dots (QDs) that were highly visible under a fluorescence confocal
microscope. Surface-modified QDs with basic biologically-significant moieties,
e.g. carboxyl, amino, streptavidin were used, in combination with the surface
derivatization with polyethylene glycol (PEG) in a range of immortalized cell
lines. Internalization rates were derived from image analysis and a detailed
discussion about the effect of nanoparticle size, charge and surface groups is
presented. We find that PEG-derivatization dramatically suppresses the
non-specific uptake while PEG-free carboxyl and amine functional groups promote
QD internalization. These uptake variations displayed a remarkable consistency
across different cell types. The reported results are important for experiments
concerned with cellular uptake of surface-functionalized nanomaterials, both
when non-specific internalization is undesirable and also when it is intended
for material to be internalized as efficiently as possible.
