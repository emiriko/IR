We explore the kinematical effect of having extra dimensions on the gravity
wave emission from cosmic strings. Additional dimensions both round off cusps,
and reduce the probability of their formation. We recompute the gravity wave
burst, taking into account these two factors, and find a potentially
significant damping on the gravity waves of the strings.
