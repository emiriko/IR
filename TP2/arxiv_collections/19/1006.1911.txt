An analysis of IGR J16207-5129 is presented based on observations taken with
Suzaku. The data set represents ~80 ks of effective exposure time in a broad
energy range between 0.5 and 60 keV, including unprecedented spectral
sensitivity above 15 keV. The average source spectrum is well described by an
absorbed power law in which we measured a large intrinsic absorption of nH =
16.2(-1.1/+0.9)x10^22 /cm2. This confirms that IGR J16207-5129 belongs to the
class of absorbed HMXBs. We were able to constrain the cutoff energy at
19(-4/+8) keV which argues in favor of a neutron star as the primary. Our
observation includes an epoch in which the source count rate is compatible with
no flux suggesting a possible eclipse. We discuss the nature of this source in
light of these and of other recent results.
