We present a CCD photometric study of the star with ASAS ID 134738 + 0410.1
using V band observations obtained from the $IUCAA$ Girawali Observatory (IGO)
2-metre telescope, India. The star was selected from the $\delta$ Scuti
database of All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) (Pojmanski 2002). Our analysis
reveals that the star is not a $\delta$ Scuti variable but is in fact a W UMa
type contact binary with an orbital period of 0.2853067 day. Two new times of
primary and secondary minima were determined from the observed data. A
preliminary solution obtained using the Wilson-Devinney light curve modelling
technique indicates that the star is more likely a partially-eclipsing W UMa
type contact binary. However, the determination of actual subtype of this
binary is quite impossible from the photometry alone, as the observed light
curve can fitted for both A- and W-type solutions. The exact classification of
this binary needs to be determined from high resolution spectroscopy.
