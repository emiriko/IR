Particle creation at the expense of gravitational field might be sufficient
to explain the cosmic evolution history, without the need of dark energy at
all. This phenomena has been investigated in a recent work by Lima et-al,
assuming particle creation at the cost of gravitational energy in the late
Universe. However, the model does not satisfy the WMAP constraint on
matter-radiation equality. Here, we have suggested a model, in the same
framework, which fits perfectly with SNIa data at low redshift as well as early
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect on matter-radiation equality determined by WMAP
at high redshift. Such a model, requires the presence of nearly 26% primeval
matter in the form of baryons and CDM.
