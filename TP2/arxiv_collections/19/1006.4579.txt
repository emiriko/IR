We study dynamics of an ultra-cold atomic BCS superfluid driven towards the
BCS superfluid-Fermi liquid quantum critical point by a gradual decrease of the
pairing interaction. We analyze how the BCS superfluid falls out of equilibrium
and show that the non-equilibrium gap and Cooper pair size reflect critical
properties of the transition. We observe three stages of evolution: adiabatic
where the Cooper pair size is inversely proportional to the equilibrium gap,
weakly non-equilibrium where it is inversely proportional to the
non-equilibrium gap, and strongly non-equilibrium where it decouples from both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium gap. These phenomena should stimulate future
experimental characterization of non-equilibrium ultra-cold atomic BCS
superfluids.
