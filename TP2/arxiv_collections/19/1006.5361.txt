The behaviour of the critical point between quantum Hall plateaux, as the
Zeeman energy is varied, is analysed using modular symmetry of the Hall
conductivities following from the law of corresponding states. Flow diagrams
for the conductivities as a function of temperature, with the magnetic field
fixed, are constructed for different Zeeman energies, for samples with
particle-hole symmetry.
