We present a generalization of Kruzkov's theory to manifolds. Nonlinear
hyperbolic conservation laws are posed on a differential (n+1)-manifold, called
a spacetime, and the flux field is defined as a field of n-forms depending on a
parameter. The entropy inequalities take a particularly simple form as the
exterior derivative of a family of n-form fields. Under a global hyperbolicity
condition on the spacetime, which allows arbitrary topology for the spacelike
hypersurfaces of the foliation, we establish the existence and uniqueness of an
entropy solution to the initial value problem, and we derive a geometric
version of the standard L1 semi-group property. We also discuss an alternative
framework in which the flux field consists of a parametrized family of vector
fields.
