The $q$-deformed statistics for fermions arising within the non-extensive
thermostatistical formalism has been applied to the study of various quantum
many-body systems recently. The aim of the present note is to point out some
subtle difficulties presented by this approach in connection with the problem
of thermodynamic consistency. Different possible ways to apply the $q$-deformed
quantum distributions in a thermodynamically consistent way are considered.
