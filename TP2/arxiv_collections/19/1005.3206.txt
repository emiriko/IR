We study physical properties of a Luttinger liquid in a superlattice which is
characterized by alternating two tunneling parameters. Employing the
Bosonization approach, we describe the corresponding Hubbard model by the
equivalent Tomonoga-Luttinger model. We analyze the spin-charge separation and
transport property as the difference between the two tunneling parameter
increases. We suggest that cold Fermi gases trapped in a bichromatic optical
lattice and coupled quantum dots offer the opportunity to measure these effects
in a convenient manner. We also study the classical Ising chain with two
tunneling parameters. We found that the classical two-point correlator
decreases as the difference between the two tunneling parameter increases.
