We study the bulk viscosity of dense matter, taking into account non-linear
effects which arise in the large amplitude "supra-thermal" region where the
deviation $\mu_\Delta$ of the chemical potentials from chemical equilibrium
fulfills $\mu_\Delta>T$. This regime is relevant to unstable modes such as
r-modes, which grow in amplitude until saturated by non-linear effects. We
study the damping due to direct and modified Urca processes in hadronic matter,
and due to nonleptonic weak interactions in strange quark matter. We give
general results valid for an arbitrary equation of state of dense matter and
find that the viscosity can be strongly enhanced by supra-thermal effects. Our
study confirms previous results on quark matter and shows that the non-linear
enhancement is even stronger in the case of hadronic matter. Our results can be
applied to calculations of the r-mode-induced spin-down of fast-rotating
neutron stars, where the spin-down time will depend on the saturation amplitude
of the r-mode
