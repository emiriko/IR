We prove that the amplitudes for the (d,p), (d,pn) and (e,e'p) reactions
determining the asymptotic behavior of the exact scattering wave functions in
the corresponding channels are invariant under unitary correlation operators
while the spectroscopic factors are not. Moreover, the exact reaction
amplitudes are not parametrized in terms of the spectroscopic factors and
cannot provide a tool to determine the spectroscopic factors.
