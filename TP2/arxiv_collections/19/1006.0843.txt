Motivated by MIMO broad-band fading channel model, in this section we deals
with the capacity behaviour of wireless MIMO and OFDM based spatial
multiplexing systems in broad-band fading environments for the case where the
channel is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver. This
influence the propagation and system parameters on ergodic capacity, we
furthermore demonstrate that, unlike the single-input single-output (SISO)
case, delay spread channels may provide advantage over flat-fading channels not
only in terms of outage capacity but also in terms of ergodic capacity.
Therefore, MIMO delay spread channels will in general provide both higher
diversity gain and higher multiplexing gain than MIMO flat-fading channels.
