We present a new parametric class of spherically symmetric analytic solutions
of the general relativistic field equations in canonical coordinates, which
corresponds to causal models of perfect fluid balls. These solutions describe
perfect fluid balls with infinite central pressure and infinite central density
though their ratio is positively finite and less then one. From the solutions
of this class we have constructed two causal models in which outmarch of
pressure, density is positive and monotonically decreasing and pressure-density
ratio is less than one throughout with in the balls. Corresponding to these
models we have maximized the Neutron star masses 3.24MQ and 3.48MQ with the
linear dimensions 32.09Kms and 34.36Kms respectively with equal surface red
shift 0.5811.
