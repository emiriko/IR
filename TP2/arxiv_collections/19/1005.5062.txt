We examine the ability of LHC experiments to observe jets from squark pair
production at the center-of-mass energy E$_{CM}$=10 TeV and 1 fb$^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity. We point out the crucial influence of initial- and
final-state radiation on the signal/background discriminating ability of
different kinematic variables. The reliable measurements of missing transverse
energy and stransverse mass would play a key role in picking out the signal
against the background.
