Let $G$ be a higher-rank semisimple Lie group over a nonarchimedean local
field, for example $G={\rm PGL}(n,Q_P)$. To any lattice $L$ in $G$ there is an
associated simplicial complex $B_L$, given by the quotient by $L$ of the
Bruhat-Tits building associated to $G$. In this paper prove that the simplicial
structure $B_L$ exhibits some remarkable and extremal symmetry properties, in
particular when compared to any other simplicial structure on (any cover of)
$B_L$.
