In this paper we present an algorithm for optical phase evaluation based on
the wavelet transform technique. The main advantage of this method is that it
requires only one fringe pattern. This algorithm is based on the use of a
second {\pi}/2 phase shifted fringe pattern where it is calculated via the
Hilbert transform. To test its validity, the algorithm was used to demodulate a
simulated fringe pattern giving the phase distribution with a good accuracy.
