Metallic split-ring resonators possess dominant electric dipoles as well as
considerable magnetic dipoles under proper excitations. Full-wave numerical
approaches are frequently employed to simulate adjacent split-ring resonators,
but simulations cannot explain the underlying physics. An analytical theory
based on a dynamic electric dipole approximation is developed here. Detailed
theory-simulation comparisons demonstrate that this theory can
\textit{quantitatively} describe the interaction strength of coupled
split-ring-resonators under certain circumstances.
