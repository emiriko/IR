We extend the Vasi\v{c}ek loan portfolio model to a setting where liabilities
fluctuate randomly and asset values may be subject to systemic jump risk. We
derive the probability distribution of the percentage loss of a uniform
portfolio and analyze its properties. We find that the impact of liability risk
is ambiguous and depends on the correlation between the continuous aggregate
factor and the asset-liability ratio as well as on the default intensity. We
also find that systemic jump risk has a significant impact on the upper
percentiles of the loss distribution and, therefore, on both the VaR-measure as
well as on the expected shortfall.
