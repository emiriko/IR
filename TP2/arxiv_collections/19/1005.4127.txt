A theory for the Hubbard model appropriate in the limit of large U/t, small
doping away from half-filling and short-ranged antiferromagnetic spin
correlations is presented. Despite the absence of any broken symmetry the Fermi
surface takes the form of elliptical hole pockets centered near (pi/2,pi/2)
with a volume proportional to the hole concentration. Short range
antiferromagnetic correlations render the nearest neighbor hopping almost
ineffective so that only second or third nearest neighbor hopping contributes
appreciably to the dispersion relation.
