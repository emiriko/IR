Communication complexity is an area of classical computer science which
studies how much communication is necessary to solve various distributed
computational problems. Quantum information processing can be used to reduce
the amount of communication required to carry out some distributed problems. We
speak of pseudo-telepathy when it is able to completely eliminate the need for
communication. Since it is generally very hard to perfectly implement a quantum
winning strategy for a pseudo-telepathy game, quantum players are almost
certain to make errors even though they use a winning strategy. After
introducing a model for pseudo-telepathy games, we investigate the impact of
erroneously performed unitary transformations on the quantum winning strategy
for the Mermin-GHZ game. The question of how strong the unitary noise can be so
that quantum players would still be better than classical ones is also dealt
with.
