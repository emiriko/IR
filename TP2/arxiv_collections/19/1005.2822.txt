A technique is described for constructing three-dimensional vector graphics
representations of planar regions bounded by cubic B\'ezier curves, such as
smooth glyphs. It relies on a novel algorithm for compactly partitioning planar
B\'ezier regions into nondegenerate Coons patches. New optimizations are also
described for B\'ezier inside-outside tests and the computation of global
bounds of directionally monotonic functions over a B\'ezier surface (such as
its bounding box or optimal field-of-view angle). These algorithms underlie the
three-dimensional illustration and typography features of the TeX-aware vector
graphics language Asymptote.
