The positive operator valued measure (POVM) for a photon counting array
detector is derived and found to equal photon flux density integrated over
pixel area and measurement time. Since photon flux density equals number
density multiplied by the speed of light, this justifies theoretically the
observation that a photon counting array provides a coarse grained measurement
of photon position. The POVM obtained here can be written as a set of
projectors onto a basis of localized states, consistent with the description of
photon position in a recent quantum imaging proposal [M. Tsang, Phys. Rev.
Lett. \textbf{102}, 253601 (2009)]. The wave function that describes a photon
counting experiment is the projection of the photon state vector onto this
localized basis. Collapse is to the electromagnetic vacuum and not to a
localized state, thus violating the text book rules of quantum mechanics but
compatible with the theory of generalized observables and the nonlocalizability
of an incoming photon.
