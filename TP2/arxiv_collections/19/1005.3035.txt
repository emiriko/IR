In this essay, we argue that the emergence of classically connected
spacetimes is intimately related to the quantum entanglement of degrees of
freedom in a non-perturbative description of quantum gravity. Disentangling the
degrees of freedom associated with two regions of spacetime results in these
regions pulling apart and pinching off from each other in a way that can be
quantified by standard measures of entanglement.
