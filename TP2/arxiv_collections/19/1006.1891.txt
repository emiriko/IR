Magnetization and magnetoresistance have been measured in insulating
antiferromagnetic La_{2}Cu_{0.97}Li_{0.03}O_{4} over a wide range of
temperatures, magnetic fields, and field orientations. The magnetoresistance
step associated with a weak ferromagnetic transition exhibits a striking
nonmonotonic temperature dependence, consistent with the presence of skyrmions.
