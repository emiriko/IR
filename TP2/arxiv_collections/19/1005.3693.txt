We study theoretically the effect of a lateral electric field on the
magneto-polaron states in a quantum cascade laser under a quantizing magnetic
field. We show that this problem fits the original Fano model of a discrete
state coupled to a continuum, present a detailed analysis of magneto-Stark
polaron resonances, and finally discuss the strong consequences on the optical
characteristics of an operating structure.
