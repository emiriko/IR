In sensor networks communication by broadcast methods involves many hazards,
especially collision. Several MAC layer protocols have been proposed to resolve
the problem of collision namely ARBP, where the best achieved success rate is
90%. We hereby propose a MAC protocol which achieves a greater success rate
(Success rate is defined as the percentage of delivered packets at the source
reaching the destination successfully) by reducing the number of collisions,
but by trading off the average propagation delay of transmission. Our proposed
protocols are also shown to be more energy efficient in terms of energy
dissipation per message delivery, compared to the currently existing protocol.
