In this paper we introduce and study the $\alpha$-Farey map and its
associated jump transformation, the $\alpha$-L\"uroth map, for an arbitrary
countable partition $\alpha$ of the unit interval with atoms which accumulate
only at the origin. These maps represent linearised generalisations of the
Farey map and the Gauss map from elementary number theory. First, a thorough
analysis of some of their topological and ergodic-theoretic properties is
given, including establishing exactness for both types of these maps. The first
main result then is to establish weak and strong renewal laws for what we have
called $\alpha$-sum-level sets for the $\alpha$-L\"uroth map. Similar results
have previously been obtained for the Farey map and the Gauss map, by using
infinite ergodic theory. In this respect, a side product of the paper is to
allow for greater transparency of some of the core ideas of infinite ergodic
theory. The second remaining result is to obtain a complete description of the
Lyapunov spectra of the $\alpha$-Farey map and the $\alpha$-L\"uroth map in
terms of the thermodynamical formalism. We show how to derive these spectra,
and then give various examples which demonstrate the diversity of their
behaviours in dependence on the chosen partition $\alpha$.
