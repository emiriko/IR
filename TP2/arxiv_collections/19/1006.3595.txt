We study the final outcome of gravitational collapse resulting from the plane
symmetric charged Vaidya spacetime. Using the field equations, we show that the
weak energy condition is always satisfied by collapsing fluid. It is found that
the singularity formed is naked. The strength of singularity is also
investigated by using Nolan's method. This turns out to be a strong curvature
singularity in Tipler's sense and hence provides a counter example to the
cosmic censorship hypothesis.
