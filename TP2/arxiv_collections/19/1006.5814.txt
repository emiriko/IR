We have analysed here the role of the geometric phase in dynamical mechanism
of quantum phase transition in the transverse Ising model. We have investigated
the system when it is driven at a fixed rate characterized by a quench time
$\tau_q$ across the critical point from a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase.
Our argument is based on the fact that the spin fluctuation occurring during
the critical slowing down causes random fluctuation in the ground state
geometric phase at the critical regime. The correlation function of the random
geometric phase determines the excitation probability of the quasiparticles,
which are excited during the transition from the inital paramagnetic to the
ferromagnetic phase. This helps us to evaluate the number density of the kinks
formed during the transition, which is found to scale as
$\tau_q^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. In addition, we have also estimated the spin-spin
correlation at criticality.
