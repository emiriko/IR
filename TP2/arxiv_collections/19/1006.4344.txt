Entanglement is a striking feature of quantum mechanics and an essential
ingredient in most applications in quantum information. Typically, coupling of
a system to an environment inhibits entanglement, particularly in macroscopic
systems. Here we report on an experiment, where dissipation continuously
generates entanglement between two macroscopic objects. This is achieved by
engineering the dissipation using laser- and magnetic fields, and leads to
robust event-ready entanglement maintained for 0.04s at room temperature. Our
system consists of two ensembles containing about 10^{12} atoms and separated
by 0.5m coupled to the environment composed of the vacuum modes of the
electromagnetic field. By combining the dissipative mechanism with a continuous
measurement, steady state entanglement is continuously generated and observed
for up to an hour.
