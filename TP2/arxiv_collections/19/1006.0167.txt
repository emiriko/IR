I study magnetic quantum oscillations in antiferromagnetic conductors with
small carrier pockets and show that combining the oscillation data with
symmetry arguments and with the knowledge of the possible positions of the band
extrema may allow us to greatly constrain or even uniquely determine the
location of a detected carrier pocket in the Brillouin zone.
