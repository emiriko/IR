The authors show that it is possible to rotate the magnetization of a
multiferroic (strain-coupled two-layer magnetostrictive-piezoelectric)
nanomagnet by a large angle with a small electrostatic potential. This can
implement Bennett clocking in nanomagnetic logic arrays resulting in
unidirectional propagation of logic bits from one stage to another. This method
of Bennett clocking is superior to using spin-transfer torque or local magnetic
fields for magnetization rotation. For realistic parameters, it is shown that a
potential of ~ 0.2 V applied to a multiferroic nanomagnet can rotate its
magnetization by nearly 900 to implement Bennett clocking.
