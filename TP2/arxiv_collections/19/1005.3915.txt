We obtained Herschel PACS and SPIRE images of the thermal emission of the
debris disk around the A5V star {\beta} Pic. The disk is well resolved in the
PACS filters at 70, 100, and 160 {\mu}m. The surface brightness profiles
between 70 and 160 {\mu}m show no significant asymmetries along the disk, and
are compatible with 90% of the emission between 70 and 160 {\mu}m originating
in a region closer than 200 AU to the star. Although only marginally resolving
the debris disk, the maps obtained in the SPIRE 250 - 500 {\mu}m filters
provide full-disk photometry, completing the SED over a few octaves in
wavelength that had been previously inaccessible. The small far-infrared
spectral index ({\beta} = 0.34) indicates that the grain size distribution in
the inner disk (<200AU) is inconsistent with a local collisional equilibrium.
The size distribution is either modified by non-equilibrium effects, or
exhibits a wavy pattern, caused by an under-abundance of impactors which have
been removed by radiation pressure.
