The work of astronomers is getting more complex and advanced as the progress
of computer development occurs. With improved computing capabilities and
increased data flow, more sophisticated software is required in order to
interpret, and fully exploit, astronomic data. However, it is not possible for
every astronomer to also be a software specialist. As history has shown, the
work of scientists always becomes increasingly specialised, and we here argue
in favour of another, at least partial, split between "programmers" and
"interpreters". In this presentation we outline our vision for a new approach
and symbiosis between software specialists and scientists, and present its
advantages along with a simple test case.
