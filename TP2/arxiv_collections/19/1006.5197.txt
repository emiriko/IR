We present a broad class of states which are diagonal in the basis of N-qubit
GHZ states such that non-positivity under the partial transpose operation is
necessary and sufficient for the presence of entanglement. This class includes
many naturally arising instances such as dephased or depolarised GHZ states.
Furthermore, our proof directly leads to an entanglement witness which
saturates this bound. The witness is applied to thermal GHZ states to prove
that the entanglement can be extremely robust to system imperfections.
