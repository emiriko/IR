An outstanding question in the physics of soft jammed packings concerns the
nature of the correlations that arise near the unjamming transition. In this
work, we treat unjamming as a constraint satisfaction problem and demonstrate
that a static correlation function, which probes sensitivity to boundary
conditions,exhibits a diverging correlation length as the packing is
decompressed. This length scale is related to isostaticity, and has been
connected earlier to the existence of soft modes in isostatic packings. The
form of the correlation function is remarkably similar to one predicted in the
mosaic theory of the glass transition, and we relate the nature of the growing
correlations to the entropy of packings.
