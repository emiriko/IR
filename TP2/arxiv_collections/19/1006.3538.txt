We present an abundance analysis based on high resolution spectra of 10 stars
selected to span the full range in metallicity in the Ursa Minor dwarf
spheroidal galaxy. We find [Fe/H] for the sample stars ranges from -1.35 to
-3.10 dex and establish the trends of the abundance ratios [X/Fe]. In key
cases, particularly for the alpha-elements, these resemble those for stars in
the outer part of the Galactic halo, especially at the lowest metallicities
probed. The n-capture elements show a r-process distribution over the full
range of Fe-metallicity. This suggests that the duration of star formation in
the UMi dSph was shorter than in other dSph galaxies. The derived ages for a
larger sample of UMi stars with more uncertain metallicities also suggest a
population dominated by uniformly old (~13 Gyr) stars, with a hint of an
age-metallicity relationship.
  In comparing our results for UMi, our earlier work in Draco, and published
studies of more metal-rich dSph Galactic satellites, there appears to be a
pattern of moving from a chemical inventory for dSph giants with [Fe/H] < -2
dex which is very similar to that of stars in the outer part of the Galactic
halo (enhanced alpha/Fe relative to the Sun, coupled with subsolar [X/Fe] for
the heavy neutron capture elements and r-process domination), switching to
subsolar alpha-elements and super-solar s-process dominated neutron capture
elements for the highest [Fe/H] dSph stars. The combination of low star
formation rates over a varying and sometimes extended duration that produced
the stellar populations in the local dSph galaxies with [Fe/H] > -1.5 dex leads
to a chemical inventory wildly discrepant from that of any component of the
Milky Way.
