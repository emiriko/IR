Eliashberg theory generalized for the account of the electron-hole
nonequivalence and electron correlations in the vertex function is used. The
phonon contribution to the nodal electron Green function in cuprates is viewed.
At non- zero temperatures the singularities (kinks) in the frequency behavior
of a real and imaginary part of an electron nodal Green function, and also in
the nodal part of the density of the electron states modified by an
electron-phonon interaction are studied. It is shown that near the optimal
doping both the low-energy and high-energy nodal Green function kinks and also
the abnormal broadening of a band in cuprates are reproduced with the
electron-phonon interaction in the extended Eliashberg theory.
