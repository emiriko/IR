The multiple zeta values are generalizations of the values of the Riemann
zeta function at positive integers. They are known to satisfy a number of
relations, among which are the cyclic sum formula. The cyclic sum formula can
be stratified via linear operators defined by the second and third authors. We
give the number of relations belonging to each stratum by combinatorial
arguments.
