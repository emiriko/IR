Nonlinear dynamics of a bouncing ball moving in gravitational field and
colliding with a moving limiter is considered. Several simple models of table
motion are studied and compared. Dependence of displacement of the table on
time, approximating sinusoidal motion and making analytical computations
possible, is assumed as quadratic and cubic functions of time, respectively.
