I will review the latest developments in determining the CP-violating phases
of the CKM matrix elements from measurements by the BaBar and BELLE experiments
at the high-luminosity B factories (PEP-II and KEKB). The emphasis will be on
the angle gamma/phi_3 of the Unitarity Triangle, which is the relative phase
arg(-V_ud V_ub^*/V_cd V_cb^*), or the CP-violating phase of the b to u
transition in the commonly used Wolfenstein convention.
