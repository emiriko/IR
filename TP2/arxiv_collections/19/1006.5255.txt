Many experiments seek dark matter by detecting relatively low energy nuclear
recoils. Yet since events from ordinary physics with energies in the 1-100 KeV
range are commonplace, all claims of signals or their absence hinge on
exhaustive calibrations and background rejection. We document many curious and
consistent discrepancies between the backgrounds which neutrons can produce
versus the picture of neutrons and claims of neutron calibration found in dark
matter literature. Much of the actual physics of neutrons is either
under-recognized or under-reported, opening up new interpretations of current
data. All signals seen so far, including those presented tentatively such as
CoGENT, or the bold claims and time dependence of DAMA/LIBRA, appear to be
consistent with neutron-induced backgrounds. At the same time it is the burden
of proof of experimental groups to support their claims no possible background
could matter, not ours. The existing hypotheses about backgrounds stated by
experiments, accepted at face value and as published, make possible a variety
of neutron-induced events to be registered as dark matter signals.
