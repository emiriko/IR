We have measured the azimuthal anisotropy of pi0's for 1 < pT < 18 GeV/c for
Au+Au collisions at sqrt s_NN = 200 GeV. The observed anisotropy shows a
gradual decrease in 3 < pT < 7 - 10 GeV/c, but remains positive beyond 10
GeV/c. The magnitude of this anisotropy is under-predicted, up to at least 10
GeV/c, by current perturbative QCD (pQCD) energy-loss model calculations. An
estimate of the increase in anisotropy expected from initial-geometry
modification due to gluon saturation effects and initial-geometry fluctuations
is insufficient to account for this discrepancy. Calculations which implement a
path length dependence steeper than what is implied by current pQCD energy-loss
models, show reasonable agreement with the data.
