The classical relationship between the Tutte polynomial of graph theory and
the Potts model of statistical mechanics has resulted in valuable interactions
between the disciplines. Unfortunately, it does not include the external
magnetic fields that appear in most Potts model applications. Here we define
the V-polynomial, which lifts the classical relationship between the Tutte
polynomial and the zero field Potts model to encompass external magnetic
fields. The V-polynomial generalizes Nobel and Welsh's W-polynomial, which
extends the Tutte polynomial by incorporating vertex weights and adapting
contraction to accommodate them. We prove that the variable field Potts model
partition function (with its many specializations) is an evaluation of the
V-polynomial, and hence a polynomial with deletion-contraction reduction and
Fortuin-Kasteleyn type representation. This unifies an important segment of
Potts model theory and brings previously successful combinatorial machinery,
including complexity results, to bear on a wider range of statistical mechanics
models.
