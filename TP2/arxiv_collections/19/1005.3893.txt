The B-factories have successfully exploited the unique advantages of the
Upsilon(4S) resonance to study many aspects of Bd and Bu mesons. The
Upsilon(10860) (aka Upsilon(5S)) resonance, which is above mass threshold for
the Bs and shares many of the same advantages, has been relatively unexplored.
The Belle experiment has collected more than 120 fb-1 at the Upsilon(10860) and
7.9 fb-1 at higher energies, corresponding to more than 7 million Bs events.
Recent results based on ~20% of these data are presented and prospects for
future possiblities discussed.
