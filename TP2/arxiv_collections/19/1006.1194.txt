We report the formation of a novel ferromagnetic state in the antiferromagnet
BiFeO3 at the interface with La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. Using x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism at Mn and Fe L2,3-edges, we discovered that the development of this
ferromagnetic spin structure is strongly associated with the onset of a
significant exchange bias. Our results demonstrate that the magnetic state is
directly related with an electronic orbital reconstruction at the interface,
which is supported by the linearly polarized x-ray absorption measurement at
oxygen K-edge.
