The electric dipole moment (EDM) of the top quark is calculated in a model
with a vector like multiplet which mixes with the third generation in an
extension of the MSSM. Such mixings allow for new CP violating phases.
Including these new CP phases, the EDM of the top in this class of models is
computed. The top EDM arises from loops involving the exchange of the W, the Z
as well as from the exchange involving the charginos, the neutralinos, the
gluino, and the vector like multiplet and their superpartners. The analysis of
the EDM of the top is more complicated than for the light quarks because the
mass of the external fermion, in this case the top quark mass cannot be ignored
relative to the masses inside the loops. A numerical analysis is presented and
it is shown that the top EDM could be close to $10^{-19} ecm$ consistent with
the current limits on the EDM of the electron, the neutron and on atomic EDMs.
A top EDM of size $10^{-19}ecm$ could be accessible in collider experiments
such as the ILC.
