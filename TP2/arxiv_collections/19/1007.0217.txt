We consider the problem of choosing Euclidean points to maximize the sum of
their weighted pairwise distances, when each point is constrained to a ball
centered at the origin. We derive a dual minimization problem and show strong
duality holds (i.e., the resulting upper bound is tight) when some locally
optimal configuration of points is affinely independent. We sketch a polynomial
time algorithm for finding a near-optimal set of points.
