The PICASSO project is using superheated droplets of C$_4$F$_{10}$ for the
direct detection of Dark Matter candidates in the {\it spin-dependent} (SD)
sector. The total setup includes 32 detectors installed in the SNOLAB
underground laboratory in Sudbury (Ontario, Canada). With a concentrated effort
in detector purification and with new discrimination tools now available for
analysis, Picasso published competitive results in June 2009 \cite{publi2009}
and became the leading experiment in the SD sector of direct dark matter
searches. The present level of sensitivity is at 0.16 pb on protons at 90% C.L.
(M$_W$= 24GeV/c$^2$) following an analysis of two detectors only. The rest of
the detectors are now in the process of being analyzed and the experimental
search continues in order to further improve the limits or hopefully discover a
signal of dark matter. The status of the experiment and the ongoing analysis
will be presented.
