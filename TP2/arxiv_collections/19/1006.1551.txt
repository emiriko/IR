Climate change has been a popular topic for a number of years now. Computer
Science has contributed to aiding humanity in reducing energy requirements and
consequently global warming. Much of this work is through calculators which
determine a user's carbon footprint. However there are no expert systems which
can offer advice in an efficient and time saving way. There are many
publications which do offer advice on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
but to find the advice the reader seeks will involve reading a lot of
irrelevant material. This work built an expert system (which we call
EcoHomeHelper) and attempted to show that it is useful in changing people's
behaviour with respect to their GHG emissions and that they will be able to
find the information in a more efficient manner. Twelve participants were used.
Seven of which used the program and five who read and attempted to find advice
by reading from a list. The application itself has current implementations and
the concept further developed, has applications for the future.
