A new computational method for solving the nucleon-deuteron breakup
scattering problem has been applied to study the elastic neutron- and
proton-deuteron scattering on the basis of the configuration-space
Faddeev-Noyes-Noble-Merkuriev equations. This method is based on the
spline-decomposition in the angular variable and on a generalization of the
Numerov method for the hyperradius. The Merkuriev-Gignoux-Laverne approach has
been generalized for arbitrary nucleon-nucleon potentials and with an arbitrary
number of partial waves. The nucleon-deuteron observables at the incident
nucleon energy 3 MeV have been calculated using the charge-independent AV14
nucleon-nucleon potential including the Coulomb force for the proton-deuteron
scattering. Results have been compared with those of other authors and with
experimental proton-deuteron scattering data.
