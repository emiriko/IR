Dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies are ideal objects to test modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND), because in most of these galaxies the accelerations
fall below the threshold below where MOND supposedly applies. We have selected
from the literature a sample of 27 dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies.
MOND is successful in explaining the general shape of the observed rotation
curves for roughly three quarters of the galaxies in the sample presented here.
However, for the remaining quarter, MOND does not adequately explain the
observed rotation curves. Considering the uncertainties in distances and
inclinations for the galaxies in our sample, a small fraction of poor MOND
predictions is expected and is not necessarily a problem for MOND. We have also
made fits taking the MOND acceleration constant, a_0, as a free parameter in
order to identify any systematic trends. We find that there appears to be a
correlation between central surface brightness and the best-fit value of a_0,
in the sense that lower surface brightness galaxies tend to have lower a_0.
However, this correlation depends strongly on a small number of galaxies whose
rotation curves might be uncertain due to either bars or warps. Without these
galaxies, there is less evidence of a trend, but the average value we find for
a_0 ~ 0.7*10^-8 cm s^-2 is somewhat lower than derived from previous studies.
Such lower fitted values of a_0 could occur if external gravitational fields
are important.
