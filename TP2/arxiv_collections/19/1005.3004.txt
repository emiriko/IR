We investigate several coordinate systems and dynamical vector fields for
target tracking to be used in driver assistance systems. We show how to express
the discrete dynamics of maneuvering target vehicles in arbitrary coordinates
starting from the target's and the own (ego) vehicle's assumed dynamical model
in global coordinates. We clarify the notion of "ego compensation" and show how
non-inertial effects are to be included when using a body-fixed coordinate
system for target tracking. We finally compare the tracking error of different
combinations of target tracking coordinates and dynamical vector fields for
simulated data.
