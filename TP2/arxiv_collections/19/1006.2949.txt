The space telescope CoRoT searches for transiting extrasolar planets by
continuously monitoring the optical flux of thousands of stars in several
fields of view. We report the discovery of CoRoT-10b, a giant planet on a
highly eccentric orbit (e=0.53 +/- 0.04) revolving in 13.24 days around a faint
(V=15.22) metal-rich K1V star. We use CoRoT photometry, radial velocity
observations taken with the HARPS spectrograph, and UVES spectra of the parent
star to derive the orbital, stellar and planetary parameters. We derive a
radius of the planet of 0.97 +/- 0.07 R_Jup and a mass of 2.75 +/- 0.16 M_Jup.
The bulk density, rho_pl=3.70 +/- 0.83 g/cm^3, is ~2.8 that of Jupiter. The
core of CoRoT-10b could contain up to 240 M_Earth of heavy elements. Moving
along its eccentric orbit, the planet experiences a 10.6-fold variation in
insolation. Owing to the long circularisation time, tau_circ > 7 Gyr, a
resonant perturber is not required to excite and maintain the high eccentricity
of CoRoT-10b.
