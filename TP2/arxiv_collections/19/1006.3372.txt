We investigate how the geometrical symmetry affects the penetration and
arrangement of vortices in mesoscopic superconductors using self-consistent
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. We find that the entrance of the vortex happens
when the current density at the hot spots reaches the depairing current
density. Through determining the spatial distribution of hot spots, the
geometrical symmetry of the superconducting sample influences the nucleation
and entrance of vortices. Our results propose one possible experimental
approach to control and manipulate the quantum states of mesoscopic
superconductors with their topological geometries, and they can be easily
generalized to the confined superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates.
