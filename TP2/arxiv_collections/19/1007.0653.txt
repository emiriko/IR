We give a proof of Varadhan estimates for a degenerated jump process with
independent increments with more and more jumps which become smaller and
smaller. The proof uses the Malliavin Calculus of Bismut type for jump process
in semi-group theory and Wentzel-Freidlin estimates for jump process in
semi-group theory.
