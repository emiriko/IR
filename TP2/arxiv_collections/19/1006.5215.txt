In the context of a noncommutative model of coordinate coherent states, we
present a Schwarzschild-like metric for a Vaidya solution instead of the
standard Eddington-Finkelstein metric. This leads to the appearance of an exact
$(t - r)$ dependent case of the metric. We analyze the resulting metric in
three possible causal structures. In this setup, we find a zero remnant mass in
the long-time limit, i.e. an instable black hole remnant. We also study the
tunneling process across the quantum horizon of such a Vaidya black hole. The
tunneling probability including the time-dependent part is obtained by using
the tunneling method proposed by Parikh and Wilczek in terms of the
noncommutative parameter $\sigma$. After that, we calculate the entropy
associated to this noncommutative black hole solution. However the corrections
are fundamentally trifling; one could respect this as a consequence of quantum
inspection at the level of semiclassical quantum gravity.
