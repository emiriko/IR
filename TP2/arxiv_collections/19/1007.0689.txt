We present a consistent renormalization of the top and bottom quark/squark
sector of the MSSM with complex parameters (cMSSM). Various renormalization
schemes are defined, analyzed analytically and tested numerically in the decays
Stop_2 -> Sbot_i H+/W+ (i = 1,2). No scheme is found that produces numerically
acceptable results over all the cMSSM parameter space, where problems occur
mostly already for real parameters. Two schemes are identified that show the
most robust behavior. A numerical analysis of the four partial stop decay
widths is performed in our "preferred" scheme, "m_b, A_b DRbar". The full
one-loop corrections to the corresponding partial decay widths are evaluated
including hard QED and QCD radiation. We find mostly modest corrections at the
one-loop level.
