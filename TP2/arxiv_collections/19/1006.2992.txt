In games with a large number of players where players may have overlapping
objectives, the analysis of stable outcomes typically depends on player types.
A special case is when a large part of the player population consists of
imitation types: that of players who imitate choice of other (optimizing)
types. Game theorists typically study the evolution of such games in dynamical
systems with imitation rules. In the setting of games of infinite duration on
finite graphs with preference orderings on outcomes for player types, we
explore the possibility of imitation as a viable strategy. In our setup, the
optimising players play bounded memory strategies and the imitators play
according to specifications given by automata. We present algorithmic results
on the eventual survival of types.
