Asteroseismology is able to conduct studies on the interiors of solar-type
stars from the analysis of stellar acoustic spectra. However, such an analysis
process often has to rely upon subjective choices made throughout. A recurring
problem is to determine whether a signal in the acoustic spectrum originates
from a radial or a dipolar oscillation mode. In order to overcome this problem,
we present a procedure for modelling and fitting the autocovariance of the
power spectrum which can be used to obtain global seismic parameters of
solar-type stars, doing so in an automated fashion without the need to make
subjective choices. From the set of retrievable global seismic parameters we
emphasize the mean small frequency separation and, depending on the intrinsic
characteristics of the power spectrum, the mean rotational frequency splitting.
Since this procedure is automated, it can serve as a useful tool in the
analysis of the more than one thousand solar-type stars expected to be observed
as part of the Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation (KAI). We apply the
aforementioned procedure to simulations of the Sun. Assuming different apparent
magnitudes, we address the issues of how accurately and how precisely we can
retrieve the several global seismic parameters were the Sun to be observed as
part of the KAI.
