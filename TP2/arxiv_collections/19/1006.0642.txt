We present preliminary results of 7 years of Arecibo timing of the
pulsar-white dwarf binary PSR J1738+0333. We can measure the proper motion,
parallax with excellent precision and have detected the orbital decay.
Furthermore, the companion has been detected at optical wavelengths and a mass
ratio of 8.1 +/- 0.3 has been measured from the orbital variation of its
Doppler shift. Once the companion mass is determined from the optical
measurements, this system will provide strong limits for the radiation of
dipolar gravitational waves. Assuming that general relativity holds, the
fast-improving measurement of the orbital decay, combined with the measurement
of the mass ratio, will provide an independent and precise measurement of the
component masses.
