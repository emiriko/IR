We derive the renormalization group equations describing all the short-range
interactions in bilayer graphene allowed by symmetry and the long range Coulomb
interaction. For certain range of parameters, we predict the first order phase
transition to the uniaxially deformed gapless state accompanied by the change
of the topology of the electron spectrum.
