We study the cosmic dynamics of a magnetic universe supported by non-linear
electrodynamics (NLED) Lagrangeans that are proportional to powers of the
electromagnetic invariant $\propto F^{1/(1-m)}$ ($m$ is an overall constant).
For simplicity we focus in the case when $F$ depends on the magnetic field
alone, a case dubbed in the bibliography as ''magnetic universe''. Our results
demonstrate that, depending on the values of the free parameter $m$, the
magnetic field can mimic phantom field behavior, an effect previously found in
other contexts. It is demonstrated that, since there are found equilibrium
points in the phase space of these models that can be associated with
magnetic-dominated past and future attractors, a combination of positive and
negative powers of $F$ may lead to interesting cosmological behavior. In
particular, a cosmological scenario where the universe might evolve from a past
NLED-driven (non-inflationary) state into a future (late-time) -- also
NLED-driven -- inflationary stage, transiting through a matter-dominated
solution, is envisioned. The impact of braneworld gravity on the dynamics
driven by such NLED Lagrangeans is also investigated. It is demonstrated that,
due to phantom property at late times, the non-linear electromagnetic effects
may play an important role in deciding the fate of the cosmic evolution.
Randall-Sundrum brane effects, in particular, modify the nature of the starting
point of the cosmic evolution, as well as the fate of the expansion: both, the
big bang singularity and the big rip event -- inherent in general relativity
with phantom matter source --, may be avoided.
