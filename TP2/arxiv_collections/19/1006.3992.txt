Bayesian methods are becoming more widely used in asteroseismic analysis. In
particular, they are being used to determine oscillation frequencies, which are
also commonly found by Fourier analysis. It is important to establish whether
the Bayesian methods provide an improvement on Fourier methods. We compare,
using simulated data, the standard iterative sine-wave fitting method against a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code that has been introduced to infer purely
the frequencies of oscillation modes (Brewer et al. 2007). A uniform prior
probability distribution function is used for the MCMC method. We find the
methods do equally well at determining the correct oscillation frequencies,
although the Bayesian method is able to highlight the possibility of a
misidentification due to aliasing, which can be useful. In general, we suggest
that the least computationally intensive method is preferable.
