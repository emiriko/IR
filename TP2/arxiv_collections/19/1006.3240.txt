Here, we consider damped two-components Bose-Einstein condensates with
many-body interactions. We show that, when the external trapping potential has
a double-well shape and when the nonlinear coupling factors are modulated in
time, hysteresis effects may appear under some circumstances. Such hysteresis
phenomena are a result of the joint contribution between the appearance of
saddle node bifurcations and damping effect.
