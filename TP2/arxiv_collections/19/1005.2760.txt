Memory effect of Brownian motion in an incompressible fluid is studied. The
reasoning is based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism and a new formulation of the
Langevin force as a result of collisions between an effective and the Brownian
particles. Thus, the stochastic force autocorrelation function with finite
dispersion and the corresponding Brownian particle velocity autocorrelation
function are obtained.
