In this paper, a study of two-photon and two-gluon decays in the context of
p-wave heavy quarkonia is presented. Within the covariant light-front
framework, the annihilation rates of scalar and tensor quarkonium states are
derived. In the absence of free parameters in this case, the results for the
charmonium decay widths are consistent with the experimental data. However, in
comparison to other theoretical calculations, there are large discrepancies in
our results regarding bottomonia.
