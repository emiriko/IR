Here we report on a "new" type of ordering which allows to modify the
electronic structure of a graphene monolayer (ML). We have intercalated small
gold clusters between the top monolayer graphene and the buffer layer of
epitaxial graphene. We show that these clusters perturb the quasiparticles on
the ML graphene, and act as quantum dots creating a superlattice of resonators
on the graphene ML, as revealed by a strong pattern of standing waves. A
detailed analysis of the standing wave patterns using Fourier Transform
Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy strongly indicates that this phenomenon can
arise from a strong modification of the band structure of graphene and (or)
from Charge Density Waves (CDW)where a large extension of Van Hove
singularities are involved.
