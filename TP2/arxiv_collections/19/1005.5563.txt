We reconsider basic, in the sense of minimal field content, Pati-Salam x
SU(3) family models which make use of the Type I see-saw mechanism to reproduce
the observed mixing and mass spectrum in the neutrino sector. The goal of this
is to achieve the observed baryon asymmetry through the thermal decay of the
lightest right-handed neutrino and at the same time to be consistent with the
expected experimental lepton flavour violation sensitivity. This kind of models
have been previously considered but it was not possible to achieve a
compatibility among all of the ingredients mentioned above. We describe then
how different SU(3) messengers, the heavy fields that decouple and produce the
right form of the Yukawa couplings together with the scalars breaking the SU(3)
symmetry, can lead to different Yukawa couplings. This in turn implies
different consequences for flavour violation couplings and conditions for
realizing the right amount of baryon asymmetry through the decay of the
lightest right-handed neutrino. Also a highlight of the present work is a new
fit of the Yukawa textures traditionally embedded in SU(3) family models.
