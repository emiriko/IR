The unique Honeycomb nebula, most likely a peculiar supernova remnant, lies
in 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Due to its proximity to SN1987A,
it has been serendipitously and intentionally observed at many wavelengths.
Here, an optical spectral analysis of forbidden line ratios is performed in
order to compare the Honeycomb high-speed gas with supernova remnants in the
Galaxy and the LMC, with galactic Wolf-Rayet nebulae and with the optical line
emission from the interaction zone of the SS433 microquasar and W50 supernova
remnant system. An empirical spatiokinematic model of the images and spectra
for the Honeycomb reveals that its striking appearance is most likely due to a
fortuitous viewing angle. The Honeycomb nebula is more extended in soft X-ray
emission and could in fact be a small part of the edge of a giant LMC shell
revealed for the first time in this short wavelength domain. It is also
suggested that a previously unnoticed region of optical emission may in fact be
an extension of the Honeycomb around the edge of this giant shell. A secondary
supernova explosion in the edge of a giant shell is considered for the creation
of the Honeycomb nebula. A microquasar origin of the Honeycomb nebula as
opposed to a simple supernova origin is also evaluated.
