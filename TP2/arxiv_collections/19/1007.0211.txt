We present the first results from tests of a MICROMEGAS detector manufactured
using the so-called "bulk" technology and having a resistive cathode mesh
instead of the conventional metallic one. This detector operates as usual
MICROMEGAS, but in the case of sparks, which may appear at high gas gains, the
resistive mesh reduces their current and makes the sparks harmless. This
approach could be complementary to the ongoing efforts of various groups to
develop spark-protected MICROMEGAS with resistive anode planes.
