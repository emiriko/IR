We study mass transfer by Roche lobe overflow in close-in exoplanetary
systems. The planet's atmospheric gas passes through the inner Lagrangian point
and flows along a narrow stream, accelerating to 100-$200\kms$ velocity before
forming an accretion disk. We show that the cylinder-shaped accretion stream
can have an area (projected in the plane of the sky) comparable to that of the
planet and a significant optical depth to spectral line absorption. Such a
"transiting cylinder" may produce an earlier ingress of the planet transit, as
suggested by recent HST observations of the WASP-12 system. The asymmetric disk
produced by the accretion stream may also lead to time-dependent obscuration of
the star light and apparent earlier ingress. We also consider the interaction
of the stellar wind with the planetary magnetosphere. Since the wind speed is
subsonic/sub-Alfvenic and comparable to the orbital velocity of the planet, the
head of the magnetopause lies eastward relative to the substellar line (the
line joining the planet and the star). The gas around the magnetopause may, if
sufficiently compressed, give rise to asymmetric ingress/egress during the
planet transit, although more works are needed to evaluate this possibility.
