We experimentally demonstrate quantum process tomography of controlled-Z and
controlled-NOT gates using capacitively-coupled superconducting phase qubits.
These gates are realized by using the $|2\rangle$ state of the phase qubit. We
obtain a process fidelity of 0.70 for the controlled-phase and 0.56 for the
controlled-NOT gate, with the loss of fidelity mostly due to single-qubit
decoherence. The controlled-Z gate is also used to demonstrate a two-qubit
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm with a single function query.
