In this review, we provide an account of the recent progress in understanding
electronic transport in disordered graphene systems. Starting from a
theoretical description that emphasizes the role played by band structure
properties and lattice symmetries, we describe the nature of disorder in these
systems and its relation to transport properties. While the focus is primarily
on theoretical and conceptual aspects, connections to experiments are also
included. Issues such as short versus long-range disorder, localization (strong
and weak), the carrier density dependence of the conductivity, and conductance
fluctuations are considered and some open problems are pointed out.
