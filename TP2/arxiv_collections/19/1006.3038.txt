NOON states (states of the form $|N>_{a}|0>_{b}+|0>_{a}|N>_{b}$ where $a$ and
$b$ are single particle states) have been used for predicting violations of
hidden-variable theories (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger violations) and are
valuable in metrology for precision measurements of phase at the Heisenberg
limit. We show theoretically how the use of two Fock state/Bose-Einstein
condensates as sources in a modified Mach Zender interferometer can lead to the
creation of the NOON state in which $a$ and $b$ refer to arms of the
interferometer and $N$ is the total number of particles in the two condensates.
The modification of the interferometer involves making conditional ``side''
measurements of a few particles near the sources. These measurements put the
remaining particles in a superposition of two phase states, which are converted
into NOON states by a beam splitter. The result is equivalent to the quantum
experiment in which a large molecule passes through two slits. The NOON states
are combined in a final beam splitter and show interference. Attempts to detect
through which ``slit'' the condensates passed destroys the interference.
