Recently the peak luminosity achieved on the DA{\Phi}NE collider has been
improved by almost a factor three by implementing a novel collision scheme
based on large Piwinski angle and Crab-Waist. This encouraging result opened
new perspectives for physics research and a new run with the KLOE-2 detector
has been scheduled to start by spring 2010. The KLOE-2 installation is a
complex operation requiring a careful design effort and a several months long
shutdown. The high luminosity interaction region has been deeply revised in
order to take into account the effect on the beam caused by the solenoidal
field of the experimental detector and to ensure background rejection. The
shutdown has been also used to implement several other modifications aimed at
improving beam dynamics: the wiggler poles have been displaced from the magnet
axis in order to cancel high order terms in the field, the feedback systems
have been equipped with stronger power supplies and more efficient kickers and
electrodes have been inserted inside the wiggler and the dipole vacuum
chambers, in the positron ring, to avoid the e-cloud formation. A low level RF
feedback has been added to the cavity control in both rings.
