The Dark Matter Time Projection Chamber (DMTPC) is a low pressure (75 Torr
CF4) 10 liter detector capable of measuring the vector direction of nuclear
recoils with the goal of directional dark matter detection. In this paper we
present the first dark matter limit from DMTPC. In an analysis window of 80-200
keV recoil energy, based on a 35.7 g-day exposure, we set a 90% C.L. upper
limit on the spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross section of 2.0 x 10^{-33} cm^{2}
for 115 GeV/c^2 dark matter particle mass.
