This article is meant to provide an additional point of view, applying known
knowledge, to supply keys that have a series of non-repeating digits, in a
manner that is not usually thought of. Traditionally, prime numbers are used in
encryption as keys that have non-repeating sequences. Usually, non-repetition,
especially of digits in a key, is very sought after in encryption. Uniqueness
in a digit sequence defeats decryption. In searching for methods of
non-decryptable encryption as well as ways to provide unique sequences, other
than using prime numbers [5], the idea of using repeating decimals came to me.
Applied correctly, a repeating decimal series of sufficient length will stand
in as well for a prime number. This is so, because only numbers prime to each
other will produce repeating decimals and; within the repeating sequence there
is uniqueness of digit sequence.
