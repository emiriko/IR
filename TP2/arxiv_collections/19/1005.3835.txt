We consider scheduling packets with values in a capacity-bounded buffer in an
online setting. In this model, there is a buffer with limited capacity $B$. At
any time, the buffer cannot accommodate more than $B$ packets. Packets arrive
over time. Each packet is associated with a non-negative value. Packets leave
the buffer only because they are either sent or dropped. Those packets that
have left the buffer will not be reconsidered for delivery any more. In each
time step, at most one packet in the buffer can be sent. The order in which the
packets are sent should comply with the order of their arrival time. The
objective is to maximize the total value of the packets sent in an online
manner. In this paper, we study a variant of this FIFO buffering model in which
a packet's value is either 1 or $\alpha > 1$. We present a deterministic
memoryless 1.304-competitive algorithm. This algorithm has the same competitive
ratio as the one presented in (Lotker and Patt-Shamir. PODC 2002, Computer
Networks 2003). However, our algorithm is simpler and does not employ any
marking bits. The idea used in our algorithm is novel and different from all
previous approaches applied for the general model and its variants. We do not
proactively preempt one packet when a new packet arrives. Instead, we may
preempt more than one 1-value packet when the buffer contains sufficiently many
$\alpha$-value packets.
