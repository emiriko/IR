The operation of atomic clocks is generally carried out at room temperature,
whereas the definition of the second refers to the clock transition in an atom
at absolute zero. This implies that the clock transition frequency should be
corrected in practice for the effect of finite temperature of which the leading
contributor is the blackbody radiation (BBR) shift. Experimental measurements
of the BBR shifts are difficult. In this work, we have calculated the blackbody
radiation shift of the ground-state hyperfine microwave transition in 87Rb
using the relativistic all-order method and carried out detailed evaluation of
the accuracy of our final value. Particular care is taken to accurately account
for the contributions from highly-excited states. Our predicted value for the
Stark coefficient, k_S=-1.240(4)\times 10^{-10}\text{Hz/(V/m)}^{2} is three
times more accurate than the previous calculation [1].
