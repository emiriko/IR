Abundances of 15 chemical elements have been derived for 28 F and 16 A stars
members of the Hyades open cluster in order to set constraints on
self-consistent evolutionary models including radiative and turbulent
diffusion. A spectral synthesis iterative procedure was applied to derive the
abundances from selected high quality lines in high resolution high
signal-to-noise spectra obtained with SOPHIE and AURELIE at the Observatoire de
Haute Provence. The abundance patterns found for A and F stars in the Hyades
resemble those observed in Coma Berenices and Pleiades clusters. In graphs
representing the abundances versus the effective temperature, A stars often
display abundances much more scattered around their mean values than the
coolest F stars do. Large star-to-star variations are detected in the Hyades A
dwarfs in their abundances of C, Na, Sc, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y and Zr, which we
interpret as evidence of transport processes competing with radiative
diffusion. In A and Am stars, the abundances of Cr, Ni, Sr, Y and Zr are found
to be correlated with that of iron as in the Pleiades and in Coma Berenices.
The ratios [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are found to be anticorrelated with [Fe/H] as in
Coma Berenices. All Am stars in the Hyades are deficient in C and O and
overabundant in elements heavier than Fe but not all are deficient in calcium
and/or scandium. The F stars have solar abundances for almost all elements
except for Si. The overall shape of the abundance pattern of the slow rotator
HD30210 cannot be entirely reproduced by models including radiative diffusion
and different amounts of turbulent diffusion. While part of the discrepancies
between derived and predicted abundances could be due to non-LTE effects, the
inclusion of competing processes such as rotational mixing and/or mass loss
seems necessary in order to improve the agreement between the observed and
predicted abundance patterns.
