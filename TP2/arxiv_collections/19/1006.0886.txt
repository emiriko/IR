We study quantum oscillations of the magnetization in Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$(111)
surface system in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. The combined
spin-chiral Dirac cone and Landau quantization produce profound effects on the
magnetization properties that are fundamentally different from those in the
conventional semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas. In particular, we show
that the oscillating center in the magnetization chooses to pick up positive or
negative values depending on whether the zero-mode Landau level is occupied or
empty. An intuitive analysis of these new features is given and the subsequent
effects on the magnetic susceptibility and Hall conductance are also discussed.
