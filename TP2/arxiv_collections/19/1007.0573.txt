The interaction between various charmed mesons and charmed baryons are
studied within the framework of the coupled channel unitary approach with the
local hidden gauge formalism. Several meson-baryon dynamically generated narrow
$N^*$ and $\Lambda^*$ resonances with hidden charm are predicted with mass
above 4 GeV and width smaller than 100 MeV. The predicted new resonances
definitely cannot be accommodated by quark models with three constituent quarks
and can be looked for at the forthcoming PANDA/FAIR experiments.
