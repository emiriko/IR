NMR spectra in superfluid A-like phases confined in axially deformed aerogel
in presence of a magnetic field inclined with respect to deformation axis is
considered. The characteristic features of dipole frequency shift in axially
compressed and axially stretched cases are compared. In particular, it is shown
that in axially stretched aerogel environment the stability region of
coherently spin precessing mode is rather narrow due to the U(1)LIM effect.
