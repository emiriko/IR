We report on a solid-state laser structure being the organic counterpart of
the Vertical External-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VECSEL) design. The gain
medium is a poly (methyl methacrylate) film doped with Rhodamine 640,
spin-casted onto the High-Reflectivity mirror of a plano-concave resonator.
Upon pumping by 7-ns pulses at 532 nm, a diffraction-limited beam (M^2=1) was
obtained, with a conversion efficiency of 43%; higher peak powers (2kW) could
be attained when resorting to shorter (0.5 ns) pump pulses. The spectrum was
controlled by the thickness of the active layer playing the role of an
intracavity etalon; tunability is demonstrated over up to 20 nm.
