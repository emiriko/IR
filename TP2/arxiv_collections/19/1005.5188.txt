We study heating effects in a chain of weakly coupled grains due to
electron-hole pair creation. The main mechanism for the latter at low
temperatures is due to inelastic electron cotunneling processes in the array.
We develop a quantitative kinetic theory for these systems and calculate the
array temperature profile as a function of grain parameters, bias voltage or
current, and time and show that for nanoscale size grains the heating effects
are pronounced and easily measurable in experiments. In the low- and
high-voltage limits we solve the stationary heat-flux equation analytically. We
demonstrate the over-heating hysteresis in the large-current or voltage
regimes. In addition we consider the influence of a substrate on the system
which acts as a heat sink. We show that nano dot chains can be used as highly
sensitive thermometers over a broad range of temperatures.
