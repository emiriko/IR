In this paper, we analyze four authentication protocols of Bindu et al.,
Goriparthi et al., Wang et al. and H\"olbl et al.. After investigation, we
reveal several weaknesses of these schemes. First, Bindu et al.'s protocol
suffers from an insider impersonation attack if a malicious user obtains a lost
smart card. Second, both Goriparthi et al.'s and Wang et al.'s protocols cannot
withstand a DoS attack in the password change phase, i.e. an attacker can
involve the phase to make user's password never be used in subsequent
authentications. Third, H\"olbl et al.'s protocol is vulnerable to an insider
attack since a legal but malevolent user can deduce KGC's secret key.
