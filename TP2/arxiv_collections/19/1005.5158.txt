Inspired by ideas from algebraic geometry, Batyrev and the first named author
have introduced the stringy E-function of a Gorenstein polytope. We prove that
this a priori rational function is actually a polynomial, which is part of a
conjecture of Batyrev and the first named author. The proof relies on a
comparison result for the lattice point structure of a Gorenstein polytope P, a
face F of P and the face of the dual Gorenstein polytope corresponding to F. In
addition, we study joins of Gorenstein polytopes and introduce the notion of an
irreducible Gorenstein polytope. We show how these concepts relate to the
decomposition of nef-partitions.
