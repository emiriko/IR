We investigate an effective model Hamiltonian for organometallic complexes
that are widely used in optoelectronic devices. The two most important
parameters in the model are $J$, the effective exchange interaction between the
$\pi$ and $\pi^*$ orbitals of the ligands, and $\epsilon^*$, the renormalized
energy gap between the highest occupied orbitals on the metal and on the
ligand. We find that the degree of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT)
character of the lowest triplet state is strongly dependent on the ratio
$\epsilon^*/J$. $\epsilon^*$ is purely a property of the complex and can be
changed significantly by even small variations in the complex's chemistry, such
as replacing substituents on the ligands. We find that that small changes in
$\epsilon^*/J$ can cause large changes in the properties of the complex,
including the lifetime of the triplet state and the probability of injected
charges (electrons and holes) forming triplet excitations. These results give
some insight into the observed large changes in the photophysical properties of
organometallic complexes caused by small changes in the ligands.
