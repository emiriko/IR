In [Eur. J. Phys. {\bf 25} (2004) 123-126], Dragan V. Red{\v z}i\'c is led to
the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction by comparing electromagnetic images of a
moving point charge and a moving conducting sphere. We wish to point out that
much simpler possibilities intrinsic to electromagnetism already exist from
which we may get at the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis. In
particular we consider an example going back to Poincar\'e in [{\it Bulletin
des Sciences math\'ematiques}, 28, (1904) pp. 302-324], in which he considers
the problem of two moving, parallel line charges in order to get at length
contraction. We develop this model of Poincar\'e and show that it leads not
only to the FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction but also to an elementary derivation
of the composition of velocities formula in special relativity for collinear
velocities.
  Red{\v z}i\'c suggests that, by considering such purely electromagnetic
examples, the Maxwellians could have been led to the contraction hypothesis
much before the time of the Michelson-Morely experiment, and we agree with him
that such elementary results as the ones discussed here could not have escaped
their attention. Apparently, it took an extremely sensitive experiment, not
intrinsic to electromagnetism, such as was the Michelson-Morley experiment,
together with the efforts of persons with authority, like Lorentz and
Poincar\'e, trying to uphold the relativity principle before the radical notion
of length contraction could seriously be entertained, and making ripe the way
for the genius of Einstein.
