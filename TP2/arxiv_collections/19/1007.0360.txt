We study the excitation dynamics of a single molecular nanomagnet by static
and pulsed magnetic fields. Based on a stability analysis of the classical
magnetization dynamics we identify analytically the fields parameters for which
the energy is stochastically pumped into the system in which case the
magnetization undergoes diffusively and irreversibly a large angle deflection.
An approximate analytical expression for the diffusion constant in terms of the
fields parameters is given and assessed by full numerical calculations.
