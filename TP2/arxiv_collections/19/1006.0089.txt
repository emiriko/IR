One of the still open issues for the development of superconducting insertion
devices is the understanding of the beam heat load. With the aim of measuring
the beam heat load to a cold bore and the hope to gain a deeper understanding
in the beam heat load mechanisms, a cold vacuum chamber for diagnostics is
under construction. The following diagnostics will be implemented: i) retarding
field analyzers to measure the electron energy and flux, ii) temperature
sensors to measure the total heat load, iii) pressure gauges, iv) and mass
spectrometers to measure the gas content. The inner vacuum chamber will be
removable in order to test different geometries and materials. This will allow
the installation of the cryostat in different synchrotron light sources.
COLDDIAG will be built to fit in a short straight section at ANKA. A first
installation at the synchrotron light source Diamond is foreseen in June 2011.
Here we describe the technical design report of this device and the planned
measurements with beam.
