Most of the large galaxies host a supermassive black hole, but their origin
is still not well understood. In this paper we look at a possible connection
between the gravitational binding energies of large galaxies etc. and the
masses of their central black holes. Using this relation (between gravitational
binding energy of the host structure and the black hole energy) we argue why
globular clusters are unlikely to harbour large black holes and why dwarf
galaxies, if they have to host black holes, should have observed mass to light
ratios of ~100.
