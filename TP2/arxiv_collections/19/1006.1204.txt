The two CCD photometries of the intermediate polar TV Columbae are made for
obtaining the two updated eclipse timings with high precision. There is an
interval time \sim 17yr since the last mid-eclipse time observed in 1991. Thus,
the new mid-eclipse times can offer an opportunity to check the previous
orbital ephemerides. A calculation indicates that the orbital ephemeris derived
by Augusteijn et al. (1994) should be corrected. Based on the proper linear
ephemeris (Hellier, 1993), the new orbital period analysis suggests a cyclical
period variation in the O-C diagram of TV Columbae. Using Applegate's mechanism
to explain the periodic oscillation in O-C diagram, the required energy is
larger than that a M0-type star can afford over a complete variation period
\sim 31.0(\pm 3.0)yr. Thus, the light travel-time effect indicates that the
tertiary component in TV Columbae may be a dwarf with a low mass, which is near
the mass lower limit \sim 0.08Msun as long as the inclination of the third body
high enough.
