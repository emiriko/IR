Correlated imaging through atmospheric turbulence is studied, and the
analytical expressions describing turbulence effects on image resolution are
derived. Compared with direct imaging, correlated imaging can reduce the
influence of turbulence to a certain extent and reconstruct high-resolution
images. The result is backed up by numerical simulations, in which
turbulence-induced phase perturbations are simulated by random phase screens
inserting propagation paths.
