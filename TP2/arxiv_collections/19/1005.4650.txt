Twin-Signal-Recycling (TSR) builds on the resonance doublet of two optically
coupled cavities and efficiently enhances the sensitivity of an interferometer
at a dedicated signal frequency. We report on the first experimental
realization of a Twin-Signal-Recycling Michelson interferometer and also its
broadband enhancement by squeezed light injection. The complete setup was
stably locked and a broadband quantum noise reduction of the interferometers
shot noise by a factor of up to 4\,dB was demonstrated. The system was
characterized by measuring its quantum noise spectra for several tunings of the
TSR cavities. We found good agreement between the experimental results and
numerical simulations.
