We investigate the ground-state phase diagram for the ferromagnetic Kondo
lattice model on a triangular lattice by a variational calculation for various
spin orderings up to a four-site unit cell. We find that a noncoplanar
four-sublattice ordering with a finite scalar spin chirality emerges at and
around 1/4 filling, in addition to the 3/4-filled case, which was predicted to
be induced by the perfect nesting of the Fermi surface [I. Martin and C. D.
Batista: Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101} (2008) 156402]. The 1/4-filling phase is
stable in a wider range of parameters than the 3/4-filling one, and includes a
large region of gapped insulating state characterized by a Chern number. We
also compute the Hall conductivity in the chiral-ordered phases.
