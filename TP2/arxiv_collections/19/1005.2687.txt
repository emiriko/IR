The local universe is the best known part of our universe. Within the CLUES
project (http://clues-project.org - Constrained Local UniversE Simulations) we
perform numerical simulations of the evolution of the local universe. For these
simulations we construct initial conditions based on observational data of the
galaxy distribution in the local universe. Here we review the technique of
these constrained simulations. In the second part we summarize our predictions
of a possible Warm Dark Matter cosmology for the observed local distribution of
galaxies and the local spectrum of mini-voids as well as a study of the
satellite dynamics in a simulated Local Group.
