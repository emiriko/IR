We consider the cosmology of a 3-brane universe, in a five dimensional space
time (Bulk). We present some solutions to the five-dimensional Einstein
equation, where a perfect fluid is confined to the 3-brane. We investigate the
evolution of brane for two models of bulk. We choose ordinary and modified
polytropic gas in brane and it is seen that these models have some new
features.
