Five dimensional warped spaces with soft walls are generalizations of the
standard Randall-Sundrum compactifications, where instead of an infrared brane
one has a curvature singularity (with vanishing warp factor) at finite proper
distance in the bulk. We project the physics near the singularity onto a
hypersurface located a small distance away from it in the bulk. This results in
a completely equivalent description of the soft wall in terms of an effective
infrared brane, hiding any singular point. We perform explicitly this
calculation for two classes of soft wall backgrounds used in the literature.
The procedure has several advantages. It separates in a clean way the physics
of the soft wall from the physics of the five dimensional bulk, facilitating a
more direct comparison with standard two-brane warped compactifications.
Moreover, consistent soft walls show a sort of universal behavior near the
singularity which is reflected in the effective brane Lagrangian. Thirdly, for
many purposes, a good approximation is obtained by assuming the bulk background
away from the singularity to be the usual Randall-Sundrum metric, thus making
the soft wall backgrounds better analytically tractable. We check the validity
of this procedure by calculating the spectrum of bulk fields and comparing it
to the exact result, finding very good agreement.
