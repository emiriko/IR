A new approach to the solution of quasilinear nonelliptic first-order systems
of inhomogeneous PDEs in many dimensions is presented. It is based on a version
of the conditional symmetry and Riemann invariant methods. We discuss in detail
the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of rank-2 and rank-3
solutions expressible in terms of Riemann invariants. We perform the analysis
using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for a certain algebraic system associated
with the initial system. The problem of finding such solutions has been reduced
to expanding a set of trace conditions on wave vectors and their profiles which
are expressible in terms of Riemann invariants. A couple of theorems useful for
the construction of such solutions are given. These theoretical considerations
are illustrated by the example of inhomogeneous equations of fluid dynamics
which describe motion of an ideal fluid subjected to gravitational and Coriolis
forces. Several new rank-2 solutions are obtained. Some physical interpretation
of these results is given.
