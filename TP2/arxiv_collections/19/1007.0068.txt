We investigate the relation between the entanglement and the robustness of a
multipartite system to a depolarization noise. We find that the robustness of a
two-qubit system in an arbitrary pure state depends completely on its
entanglement. However, this is not always true in a three-qubit system. There
is a residual effect on the robustness of a three-qubit system in an arbitrary
superposition of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and W state. Its
entanglement determines the trend of its robustness. However, there is a
splitting on its robustness under the same entanglement. Its robustness not
only has the same periodicity as its three-tangle but also alters with its
three-tangle synchronously. There is also a splitting on the robustness of an
$n$-qubit ($n>3$) system although it is more complicated.
