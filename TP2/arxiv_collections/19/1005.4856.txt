We report neutron scattering studies on static magnetic orders and spin
excitations in the Fe-based chalcogenide system
Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ with different Fe and Se compositions.
Short-range static magnetic order with the "bicollinear" spin configuration is
found in all non-superconducting samples, with strong low-energy magnetic
excitations near the $(0.5,0)$ in-plane wave-vector (using the two-Fe unit
cell) for Se doping up to 45%. When the static order disappears and bulk
superconductivity emerges, the spectral weight of the magnetic excitations
shifts to the region of reciprocal space near the in-plane wave-vector
$(0.5,0.5)$, corresponding to the "collinear" spin configuration. Our results
suggest that spin fluctuations associated with the collinear magnetic structure
appear to be universal in all Fe-based superconductors, and there is a strong
correlation between superconductivity and the character of the magnetic
order/fluctuations in
