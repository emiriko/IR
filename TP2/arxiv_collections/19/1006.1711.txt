This volume contains the Proceedings of the first Symposium on "Games,
Automata, Logic, and Formal Verification (GandALF)", held in Minori (Amalfi
coast), Italy, 17-18 June 2010. The symposium has been promoted by a number of
Italian computer scientists interested in game theory, mathematical logic,
automata theory, and their applications to the specification, design, and
verification of complex systems. It covers a large spectrum of research topics,
ranging from theoretical aspects to concrete applications. Its aim is to
provide a forum where people from different areas, and possibly with a
different background, can successfully interact. The high-level international
profile of the event is witnessed by the composition of the program committee
and by the final program.
