MCSTHAR++ is a new Monte Carlo code implementing the Statistical
Hadronization Model. This model assumes that hadronization proceeds through the
microcanonical decay of massive extended clusters. Unlike other hadronization
models, in this approach very few free parameters are needed, as has been
demonstrated in previous studies. The tuning of the model and the comparison
with the data is ongoing.
