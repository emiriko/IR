No-arbitrage models of term structure have the feature that the return on
zero-coupon bonds is the sum of the short rate and the product of volatility
and market price of risk. Well known models restrict the behavior of the market
price of risk so that it is not dependent on the type of asset being modeled.
We show that the models recently proposed by Goldstein and Santa-Clara and
Sornette, among others, allow the market price of risk to depend on
characteristics of each asset, and we quantify this dependence. A key tool in
our analysis is a very general space-time change of measure theorem, proved by
the first author in earlier work, and covers continuous orthogonal local
martingale measures including space-time white noise.
