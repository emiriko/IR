Context. The high-redshift (z = 4.72) blazar J1430+4204 produced a major
radio outburst in 2005. Such outbursts are usually associated with the
emergence of a new component in the inner radio jet. Aims. We searched for
possible changes in the radio structure on milli-arcsecond angular scales, to
determine physical parameters that characterise the relativistic jet ejected
from the centre of this source. Methods. We analysed 15-GHz radio
interferometric images obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) before
and after the peak of the outburst. Results. We did not identify any
significant new jet component over a period of 569 days. We estimated the
Doppler factor, the Lorentz factor, and the apparent transverse speed of a
putative jet component using three different methods. The likely small jet
angle to the line of sight and our values of the apparent transverse speed are
consistent with not detecting a new jet feature.
