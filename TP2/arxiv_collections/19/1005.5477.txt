For a periodically driven quantum system an effective time-independent
Hamiltonian is derived with an eigen-energy spectrum, which in the regime of
large driving frequencies approximates the quasi-energies of the corresponding
Floquet Hamiltonian. The effective Hamiltonian is evaluated for the case of
optical lattice models in the tight-binding regime subjected to strong periodic
driving. Three scenarios are considered: a periodically shifted one-dimensional
(1D) lattice, a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice with inversely phased
temporal modulation of the well depths of adjacent lattice sites, and a 2D
lattice subjected to an array of microscopic rotors commensurate with its
plaquette structure. In case of the 1D scenario the rescaling of the tunneling
energy, previously considered by Eckardt et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 260404
(2005), is reproduced. The 2D lattice with well depth modulation turns out as a
generalization of the 1D case. In the 2D case with staggered rotation, the
expression previously found in the case of weak driving by Lim et al. in Phys.
Rev. Lett. 100, 130402 (2008) is generalized, such that its interpretation in
terms of an artificial staggered magnetic field can be extended into the regime
of strong driving.
