A theoretical scheme for bidirectional swapping quantum controlled
teleportation is presented using the entanglement property of maximally
entangled five-qubit state, i.e., Alice wants to transmit a entangled state of
particle a to Bob and Bob wants to transmit a entangled state of particle b to
Alice via the control of the supervisor Charlie.
