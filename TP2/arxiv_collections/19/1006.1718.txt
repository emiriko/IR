This is a pedagogical article which discusses various kinds of fermion
fields: Dirac, Majorana and Weyl. The definitions and motivations for
introducing each kind of fields is discussed, along with the connections
between them. It is pointed out that these definitions have to do with the
proper Lorentz group, and not with respect to any discrete symmetry. The
relationship of discrete symmetries like charge conjugation and CP,
particularly important for Majorana fermions, has also been clarified.
