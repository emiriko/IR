We analyze the transport properties of a quantum dot with a harmonic degree
of freedom (Holstein phonon) coupled to interacting one-dimensional metallic
leads. Using Tomonaga-Luttinger model to describe the interacting leads we
construct the generating function of the full counting statistics (FCS) for a
specific constellation of system parameters and give explicit expression for
the cumulant generating function. In the resonant case we find the lowest order
correction to the current to be negative and divergent when source-drain
voltage approaches the phonon frequency. Via a diagram resummation procedure we
show, that this divergencies can be repealed. On the contrary, in the
off-resonant case the lowest order correction remains finite. This effect can
be traced back to the strongly non-monotonic behaviour of the bare transmission
coefficient (without phonon) with respect to the dot level energy. We calculate
corrections to the noise power as well and discuss possible experimental
implications of this phenomenon.
