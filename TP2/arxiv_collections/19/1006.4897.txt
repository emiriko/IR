Our goal is to research the upper limits on the extragalactic background
light (EBL). The upper limits on the extragalactic background light (EBL),
using the Fermi and very high energy (VHE) spectra recently observed in TeV
blazars, are presented. We use an assumption that the VHE intrinsic photon
index cannot be harder than the Fermi index measured by the Fermi-LAT. Totally,
these upper limits on the EBL are compatible with ones given by most of EBL
models. However, the models of high EBL density are denied by TeV blazars.
