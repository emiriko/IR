We report on several unusual properties of a graphene antidot created by a
piecewise constant potential in a magnetic field. We find that the total
probability of finding the electron in the barrier can be nearly one while it
is almost zero outside the barrier. In addition, for each electron state of a
graphene antidot there is a dot state with exactly the same wavefunction but
with a different energy. This symmetry is a consequence of Klein tunneling of
Dirac electrons. Moreover, in zigzag nanoribbons we find strong coupling
between some antidot states and zigzag edge states. Experimental tests of these
effects are proposed.
