How much information is stored in the ground-state of a system without
\emph{any symmetry} and how can we extract it? This question is investigated by
analyzing the behavior of a topological Chern Insulator (CI) in the presence of
disorder, with a focus on its entanglement spectrum (EtS) constructed from the
ground state. For systems with symmetries, the EtS was shown to contain
explicit information revealed by sorting the EtS against the conserved quantum
numbers. In the absence of any symmetry, we demonstrate that statistical
methods such as the level statistics of the EtS can be equally insightful,
allowing us to distinguish when an insulator is in a topological or trivial
phase and to map the boundary between the two phases, where EtS becomes
entirely delocalized. The phase diagram of a CI is explicitly computed as
function of Fermi level ($E_F$) and disorder strength using the level
statistics of the EtS and energy spectrum (EnS), together with a computation of
the Chern number via an efficient real-space formula.
