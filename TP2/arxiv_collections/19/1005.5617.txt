We derive the expressions for the anisotropic heterogeneous tensors of
permittivity and perme- ability associated with two-dimensional and
three-dimensional carpets of an arbitrary shape. In the former case, we map a
segment onto smooth curves whereas in the latter case we map a non convex
region of the plane onto smooth surfaces. Importantly, these carpets display no
singularity of the permeability and permeability tensor components, and this
may lead to some broadband cloaking.
