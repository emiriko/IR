The effect of an initial disturbance on the detonation front structure in a
narrow duct is studied by three-dimensional numerical simulation. The numerical
method used includes a high resolution fifth-order weighted essentially
non-oscillatory scheme for spatial discretization, coupled with a third order
total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta time stepping method. Two types of
disturbances are used for the initial perturbation. One is a random disturbance
which is imposed on the whole area of the detonation front, and the other is a
symmetrical disturbance imposed within a band along the diagonal direction on
the front. The results show that the two types of disturbances lead to
different processes. For the random disturbance, the detonation front evolves
into a stable spinning detonation. For the symmetrical diagonal disturbance,
the detonation front displays a diagonal pattern at an early stage, but this
pattern is unstable. It breaks down after a short while and it finally evolves
into a spinning detonation. The spinning detonation structure ultimately formed
due to the two types of disturbances is the same. This means that spinning
detonation is the most stable mode for the simulated narrow duct. Therefore, in
a narrow duct, triggering a spinning detonation can be an effective way to
produce a stable detonation as well as to speed up the deflagration to
detonation transition process.
