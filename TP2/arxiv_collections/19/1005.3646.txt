We present a swarm model of Brownian particles with harmonic interactions,
where the individuals undergo canonical active Brownian motion, i.e. each
Brownian particle can convert internal energy to mechanical energy of motion.
We assume the existence of a single global internal energy of the system.
Numerical simulations show amorphous swarming behavior as well as static
configurations. Analytic understanding of the system is provided by studying
stability properties of equilibria.
