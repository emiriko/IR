We introduce efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for inference and
model determination in multivariate and matrix-variate Gaussian graphical
models. Our framework is based on the G-Wishart prior for the precision matrix
associated with graphs that can be decomposable or non-decomposable. We extend
our sampling algorithms to a novel class of conditionally autoregressive models
for sparse estimation in multivariate lattice data, with a special emphasis on
the analysis of spatial data. These models embed a great deal of flexibility in
estimating both the correlation structure across outcomes and the spatial
correlation structure, thereby allowing for adaptive smoothing and spatial
autocorrelation parameters. Our methods are illustrated using simulated and
real-world examples, including an application to cancer mortality surveillance.
