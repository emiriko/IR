Dirac neutrinos arising from gauged discrete symmetry \`a la Krauss-Wilczek
are implemented in the minimal custodial Randall-Sundrum model. In the case of
a normal hierarchy, all lepton masses and mixing pattern can be naturally
reproduced at the TeV scale set by the electroweak constraints, while
simultanously satisfy bounds from lepton flavour violation. A nonzero neutrino
mixing angle, $\theta_{13}$, is generic in the scenario, as well as the
existence of sub-TeV right-handed Kaluza-Klein neutrinos, which may be searched
for at the LHC.
