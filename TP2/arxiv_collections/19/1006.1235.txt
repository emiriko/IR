The library RNGSSELIB for random number generators (RNGs) based upon the SSE2
command set is presented. The library contains realization of a number of
modern and most reliable generators. Usage of SSE2 command set allows to
substantially improve performance of the generators. Three new RNG realizations
are also constructed. We present detailed analysis of the speed depending on
compiler usage and associated optimization level, as well as results of
extensive statistical testing for all generators using available test packages.
Fast SSE implementations produce exactly the same output sequence as the
original algorithms.
