A new approach to Brownian motion of atomic clusters on solid surfaces is
developed. The main topic discussed is the dependence of the diffusion
coefficient on the fit between the surface static potential and the internal
cluster configuration. It is shown this dependence is non-monotonous, which is
the essence of the so-called resonant diffusion. Assuming quicker inner motion
of the cluster than its translation, adiabatic separation of these variables is
possible and a relatively simple expression for the diffusion coefficient is
obtained. In this way, the role of cluster vibrations is accounted for, thus
leading to a more complex resonance in the cluster surface mobility.
