Random scale-free overlay topologies provide a number of properties like for
example high resilience against failures of random nodes, small (average)
diameter as well as good expansion and congestion characteristics that make
them interesting for the use in large-scale distributed systems. A number of
these properties have been shown to be influenced by the exponent \gamma of
their degree distribution P(k) ~ k^{-\gamma}. In this article, we present a
distributed rewiring scheme that is suitable to effectuate scale-free overlay
topologies with an adjustable exponent. The scheme uses a biased random walk
strategy to sample new endpoints of edges being rewired and relies on a simple
equilibrium model for scale-free networks. The bias of the random walk strategy
can be tuned to produce random scale-free networks with arbitrary degree
distribution exponents greater than two. We argue that the rewiring strategy
can be implemented in a distributed fashion based on a node's information about
its immediate neighbors. We present both analytical arguments as well as
results that have been obtained using an implementation of the proposed
protocol.
