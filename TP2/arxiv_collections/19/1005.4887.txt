We study extensions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with
new degrees of freedom that couple sizably to the MSSM Higgs sector and lie in
the TeV range. After integrating out the physics at the TeV scale, the
resulting Higgs spectrum can significantly differ from typical supersymmetric
scenarios, thereby providing a window Beyond the MSSM (BMSSM). Taking into
account current LEP and Tevatron constraints, we perform an in-depth analysis
of the Higgs collider phenomenology and explore distinctive characteristics of
our scenario with respect to both the Standard Model and the MSSM.
  We propose benchmark scenarios to illustrate specific features of BMSSM Higgs
searches at the Tevatron and the LHC.
