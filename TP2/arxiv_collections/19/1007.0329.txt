The Si(001) surface subjected to different treatments in ultrahigh vacuum
molecular beam epitaxy chamber for SiO$_2$ film decomposition has been in situ
investigated by reflected high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and high
resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). A transition between (2 x 1)
and (4 x 4) RHEED patterns was observed. The (4 x 4) pattern arose at T <~600C
during sample posttreatment cooling. The reconstruction was observed to be
reversible. The c(8 x 8) structure was revealed by STM at room temperature on
the same samples. The (4 x 4) patterns have been evidenced to be a
manifestation of the c(8 x 8) surface structure in RHEED. The phase transition
appearance has been found to depend on thermal treatment conditions and sample
cooling rate.
