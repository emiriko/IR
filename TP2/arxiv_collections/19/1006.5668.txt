By comparing the signals of electron spin resonance (ESR) from two crystals
of a diamond (spin-labels) the demagnetizing field of the Co, Fe, and Ni
samples in the shape of strongly elongated ellipsoids of revolution (disks) has
been measured. The magnetic permeabilities of the metals in the external
magnetic field corresponding to the ESR of the broken chemical bonds in a
natural diamond irradiated with fast reactor neutrons have been determined.
