We have synthesized polycrystalline samples of the noncentrosymmetric
superconductor Mo3Al2C by arc and RF melting, measured its transport, magnetic
and thermodynamic properties, and computed its band structure. Experimental
results indicate a bulk superconducting transition at Tc ~ 9.2 K, while the
density of states at the Fermi surface is found to be dominated by Mo
d-orbitals. Using the measured values for the lower critical field Hc1, upper
critical field Hc2, and the specific heat C, we estimated the thermodynamic
critical field Hc(0), coherence length {\xi}(0), penetration depth
{\lambda}(0), and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter {\kappa}(0). The specific heat
jump at Tc, {\Delta}C/{\gamma}Tc = 2.14, suggests that Mo3Al2C is
moderately-to-strongly coupled, consistent with the fast opening of the gap, as
evidenced by the rapid release of entropy below Tc from our electronic specific
heat measurements. Above 2K the electronic specific heat exhibits the power law
behavior, suggesting that synthesis of single crystals and measurements at
lower temperature are needed to establish whether the gap is anisotropic. The
estimated value of the upper critical field Hc2(0) is close to the calculated
Pauli limit, therefore further studies are needed to determine whether the
absence of an inversion center results in a significant admixture of the
triplet component of the order parameter.
