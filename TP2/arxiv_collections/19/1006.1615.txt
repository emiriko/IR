We develop a formal theory of the weak values with emphasis on the
consistency conditions and a probabilistic interpretation in the
counter-factual processes. We present the condition for the choice of the
post-selected state to give a negative weak value of a given projection
operator and strange values of an observable in general. The general framework
is applied to Hardy's paradox and the spin $1/2$ system to explicitly address
the issues of counter-factuality and strange weak values. The counter-factual
arguments which characterize the paradox specifies the pre-selected state and a
complete set of the post-selected states clarifies how the strange weak values
emerge.
