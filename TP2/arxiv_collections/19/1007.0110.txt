Permittivity tensors of arbitrary shaped invisibility devices are obtained
using effective medium approach in general relativity. As special cases,
analytical expressions for the permittivity tensors of invisibility cloaks for
the elliptic cylinder, prolate spheroid, and the confocal paraboloid geometry
are derived. In the case of elliptic cylinder, we found that the point of
infinite light speed in the electromagnetic space becomes two points in the
physical space in the zz component of the permittivity tensor. This result is
different from the case of perfect cylinder in which there is a line of cloak
at which the speed of light becomes infinite. In the cases of prolate spheroid
and confocal paraboloid, the point of infinite light speed in the
electromagnetic space becomes line in the physical space for the first two
tensor components and the third component of the permittivity tensor becomes
singular at the line of cloak.
