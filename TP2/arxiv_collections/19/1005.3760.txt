We present a two-fluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of quasi-stationary,
two-dimensional magnetic reconnection in an incompressible plasma composed of
electrons and ions. We find two distinct regimes of slow and fast reconnection.
The presence of these two regimes can provide a possible explanation for the
initial slow build up and subsequent rapid release of magnetic energy
frequently observed in cosmic and laboratory plasmas.
