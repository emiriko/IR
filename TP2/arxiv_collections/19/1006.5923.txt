Among (conformal) quantum field theories, the rational conformal field
theories are singled out by the fact that their correlators can be constructed
from a modular tensor category C with a distinguished object, a symmetric
special Frobenius algebra A in C, via the so-called TFT-construction. These
correlators satisfy in particular all factorization constraints, which involve
gluing homomorphisms relating correlators of world sheets of different
topology.
  We review the action of the gluing homomorphisms and discuss the implications
of the factorization constraints for boundary conditions. The so-called
classifying algebra A for a RCFT is a semisimple commutative associative
complex algebra, which classifies the boundary conditions of the theory. We
show that the annulus partition functions can be obtained from the
representation theory of A.
