We calculate the cosmic ray positron and antiproton spectra of a gauge-Higgs
dark matter candidate in a warped five-dimensional $SO(5) \times U(1)$
gauge-Higgs unification model. The stability of the gauge-Higgs boson is
guaranteed by the H parity under which only the Higgs boson is odd at low
energy. The 4-point vertices of HHW^+W^- and HHZZ, allowed by H parity
conservation, have the same magnitude as in the standard model, which yields
efficient annihilation rate for $m_H > m_W$. The most dominant annihilation
channel is $H H \to W^+ W^-$ followed by the subsequent decays of the $W$
bosons into positrons or quarks, which undergo fragmentation into antiproton.
Comparing with the observed positron and antiproton spectra with the PAMALA and
Fermi/LAT, we found that the Higgs boson mass cannot be larger than 90 GeV, in
order not to overrun the observations. Together with the constraint on not
overclosing the Universe, the valid range of the dark matter mass is restricted
to 70-90 GeV.
