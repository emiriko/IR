This paper proposes a two-stage optical packet switch with second stage of
recirculate switch of FDL to reduce the number of the FDL used in the switch
for contention resolution. The contention resolution scheme with priority in
packet releasing from FDL is tested in the two-stage switch for performance
evaluation. Simulation result shows that zero packet loss rate achievable with
{\i}< 0.8 for 32x 32 two-stage switch.
