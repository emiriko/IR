The Collins and Sivers asymmetries for charged hadrons produced in deeply
inelastic scattering on transversely polarised protons have been extracted from
the data collected in 2007 with the CERN SPS muon beam tuned at 160 GeV/c. At
large values of the Bjorken x variable non-zero Collins asymmetries are
observed both for positive and negative hadrons while the Sivers asymmetry for
positive hadrons is slightly positive over almost all the measured x range.
These results nicely support the present theoretical interpretation of these
asymmetries, in terms of leading-twist quark distribution and fragmentation
functions.
