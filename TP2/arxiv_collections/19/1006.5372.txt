We offer a Maple package {\tt Poincare\_Series} for calculating the
Poincar\'e series for the algebras of invariants/covariants of binary forms,
for the algebras of joint invariants/covariants of several binary forms, for
the kernel of Weitzenb\"ock derivations and for the multivariate Poincar\'e
series of algebras of joint invariants/covariants of several binary forms.
