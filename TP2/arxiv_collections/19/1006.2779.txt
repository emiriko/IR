We have studied the effect of dynamical correlations on the electronic
structure of single Co adatoms on graphene monolayers with a recently developed
novel method for nanoscopic materials that combines density functional
calculations with a fully dynamical treatment of the strongly interacting
3d-electrons. The coupling of the Co 3d-shell to the graphene substrate and
hence the dynamic correlations are strongly dependent on the orbital symmetry
and the system parameters (temperature, distance of the adatom from the
graphene sheet, gate voltage). When the Kondo effect takes place, we find that
the dynamical correlations give rise to strongly temperature-dependent peaks in
the Co 3d-spectra near the Fermi level. Moreover, we find that the Kondo effect
can be tuned by the application of a gate voltage. It turns out that the
position of the Kondo peaks is pinned to the Dirac points of graphene rather
than to the chemical potential.
