Many studies in the last ten years have shown that we can measure the unknown
angle theta13, discover leptonic CP violation and determine the neutrino
hierarchy in more precise neutrino oscillation experiments, searching for the
subleading channel nue -> numu in the atmospheric range. In this first report
of WP6 activities the following new results are reviewed: (1) Re-evaluation of
the physics reach of the upcoming generation of experiments to measure theta13
and delta; (2) New tools to explore a larger parameter space as needed beyond
the standard scenario; (3) Neutrino Factory: (a) evaluation of the physics
reach of a Nufact regards sterile neutrinos; (b) evaluation of the physics
reach of a Nufact as regards non-standard interactions; (c) evaluation of the
physics reach of a Nufact as regards violation of unitarity; (d) critical
assessment on long baseline tau-detection at Nufact; (e) new physics searches
at a near detector in a Nufact; (4) Beta-beams: (a) choice of ions and location
for a gamma = 100 CERN-based beta-beam; (b) re-evaluation of atmospheric
neutrino background for the gamma = 100 beta-beam scenario; (c) study of a two
baseline beta-beam; (d) measuring absolute neutrino mass with beta-beams; (e)
progress on monochromatic beta-beams; (5) Update of the physics potential of
the SPL super-beam. Eventually, we present an updated comparison of the
sensitivity to theta13, delta and the neutrino mass hierarchy of several of the
different proposed facilities.
