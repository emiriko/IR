We construct bi-invariant total orderings of residually torsion-free
nilpotent groups by using Chen's iterated integrals. This construction can be
seen as a generalization of the Magnus ordering of the free groups, and
equivalent to the classical construction which uses an iteration of central
extensions. Our geometric construction provides a connection between
bi-orderings and the rational homotopy theory.
