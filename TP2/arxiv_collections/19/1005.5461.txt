The double-peak structure observed in soft-hard hadron correlations is
commonly interpreted as a signature for a Mach cone generated by a supersonic
jet interacting with the hot and dense medium created in ultrarelativistic
heavy-ion collisions. We show that it can also arise due to averaging over many
jet events in a transversally expanding background. We find that the
jet-induced away-side yield does not depend on the details of the
energy-momentum deposition in the plasma, the jet velocity, or the system size.
Our claim can be experimentally tested by comparing soft-hard correlations
induced by heavy-flavor jets with those generated by light-flavor jets.
