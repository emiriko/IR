We study the photon counting noise in optical interferometers used for
gravitational wave detection. In order to reduce quantum noise a squeezed
vacuum is injected into the usually unused input port. It is investigated under
which conditions the gravitational wave signal may be amplified without
increasing counting noise concurrently. Such a possibility was suggested as a
consequence of the entanglement of the two output ports of a beam splitter. We
find that amplification without concurrent increase of noise is not possible
for reasonable squeezing parameters. Photon distributions for various beam
splitter angles and squeezing parameters are calculated.
