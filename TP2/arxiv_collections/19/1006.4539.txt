This paper reports on empirical evaluation study of users' performance and
satisfaction with prototype of Web Based speech photo annotation with speech
interaction. Participants involved consist of Johor Bahru citizens from various
background. They have completed two parts of annotation task; part A involving
PhotoASys; photo annotation system with proposed speech interaction and part B
involving Microsoft Microsoft Vista Speech Interaction style. They have
completed eight tasks for each part including system login and selection of
album and photos. Users' performance was recorded using computer screen
recording software. Data were captured on the task completion time and
subjective satisfaction. Participants need to complete a questionnaire on the
subjective satisfaction when the task was completed. The performance data show
the comparison between proposed speech interaction and Microsoft Vista Speech
interaction applied in photo annotation system, PhotoASys. On average, the
reduction in annotation performance time due to using proposed speech
interaction style was 64.72% rather than using speech interaction Microsoft
Vista style. Data analysis were showed in different statistical significant in
annotation performance and subjective satisfaction for both styles of
interaction. These results could be used for the next design in related
software which involves personal belonging management.
