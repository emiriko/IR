A complete phase diagram of Zn substituted quantum quasi-two-dimensional
helimagnet LiCu2O2 has been presented. Helical ordering transition temperature
(T_h) of the original LiCu2O2 follows finite size scaling for less than ~ 5.5%
Zn substitution, which implies the existence of finite helimagnetic domains
with domain boundaries formed with nearly isolated spins. Higher Zn
substitution > 5.5% quenches the long-range helical ordering and introduces an
intriguing Zn level dependent magnetic phase transition with slight thermal
hysteresis and a universal quadratic field dependence for T_c (Zn > 0.055,H).
The magnetic coupling constants of nearest-neighbor (nn) J1 and
next-nearest-neighbor (nnn) J2 (alpha=J2/J1) are extracted from high
temperature series expansion (HTSE) fitting and N=16 finite chain exact
diagonalization simulation. We have also provided evidence of direct
correlation between long-range helical spin ordering and the magnitude of
electric polarization in this spin driven multiferroic material.
