The epitaxial growth of complex oxide thin films provide three avenues to
generate unique properties: the ability to influence the 3-dimensional
structure of the film, the presence of a surface, and the generation of an
interface. In all three cases, a clear understanding of the resulting atomic
structure is desirable. However, determining the full structure of an epitaxial
thin film (lattice parameters, space group, atomic positions, surface
reconstructions) on a routine basis is a serious challenge. In this paper we
highlight the remarkable information that can be extracted from both the Bragg
scattering and inelastic multiple scattering events that occur during
Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction. We review some methods to extract
structural information and show how mature techniques used in other fields can
be directly applied to the {\em in-situ} and real-time diffraction images of a
growing film. These collection of techniques give access to both the
epitaxially influenced 3 dimensional bulk structure of the film, and any
reconstructions that may happen at the surface.
