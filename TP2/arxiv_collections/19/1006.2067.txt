We have investigated antidot lattices, which were prepared on exfoliated
graphene single layers via electron-beam lithography and ion etching, by means
of scanning Raman spectroscopy. The peak positions, peak widths and intensities
of the characteristic phonon modes of the carbon lattice have been studied
systematically in a series of samples. In the patterned samples, we found a
systematic stiffening of the G band mode, accompanied by a line narrowing,
while the 2D mode energies are found to be linearly correlated with the G mode
energies. We interpret this as evidence for p-type doping of the nanostructured
graphene.
