It is shown that effective quantum-state and entanglement transfer can be
obtained by inducing a coherent dynamics in quantum wires with homogeneous
intrawire interactions. This goal is accomplished by tuning the coupling
between the wire endpoints and the two qubits there attached, to an optimal
value. A general procedure to determine such value is devised, and scaling laws
between the optimal coupling and the length of the wire are found. The
procedure is implemented in the case of a wire consisting of a spin-1/2 XY
chain: results for the time dependence of the quantities which characterize
quantum-state and entanglement transfer are found of extremely good quality and
almost independent of the wire length. The present approach does not require
`ad hoc' engineering of the intrawire interactions nor a specific initial pulse
shaping, and can be applied to a vast class of quantum channels.
