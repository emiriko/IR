A beam size monitor so called Shintake monitor, which uses the inverse
Compton scattering between the laser interference fringe and the electron beam
was designed for and installed at ATF2. The commissioning at ATF2 was started
in the end of 2008 and succeeded in the measurement of the fringe pattern from
the scattered gamma-rays. The present status of the Shintake monitor is
described here.
