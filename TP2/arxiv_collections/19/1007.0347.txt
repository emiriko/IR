If you search for 'collective behaviour' with your web browser most of the
texts popping up will be about group activities of humans, including riots,
fashion and mass panic. Nevertheless, collective behaviour is also considered
to be an important aspect of observed phenomena in atoms and molecules, for
example, during spontaneous magnetization. In your web search, you might also
find articles on collectively migrating bacteria, insects or birds; or
phenomena where groups of organisms or non- living objects synchronize their
signals or motion (think of fireflies flashing in unison or people clapping in
phase during rhythmic applause).
