The retrograde software analysis is a method that emanates from executing a
program backwards - instead of taking input data and following the execution
path, we start from output data and by executing the program backwards, command
by command, analyze data that could lead to the current output. The changed
perspective forces a developer to think in a new way about the program. It can
be applied as a thorough procedure or casual method. With this method, we have
many advantages in testing, algorithm and system analysis.
