Several claims have been made of anomalies in the large-angle properties of
the cosmic microwave background anisotropy as measured by WMAP. In most cases,
the statistical significance of these anomalies is hard or even impossible to
assess, due to the fact that the statistics used to quantify the anomalies were
chosen a posteriori. On the other hand, the possibility of detecting new
physics on the largest observable scales is so exciting that, in my opinion, it
is worthwhile to examine the claims carefully. I will focus on three particular
claims: the lack of large-angle power, the north-south power asymmetry, and
multipole alignments. In all cases, the problem of a posteriori statistics can
best be solved by finding a new data set that probes similar physical scales to
the large-angle CMB. This is a difficult task, but there are some possible
routes to achieving it.
