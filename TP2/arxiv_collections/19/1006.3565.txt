During a midlatitude spread F (MSF) event, data was collected to investigate
the circumstances that may lead to MSF. Using the Total Electron Content (TEC)
derived from the NCAT-SCINDA GPS station and the Continuous Operating Reference
Stations (CORS) Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TID) were analyzed during a
period of MSF over Wallops Island, Virginia. In addition to the TEC analysis,
scintillation calculations have been made using the NCAT-SCINDA GPS receiver,
USRP receiver and a Narrow Band (NB) receiver. Scintillation levels on the GPS,
USRP and NB signals were very low throughout the period of MSF. Analysis of TEC
data from multiple CORS sites has shown the presence of medium scale
atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) within the MSF event region propagating towards
low latitudes with a small eastward component. This is consistent with theories
showing AGW may lead to MSF if an oppositely directed neutral wind is present.
This study was performed in conjunction with a sounding rocket experiment
investigating ionospheric disturbances at multiple scale sizes.
