We construct the general extension of the four-dimensional Jackiw-Rossi-Dirac
Hamiltonian that preserves the antilinear reflection symmetry between the
positive and negative energy eigenstates. Among other systems, the resulting
Hamiltonian describes the s-wave superconducting vortex at the surface of the
topological insulator, at a finite chemical potential, and in the presence of
both Zeeman and orbital couplings to the external magnetic field. Here we find
that the bound zero-mode exists only when the Zeeman term is below a critical
value. Other physical realizations pertaining to graphene are considered, and
some novel zero-energy wave functions are analytically computed.
