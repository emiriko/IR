The coherent dynamics of a coupled photonic cavity and a nanomagnet is
explored as a function of nanomagnet size. For sufficiently strong coupling
eigenstates involving highly entangled photon and spin states are found, which
can be combined to create coherent states. As the size of the nanomagnet
increases its coupling to the photonic mode also monotonically increases, as
well as the number of photon and spin states involved in the system's
eigenstates. For small nanomagnets the crystalline anisotropy of the magnet
strongly localized the eigenstates in photon and spin number, quenching the
potential for coherent states. For a sufficiently large nanomagnet the
macrospin approximation breaks down and different domains of the nanomagnet may
couple separately to the photonic mode. Thus the optimal nanomagnet size is
just below the threshold for failure of the macrospin approximation.
