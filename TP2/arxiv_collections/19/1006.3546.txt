Experimental results for congested pedestrian traffic are presented. For data
analysis we apply a method providing measurements on an individual scale. The
resulting velocity-density relation shows a coexistence of moving and stopping
states revealing the complex structure of pedestrian fundamental diagrams and
supporting new insights into the characteristics of pedestrian congestions.
Furthermore we introduce a model similar to event driven approaches. The
velocity-density relation as well as the phase separation is reproduced.
Variation of the parameter distribution indicates that the diversity of
pedestrians is crucial for phase separation.
