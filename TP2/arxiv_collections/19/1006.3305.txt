We extend Holowinsky and Soundararajan's proof of quantum unique ergodicity
for holomorphic Hecke modular forms on SL(2,Z), by establishing it for
automorphic forms of cohomological type on GL_2 over an arbitrary number field
which satisfy the Ramanujan bounds. In particular, we have uncondtional
theorems over totally real and imaginary quadratic fields. In the totally real
case we show that our result implies the equidistribution of the zero divisors
of holomorphic Hecke modular forms, generalising a result of Rudnick over Q.
