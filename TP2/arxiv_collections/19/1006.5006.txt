We present high resolution HIFI spectroscopy of the nucleus of the
archetypical starburst galaxy M82. Six 12CO lines, 2 13CO lines and 4
fine-structure lines are detected. Besides showing the effects of the overall
velocity structure of the nuclear region, the line profiles also indicate the
presence of multiple components with different optical depths, temperatures and
densities in the observing beam. The data have been interpreted using a grid of
PDR models. It is found that the majority of the molecular gas is in low
density (n=10^3.5 cm^-3) clouds, with column densities of N_H=10^21.5 cm^-2 and
a relatively low UV radiation field (GO = 10^2). The remaining gas is
predominantly found in clouds with higher densities (n=10^5 cm^-3) and
radiation fields (GO = 10^2.75), but somewhat lower column densities
(N_H=10^21.2 cm^-2). The highest J CO lines are dominated by a small (1%
relative surface filling) component, with an even higher density (n=10^6 cm^-3)
and UV field (GO = 10^3.25). These results show the strength of multi-component
modeling for the interpretation of the integrated properties of galaxies.
