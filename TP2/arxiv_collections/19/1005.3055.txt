By combining Herschel-SPIRE observations obtained as part of the Herschel
Virgo Cluster Survey with 21 cm HI data from the literature, we investigate the
role of the cluster environment on the dust content of Virgo spiral galaxies.We
show for the first time that the extent of the dust disk is significantly
reduced in HI-deficient galaxies, following remarkably well the observed
'truncation' of the HI disk. The ratio of the submillimetre-to- optical
diameter correlates with the HI-deficiency, suggesting that the cluster
environment is able to strip dust as well as gas. These results provide
important insights not only into the evolution of cluster galaxies but also
into the metal enrichment of the intra-cluster medium.
