Model-independent semantic requirements for user specification and
interpretation of data before and after quantum computations are characterized.
Classical computational costs of assigning classical data values to quantum
registers and to run-time parameters passed across a classical-to-quantum
application programming interface are derived. It is shown that the classical
computational costs of data definition equal or exceed the classical
computational cost of solving the problem of interest for all applications of
quantum computing except computations defined over the integers and the
simulation of linear systems with linear boundary conditions.
