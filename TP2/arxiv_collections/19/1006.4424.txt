We consider static, axisymmetric, thick brane solutions on higher
dimensional, spherically symmetric black hole backgrounds. It was found
recently [1], that in cases when the thick brane has more than 2 spacelike
dimensions, perturbative approaches break down around the corresponding thin
solutions for Minkowski type topologies. This behavior is a consequence of the
fact that thin solutions are not smooth at the axis, and for a general
discussion of possible phase transitions in the system, one needs to use a
non-perturbative approach. In the present paper we provide an exact, numerical
solution of the problem both for black hole- and Minkowski type topologies with
arbitrary number of brane and bulk dimensions. We also illustrate a topology
change transition in the system for a 5-dimensional brane embedded in a
6-dimensional bulk.
