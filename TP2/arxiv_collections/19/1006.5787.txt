Virtual human techniques have been used a lot in industrial design in order
to consider human factors and ergonomics as early as possible. The physical
status (the physical capacity of virtual human) has been mostly treated as
invariable in the current available human simulation tools, while indeed the
physical capacity varies along time in an operation and the change of the
physical capacity depends on the history of the work as well. Virtual Human
Status is proposed in this paper in order to assess the difficulty of manual
handling operations, especially from the physical perspective. The decrease of
the physical capacity before and after an operation is used as an index to
indicate the work difficulty. The reduction of physical strength is simulated
in a theoretical approach on the basis of a fatigue model in which fatigue
resistances of different muscle groups were regressed from 24 existing maximum
endurance time (MET) models. A framework based on digital human modeling
technique is established to realize the comparison of physical status. An
assembly case in airplane assembly is simulated and analyzed under the
framework. The endurance time and the decrease of the joint moment strengths
are simulated. The experimental result in simulated operations under laboratory
conditions confirms the feasibility of the theoretical approach.
