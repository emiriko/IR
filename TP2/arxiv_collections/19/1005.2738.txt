We present a theoretical study of the Pauli or spin-valley blockade for
double quantum dots in semiconducting carbon nanotubes. In our model we take
into account the following characteristic features of carbon nanotubes: (i)
fourfold (spin and valley) degeneracy of the quantum dot levels, (ii) the
intrinsic spin-orbit interaction which is enhanced by the tube curvature, and
(iii) valley-mixing due to short-range disorder, i.e., substitutional atoms,
adatoms, etc. We find that the spin-valley blockade can be lifted in the
presence of short-range disorder, which induces two independent random (in
magnitude and direction) valley-Zeeman-fields in the two dots, and hence acts
similarly to hyperfine interaction in conventional semiconductor quantum dots.
In the case of strong spin-orbit interaction, we identify a parameter regime
where the current as the function of an applied axial magnetic field shows a
zero-field dip with a width controlled by the interdot tunneling amplitude, in
agreement with recent experiments.
