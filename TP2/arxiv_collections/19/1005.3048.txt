We present molecular line observations, made with angular resolutions of
~20", toward the filamentary infrared dark cloud G34.43+0.24 using the APEX
[CO(3-2), 13CO(3-2), C18O(3-2) and CS(7-6) transitions], Nobeyama 45 m
[CS(2-1), SiO(2-1), C34S(2-1), HCO+(1-0), H13CO+(1-0) and CH3OH(2-1)
transitions], and SEST [CS(2-1) and C18O(2-1) transitions] telescopes. We find
that the spatial distribution of the molecular emission is similar to that of
the dust continuum emission observed with 11" resolution showing a filamentary
structure and four cores. The cores have local thermodynamic equilibrium masses
ranging from 3.3x10^2 - 1.5x10^3 solar masses and virial masses from 1.1x10^3 -
1.5x10^3 solar masses, molecular hydrogen densities between 1.8x10^4 and
3.9x10^5 cm^{-3}, and column densities >2.0x10^{22} cm^{-2}; values
characteristics of massive star forming cores. The 13CO(3-2) profile observed
toward the most massive core reveals a blue profile indicating that the core is
undergoing large-scale inward motion with an average infall velocity of 1.3
km/s and a mass infall rate of 1.8x10^{-3} solar masses per year. We report the
discovery of a molecular outflow toward the northernmost core thought to be in
a very early stage of evolution. We also detect the presence of high velocity
gas toward each of the other three cores, giving support to the hypothesis that
the excess 4.5 $\mu$ emission ("green fuzzies") detected toward these cores is
due to shocked gas. The molecular outflows are massive and energetic, with
masses ranging from 25 -- 80 solar masses, momentum 2.3 - 6.9x10^2 \Msun km/s,
and kinetic energies 1.1 - 3.6x10^3 \Msun km^2 s^{-2}; indicating that they are
driven by luminous, high-mass young stellar objects.
