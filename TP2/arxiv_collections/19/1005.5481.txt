The simplest interior magnetic field B_i that can explain the observed
uniform rotation of the Sun's radiative envelope is an axial dipole stabilized
by a deep toroidal field. It can explain the uniform rotation only if confined
in the polar caps. The field must be prevented from diffusing up into the
high-latitude convection zone, whose slower rotation must remain decoupled from
the radiative interior. This paper describes new analytical and numerical
solutions of the relevant magnetohydrodynamic equations showing that such
confinement and decoupling is dynamically possible by means of a laminar
"magnetic confinement layer" at the bottom of the tachocline. With realistic
values of the microscopic diffusivities, a weak laminar downwelling flow
U~10^{-5}cm/s over the poles is enough to enforce exponential decay of B_i with
altitude, in a confinement layer only a fraction of a megameter thick.
Downwelling in the polar tachocline is implied both by helioseismic
observations, combined with elementary dynamics, and by theoretical arguments
about the "gyroscopic pumping" that would spread differential rotation downward
in the absence of B_i. Our confinement-layer solutions are the first to take
account of all the relevant physical effects in a self-consistent mathematical
model. The effects include magnetic diffusion, baroclinicity and stable
stratification (thermal and compositional), Coriolis effects, and thermal
relaxation. We discuss how the confinement layers at each pole might fit into a
global dynamical picture of the solar tachocline. That picture, in turn,
suggests a new insight into the early Sun and solar lithium depletion.
