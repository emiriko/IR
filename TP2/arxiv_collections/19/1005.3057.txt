We present a resolved dust analysis of three of the largest angular size
spiral galaxies, NGC 4501 and NGC 4567/8, in the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey
(HeViCS) Science Demonstration field. Herschel has unprecedented spatial
resolution at far-infrared wavelengths and with the PACS and SPIRE instruments
samples both sides of the peak in the far infrared spectral energy distribution
(SED).We present maps of dust temperature, dust mass, and gas-to-dust ratio,
produced by fitting modified black bodies to the SED for each pixel. We find
that the distribution of dust temperature in both systems is in the range ~19 -
22 K and peaks away from the centres of the galaxies. The distribution of dust
mass in both systems is symmetrical and exhibits a single peak coincident with
the galaxy centres. This Letter provides a first insight into the future
analysis possible with a large sample of resolved galaxies to be observed by
Herschel.
