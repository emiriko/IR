We report on the observation of a novel mode locked optical comb generated at
the Raman offset (Raman comb) in an optically pumped crystalline whispering
gallery mode resonator. Mode locking is confirmed via measurement of the
radio-frequency beat note produced by the optical comb on a fast photodiode.
Neither the conventional Kerr comb nor hyper-parametric oscillation is observed
when the Raman comb is present.
