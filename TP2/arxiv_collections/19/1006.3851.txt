This review discusses the dynamics of negative ion reactions with neutral
molecules in the gas phase. Most anion-molecule reactions proceed via a
qualitatively different interaction potential than cationic or neutral
reactions. It has been and still is the goal of many experiments to understand
these reaction dynamics and the different reaction mechanisms they lead to. We
will show how rate coefficients and cross sections for anion-molecule reactions
are measured and interpreted to yield information on the underlying dynamics.
We will also present more detailed approaches that study either the transient
reaction complex or the energy- and angle-resolved scattering of negative ions
with neutral molecules. With the help of these different techniques many
aspects of anion-molecule reaction dynamics could be unravelled in the last
years. However, we are still far from a complete understanding of the complex
molecular interplay that is at work during a negative ion reaction.
