We study edge states of non-centrosymmetric superconductors where
spin-singlet d-wave pairing mixes with spin-triplet p (or f)-wave one by
spin-orbit coupling. For dxy-wave pairing, the obtained Andreev bound state has
an anomalous dispersion as compared to conventional helical edge modes. A
unique topologically protected time-reversal invariant Majorana fermion appears
at the edge. The charge conductance in the non-centrosymmetric superconductor
junctions reflects the anomalous structures of the dispersions, particularly
the time-reversal invariant Majorana fermion is manifested as a zero bias
conductance peak.
