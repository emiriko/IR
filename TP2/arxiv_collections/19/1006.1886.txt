The KATRIN neutrino experiment is a next-generation tritium beta decay
experiment aimed at measuring the mass of the electron neutrino to better than
200 meV at 90% C.L. Due to its intense tritium source, KATRIN can also serve as
a possible target for the process of neutrino capture, {\nu}e +3H \to 3He+ +
e-. The latter process, possessing no energy threshold, is sensitive to the
Cosmic Neutrino Background (C{\nu}B). In this paper, we explore the potential
sensitivity of the KATRIN experiment to the relic neutrino density. The KATRIN
experiment is sensitive to a C{\nu}B over-density ratio of 2.0x 10^9 over
standard concordance model predictions (at 90% C.L.), addressing the validity
of certain speculative cosmological models.
