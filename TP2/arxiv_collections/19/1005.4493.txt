We present global existence results for solutions of reaction-diffusion
systems on evolving domains. Global existence results for a class of
reaction-diffusion systems on fixed domains are extended to the same systems
posed on spatially linear isotropically evolving domains. The results hold
without any assumptions on the sign of the growth rate. The analysis is valid
for many systems that commonly arise in the theory of pattern formation. We
present numerical results illustrating our theoretical findings.
