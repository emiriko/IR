Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on the high temperature
superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ have reported an enhanced
spectral gap in the neighborhood of O dopant atoms. We calculate, within
density functional theory (DFT), the change in electronic structure due to such
a dopant. We then construct and discuss the validity of several tight binding
(TB) fits to the DFT bands with and without an O dopant. With the
doping-modulated TB parameters, we finally evaluate the spin susceptibility and
pairing interaction within spin fluctuation theory. The d-wave pairing
eigenvalues are enhanced above the pure system without O dopant, supporting the
picture of enhanced local pairing around such a defect.
