Here we report extensive ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity experiments on
overdoped Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$Ca$_{1-x}$Y$_x$Cu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ single crystals
(T$_C$=78 K) aimed to clarify the nature of the superconducting-to-normal-state
photoinduced phase transition. The experimental data show the lack of the
quasiparticles decay time divergence at the fluence required to induce this
phase transition, in contrast to the thermally-driven phase transition observed
at T$_C$ and at variance with recently reported photoinduced
charge-density-wave and spin-density-wave to metal phase transitions. Our data
demonstrate the non-thermal character of the superconducting-to-normal-state
photoinduced phase transition. The data have been analyzed using an ad-hoc
developed time-dependent Rothwarf-Taylor model, opening the question on the
order of this non-equilibrium phase transition.
