We consider the correlations and superfluid properties of a Bose gas in an
external potential. Using a Bogoliubov scheme, we obtain expressions for the
correlation function and the superfluid density in an arbitrary external
potential. These expressions are applied to a one-dimensional system at zero
temperature subject to a quasiperiodic modulation. The critical parameters for
the Bose glass transition are obtained using two different criteria and the
results are compared. The Lifshits glass is seen to be the limiting case for
vanishing interactions.
