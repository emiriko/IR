Cosmogenic neutrinos originate from photo-hadronic interactions of cosmic ray
protons with the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The neutrino production
rate can be constrained through the accompanying electrons, positrons and
gamma-rays that quickly cascade on the CMB and intergalactic magnetic fields to
lower energies and generate a gamma ray background in the GeV-TeV region.
Bethe-Heitler pair production by protons also contributes to the cascade and
can tighten the neutrino constraints in models where extragalactic cosmic rays
begin to dominate over the galactic component at a relatively low "crossover"
energy. We investigate this issue in the light of the recent Fermi-LAT
measurements of the diffuse extragalactic gamma ray background and illustrate
by a fit to the HiRes spectrum how the prediction of the cosmogenic neutrino
flux in all-proton models varies with the crossover energy. The neutrino flux
is required to be smaller when the gamma-ray bound is applied, nevertheless
such models are still consistent with HiRes and Fermi-LAT if one properly takes
into account the energy uncertainty of cosmic ray measurements. The presently
allowed flux is within reach of the IceCube neutrino telescope and other
dedicated radio experiments.
