We consider two disordered lattice models on the square lattice: on the
medial lattice the random field Ising model at T=0 and on the direct lattice
the random bond Potts model in the large-q limit at its transition point. The
interface properties of the two models are known to be related by a mapping
which is valid in the continuum approximation. Here we consider finite random
samples with the same form of disorder for both models and calculate the
respective equilibrium states exactly by combinatorial optimization algorithms.
We study the evolution of the interfaces with the strength of disorder and
analyse and compare the interfaces of the two models in finite lattices.
