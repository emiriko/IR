In 2007, the observed Earth flyby anomalies have been successfully simulated
using an empirical formula (H. J. Busack, 2007). This simulation has led to the
prediction of anomaly values, to be expected for the Rosetta flybys of Mars in
2007, and following twice of Earth in 2007 and 2009. While the data for the
Mars flyby are yet under evaluation, the predictions of the formula for the
last two Earth flybys of Rosetta are fully confirmed now. This is remarkable,
since an alternatively proposed formula (Anderson et al., 2007) failed to
predict the correct values for the recent flybys. For the Mercury flybys of the
Messenger spacecraft, this alternative formula predicts a null result. In the
meantime, Doppler residuals of these flybys on 14.01.2008 and 06.10.2008 are
availabel. On both flybys, significant residuals were observed, using gravity
data derived by Mariner 10 on Mercury (D. E. Smith et al., 2009). According to
the authors, these residuals cannot be eliminated totally by adjustment of the
second degree gravity coefficients and by assumption of irregular mass
concentrations of acceptable value on Mercury. In this investigation, I adapt
the output of the simulation program to compare with the measured Doppler
residuals of the Mercury flybys without changing the formerly derived
parameters for the Earth flybys. The simulation with these parameters leads to
Doppler residuals of the Mercury flybys compatible with the measured curves.
Additionally, the expected flyby anomalies are calculated. Since the gravity
field of Mercury is not explored yet with sufficient accuracy, this result
cannot be falsified or confirmed until the evaluation of the coming Mercury
orbits of Messenger will be finished. If the proposed empirical formula would
be confirmed then again, this would be a strong indication of an underlying
physical reality.
