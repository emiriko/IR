We propose a general algorithm for computer assisted verification of uniform
hyperbolicity for maps which exhibit a robust attractor.
  The method has been successfully applied to a Poincare map for a system of
coupled non-autonomous van der Pol oscillators. The model equation has been
proposed by Kuznetsov and the attractor seems to be of the Smale-Williams type.
