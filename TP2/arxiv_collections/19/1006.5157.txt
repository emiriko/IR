This paper describes an electric circuit lab exercise that offers various
ways of comparing the equivalent electrical resistance of three-resistor
circuits. It requires the use of two multi-meters, a power supply, cables and
connectors, an assortment of ceramic resistors, and breadboards. The lab lets
students verify Ohm's law through graphical analysis, and perform comparisons
with calculated counterparts. The lab can be shortened as well as be made more
complex. Suggestions are presented on how to simplify the assignment, and on
how to make it a more challenging task for students.
