We present the latest B physics results from the CDF experiment at the
Fermilab Tevatron collider. We focus on a number of analyses, including a
measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry of B -> K^(*) mu mu decays,
determination of the CP violating phase sin2beta_s in B^0_s-> J/psi phi decays,
B -> J/psi X lifetime measurements, observation of resonance structure in
Lambda_b -> Lambda_c 3pi, and Upsilon(1S) polarization.
