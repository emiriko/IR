We introduce the simple notion of a "crystallographic arrangement" and prove
a one-to-one correspondence between these arrangements and the connected simply
connected Cartan schemes for which the real roots are a finite root system (up
to equivalence on both sides). We thus obtain a more accessible definition for
this very large subclass of the class of simplicial arrangements for which a
complete classification is known.
