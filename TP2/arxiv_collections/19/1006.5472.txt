The Si(001) surface deoxidized by short annealing at T~925C in the ultrahigh
vacuum molecular beam epitaxy chamber has been in situ investigated by high
resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and reflected high energy
electron diffraction (RHEED). RHEED patterns corresponding to (2x1) and (4x4)
structures were observed during sample treatment. The (4x4) reconstruction
arose at T<600C after annealing. The reconstruction was observed to be
reversible: the (4x4) structure turned into the (2x1) one at T>600C, the (4x4)
structure appeared again at recurring cooling. The c(8x8) reconstruction was
revealed by STM at room temperature on the same samples. A fraction of the
surface area covered by the c(8x8) structure decreased as the sample cooling
rate was reduced. The (2x1) structure was observed on the surface free of the
c(8x8) one. The c(8x8) structure has been evidenced to manifest itself as the
(4x4) one in the RHEED patterns. A model of the c(8x8) structure formation has
been built on the basis of the STM data. Origin of the high-order structure on
the Si(001) surface and its connection with the epinucleation phenomenon are
discussed.
