We first prove rigidity results for pseudo-Anosov flows in prototypes of
toroidal 3-manifolds: we show that a pseudo-Anosov flow in a Seifert fibered
manifold is up to finite covers topologically equivalent to a geodesic flow and
we show that a pseudo-Anosov flow in a solv manifold is topologically
equivalent to a suspension Anosov flow. Then we study the interaction of a
general pseudo-Anosov flow with possible Seifert fibered pieces in the torus
decomposition: if the fiber is associated with a periodic orbit of the flow, we
show that there is a standard and very simple form for the flow in the piece
using Birkhoff annuli. This form is strongly connected with the topology of the
Seifert piece. We also construct a large new class of examples in many graph
manifolds, which is extremely general and flexible. We construct other new
classes of examples, some of which are generalized pseudo-Anosov flows which
have one prong singularities and which show that the above results in Seifert
fibered and solvable manifolds do not apply to one prong pseudo-Anosov flows.
Finally we also analyse immersed and embedded incompressible tori in optimal
position with respect to a pseudo-Anosov flow.
