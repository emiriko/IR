Parameter fitting of data to a proposed equation almost always consider these
parameters as independent variables. Here, the method proposed optimizes an
arbitrary number of variables by the minimization of a function of a single
variable. Such a technique avoids problems associated with multiple minima and
maxima because of the large number of parameters, and could increase the
accuracy of the determination by cutting down on machine errors. An algorithm
for this optimization scheme is provided and applied to the determination of
the rate constant and final concentration parameters for a first order and
second order chemical reaction.
