Contributions to the energy levels in light muonic atoms and, in particular,
to the Lamb shift fall into a few well-distinguished classes. The related
diagrams are calculated using different approaches. In particular, there is a
specific kind of non-relativistic contributions. Here we consider such
corrections to the Lamb shift in order $\alpha^5m_\mu$. These contributions are
due to free vacuum polarization loops as well as to various effects of
light-by-light scattering. The closed loop in the related diagrams is an
electronic one, which allows a non-relativistic consideration of the muon. Both
kinds of contributions have been known for a while, however, the results
obtained up to date are only partial ones. We complete a calculation of the
$\alpha^5m_\mu$ contributions for muonic hydrogen. The results are also
adjusted for muonic deuterium and muonic helium ion.
