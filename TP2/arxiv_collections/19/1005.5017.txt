We propose a relevant lattice distortion to stabilize the spin-Peierls state
in CeRu2Al10, compatible with the 27Al-NQR spectra and the neutron diffraction
patterns on the assumption that Al atoms at Al(1) to Al(4) sites displace
toward their respective neighboring Ce ions below T0 = 27 K, leaving Ce, Ru,
and Al at Al(5) immobile. Due to a resulting regular lattice distortion the
assembly of one-dimensional spin-Peierls order on each zigzag chain along the
c-axis predicted by the author becomes a three-dimensional order with Q = (0,
0, 1), where bonds connecting dimerized pair of Ce ions form an antiferro
ordering in a body-centered structure.
