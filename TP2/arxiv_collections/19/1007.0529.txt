Charge and spin Josephson currents in a ballistic
superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor junction with spin-triplet pairing
symmetry are studied using the quasiclassical Eilenberger equation. The gap
vector of superconductors has an arbitrary relative angle with respect to
magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. We clarify the effects of the
thickness of ferromagnetic layer and magnitude of the magnetization on the
Josephson charge and spin currents. We find that 0-\pi transition can occur
except for the case that the exchange field and d-vector are in nearly
perpendicular configuration. We also show how spin current flows due to
misorientation between the exchange field and d-vector.
