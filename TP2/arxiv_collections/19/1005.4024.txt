We consider elongated condensates that cross twice the speed of sound. In the
absence of periodic boundary conditions, the phonon spectrum possesses a
discrete and finite set of complex frequency modes that induce a laser effect.
This effect constitutes a dynamical instability and is due to the fact that the
supersonic region acts as a resonant cavity. We numerically compute the complex
frequencies and density-density correlation function. We obtain patterns with
very specific signatures. In terms of the gravitational analogy, the flows we
consider correspond to a pair of black hole and white hole horizons, and the
laser effect can be conceived as a self-amplified Hawking radiation. This is
verified by comparing the outgoing flux at early time with the standard black
hole radiation.
