The set of Bell-diagonal states for two qubits can be depicted as a
tetrahedron in three dimensions. We consider the level surfaces of entanglement
and quantum discord for Bell-diagonal states. This provides a complete picture
of the structure of entanglement and discord for this simple case and, in
particular, of their nonanalytic behavior under decoherence. The pictorial
approach also indicates how to show that discord is neither convex nor concave.
