We report on the results of a radio interferometric observation of NGC7027 in
the CO J=2-1 and 13CO J=2-1 lines. The results are analyzed with
morpho-kinematic models developed from the software tool Shape. Our goal is to
reveal the morpho-kinematic properties of the central region of the nebula, and
to explore the nature of unseen high-velocity jets that may have created the
characteristic structure of the central region consisting of molecular and
ionized components. A simple ellipsoidal shell model explains the intensity
distribution around the systemic velocity, but the high velocity features
deviate from the ellipsoidal model. Through the Shape automatic reconstruction
model, we found a possible trail of a jet only in one direction, but no other
possible holes were created by the passage of a jet.
