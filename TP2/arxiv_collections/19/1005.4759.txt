We give a rigorous treatment on the foundation of the first order asymptotic
theory of quantum estimation, with tractable and reasonable regularity
conditions. Different from past works, we do not use Fisher information nor
MLE, and an optimal estimator is constructed based on locally unbiased
estimators. Also, we treat state estimation by local operations and classical
communications (LOCC), and estimation of quantum operations.
