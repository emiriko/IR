The Library of Babel, described by Jorge Luis Borges, stores an enormous
amount of information. The Library exists {\it ab aeterno}. Wikipedia, a free
online encyclopaedia, becomes a modern analogue of such a Library. Information
retrieval and ranking of Wikipedia articles become the challenge of modern
society. While PageRank highlights very well known nodes with many ingoing
links, CheiRank highlights very communicative nodes with many outgoing links.
In this way the ranking becomes two-dimensional. Using CheiRank and PageRank we
analyze the properties of two-dimensional ranking of all Wikipedia English
articles and show that it gives their reliable classification with rich and
nontrivial features. Detailed studies are done for countries, universities,
personalities, physicists, chess players, Dow-Jones companies and other
categories.
