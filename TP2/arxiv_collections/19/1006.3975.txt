Subdwarf B stars (sdBs) can significantly change the ultraviolet spectra of
populations at age t~1Gyr, and have been even included in the volutionary
population synthesis (EPS) models by Han et al. (2007). In this study we
present the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of binary stellar populations
(BSPs) by combining the EPS models of Han et al. (2007) and those of the Yunnan
group (Zhang et al. 2004, 005), which have included various binary interactions
(except sdBs) in EPS models. This set of SEDs is vailable upon request from the
authors.
  Using this set of SEDs of BSPs we build the spectra of Burst, E, S0-Sd and
Irr types of galaxies by using the package of Bruzual & Charlot (2003, BC03).
Combined with the photometric data (filters and magnitudes), we obtain the
photometric redshifts and morphologies of 1502 galaxies by using the Hyperz
code of Bolzonella et al. (2000). This sample of galaxies is obtained by
removing those objects, mismatched with the SDSS/DR7 and GALEX/DR4, from the
catalogue of Fukugita et al. (2007). By comparison the results with the SDSS
spectroscopic redshifts and the morphological index of Fukugita et al. (2007),
we find that the photo-zs fluctuate with the SDSS spectroscopic redshifts,
while the Sa-Sc galaxies in the catalogue of Fukugita et al. (2007) are
classified earlier as Burst-E galaxies.
