Stellar and galactic systems are objects in dynamical equilibrium that are
composed of ordinary baryonic matter hypothetically embedded in extended
dominant dark matter halos. Our aim is to investigate the scaling relations and
dissipational features of these objects over a wide range of their properties,
taking the dynamical influence of the dark matter component into account. We
study the physical properties of these self-gravitating systems using the
two-component virial theorem in conjunction with data that embrace a wide range
of astrophysical systems. We find that the scaling relations defined by the
properties of these objects admit a dark-to-luminous density ratio parameter as
a natural requirement in this framework. We also probe dissipational effects on
the fundamental surface defined by the two-component virial theorem and discuss
their relations with respect to the region devoid of objects in the data
distribution. Our results indicate complementary contributions of dissipation
and dark matter to the orign of scaling relations in astrophysical systems.
