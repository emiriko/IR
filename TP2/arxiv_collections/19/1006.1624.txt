This investigation is devoted to the solutions of Einstein's field equations
for a circularly symmetric anisotropic fluid, with kinematic self-similarity of
the first kind, in $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes. In the case where the radial
pressure vanishes, we show that there exists a solution of the equations that
represents the gravitational collapse of an anisotropic fluid, and this
collapse will eventually form a black hole, even when it is constituted by the
phantom energy.
