Ultra-compact X-ray binaries consist of a neutron star or black hole that
accretes material from a white dwarf-donor star. The ultra-compact nature is
expressed in very short orbital periods of less than 1 hour. In the case of 4U
0614+091 oxygen-rich material from a CO or ONe white dwarf is flowing to the
neutron star. This oxygen-rich disc can reflect X-rays emitted by the neutron
star giving a characteristic emission spectrum. We have analyzed
high-resolution RGS and broad band EPIC spectra of 4U 0614+091 obtained by the
XMM-Newton satellite. We detect a broad emission feature at ~0.7 keV in both
instruments, which cannot be explained by unusual abundances of oxygen and neon
in the line of sight, as proposed before in the literature. We interpret this
feature as O VIII Lyalpha emission caused by reflection of X-rays off highly
ionized oxygen, in the strong gravitational field close to the neutron star.
