The data from the HERA experiments H1 and ZEUS allows a precise extraction of
the strong coupling constant {\alpha}S with the highest experimental precision
(sub 1%). A review of recent measurements of jet cross sections in neutral
current deep inelastic scattering (NC DIS) at HERA is presented and compared
with theoretical NLO QCD predictions. The latest determinations of {\alpha}S in
a large range of Q2 are shown.
