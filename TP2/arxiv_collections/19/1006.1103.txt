DNA supercoiling plays an important role in a variety of cellular processes.
The torsional stress related with supercoiling may be also involved in gene
regulation through the local structure and dynamics of the double helix. To
check this possibility steady torsional stress was applied to DNA in the course
of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that small static
untwisting significantly reduces the torsional persistence length ($l_t$) of
GC-alternating DNA. For the AT-alternating sequence a smaller effect of the
opposite sign is observed. As a result, the measured $l_t$ values are similar
under zero stress, but diverge with untwisting. The effect is traced to
sequence-specific asymmetry of local torsional fluctuations, and it should be
small in long random DNA due to compensation. In contrast, the stiffness of
special short sequences can vary significantly, which gives a simple
possibility of gene regulation via probabilities of strong fluctuations. These
results have important implications for the role of local DNA twisting in
complexes with transcription factors.
