The majorization order on $\RR^n$ induces a natural partial ordering on the
space of univariate hyperbolic polynomials of degree $n$. We characterize all
linear operators on polynomials that preserve majorization, and show that it is
sufficient (modulo obvious degree constraints) to preserve hyperbolicity.
