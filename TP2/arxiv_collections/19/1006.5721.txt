The degree of elliptical polarization of intense short laser pulses is shown
to be related to the timing of strong-field non-sequential double ionization.
Higher ellipticity is predicted to force the initiation of double ionization
into a narrower time window, and this "pins" the ionizing field strength in an
unexpected way, leading to the first experimentally testable formula for double
ionization probability as a function of ellipticity.
