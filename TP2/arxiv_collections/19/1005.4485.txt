Resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RRMHD) simulations are applied to
investigate the system evolution of relativistic magnetic reconnection. A
time-split Harten--Lan--van Leer method is employed. Under a localized
resistivity, the system exhibits a fast reconnection jet with an Alfv\'{e}nic
Lorentz factor inside a narrow Petschek-type exhaust. Various shock structures
are resolved in and around the plasmoid such as the post-plasmoid vertical
shocks and the "diamond-chain" structure due to multiple shock reflections.
Under a uniform resistivity, Sweet--Parker-type reconnection slowly evolves.
Under a current-dependent resistivity, plasmoids are repeatedly formed in an
elongated current sheet. It is concluded that the resistivity model is of
critical importance for RRMHD modeling of relativistic magnetic reconnection.
