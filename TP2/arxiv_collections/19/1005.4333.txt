We find that competition between random Kondo and random magnetic
correlations results in a quantum phase transition from a local Fermi liquid to
a spin liquid. The local charge susceptibility turns out to have exactly the
same critical exponent as the local spin susceptibility, suggesting novel
duality between the Kondo singlet phase and the critical local moment state
beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry breaking framework. This leads us to
propose an enhanced symmetry at the local quantum critical point, described by
an O(4) vector for spin and charge. The symmetry enhancement serves mechanism
of electron fractionalization in critical impurity dynamics, where such
fractionalized excitations are identified with topological excitations.
