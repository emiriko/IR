In this article, we take into account the one-pion exchange force besides the
one-gluon exchange force to study the mass difference of the $\pi$ and $\rho$
mesons with the Bethe-Salpeter equation. After projecting the Bethe-Salpeter
equation into an simple form, we can see explicitly that the bound energy
$|E_\pi|\gg |E_\rho|$.
