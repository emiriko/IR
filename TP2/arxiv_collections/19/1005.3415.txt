We developed microscopic theory of Josephson effect in point contacts between
dirty two-band superconductors. The general expression for the Josephson
current, which is valid for arbitrary temperatures, is obtained. This
expression was used for calculation of current-phase relations and temperature
dependences of critical current with application to MgB2 superconductor. Also
we have considered influence on contact characteristics interband scattering
effect appeared in case of dirty superconductors. It is shown that the
correction to Josephson current due to the interband scattering depends on
phase shift in the banks (i.e. s- or s+/- -wave symmetry of order parameters)
