We demonstrate clear collective atomic recoil motion in a dilute,
momentum-squeezed, ultra-cold degenerate fermion gas by circumventing the
effects of Pauli blocking. Although gain from bosonic stimulation is
necessarily absent because the quantum gas obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics,
collective atomic recoil motion from the underlying wave-mixing process is
clearly visible. With a single pump pulse of the proper polarization, we
observe two mutually-perpendicular wave-mixing processes occurring
simultaneously. Our experiments also indicate that the red-blue pump detuning
asymmetry observed with Bose-Einstein condensates does not occur with fermions.
