The transient response of Ba(Fe(1-x)Co(x))2As2, x=0.08 was studied by
pump-probe optical reflectivity. After ultrafast photoexcitation, hot electrons
were found to relax with two different characteristic times, indicating the
presence of two distinct decay channels: a faster one, of less than 1 ps in the
considered pump fluence range, and a slower one, corresponding to lattice
thermalization and lasting ~6 ps. Our analysis indicates that the fast
relaxation should be attributed to preferential scattering of the electrons
with only a subset of the lattice vibration modes, with a second moment of the
Eliashberg function lambda(omega^2)~64 meV^2. The simultaneous excitation of a
strong fully symmetric A(1g) optical phonon corroborates this conclusion and
makes it possible to deduce the value of lambda~0.12. This small value for the
electron-phonon coupling confirms that a phonon mediated process cannot be the
only mechanism leading to the formation of superconducting pairs in this family
of pnictides.
