LDA+DMFT+Sigma_k approach was applied to describe pseudogap phase of several
prototype high-Tc compounds e.g. hole doped Bi2212 and LSCO systems and
electron doped NCCO and PCCO, demonstrating qualitative difference of the Fermi
surfaces (FS) for these systems. Namely for Bi2212 and LSCO the so called
"hot-spots" (intersection of a bare FS and AFM Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary),
where scattering on pseudogap fluctuations is most intensive were not observed.
Instead here we have Fermi arcs with smeared FS close to the BZ boundary.
However for NCCO and PCCO "hot-spots" are clearly visible. This qualitative
difference is shown to have material specific origin. Good agreement with known
ARPES data was demon strated not only for FS maps but also for spectral
function maps (quasiparticle bands in cluding lifetime and interaction
broadening).
