We study the spectral and temporal behavior of X-ray flares from the active
M-dwarf EV Lac in 200 ks of exposure with the Chandra/HETGS. We derive flare
parameters by fitting an empirical function which characterizes the amplitude,
shape, and scale. The flares range from very short (<1 ks) to long (10 ks)
duration events with a range of shapes and amplitudes for all durations. We
extract spectra for composite flares to study their mean evolution and to
compare flares of different lengths. Evolution of spectral features in the
density-temperature plane shows probable sustained heating. The short flares
are significantly hotter than the longer flares. We determined an upper limit
to the Fe K fluorescent flux, the best fit value being close to what is
expected for compact loops.
