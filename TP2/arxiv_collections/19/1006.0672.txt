We have calculated the step scaling function and the running coupling of QCD
in the Schroedinger functional scheme with four flavors of O(a) improved Wilson
quarks. Comparisons of our non-perturbative results with 2-loop and 3-loop
perturbation theory as well as with non-perturbative data for only two flavors
are made.
