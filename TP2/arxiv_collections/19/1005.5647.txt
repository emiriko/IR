We assume an environment of neutrons and $\alpha$-particles of given density
and temperature where nuclear syntheses into $^{6}$He, $^{9}$Be and $^{12}$C
are possible. We investigate the resulting relative abundance as a function of
density and temperature. When the relative abundance of $\alpha$-particles
$Y_{\alpha}$ is between 0.2 and 0.9, or larger than 0.9, the largest production
is $^{9}$Be or $^{12}$C, respectively. When $Y_{\alpha}<0.2$ $^{6}$He is mostly
frequently produced for temperatures above about 2 GK whereas the $^{9}$Be
production dominates at smaller temperatures.
