Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) are bubbles or relativistic plasma that form when
the pulsar wind is confined by the SNR or the ISM. Recent observations have
shown a richness of emission features that has driven a renewed interest in the
theoretical modeling of these objects. In recent years a MHD paradigm has been
developed, capable of reproducing almost all of the observed properties of
PWNe, shedding new light on many old issues. Given that PWNe are perhaps the
nearest systems where processes related to relativistic dynamics can be
investigated with high accuracy, a reliable model of their behavior is
paramount for a correct understanding of high energy astrophysics in general. I
will review the present status of MHD models: what are the key ingredients,
their successes, and open questions that still need further investigation.
