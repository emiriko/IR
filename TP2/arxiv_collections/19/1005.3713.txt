We present a theoretical study of current noise of a resonant tunnel junction
coupled to a nanomechanical oscillator within the non-equilibrium Green's
function technique. An arbitrary voltage is applied to the tunnel junction and
electrons in the leads are considered to be at zero temperature. The properties
of the phonon distribution of the nanomechanical oscillator strongly coupled to
the electrons on the dot are investigated using a non-perturbative approach. An
analytical calculations and numerical results for the current-voltage, shot
noise and the corresponding Fano factor as a function of applied bias show
significant features of the nanomechanical oscillator coupling dynamics. This
will provide useful insight for the design of experiments aimed at studying the
quantum behavior of an oscillator.
