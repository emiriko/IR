Several Markovian process calculi have been proposed in the literature, which
differ from each other for various aspects. With regard to the action
representation, we distinguish between integrated-time Markovian process
calculi, in which every action has an exponentially distributed duration
associated with it, and orthogonal-time Markovian process calculi, in which
action execution is separated from time passing. Similar to deterministically
timed process calculi, we show that these two options are not irreconcilable by
exhibiting three mappings from an integrated-time Markovian process calculus to
an orthogonal-time Markovian process calculus that preserve the behavioral
equivalence of process terms under different interpretations of action
execution: eagerness, laziness, and maximal progress. The mappings are limited
to classes of process terms of the integrated-time Markovian process calculus
with restrictions on parallel composition and do not involve the full
capability of the orthogonal-time Markovian process calculus of expressing
nondeterministic choices, thus elucidating the only two important differences
between the two calculi: their synchronization disciplines and their ways of
solving choices.
