Some recent experimental results obtained in collisions of heavy nuclei
($\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV) at BNL Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) are
discussed. The probes of dense matter created in heavy-ion collision by
quarkonia, $D$ and $B$ mesons containing heavy charm and beauty quarks are
considered. The centrality, rapidity and transverse momentum dependences of the
nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow coefficient are presented and
their possible theoretical interpretation is provided.
