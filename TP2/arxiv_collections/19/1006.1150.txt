In this work we employ an MHD numerical code to reproduce the morphology
observed for SN 1006 in radio synchrotron and thermal X-ray emission. We
introduce a density discontinuity, in the form of a flat cloud parallel to the
Galactic Plane, in order to explain the NW filament observed in optical
wavelengths and in thermal X-rays. We compare our models with observations. We
also perform a test that contrasts the radio emitting bright limbs of the SNR
against the central region, finding additional support to our results. Our main
conclusion is that the most probable direction of the ambient magnetic field is
on average perpendicular to the Galactic Plane.
