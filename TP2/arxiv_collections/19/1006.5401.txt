If large-angle multigluon radiation contributes significantly to parton
showers associated with heavy boson production at the LHC, appropriate parton
branching methods are required for realistic Monte Carlo simulations of final
states. We report on a study illustrating such effects in the case of central
scalar-boson production. We comment on the possible impact of such studies on
the modeling of multi-parton interactions.
