We prove that the exceptional complex Lie group $F_4$ has a transitive action
on the hyperplane section of the complex Cayley plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$. Our
proof is direct and constructive. We use an explicit realization of the vector
and spin actions of $\Spin(9,\C) \leq F_4$. Moreover, we identify the
stabilizer of the $F_4$-action as a parabolic subgroup $P_4$ (with Levi factor
$B_3T_1$) of the complex Lie group $F_4$. In the real case we obtain an
analogous realization of $F_4^{(-20)}/P_4$.
