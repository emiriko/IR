The Jones-Wenzl projectors play a central role in quantum topology,
underlying the construction of SU(2) topological quantum field theories and
quantum spin networks. We construct chain complexes whose graded Euler
characteristic is the "classical" projector in the Temperley-Lieb algebra. We
show that they are homotopy idempotents and uniquely defined up to homotopy.
Our results fit within the general framework of Khovanov's categorification of
the Jones polynomial. Consequences of our construction include families of knot
invariants corresponding to higher representations of quantum su(2) and a
categorification of quantum spin networks. We introduce 6j-symbols in this
context.
