The establishment and spreading of biological populations depends crucially
on population growth at low densities. The Allee effect is a problem in those
populations where the per-capita growth rate at low densities is reduced. We
examine stochastic spatial models in which the reproduction rate changes across
a gradient g so that the population undergoes a 2D-percolation transition.
Without the Allee effect, the transition is continuous and the width w of the
hull scales as in conventional (i.e., uncorrelated) gradient percolation,
proportional to g^(-0.57). However, with a strong Allee effect the transition
is first order and w is proportional to g^(-0.26).
