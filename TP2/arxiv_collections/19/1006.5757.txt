The great successes achieved by the Standard Model(SM) lead us to believe the
existence of the Higgs particle. On the other hand, there are many evidences
indicate that some unknown dark matter particle must exist in our universe. To
identify the Higgs boson as the dark matter particle is difficult in the
present SM, the challenge is: the Higgs particle is unstable while the dark
matter particle is stable. A solution of this problem is proposed in this
paper. We will describe a model in which almost all the predictions made by the
present SM remain unchanged but leave two neutral stable Higgs particles, which
may be the dark matter particle. Some possible experimental tests of Higgs
particle are also suggested in this paper.
