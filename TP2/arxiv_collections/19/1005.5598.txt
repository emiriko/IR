The eigenfunctions of quantized chaotic systems cannot be described by
explicit formulas, even approximate ones. This survey summarizes (selected)
analytical approaches used to describe these eigenstates, in the semiclassical
limit. The levels of description are macroscopic (one wants to understand the
quantum averages of smooth observables), and microscopic (one wants
informations on maxima of eigenfunctions, "scars" of periodic orbits, structure
of the nodal sets and domains, local correlations), and often focusses on
statistical results. Various models of "random wavefunctions" have been
introduced to understand these statistical properties, with usually good
agreement with the numerical data. We also discuss some specific systems (like
arithmetic ones) which depart from these random models.
