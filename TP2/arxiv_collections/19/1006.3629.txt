In this work, Rydberg energy levels of the triatomic hydrogen molecule
($\rm{H_3}$) are studied with multichannel quantum-defect theory. We extract
the body-frame p-wave quantum defects from highly accurate \emph{ab initio}
electronic potential surfaces and calculate the quantum defects of higher
momentum states by using the long-range multipole potential model. To obtain
laboratory-frame quantum defects, we perform a rovibrational-frame
transformation with accurate rovibrational states of $\rm{H_3^+}$. Finally, we
use the laboratory-frame quantum defects to calculate Rydberg energy levels for
the fundamental neutral triatomic molecule $\rm{H_3}$.
