Mathieu equation is widely used to study several natural phenomenon. In this
paper, we show that replacing the sinusoid in the Mathieu equation with a
phasor can lead to solutions that behave in a totally different way. Solutions
of Mathieu equation are either bounded or grow unboundedly at an exponential
rate. Solutions of this new equation are always unbounded and grow linearly
with time.
