In Templeton (2010), the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm
(see, e.g., Pritchard et al., 1999, Beaumont et al., 2002, Marjoram et al.,
2003, Ratmann et al., 2009) is criticised on mathematical and logical grounds:
"the [Bayesian] inference is mathematically incorrect and formally illogical".
Since those criticisms turn out to be bearing on Bayesian foundations rather
than on the computational methodology they are primarily directed at, we
endeavour to point out in this note the statistical errors and inconsistencies
in Templeton (2010), refering to Beaumont et al. (2010) for a reply that is
broader in scope since it also covers the phylogenetic aspects of nested clade
versus a model-based approach.
