In two series of papers we construct quasi regular polyhedra and their duals
which are similar to the Catalan solids. The group elements as well as the
vertices of the polyhedra are represented in terms of quaternions. In the
present paper we discuss the quasi regular polygons (isogonal and isotoxal
polygons) using 2D Coxeter diagrams. In particular, we discuss the isogonal
hexagons, octagons and decagons derived from 2D Coxeter diagrams and obtain
aperiodic tilings of the plane with the isogonal polygons along with the
regular polygons. We point out that one type of aperiodic tiling of the plane
with regular and isogonal hexagons may represent a state of graphene where one
carbon atom is bound to three neighboring carbons with two single bonds and one
double bond. We also show how the plane can be tiled with two tiles; one of
them is the isotoxal polygon, dual of the isogonal polygon. A general method is
employed for the constructions of the quasi regular prisms and their duals in
3D dimensions with the use of 3D Coxeter diagrams.
