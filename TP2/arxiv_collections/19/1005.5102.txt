We calculate solar models including dark matter (DM) weakly-interacting
massive particles (WIMPs) of mass 5-50 GeV and test these models against
helioseismic constraints on sound speed, convection zone depth, convection zone
helium abundance, and small separations of low-degree p-modes. Our main
conclusion is that both direct detection experiments and particle accelerators
may be complemented by using the Sun as a probe for WIMP DM particles in the
5-50 GeV mass range. The DM most sensitive to this probe has suppressed
annihilations and a large spin-dependent elastic scattering cross section. For
the WIMP cross-section parameters explored here, the lightest WIMP masses <10
GeV are ruled out by constraints on core sound speed and low-degree frequency
spacings. For WIMP masses 30-50 GeV, the changes to the solar structure are
confined to the inner 4% of the solar radius and so do not significantly affect
the solar p-modes. Future helioseismology observations, most notably involving
g-modes, and future solar neutrino experiments may be able to constrain the
allowable DM parameter space in a mass range that is of current interest for
direct detection.
