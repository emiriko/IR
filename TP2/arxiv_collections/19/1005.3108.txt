An energy-momentum tensor for general relativistic spinning fluids compatible
with Tulczyjew-type supplementary condition is derived from the variation of a
general Lagrangian with unspecified explicit form. This tensor is the sum of a
term containing the Belinfante-Rosenfeld tensor and a modified perfect-fluid
energy-momentum tensor in which the four-velocity is replaced by a unit
four-vector in the direction of fluid momentum. The equations of motion are
obtained and it is shown that they admit a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
space-time as a solution.
