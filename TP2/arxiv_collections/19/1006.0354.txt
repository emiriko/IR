We propose a definition for the information theoretic security of a quantum
public-key encryption scheme, and present bit-oriented and two-bit-oriented
encryption schemes satisfying our security definition via the introduction of a
new public-key algorithm structure. We extend the scheme to a multi-bitoriented
one, and conjecture that it is also information theoretically secure, depending
directly on the structure of our new algorithm.
