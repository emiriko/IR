The description of excited state dynamics in multichromophoric systems
constitutes both a theoretical and experimental challenge in modern physical
chemistry. An experimental protocol which can systematically characterize both
coherent and dissipative processes at the level of the evolving quantum state
of the chromophores is desired. In this article, we show that a carefully
chosen set of polarization controlled two-color heterodyned photon-echo
experiments can be used to reconstruct the time-evolving density matrix of the
one-exciton manifold of a heterodimer. This possibility in turn allows for a
complete description of the excited state dynamics via quantum process
tomography (QPT). Calculations on the dimer show that QPT can reveal rich
information about system-bath interactions, which otherwise appear nontrivially
hidden in the polarization monitored in standard four-wave mixing experiments.
Our study presents a novel method for analyzing condensed phase experiments
with a quantum information processing perspective.
