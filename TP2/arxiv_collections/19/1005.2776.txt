We describe the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) Early
Release Science (ERS) observations in the Great Observatories Origins Deep
Survey (GOODS) South field. The new WFC3 ERS data provide calibrated, drizzled
mosaics in the UV filters F225W, F275W, and F336W, as well as in the near-IR
filters F098M (Ys), F125W (J), and F160W (H) with 1-2 HST orbits per filter.
Together with the existing HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) GOODS-South
mosaics in the BViz filters, these panchromatic 10-band ERS data cover 40-50
square arcmin at 0.2-1.7 {\mu}m in wavelength at 0.07-0.15" FWHM resolution and
0.090" Multidrizzled pixels to depths of AB\simeq 26.0-27.0 mag (5-{\sigma})
for point sources, and AB\simeq 25.5-26.5 mag for compact galaxies.
  In this paper, we describe: a) the scientific rationale, and the data taking
plus reduction procedures of the panchromatic 10-band ERS mosaics; b) the
procedure of generating object catalogs across the 10 different ERS filters,
and the specific star-galaxy separation techniques used; and c) the reliability
and completeness of the object catalogs from the WFC3 ERS mosaics. The
excellent 0.07-0.15" FWHM resolution of HST/WFC3 and ACS makes star- galaxy
separation straightforward over a factor of 10 in wavelength to AB\simeq 25-26
mag from the UV to the near-IR, respectively.
