Measurements of inclusive charged-hadron transverse-momentum (pT) and
pseudorapidity (eta) distributions are presented for proton-proton collisions
at sqrt(s)=0.9 and 2.36 TeV. For non-single-diffractive interactions, the
average pT of charged hadrons is measured to be 0.46+-0.01(stat.)+-0.01(syst.)
GeV/c at 0.9 TeV and 0.50+-0.01(stat.)+-0.01(syst.) GeV/c at 2.36 TeV, for
|eta|<2.4. At these energies, the measured pseudorapidity densities in the
central region, dNch/deta(|eta|<0.5), are 3.48+-0.02(stat.)+-0.13(syst.) and
4.47+-0.04(stat.)+-0.16(syst.), respectively. The results at 2.36 TeV represent
the highest-energy measurements ever published at a particle collider at the
time of the presentation at the Lake Louise Winter Institute.
