Recent observational data on the type Ia supernova rates are in excellent
agreement with the old prediction of the population synthesis of binary stars
and confirm that the overwhelming majority of type Ia supernovas (~99%) in
elliptical galaxies form via mergers of binary white dwarfs with the total mass
exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.
