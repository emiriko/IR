The economic crisis in Argentina around year 2002 provides a unique
opportunity for Econophysics studies. The available data on individual income
are analyzed to show that they correspond to non stationary states. However,
the rather restricted size of the data survey imposes difficulties that must be
overcome through a careful analysis, for a reliable use. A new method of data
treatment is presented that could be helpful in theoretical studies.
