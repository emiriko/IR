In calculations of isoscalar magnetic moments of odd-odd N=Z nuclei it was
found that for medium to heavy mass nuclei large scale shell model calculations
yielded results which were very close to much simpler single j shell ones. To
understand this we compare isoscalar and isovector configuration mixing in
first order perturbation theory using a spin dependant delata interaction.The
isoscalar corrections are much smaller
