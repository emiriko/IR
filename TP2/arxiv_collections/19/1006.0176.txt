The paper is devoted to a study of the peristaltic motion of blood in the
micro-circulatory system. The vessel is considered to be of varying
cross-section. The progressive peristaltic waves are taken to be of sinusoidal
nature. Blood is considered to be a Herschel-Bulkley fluid. Of particular
concern here is to investigate the effects of amplitude ratio, mean pressure
gradient, yield stress and the power law index on the velocity distribution,
streamline pattern and wall shear stress. On the basis of the derived
analytical expression, extensive numerical calculations have been made. The
study reveals that velocity of blood and wall shear stress are appreciably
affected due to the non-uniform geometry of blood vessels. They are also highly
sensitive to the magnitude of the amplitude ratio and the value of the fluid
index.
