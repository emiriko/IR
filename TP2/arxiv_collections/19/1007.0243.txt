A warped extra-dimensional model, where the Standard Model Yukawa hierarchy
is set by UV physics, is shown to have a sweet spot of parameters with improved
experimental visibility and possibly naturalness. Upon marginalizing over all
the model parameters, a Kaluza-Klein scale of 2.1 TeV can be obtained at 2
sigma (95.4 CL) without conflicting with electroweak precision measurements.
Fitting all relevant parameters simultaneously can relax this bound to 1.7 TeV.
In this bulk version of the Rattazzi-Zaffaroni shining model, flavor violation
is also highly suppressed, yielding a bound of 2.4 TeV. Non-trivial flavor
physics at the LHC in the form of flavor gauge bosons is predicted. The model
is also characterized by a depletion of the third generation couplings -- as
predicted by the general minimal flavor violation framework -- which can be
tested via flavor precision measurements. In particular, sizable CP violation
in Delta B=2 transitions can be obtained, and there is a natural region where
Bs mixing is predicted to be larger than Bd mixing, as favored by recent
Tevatron data. Unlike other proposals, the new contributions are not linked to
Higgs or any scalar exchange processes.
