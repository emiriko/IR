A problem of finding stationary states of open quantum systems is addressed.
We focus our attention on a generic type of open system: a qubit coupled to its
environment. We apply the theory of block operator matrices and find stationary
states of two--level open quantum systems under certain conditions applied both
on the qubit and the surrounding.
