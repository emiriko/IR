In both the equations for matter and light wave propagation, the momentum of
the electromagnetic fields Pe reflects the relevant em interaction. As a review
of some applications of wave propagation properties, an optical experiment
which tests the speed of light in moving rarefied gases is described. Moreover,
Pe is also the link to the unitary vision of the quantum effects of the
Aharonov-Bohm (AB) type, which provide a useful quantum approach for the limit
of the photon mass mph. A bench-top experiment based on effects of the AB type
that exploit new interferometric techniques, is foreseen to yield the limit mph
= 10^-54 g, a value that improves upon the results achieved with other
approaches.
