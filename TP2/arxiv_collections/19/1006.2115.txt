This is an outline of Erlangen Program at Large. Study of objects and
properties, which are invariant under a group action, is very fruitful far
beyond the traditional geometry. In this paper we demonstrate this on the
example of the group SL(2,R). Starting from the conformal geometry we develop
analytic functions and apply these to functional calculus. Finally we provide
an extensive description of open problems.
