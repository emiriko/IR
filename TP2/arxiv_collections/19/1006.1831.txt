The persistent current in an ensemble of normal-metal rings shows Gaussian
distributed sample-to-sample fluctuations with non-Gaussian corrections, which
are precursors of the transition into the Anderson localized regime. We here
report a calculation of the leading non-Gaussian correction to the current
autocorrelation function, which is of third order in the current. Although the
third-order correlation function is small, inversely proportional to the
dimensionless conductance $g$ of the ring, the mere fact that it is nonzero is
remarkable, since it is an odd moment of the current distribution.
