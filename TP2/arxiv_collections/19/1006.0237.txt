We conjecture exact and simple formulas for physical quantities in two
quantum chains. A classic result of this type is Onsager, Kaufman and Yang's
formula for the spontaneous magnetization in the Ising model, subsequently
generalized to the chiral Potts models. We conjecture that analogous results
occur in the XYZ chain when the couplings obey J_xJ_y + J_yJ_z + J_x J_z=0, and
in a related fermion chain with strong interactions and supersymmetry. We find
exact formulas for the magnetization and gap in the former, and the staggered
density in the latter, by exploiting the fact that certain quantities are
independent of finite-size effects.
