We study the quantum correlation and classical correlation dynamics in a
spin-boson model. For two different forms of spectral density, we obtain
analytical results and show that the evolutions of both correlations depend
closely on the form of the initial state. At the end of evolution, all
correlations initially stored in the spin system transfer to reservoirs. It is
found that for a large family of initial states, quantum correlation remains
equal to the classical correlation during the course of evolution. In addition,
there is no increase in the correlations during the course of evolution.
