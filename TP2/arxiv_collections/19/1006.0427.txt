The discrete energy-eigenvalues of two nucleons interacting with a
finite-range nuclear force and confined to a harmonic potential are used to
numerically reconstruct the free-space scattering phase shifts. The extracted
phase shifts are compared to those obtained from the exact continuum scattering
solution and agree within the uncertainties of the calculations. Our results
suggest that it might be possible to determine the amplitudes for the
scattering of complex systems, such as n-d, n-t or n-alpha, from the
energy-eigenvalues confined to finite volumes using ab-initio bound-state
techniques.
