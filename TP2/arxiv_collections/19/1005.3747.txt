The blazar 1ES1218+30.4 has been previously detected by the VERITAS and MAGIC
telescopes in the very high energies. The new detection of VERITAS from
December 2008 to April 2009 proves that 1ES1218+30.4 is not static, but shows
short-time variability. We show that the time variability may be explained in
the context of a self-consistent synchrotron-self Compton model, while the long
time observation do not necessarily require a time-resolved treatment. The
kinetic equations for electrons and photons in a plasma blob are solved
numerically including Fermi acceleration for electrons as well as synchrotron
radiation and Compton scattering. The light curve observed by VERITAS can be
reproduced in our model by assuming a changing level of electron injection
compared to the constant state of 1ES1218+30.4. The multiwavelength behaviour
during an outburst becomes comprehensible by the model. The long time
measurements of VERITAS are still explainable via a constant emission in the
SSC context, but the short outbursts each require a time-resolved treatment.
