Low temperature specific heat has been measured in optimally doped and highly
overdoped non-superconducting BaFe$_{2-x}$TM$_x$As$_{2}$ ($TM$ = Co and Ni)
single crystals. By using the data of the overdoped samples, we successfully
removed the phonon contribution of the optimally doped ones, and derived the
electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma_e$. Remarkably, we found a
continuing temperature dependent $\gamma_e(T)$ which follows the quadratic
relation $\gamma_e=\gamma_0+\alpha T^2$ in the low temperature limit. Together
with the very small residual term $\gamma_0$, linear magnetic field dependence
of $\gamma_e$, it is concluded that there are either small segments of nodal
lines, or point-like nodes in these samples.
