The microscopic derivation of the second law for macroscopic system is given
under the phenomenological assumption that both the initial and final states
are described by mutually different canonical ensembles. In particular, it is
also shown that the entropy difference between the initial and final states is
composed of two positive components. One of the components is expressed as the
relative entropy between the initial and final states, while the other is
positive due to a dynamical stability called passivity of the canonical
ensemble.
