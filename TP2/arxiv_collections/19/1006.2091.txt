We consider (for the first time) the ratios of doubly heavy baryon masses
(spin 3/2 over spin 1/2 and SU(3) mass-splittings) using double ratios of sum
rules (DRSR), which are more accurate than the usual simple ratios often used
in the literature for getting the hadron masses. In general, our results agree
and compete in precision with potential model predictions. In our approach, the
alpha_s corrections induced by the anomalous dimensions of the correlators are
the main sources of the Xi^*_{QQ}- Xi_{QQ} mass-splittings, which seem to
indicate a 1/M_Q behaviour and can only allow the electromagnetic decay
Xi^*_{QQ} to Xi_{QQ}+ gamma but not to Xi_{QQ}+ pi. Our results also show that
the SU(3) mass-splittings are (almost) independent of the spin of the baryons
and behave approximately like 1/M_Q, which could be understood from the QCD
expressions of the corresponding two-point correlator. Our results can improved
by including radiative corrections to the SU(3) breaking terms and can be
tested, in the near future, at Tevatron and LHCb.
