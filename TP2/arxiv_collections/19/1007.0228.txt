We relate the problem of irreversibility of entanglement with the recently
defined measures of quantum correlation - quantum discord and one-way quantum
deficit. We show that the entanglement of formation is always strictly larger
than the coherent information and the entanglement cost is also larger in most
cases. We prove irreversibility of entanglement under LOCC for a family of
entangled states. This family is a generalization of the maximally correlated
states for which we also give an analytic expression for the distillable
entanglement, the relative entropy of entanglement, the distillable secret key
and the quantum discord.
