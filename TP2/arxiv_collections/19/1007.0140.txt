In order to test the Einstein gravitation theory (EGT) we compare their
predictions with the measured results in the following phenomena: the
perihelion advance of planets, deflection of light, radar echo delays around
the Sun and an overall planetary motion in Solar System. In our calculation we
have used the Schwarzschild metric that is defined in the surrounding vacuum of
a spherically symmetric mass distribution, not in rotation. This article was
written to graduate and postgraduate students of Physics.
