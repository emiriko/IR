In this paper, we study the Euler and Euler-Poisson equations in $R^{N}$,
with multiple $\gamma$-law for pressure function: \begin{equation}
P(\rho)=e^{s}\sum_{j=1}^{m}\rho^{\gamma_{j}}, \end{equation} where all
$\gamma_{i+1}>\gamma_{i}\geq1$, is the constants. The analytical line solutions
are constructed for the systems. It is novel to discover the analytical
solutions to handle the systems with mixed pressure function. And our solutions
can be extended to the systems with the generalized multiple damping and
pressure function.
