We study effects of viscous fluid coupled with dark matter in our universe.
We consider bulk viscosity in the cosmic fluid and we suppose the existence of
a coupling between fluid and dark matter, in order to reproduce a stable de
Sitter universe protected against future-time singularities. More general
inhomogeneous fluids are studied related to future singularities.
