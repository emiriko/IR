We prove pathwise uniqueness for stochastic differential equations driven by
non-degenerate symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes with values in $\R^d$
having a bounded and $\beta$-H\"older continuous drift term. We assume $\beta >
1 - \frac{\alpha}{2} $ and $\alpha \in [ 1, 2)$. The proof requires analytic
regularity results for associated integro-differential operators of Kolmogorov
type. We also study differentiability of solutions with respect to initial
conditions and the homeomorphism property.
