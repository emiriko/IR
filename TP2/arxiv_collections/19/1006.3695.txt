We construct exact solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for solitary
vortices, and approximate ones for fundamental solitons, in 2D models of
Bose-Einstein condensates with a spatially modulated nonlinearity of either
sign and a harmonic trapping potential. The number of vortex-soliton (VS) modes
is determined by the discrete energy spectrum of a related linear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The VS families in the system with the attractive and
repulsive nonlinearity are mutually complementary. \emph{% Stable} VSs with
vorticity $S\geq 2$ and those corresponding to higher-order radial states are
reported for the first time, in the case of the attraction and repulsion,
respectively.
