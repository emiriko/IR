We study the effects of mobility on the evolution of cooperation among mobile
players, which imitate collective motion of biological flocks and interact with
neighbors within a prescribed radius $R$. Adopting the prisoner's dilemma game
and the snowdrift game as metaphors, we find that cooperation can be maintained
and even enhanced for low velocities and small payoff parameters, when compared
with the case that all agents do not move. But such enhancement of cooperation
is largely determined by the value of $R$, and for modest values of $R$, there
is an optimal value of velocity to induce the maximum cooperation level.
Besides, we find that intermediate values of $R$ or initial population
densities are most favorable for cooperation, when the velocity is fixed.
Depending on the payoff parameters, the system can reach an absorbing state of
cooperation when the snowdrift game is played. Our findings may help
understanding the relations between individual mobility and cooperative
behavior in social systems.
