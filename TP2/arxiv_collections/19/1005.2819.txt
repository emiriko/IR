The importance of stochasticity within biological systems has been shown
repeatedly during the last years and has raised the need for efficient
stochastic tools. We present SABRE, a tool for stochastic analysis of
biochemical reaction networks. SABRE implements fast adaptive uniformization
(FAU), a direct numerical approximation algorithm for computing transient
solutions of biochemical reaction networks. Biochemical reactions networks
represent biological systems studied at a molecular level and these reactions
can be modeled as transitions of a Markov chain. SABRE accepts as input the
formalism of guarded commands, which it interprets either as continuous-time or
as discrete-time Markov chains. Besides operating in a stochastic mode, SABRE
may also perform a deterministic analysis by directly computing a mean-field
approximation of the system under study. We illustrate the different
functionalities of SABRE by means of biological case studies.
