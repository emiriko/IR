We investigate neutralino dark matter in the framework of NMSSM performing a
scan over its parameter space and calculating neutralino capture and
annihilation rates in the Sun. We discuss the prospects of searches for
neutralino dark matter in neutrino experiments depending on neutralino content
and its main annihilation channel. We recalculate the upper limits on
neutralino-proton elastic cross sections directly from neutrino telescopes
upper bounds on annihilation rates in the Sun. This procedure has advantages as
compared with corresponding recalcalations from the limits on muon flux,
namely, it is independent on details of the experiment and the recalculation
coefficients are universal for any kind of WIMP dark matter models. We derive
90% c.l. upper limits on neutralino-proton cross sections from the results of
the Baksan Underground Scintillator Telescope.
