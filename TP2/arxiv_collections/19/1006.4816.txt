We analyze interferometric measurements of the Luminous Blue Variable Eta
Carinae with the goal of constraining the rotational velocity of the primary
star and probing the influence of the companion. Using 2-D radiative transfer
models of latitude-dependent stellar winds, we find that prolate wind models
with a ratio of the rotational velocity (vrot) to the critical velocity (vcrit)
of W=0.77-0.92, inclination angle of i=60-90 degrees, and position angle
PA=108-142 degrees reproduce simultaneously K-band continuum visibilities from
VLTI/VINCI and closure phase measurements from VLTI/AMBER. Interestingly,
oblate models with W=0.73-0.90 and i=80-90 degrees produce similar fits to the
interferometric data, but require PA=210-230 degrees. Therefore, both prolate
and oblate models suggest that the rotation axis of the primary star is not
aligned with the Homunculus polar axis. We also compute radiative transfer
models of the primary star allowing for the presence of a cavity and dense
wind-wind interaction region created by the companion star. We find that the
wind-wind interaction has a significant effect on the K-band image mainly via
free-free emission from the compressed walls and, for reasonable model
parameters, can reproduce the VLTI/VINCI visibilities taken at phase 0.92-0.93.
We conclude that the density structure of the primary wind can be sufficiently
disturbed by the companion, thus mimicking the effects of fast rotation in the
interferometric observables. Therefore, fast rotation may not be the only
explanation for the interferometric observations. Intense temporal monitoring
and 3-D modeling are needed to resolve these issues.
