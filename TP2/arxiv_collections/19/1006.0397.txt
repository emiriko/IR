We investigate the connection between measure and capacity for the space of
nonempty closed subsets of {0,1}*. For any computable measure, a computable
capacity T may be defined by letting T(Q) be the measure of the family of
closed sets which have nonempty intersection with Q. We prove an effective
version of Choquet's capacity theorem by showing that every computable capacity
may be obtained from a computable measure in this way. We establish conditions
that characterize when the capacity of a random closed set equals zero or is
>0. We construct for certain measures an effectively closed set with positive
capacity and with Lebesgue measure zero.
