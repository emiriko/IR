In this communication, the mass declined for the decay channel, e+e- -> ZH ->
e+e- + X, as measured by the ILD detector was studied. The Higgs mass is
assumed to be 120 GeV and the center of mass energy is 250 GeV. For an
integrated luminosity of 250 fb-1, the accuracy of the reconstruction and the
good knowledge of the initial state allow for the measurement of the Higgs
boson mass with a precision of about 100 MeV.
