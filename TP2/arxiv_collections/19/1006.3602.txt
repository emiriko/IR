In the case of bipartite two qubits systems, we derive the analytical
expression of bound of Bell operator for any given pure state. Our result not
only manifest some properties of Bell inequality, for example which may be
violated by any pure entangled state and only be maximally violated for a
maximally entangled state, but also give the explicit values of maximal
violation for any pure state. Finally we point out that for two qubits systems
there is no mixed state which can produce maximal violation of Bell inequality.
