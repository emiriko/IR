We experimentally investigate the dynamics of classical and quantum
correlations of a Bell diagonal state in a non-Markovian dephasing environment.
The sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence regime is observed
during the dynamics of such kind of Bell diagonal state. Due to the refocusing
effect of the overall relative phase, the quantum correlation revives from near
zero and then decays again in the subsequent evolution. However, the
non-Markovian effect is too weak to revive the classical correlation, which
remains constant in the same evolution range. With the implementation of an
optical $\sigma_{x}$ operation, the sudden transition from quantum to classical
revival regime is obtained and correlation echoes are formed. Our method can be
used to control the revival time of correlations, which would be important in
quantum memory.
