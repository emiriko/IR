We performed a detailed analysis and the Monte Carlo simulation of the
neutron lifetime experiment [S. Arzumanov et al., Phys. Lett. B 483 (2000) 15]
because of the strong disagreement by 5.6 standard deviations between the
results of this experiment and our experiment [A. Serebrov et al., Phys. Lett.
B 605 (2005) 72]. We found a few effects which were not taken into account in
the experiment [S. Arzumanov et al., Phys. Lett. B 483 (2000) 15]. The possible
correction is -5.5 s with uncertainty of 2.4 s which comes from initial data
knowledge. We assume that after taking into account this correction the result
of work [S. Arzumanov et al., Phys. Lett. B 483 (2000) 15] for neutron lifetime
885.4 +/- 0.9stat +/- 0.4syst s could be corrected to 879.9 +/- 0.9stat +/-
2.4syst s.
