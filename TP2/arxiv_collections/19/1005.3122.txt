On the basis of first-principles calculations we study the effect of
interfacial Cr on the magnetoelectric properties of a composite multiferroic
Fe_L/BaTiO_3(001), with the Fe thickness L=1,2 monolayers. The use of the
CrO_2-terminated interface instead of TiO_2 may significantly enhance
magnetoelectricity in the system, showing an unexpected change in magnetization
induced by the electric polarization reversal. In the case of L=2, for
instance, the magnetic order of the Fe bilayer can be switched from nearly zero
ferrimagnetic to ferromagnetic upon polarization reversal.
