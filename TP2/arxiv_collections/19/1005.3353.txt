mc4qcd is a web based collaboration tool for analysis of Lattice QCD data.
Lattice QCD computations consists of a large scale Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
Multiple measurements are performed at each MC step. Our system acquires the
data by uploading log files, parses them for results of measurements, filters
the data, mines for required information by aggregating results, represents the
results as plots and histograms, and it further allows refining and interaction
by fitting the results. The system computes moving averages and
autocorrelations, builds bootstrap samples and bootstrap errors, and allows
modeling the data using Bayesian correlated constrained linear and non-linear
fits. It can be scripted to allow real time visualization of results form an
ongoing computation. The system is modular and it can be adapted to automating
the analysis workflow of different types of MC computations.
