In this paper we are extending the well known integrability theorems obtained
by multiple scale techniques to the case of linearizable difference equations.
As an example we apply the theory to the case of a differential-difference
dispersive equation of the Burgers hierarchy which via a discrete Hopf-Cole
transformation reduces to a linear differential difference equation. In this
case the equation satisfies the $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$ linearizability
conditions. We then consider its discretization. To get a dispersive equation
we substitute the time derivative by its symmetric discretization. When we
apply to this nonlinear partial difference equation the multiple scale
expansion we find out that the lowest order non-secularity condition is given
by a non-integrable nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Thus showing that this
discretized Burgers equation is neither linearizable not integrable.
