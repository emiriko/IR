Leonhard and Philbin [Phys. Rev. A 81, 011804(R) (2010)] have recently
constructed a mathematical proof that the Maxwell's fish-eye lens provides
perfect imaging of electromagnetic waves without negative refraction. In this
comment, we argue that the unlimited resolution is an artifact of having
introduced an unphysical drain at the position of the geometrical image. The
correct solution gives focusing consistent with the standard diffraction limit.
