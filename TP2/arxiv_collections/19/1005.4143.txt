In this paper we use the semiclassical Boltzmann equation to investigate the
transport properties of Dirac fermion on the surface of topological insulator
with magnetic impurities. The results obtained show that there is also a
minimal conductivity in this system as in graphene. We also argue the low
temperature transport property, and find that there is no low temperature
anomaly known as Kondo effect when the temperature is T>10^{-6}K.
