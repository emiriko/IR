One can recover sparse multivariate trigonometric polynomials from few
randomly taken samples with high probability (as shown by Kunis and Rauhut). We
give a deterministic sampling of multivariate trigonometric polynomials
inspired by Weil's exponential sum. Our sampling can produce a deterministic
matrix satisfying the statistical restricted isometry property, and also nearly
optimal Grassmannian frames. We show that one can exactly reconstruct every
$M$-sparse multivariate trigonometric polynomial with fixed degree and of
length $D$ from the determinant sampling $X$, using the orthogonal matching
pursuit, and $# X$ is a prime number greater than $(M\log D)^2$. This result is
almost optimal within the $(\log D)^2 $ factor. The simulations show that the
deterministic sampling can offer reconstruction performance similar to the
random sampling.
