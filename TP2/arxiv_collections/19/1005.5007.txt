A method for the search of exact solutions for equation of a nonlocal scalar
field in a non-flat metric is considered. In the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
metric the proposed method can be used in the case of an arbitrary potential,
with the exception of linear and quadratic potentials, and allows to get in
quadratures solutions, which depend on two arbitrary parameters. Exact
solutions have been found for an arbitrary cubic potential, which consideration
is motivated by the string field theory, as well as for exponential,
logarithmic and power potentials. It has been shown that one can add the
k-essence field to the model to get exact solutions for all Einstein equations.
