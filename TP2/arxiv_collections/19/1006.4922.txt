The sum rule for the transition rates between the components of two
multiplets, known for the one-photon transitions, is extended to the
multiphoton transitions in hydrogen and hydrogen-like ions. As an example the
transitions 3p-2p, 4p-3p and 4d-3d are considered. The numerical results are
compared with previous calculations.
