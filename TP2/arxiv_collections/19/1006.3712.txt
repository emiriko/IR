The CALICE collaboration has constructed highly granular hadronic and
electromagnetic calorimeter prototypes to evaluate technologies for the use in
detector systems at a future Linear Collider. The hadron calorimeter uses 7608
small scintillator cells individually read out with silicon photomultipliers.
This high granularity opens up the possibility for precise three dimensional
shower reconstruction and for software compensation techniques to improve the
energy resolution of the detector. We discuss the calibration procedure for the
analog hadronic calorimeter and present two software compensation methods based
on reconstructed clusters, which were developed with simulations and are
applied to hadronic test beam data.
