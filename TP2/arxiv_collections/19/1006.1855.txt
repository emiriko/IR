Non-local correlation effects in the half-filled Hubbard model on an
isotropic triangular lattice are studied within a spin polarized extension of
the dual fermion approach. A competition between the antiferromagnetic
non-collinear and the spin liquid states is strongly enhanced by an
incorporation of a k-dependent self-energy beyond the local dynamical
mean-field theory. The dual fermion correc- tions drastically decrease the
energy of a spin liquid state while leaving the non-collinear magnetic states
almost non-affected. This makes the spin liquid to become a preferable state in
a certain interval of interaction strength of an order of the magnitude of a
bandwidth. The spectral function of the spin-liquid Mott insulator is
determined by a formation of local singlets which results in the energy gap of
about twice larger than that of the 120 degrees antiferromagnetic Neel state.
