Let $H$ and $K$ be (finite or infinite dimensional) complex Hilbert spaces. A
characterization of positive completely bounded normal linear maps from
${\mathcal B}(H)$ into ${\mathcal B}(K)$ is given, which particularly gives a
characterization of positive elementary operators including all positive linear
maps between matrix algebras. This characterization is then applied give a
representation of quantum channels (operations) between infinite-dimensional
systems. A necessary and sufficient criterion of separability is give which
shows that a state $\rho$ on $H\otimes K$ is separable if and only if
$(\Phi\otimes I)\rho\geq 0$ for all positive finite rank elementary operators
$\Phi$. Examples of NCP and indecomposable positive linear maps are given and
are used to recognize some entangled states that cannot be recognized by the
PPT criterion and the realignment criterion.
