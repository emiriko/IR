We compute new chemical profiles for the core and envelope of white dwarfs
appropriate for pulsational studies of ZZ Ceti stars. These profiles are
extracted from the complete evolution of progenitor stars, evolved through the
main sequence and the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages,
and from time-dependent element diffusion during white dwarf evolution. We
discuss the importance of the initial-final mass relationship for the white
dwarf carbon-oxygen composition. In particular, we find that the central oxygen
abundance may be underestimated by about 15% if the white dwarf mass is assumed
to be the hydrogen-free core mass before the first thermal pulse. We also
discuss the importance for the chemical profiles expected in the outermost
layers of ZZ Ceti stars of the computation of the thermally-pulsing AGB phase
and of the phase in which element diffusion is relevant. We find a strong
dependence of the outer layer chemical stratification on the stellar mass. In
particular, in the less massive models, the double-layered structure in the
helium layer built up during the thermally-pulsing AGB phase is not removed by
diffusion by the time the ZZ Ceti stage is reached. Finally, we perform
adiabatic pulsation calculations and discuss the implications of our new
chemical profiles for the pulsational properties of ZZ Ceti stars. We find that
the whole $g-$mode period spectrum and the mode-trapping properties of these
pulsating white dwarfs as derived from our new chemical profiles are
substantially different from those based on chemical profiles widely used in
existing asteroseismological studies. Thus, we expect the asteroseismological
models derived from our chemical profiles to be significantly different from
those found thus far.
