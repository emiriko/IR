We study the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter at subnuclear density
in a Virial expansion for a nonideal gas. The gas consists of neutrons,
protons, alpha particles, and 8980 species of nuclei with $A \ge 12$ and masses
from the finite-range droplet model (FRDM). At very low density, the Virial
expansion reduces to nuclear statistical equilibrium. At higher density, the
Virial results match smoothly to the relativistic mean field results discussed
in our previous paper. We tabulate the resulting EOS at over 73,000 grid points
in the temperature range $T$ = 0.158 to 15.8 MeV, the density range $n_B$ =
10$^{-8}$ to 0.1 fm$^{-3}$, and the proton fraction range $Y_P$ = 0.05 to 0.56.
In the future we plan to match these low density results to our earlier high
density mean field results, and generate a full EOS table for use in supernova
and neutron star merger simulations. This Virial EOS is exact in the low
density limit.
