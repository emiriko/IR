Advances in embedded devices and wireless sensor networks have resulted in
new and inexpensive health care solutions. This paper describes the
implementation and the evaluation of a wireless body sensor system that
monitors human physiological data at home. Specifically, a waist-mounted
triaxial accelerometer unit is used to record human movements. Sampled data are
transmitted using an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless transceiver to a data logger unit.
The wearable sensor unit is light, small, and consumes low energy, which allows
for inexpensive and unobtrusive monitoring during normal daily activities at
home. The acceleration measurement tests show that it is possible to classify
different human motion through the acceleration reading. The 802.15.4 wireless
signal quality is also tested in typical home scenarios. Measurement results
show that even with interference from nearby IEEE 802.11 signals and microwave
ovens, the data delivery performance is satisfactory and can be improved by
selecting an appropriate channel. Moreover, we found that the wireless signal
can be attenuated by housing materials, home appliances, and even plants.
Therefore, the deployment of wireless body sensor systems at home needs to take
all these factors into consideration.
