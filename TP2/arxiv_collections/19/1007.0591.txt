We investigate one-way communication scenarios where Bob manipulating on his
parts can transfer some sub-system to the environment. We define reduced
versions of quantum communication rates and further, prove new upper bounds on
one-way quantum secret key, distillable entanglement and quantum channel
capacity by means of their reduced versions. It is shown that in some cases
they drastically improve their estimation.
