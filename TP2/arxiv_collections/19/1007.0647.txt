Recently, the neutron star X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 underwent a transition
to quiescence. We analyzed an XMM-Newton observation of this source in
quiescence, where we fitted the spectrum with two different neutron-star
atmosphere models. From the fits we constrained the allowed parameter space in
the mass-radius diagram for this source for an assumed range of distances to
the system. Comparing the results with different neutron-star equations of
state, we constrained the distance to EXO 0748-676. We found that the EOS model
'SQM1' is rejected by the atmosphere model fits for the known distance, and the
'AP3' and 'MS1' is fully consistent with the known distance.
