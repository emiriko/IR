The quantum well solar cell (QWSC) is a p - i - n solar cell with quantum
wells in the intrinsic region. Previous work has shown that QWSCs have a
greater open circuit voltage (Voc) than would be provided by a cell with the
quantum well effective bandgap. This suggests that the fundamental efficiency
limits of QWSCs are greater than those of single bandgap solar cells. The
following work investigates QWSCs in the GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs materials system. The
design and optimisation of a QWSC in this system requires studies of the
voltage and current dependencies on the aluminium fraction. QWSCs with
different aluminium fractions have been studied and show an increasing Voc with
increasing barrier aluminium composition. The QE however decreases with
increasing aluminium composition. We develop a model of the QE to test novel
QWSC designs with a view to minimising this problem. This work concentrates on
two design changes. The first deals with com- positionally graded structures in
which the bandgap varies with position. This bandgap variation introduces an
quasi electric field which can be used to increase minority carrier collection
in the low efficiency p and n layers. This technique also increases the light
flux reaching the highly efficient depletion regions. The second design change
consists of coating the back of the cell with a mirror to exploit the portion
of light which is not absorbed on the first pass. A model of the QE of
compositionally graded QWSC solar cells with back surface mirrors is developed
in order to analyse the effect of these design changes. These changes are
implemented separately in a number of QWSC designs and the resulting
experimental data compared with the model. An optimised design is then
presented.
