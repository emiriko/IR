We build upon and derive a precise far from carrier phase noise model for
radiation pressure driven opto-mechanical oscillators and show that
calculations based on our model accurately match published phase noise data for
such oscillators. Furthermore, we derive insights based on the equations
presented and calculate phase noise for an array of coupled disk resonators,
showing that it is possible to achieve phase noise as low as -80 dBc/Hz at 1
kHz offset for a 54 MHz opto-mechanical oscillator.
