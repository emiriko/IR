First we present a theoretical framework to compute the fully differential
cross sections for the top-quark productions and their subsequent decays at
hadron colliders, incorporating the bound-state effects which are important in
the t\bar{t} threshold region. We include the bound-state effects such that the
cross sections are correct in the LO approximation both in the threshold and
high-energy regions. Then, based on this framework we compute various
kinematical distributions of top quarks as well as of their decay products at
the LHC, by means of Monte-Carlo event-generation. These are compared with the
corresponding predictions based on conventional perturbative QCD. In
particular, we find a characteristic bound-state effect on the
(bW^+)-(\bar{b}W^-) double-invariant-mass distribution, which is deformed to
the lower invariant-mass side in a correlated manner.
