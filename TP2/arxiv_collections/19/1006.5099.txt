The Calculus of Wrapped Compartments (CWC) is a variant of the Calculus of
Looping Sequences (CLS). While keeping the same expressiveness, CWC strongly
simplifies the development of automatic tools for the analysis of biological
systems. The main simplification consists in the removal of the sequencing
operator, thus lightening the formal treatment of the patterns to be matched in
a term (whose complexity in CLS is strongly affected by the variables matching
in the sequences).
  We define a stochastic semantics for this new calculus. As an application we
model the interaction between macrophages and apoptotic neutrophils and a
mechanism of gene regulation in E.Coli.
