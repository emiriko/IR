The Pierre Auger Observatory has already collected more ultra high energy
cosmic ray data than all the previous experiments. With an hybrid detection
technique, it can provide coherent results on the flux, energy spectrum and
arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays, and characterize the
extensive air showers in order to probe the primary particle characteristics
and its interactions. These results will be presented from the point of view of
particle physics.
