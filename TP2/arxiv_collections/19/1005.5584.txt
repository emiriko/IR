The hardcore model is a model of lattice gas systems which has received much
attention in statistical physics, probability theory and theoretical computer
science. It is the probability distribution over independent sets $I$ of a
graph weighted proportionally to $\lambda^{|I|}$ with fugacity parameter
$\lambda$. We prove that at the uniqueness threshold of the hardcore model on
the $d$-regular tree, approximating the partition function becomes
computationally hard on graphs of maximum degree $d$.
  Specifically, we show that unless NP$=$RP there is no polynomial time
approximation scheme for the partition function (the sum of such weighted
independent sets) on graphs of maximum degree $d$ for fugacity $\lambda_c(d) <
\lambda < \lambda_c(d) + \epsilon(d)$ where $\lambda_c =
\frac{(d-1)^{d-1}}{(d-2)^d}$ is the uniqueness threshold on the $d$-regular
tree and $\epsilon(d)>0$. Weitz produced an FPTAS for approximating the
partition function when $0<\lambda < \lambda_c(d)$ so this result demonstrates
that the computational threshold exactly coincides with the statistical physics
phase transition thus confirming the main conjecture of [28]. We further
analyze the special case of $\lambda=1, d=6$ and show there is no polynomial
time algorithm for approximately counting independent sets on graphs of maximum
degree $d= 6$ which is optimal.
  Our proof is based on specially constructed random bi-partite graphs which
act as gadgets in a reduction to MAX-CUT. Building on the second moment method
analysis of [28] and combined with an analysis of the reconstruction problem on
the tree our proof establishes a strong version of 'replica' method heuristics
developed by theoretical physicists. The result establishes the first rigorous
correspondence between the hardness of approximate counting and sampling with
statistical physics phase transitions.
