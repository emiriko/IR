A rectangular "shifting cloak", which visually shifts the cloaked object for
a certain distance from the original place, is proposed. Comparing with the
previously proposed similar cloaks, this rectangular shifting cloak has a much
simpler structure, for it is constructed with only four blocks of homogeneous
materials. The shifting distance can be arbitrarily tuned from zero to infinity
in principle, thus the shifted image can be either in or out of the cloak.
Various kinds of objects that have different sizes, shapes and constitutive
parameters can be cloaked using the same device. Numerical simulations are
performed to verify the properties of the shifting cloak.
