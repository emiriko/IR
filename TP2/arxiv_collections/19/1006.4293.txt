The multiplicity, average transverse momentum, and charged particle
transverse momentum distributions have recently been measured in LHC
experiments. The multiplicity and average transverse momentum grow with beam
energy. Such growth is expected in the theory of the Color Glass Condensate, a
theory that incorporates the physics of saturation into the evolution of the
gluon distribution. We show that the energy dependence of the $p\overline{p}$
data and the LHC data for $pp$ scattering at \sqrt{s} > 200 GeV may be simply
described using a minimal amount of model input. Such a description uses
parameters consistent with the Color Glass Condensate descriptions of HERA and
RHIC experimental data.
