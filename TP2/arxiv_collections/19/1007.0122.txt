In this paper we prove a universal inequality describing the asymptotic
behavior of support points for planar continuous curves. As corollaries we get
an analogous result for tangent points of differentiable planar curves and some
(partially known) assertions on the asymptotic of the mean value points for
various classical analytic theorems. Some open questions are formulated.
