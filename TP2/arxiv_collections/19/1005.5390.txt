Numerical models of the tidal disruption of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf
galaxy have recently been developed that for the first time simultaneously
satisfy most observational constraints on the angular position, distance, and
radial velocity trends of both leading and trailing tidal streams emanating
from the dwarf. We use these dynamical models in combination with extant 3-D
position and velocity data for Galactic globular clusters and dSph galaxies to
identify those Milky Way satellites that are likely to have originally formed
in Sgr and been stripped from it during its extended interaction with the Milky
Way. We conclude that the globular clusters Arp 2, M 54, NGC 5634, Terzan 8,
and Whiting 1 are likely associated with the Sgr dwarf, and that Berkeley 29,
NGC 5053, Pal 12, and Terzan 7 may be as well. The initial Sgr system therefore
may have contained 5-9 globular clusters, corresponding to a specific frequency
S_N = 5 - 9 for an initial Sgr luminosity M_V = -15.0. Our result is consistent
with the 8\pm2 Sgr globular clusters expected from statistical modeling of the
Galactic globular cluster distribution and the corresponding false-association
rate due to chance alignments with the Sgr streams. These clusters are
consistent with previous reconstructions of the Sgr age-metallicity relation,
and show no evidence for a second-parameter effect shaping their horizontal
branch morphologies. We find no statistically significant evidence to suggest
that any of the recently discovered population of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies
are conclusively associated with the Sgr tidal streams. (Abridged).
