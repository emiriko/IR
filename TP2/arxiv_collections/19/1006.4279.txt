We perform calculations of the momentum distribution n(k) in solid \^4\He by
means of path integral Monte Carlo methods. We see that, in perfect crystal,
n(k) does not depend on temperature T and that is different from the classical
Gaussian shape of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, even though these
discrepancies decrease when the density of the system increases. In crystal
presenting vacancies, we see that for T \ge 0.75K, n(k) presents the same
behavior as in the perfect crystal, but, at lower T, it presents a peak when
k\to0.
