Statistical properties of the single electron levels confined in the
semiconductor (InAs/GaAs, Si/SiO2) double quantum dots (DQDs) are considered.
We demonstrate that in the electronically coupled chaotic quantum dots the
chaos with its level repulsion disappears and the nearest neighbor level
statistics becomes Poissonian. This result is discussed in the light of the
recently predicted "huge conductance peak" by R.S. Whitney at al. (Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 102}, 186802 (2009)) in the mirror symmetric DQDs.
