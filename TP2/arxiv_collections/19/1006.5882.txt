Using the retrodictive approach of quantum physics, we show that the state
retrodicted from the response of a measurement apparatus is a convenient tool
to fully characterize its quantum properties. We translate in terms of this
state some interesting aspects of the quantum behavior of a detector, such as
the non-classicality or the non-gaussian character of its measurements. We also
introduce estimators - the projectivity, the ideality, the fidelity or the
detectivity of measurements perfomed by the apparatus - which directly follow
from the retrodictive approach. Beyond their fundamental significance for
describing general quantum measurements, these properties are crucial in
several protocols, in particular in the conditional preparation of
non-classical states of light or in measurement-driven quantum information
processing.
