In a recent Letter [J. K. Dong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 087005 (2010)],
Dong \textit{et al}. have observed a $T^{1.5}$ dependence of resistivity $\rho$
in KFe$_2$As$_2$ at the upper critical field $B_{c2}$ = 5 T parallel to the c
axis and have suggested the existence of a field-induced quantum critical point
(QCP) at $B_{c2}$. In this comment, we argue that observation of a $T^{1.5}$
dependence of $\rho$ in a sample showing broad resistive transitions does not
constitute evidence for a QCP and that recent dHvA results do not support the
proposed QCP.
