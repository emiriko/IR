It has recently been shown that crystalline defects - dislocation lines - in
three dimensional topological insulators, can host protected one dimensional
modes propagating along their length. We generalize this observation to the
case of topological superconductors and other insulators of the Altland
Zirnbauer classification, in d=2,3 dimensions. In general, protected
dislocation modes are controlled by the topological indices in (d-1)
dimensions. This is shown by relating this feature to characteristic properties
of surface states of these topological phases. This observation also allows us
to constrain these surface states properties, which is illustrated by an
addition formula for (d-1) and (d-2) indices of a topological superconductor.
