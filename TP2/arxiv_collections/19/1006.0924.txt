It is now well established that in two-dimensional chiral p-wave paired
superfluids, the vortices carry zero-energy modes which obey non-abelian
exchange statistics and can potentially be used for topological quantum
computation. In such superfluids there may also exist other excitations below
the bulk gap inside the cores of vortices. We study the properties of these
subgap states, and argue that their presence affects the topological protection
of the zero modes. In conventional superconductors where the chemical potential
is of the order of the Fermi energy of a non-interacting Fermi gas, there is a
large number of subgap states and the mini-gap towards the lowest of these
states is a small fraction of the Fermi energy. It is therefore difficult to
cool the system to below the mini-gap and at experimentally available
temperatures, transitions between the subgap states, including the zero modes,
will occur and can alter the quantum states of the zero-modes. We show that
compound qubits involving the zero-modes and the parity of the occupation
number of the subgap states on each vortex are still well defined. However,
practical schemes taking into account all subgap states would nonetheless be
difficult to achieve. We propose to avoid this difficulty by working in the
regime of small chemical potential mu, near the transition to a strongly paired
phase, where the number of subgap states is reduced. We develop the theory to
describe this regime of strong pairing interactions and we show how the subgap
states are ultimately absorbed into the bulk gap. Since the bulk gap vanishes
as mu -> 0 there is an optimum value mu_c which maximises the combined gap. We
propose cold atomic gases as candidate systems where the regime of strong
interactions can be explored, and explicitly evaluate mu_c in a Feshbach
resonant K-40 gas.
