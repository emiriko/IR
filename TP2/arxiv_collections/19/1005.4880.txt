The complete contribution of diagrams with the light-by-light scattering to
the Lamb shift is found for muonic hydrogen, deuterium and helium ion. The
results are obtained in the static muon approximation and a part of the paper
is devoted to the verification of this approximation and analysis of its
uncertainty.
