EPW (Electron-Phonon coupling using Wannier functions) is a program written
in FORTRAN90 for calculating the electron-phonon coupling in periodic systems
using density-functional perturbation theory and maximally-localized Wannier
functions. EPW can calculate electron-phonon interaction self-energies,
electron-phonon spectral functions, and total as well as mode-resolved
electron-phonon coupling strengths. The calculation of the electron-phonon
coupling requires a very accurate sampling of electron-phonon scattering
processes throughout the Brillouin zone, hence reliable calculations can be
prohibitively time-consuming. EPW combines the Kohn-Sham electronic eigenstates
and the vibrational eigenmodes provided by the Quantum-ESPRESSO package [1]
with the maximally localized Wannier functions provided by the wannier90
package [2] in order to generate electron-phonon matrix elements on arbitrarily
dense Brillouin zone grids using a generalized Fourier interpolation. This
feature of EPW leads to fast and accurate calculations of the electron-phonon
coupling, and enables the study of the electron-phonon coupling in large and
complex systems.
