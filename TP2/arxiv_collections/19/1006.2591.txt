In this paper, we evaluate of the adsorption/ desorption of ammonia molecules
on a graphene surface by studying the Fermi level shift. Based on a physically
plausible model, the adsorption and desorption rates of ammonia molecules on
graphene have been extracted from the measured Fermi level shift as a function
of exposure time. An electric field-induced flipping behavior of ammonia
molecules on graphene is suggested, based on field effect transistor (FET)
measurements.
