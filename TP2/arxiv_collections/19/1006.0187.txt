This paper has been withdrawn by the author. In this short paper I present a
new approach to the problem of measurement, based on the difference between
language (reality) and meta-language (meta-reality). This way, it will be shown
as the measurement is a meta-sentence on a real event. It is no longer
necessary to split up the world into subject and object with a shifty boundary,
but starting with an holistic event (the phenomenon) in which everything is
entangled and make meta-assertion on this. This possible way out stops von
Neumann's chain and explains the real meaning of the concept of measurement.
