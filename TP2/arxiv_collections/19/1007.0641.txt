As known, physical circuits, e.g. integrated circuits or power system, work
in a distributed manner, but these circuits could not be easily simulated in a
distributed way. This is mainly because that the dynamical system of physical
circuits is nonlinear and the linearized system of physical circuits is
nonsymmetrical. This paper proposes a simple and natural strategy to mimic the
distributed behavior of the physical circuit by mimicking the distributed
behavior of the internal wires inside this circuit. Mimic Transmission Method
(MTM) is a new distributed algorithm to solve the nonlinear ordinary
differential equations extracted from physical circuits. It maps the
transmission delay of interconnects between subcircuits to the communication
delay of digital data link between processors. MTM is a black-box algorithm. By
mimicking the transmission lines, MTM seals the nonlinear dynamical system
within the subcircuit. As the result, we do not need to pay attention on how to
solve the nonlinear dynamic system or nonsymmetrical linear system in parallel.
MTM is a global direct algorithm, and it does only one distributed computation
at each time window to obtain accurate result, so unconvergence issues do not
need to be worried about.
