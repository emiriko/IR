Orbital degeneracy of the electronic conduction band edge in silicon is a
potential roadblock to the storage and manipulation of quantum information
involving the electronic spin degree of freedom in this host material. This
difficulty may be mitigated near an interface between Si and a barrier
material, where intervalley scattering may couple states in the conduction
ground state, leading to nondegenerate orbital ground and first excited states.
The level splitting is experimentally found to have a strong sample dependence,
varying by orders of magnitude for different interfaces and samples. The basic
physical mechanisms leading to such coupling in different systems are
addressed. We expand our recent study based on an effective mass approach,
incorporating the full plane-wave expansions of the Bloch functions at the
conduction band minima. Physical insights emerge naturally from a simple
Si/barrier model. In particular, we present a clear comparison between ours and
different approximations and formalisms adopted in the literature and establish
the applicability of these approximations in different physical scenarios.
