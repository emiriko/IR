Using a sample of 25.9 million psi(2S) decays acquired with the CLEO-c
detector at the CESR e^+e^- collider, we report branching fractions for the
decays chi_cJ -> p p-bar pi^0, p p-bar eta, and p p-bar omega, with J=0,1,2.
Our results for B(chi_cJ-> p p-bar pi^0) and B(chi_cJ-> p p-bar eta) are
consistent with, but more precise than, previous measurements. Furthermore, we
include the first measurement of B(chi_cJ-> p p-bar omega).
