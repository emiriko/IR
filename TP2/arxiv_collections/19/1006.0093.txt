A complex Hilbert space of dimension six supports at least three but not more
than seven mutually unbiased bases. Two computer-aided analytical methods to
tighten these bounds are reviewed, based on a discretization of parameter space
and on Grobner bases. A third algorithmic approach is presented: the
non-existence of more than three mutually unbiased bases in composite
dimensions can be decided by a global optimization method known as semidefinite
programming. The method is used to confirm that the spectral matrix cannot be
part of a complete set of seven mutually unbiased bases in dimension six.
