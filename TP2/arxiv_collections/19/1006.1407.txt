Interval temporal logics (ITLs) are logics for reasoning about temporal
statements expressed over intervals, i.e., periods of time. The most famous ITL
studied so far is Halpern and Shoham's HS, which is the logic of the thirteen
Allen's interval relations. Unfortunately, HS and most of its fragments have an
undecidable satisfiability problem. This discouraged the research in this area
until recently, when a number non-trivial decidable ITLs have been discovered.
  This paper is a contribution towards the complete classification of all
different fragments of HS. We consider different combinations of the interval
relations Begins, After, Later and their inverses Abar, Bbar, and Lbar. We know
from previous works that the combination ABBbarAbar is decidable only when
finite domains are considered (and undecidable elsewhere), and that ABBbar is
decidable over the natural numbers. We extend these results by showing that
decidability of ABBar can be further extended to capture the language
ABBbarLbar, which lays in between ABBar and ABBbarAbar, and that turns out to
be maximal w.r.t decidability over strongly discrete linear orders (e.g. finite
orders, the naturals, the integers). We also prove that the proposed decision
procedure is optimal with respect to the complexity class.
