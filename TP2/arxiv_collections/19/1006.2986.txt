The design of multi-channel gas electron multiplier (MGEM) with metallic
electrodes is proposed, produced and tested. The electrodes of MGEM are
produced from the brass plates with thickness of 1 mm, round openings of 1 mm
in diameter and 1.5 mm steps between them. The gap between the electrodes is
equal to 3 mm, while the total working area has a diameter of 20 mm. The neon
gas fillings of the MWGEM chamber with micro admixtures of N_2 and H_2O have
been tested. The total maximal coefficient of proportional multiplication of
electrons in neon with admixture of (H_2O+N_2)<100 ppm of 30000 is obtained.
