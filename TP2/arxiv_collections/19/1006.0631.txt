In this short reappraisal of spontaneous lepton number violation in a
supersymmetric scenario implemented through singlet sneutrino vacuum
expectation value (VEV), we contribute with two new things in the context where
the lepton number symmetry is global: (i) provide explicit expressions of
$R$-parity violating couplings in terms of the neutrino Yukawa couplings and
the singlet sneutrino VEV, and (ii) estimate the limit on this VEV using the
current knowledge of the light neutrino mass and the astrophysical constraint
on the Majoron-electron coupling. Besides, we put updated constraints on the
VEV and Yukawa coupling of the singlet superfield when lepton number is gauged.
