In this work we study the influence of an electric field on stripes and
compare our results with experimental findings from scanning tunneling
microscope measurements. By introducing a negative-bias electric field into a
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with stable stripe solutions, we show
that hole(electron)-like stripes widen (narrow) compared to the field free
case. When a magnetic field is introduced instead, stripe formation is found to
be suppressed.
