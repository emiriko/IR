A short summary of the LHCb muon identification procedure is given in this
article. First, the muon system of LHCb is presented, together with some
examples of physics measurements of the experiment where the muon
identification is crucial. Then, the muon identification algorithm is
introduced in three single steps. With this, the efficiency vs.
misidentification rate is shown for MC simulated data. The way this method will
be calibrated with real data is also seen. Finally, some preliminary muon
identification results with proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 900 GeV are
presented.
