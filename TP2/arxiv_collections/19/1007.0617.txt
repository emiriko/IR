DJpsiFDC is an event generator package for the process $gg\to J/\psi J/\psi$.
It generates events for primary leading-order $2\to 2$ processes. The package
could generate a LHE document and this document could easily be embedded into
detector simulation software frameworks. The package is produced in Fortran
codes.
