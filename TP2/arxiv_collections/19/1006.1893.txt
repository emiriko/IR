We study the non-equilibrium transport properties of a one-dimensional array
of dissipative quantum dots. Using the Keldysh formalism, we show that the
dots' dissipative nature leads to a spatial variation of the chemical
potential, which in disordered arrays, breaks the invariance of the current, I,
under bias reversal. Moreover, the array's nanoscopic size results in an
algebraic low-temperature dependence of I. Finally, we show that a local
Coulomb interaction splits the dots' electronic levels, resulting in a Coulomb
blockade, which is softened with increasing dissipation and array size.
