We experimentally demonstrate frequency translation of a nonclassical optical
field via the Bragg scattering four-wave mixing process in a photonic crystal
fiber (PCF). The high nonlinearity and the ability to control dispersion in PCF
enable efficient translation between photon channels within the visible
to-near-infrared spectral range, useful in quantum networks. Heralded single
photons at 683 nm were translated to 659 nm with an efficiency of $28.6 \pm
2.2$ percent. Second-order correlation measurements on the 683-nm and 659-nm
fields yielded $g^{(2)}_{683}(0) = 0.21 \pm 0.02$ and $g^{(2)}_{659}(0) = 0.19
\pm 0.05$ respectively, showing the nonclassical nature of both fields.
