Features below the first conductance plateau in ballistic quantum point
contacts (QPCs) are often ascribed to electron interaction and spin effects
within the single mode limit. In QPCs with a highly asymmetric geometry, we
observe sharp resonance peaks when the point contacts are gated to the single
mode regime, and surprisingly, under certain gating conditions, a complete
destruction of the 2e^2/h, first quantum plateau. The temperature evolution of
the resonances suggest non-Fermi liquid behavior, while the overall nonlinear
characterizations reveal features reminiscent of the 0.7 effect. We attribute
these unusual behaviors to the formation of a quasi bound state, which is
stabilized by a momentum-mismatch accentuated by asymmetry.
