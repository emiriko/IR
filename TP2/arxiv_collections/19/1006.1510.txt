For Anderson tight-binding models in dimension $d$ with random on-site
energies $\epsilon_{\vec r}$ and critical long-ranged hoppings decaying
typically as $V^{typ}(r) \sim V/r^d$, we show that the strong multifractality
regime corresponding to small $V$ can be studied via the standard perturbation
theory for eigenvectors in quantum mechanics. The Inverse Participation Ratios
$Y_q(L)$, which are the order parameters of Anderson transitions, can be
written in terms of weighted L\'evy sums of broadly distributed variables (as a
consequence of the presence of on-site random energies in the denominators of
the perturbation theory). We compute at leading order the typical and
disorder-averaged multifractal spectra $\tau_{typ}(q)$ and $\tau_{av}(q)$ as a
function of $q$. For $q<1/2$, we obtain the non-vanishing limiting spectrum
$\tau_{typ}(q)=\tau_{av}(q)=d(2q-1)$ as $V \to 0^+$. For $q>1/2$, this method
yields the same disorder-averaged spectrum $\tau_{av}(q)$ of order $O(V)$ as
obtained previously via the Levitov renormalization method by Mirlin and Evers
[Phys. Rev. B 62, 7920 (2000)]. In addition, it allows to compute explicitly
the typical spectrum, also of order $O(V)$, but with a different $q$-dependence
$\tau_{typ}(q) \ne \tau_{av}(q)$ for all $q>q_c=1/2$. As a consequence, we find
that the corresponding singularity spectra $f_{typ}(\alpha)$ and
$f_{av}(\alpha)$ differ even in the positive region $f>0$, and vanish at
different values $\alpha_+^{typ} > \alpha_+^{av}$, in contrast to the standard
picture. We also obtain that the saddle value $\alpha_{typ}(q)$ of the Legendre
transform reaches the termination point $\alpha_+^{typ}$ where
$f_{typ}(\alpha_+^{typ})=0 $ only in the limit $q \to +\infty$.
