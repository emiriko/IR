Using the Hyperz code (Bolzonella et al. 2000) we present photometric
redshift estimates for a random sample of galaxies selected from the SDSS/DR7
and GALEX/DR4, for which spectroscopic redshifts are also available.
  We confirm that the inclusion of ultraviolet photometry improves the accuracy
of photo-zs for those galaxies with g*-r* < 0.7 and z_spec < 0.2. We also
address the problem of how binary interactions can affect photo-z estimates,
and find that their effect is negligible.
