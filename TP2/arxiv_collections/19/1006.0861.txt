In today\^as world designing adaptable course material requires new technical
knowledge which involves a need for a uniform protocol that allows organizing
resources with emphasis on quality and Learning. This can be achieved by
bundling the resources in a known and prescribed fashion called Learning
objects. Learning Objects are composed of two aspects namely "Learning" and
"Object". The Learning aspect of Learning objects refers to Education. Since
Education is a process so the primary aim of learning objects tends to be
facilitating acquisition, assessment and conversion of content into Learning
objects while fostering the assimilation of these Learning objects into
learning modules and instruction. The Object part of Learning objects relates
to the Digital Electronic format of the resources i.e. to say that it deals
with the physical resource that forms the Learning objects. The objects in LOs
are analogous to objects used in object-oriented modeling (OOM). The analogy
helps visualize how LOs will be packaged, processed and transported across the
digital library as well as utilized in course building. OOM concepts such as
encapsulation, classification, polymorphism, inheritance and reuse can be
borrowed to describe the operations on LOs in the digital library. Thus, the
aim of this paper is threefolds. Firstly, to discuss the background of this
research and the concept of Learning Objects. Secondly, to provide a framework
for adaptive mechanism for the retrieval of Learning Objects and thirdly to
highlight the benefits that this new proposed framework shall bring.
