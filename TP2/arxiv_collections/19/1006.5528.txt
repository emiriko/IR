This paper discusses possible approaches to the escape rate in infinite
lattices of weakly coupled maps with uniformly expanding repeller. It is proved
that computed-via-volume rates of spatially periodic approximations grow
linearly with the period size, suggesting normalized escape rate as the
appropriate notion for the infinite system. The proof relies on symbolic
dynamics and is based on the control of cumulative effects of perturbations
within cylinder sets. A piecewise affine diffusive example is presented that
exhibits monotonic decay of the escape rate with coupling intensity.
