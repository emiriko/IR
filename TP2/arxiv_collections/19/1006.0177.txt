The present paper deals with a theoretical investigation of the peristaltic
transport of a couple stress fluid in a porous channel. The study is motivated
towards the physiological flow of blood in the micro-circulatory system, by
taking account of the particle size effect. The velocity, pressure gradient,
stream function and frictional force of blood are investigated, when the
Reynolds number is small and the wavelength is large, by using appropriate
analytical and numerical methods. Effects of different physical parameters
reflecting porosity, Darcy number, couple stress parameter as well as amplitude
ratio on velocity profiles, pumping action and frictional force, streamlines
pattern and trapping of blood are studied with particular emphasis. The
computational results are presented in graphical form. The results are found to
be in good agreement with those of Shapiro et. al \cite{r25} that was carried
out for a non-porous channel in the absence of couple stress effect. The
present study puts forward an important observation that for peristaltic
transport of a couple stress fluid during free pumping when the couple stress
effect of the fluid/Darcy permeability of the medium, flow reversal can be
controlled to a considerable extent. Also by reducing the permeability it is
possible to avoid the occurrence of trapping phenomenon.
