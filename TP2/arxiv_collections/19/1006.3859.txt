Galaxy cluster surveys based on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) mapping
are expected from ongoing experiments. Such surveys are anticipated to provide
a significant amount of information relevant to cosmology from the number
counts redshift distribution. We carry out an estimation of predicted SZE
counts and their redshift distribution taking into account the current
cosmological constraints and the X-ray cluster temperature distribution
functions. Comparison between local and distant cluster temperature
distribution functions provides evidence for an evolution in the abundance of
X-ray clusters that is not consistent with the use of standard scaling
relations of cluster properties in the framework of the current concordance
model. The hypothesis of some evolution of the scaling law driven by
non-gravitational processes is a natural solution to this problem. We perform a
MCMC statistical study using COSMOMC, combining current CMB observations from
WMAP, the SNIa Hubble diagram, the galaxy power spectrum data from SDSS and
X-ray clusters temperature distributions to predict SZE cluster number counts.
Models reproducing well the X-ray cluster temperature distribution function
evolution lead to a significantly lower SZE clusters number counts with a
distinctive redshift distribution. Ongoing microwave SZE surveys will therefore
shed new light on intracluster gas physics and greatly help to identify the
role of possible non-gravitational physics in the history of the hot gas
component of x-ray clusters.
