We show that the Plebanski based approach to transformation optics overlooks
some subtleties in the electrodynamics of moving dielectrics that restricts its
applicability to a certain class of transformations. An alternative, completely
covariant, approach is developed that is more generally applicable and provides
a clearer picture of transformation optics.
