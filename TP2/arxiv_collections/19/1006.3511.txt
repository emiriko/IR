We investigate a network of integrate-and-fire neurons characterized by a
distribution of spiking frequencies. Upon increasing the coupling strength, the
model exhibits a transition from an asynchronous regime to a nontrivial
collective behavior. At variance with the Kuramoto model, (i) the macroscopic
dynamics is irregular even in the thermodynamic limit, and (ii) the microscopic
(single-neuron) evolution is linearly stable.
