We apply our scalar-tensor-vector (STVG) modified gravity theory (MOG) to
calculate the infall velocities of the two clusters constituting the Bullet
Cluster 1E0657-06. In the absence of an applicable two-body solution to the MOG
field equations, we adopt an approximate acceleration formula based on the
spherically symmetric, static, vacuum solution of the theory in the presence of
a point source. We find that this formula predicts an infall velocity of the
two clusters that is consistent with estimates based on hydrodynamic
simulations.
