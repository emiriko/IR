The enforcement of access control policies using cryptography has received
considerable attention in recent years and the security of such enforcement
schemes is increasingly well understood. Recent work in the area has considered
the efficient enforcement of temporal and geo-spatial access control policies,
and asymptotic results for the time and space complexity of efficient
enforcement schemes have been obtained. However, for practical purposes, it is
useful to have explicit bounds for the complexity of enforcement schemes.
  In this paper, we consider interval-based access control policies, of which
temporal and geo-spatial access control policies are special cases. We define
enforcement schemes for interval-based access control policies for which it is
possible, in almost all cases, to obtain exact values for the schemes'
complexity, thereby subsuming a substantial body of work in the literature.
Moreover, our enforcement schemes are more practical than existing schemes, in
the sense that they operate in the same way as standard cryptographic
enforcement schemes, unlike other efficient schemes in the literature. The main
difference between our approach and earlier work is that we develop techniques
that are specific to the cryptographic enforcement of interval-based access
control policies, rather than applying generic techniques that give rise to
complex constructions and asymptotic bounds.
