The properties of elementary particles are encoded in their respective
propagators and interaction vertices. For a SU(2) gauge theory coupled to a
doublet of fundamental complex scalars these propagators are determined in both
the Higgs phase and the confinement phase and compared to the Yang-Mills case,
using lattice gauge theory. Since the propagators are gauge-dependent, this is
done in the Landau limit of 't Hooft gauge, permitting to also determine the
ghost propagator. It is found that neither the gauge boson nor the scalar
differ qualitatively in the different cases. In particular, the gauge boson
acquires a screening mass, and the scalar's screening mass is larger than the
renormalized mass. Only the ghost propagator shows a significant change.
Furthermore, indications are found that the consequences of the residual
non-perturbative gauge freedom due to Gribov copies could be different in the
confinement and the Higgs phase.
