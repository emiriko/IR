We report on the results from H{\alpha} imaging observations of the eastern
limb of Tycho's supernova remnant (SN1572) using the Wide Field Planetary
Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope. We resolve the detailed structure of
the fast, collisionless shock wave into a delicate structure of nearly edge-on
filaments. We find a gradual increase of H{\alpha} intensity just ahead of the
shock front, which we interpret as emission from the thin (~1") shock
precursor. We find that a significant amount of the H{\alpha} emission comes
from the precursor and that this could affect the amount of temperature
equilibration derived from the observed flux ratio of the broad and narrow
H{\alpha} components. The observed H{\alpha} emission profiles are fit using
simple precursor models, and we discuss the relevant parameters. We suggest
that the precursor is likely due to cosmic rays and discuss the efficiency of
cosmic-ray acceleration at this position.
