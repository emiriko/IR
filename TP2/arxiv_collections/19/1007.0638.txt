In this work we investigate a novel approach to handle the challenges of face
recognition, which includes rotation, scale, occlusion, illumination etc. Here,
we have used thermal face images as those are capable to minimize the affect of
illumination changes and occlusion due to moustache, beards, adornments etc.
The proposed approach registers the training and testing thermal face images in
polar coordinate, which is capable to handle complicacies introduced by scaling
and rotation. Line features are extracted from thermal polar images and feature
vectors are constructed using these line. Feature vectors thus obtained passes
through principal component analysis (PCA) for the dimensionality reduction of
feature vectors. Finally, the images projected into eigenspace are classified
using a multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used Object Tracking
and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database. Experimental
results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the verification
and identification performance and the success rate is 99.25%.
