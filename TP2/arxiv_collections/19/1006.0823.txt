The method of the optical approximation is used to estimate the high
frequency impedances of different vacuum chamber transitions of the European
XFEL beam line. The approximations of the longitudinal impedances are obtained
in terms of simple one-dimensional integrals. The transverse impedances are
written in analytical closed form. The analytical results are compared with the
results obtained by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations.
