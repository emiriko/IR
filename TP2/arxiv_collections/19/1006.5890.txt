We determine at NNLO (3-loop) of QCD the dynamical parton distributions of
the nucleon generated radiatively from valencelike positive input distributions
at an optimally chosen low resolution scale (Q_0^2<1 GeV^2) by employing the
"fixed flavor number factorization scheme" (FFNS). These are compared with
"standard" NNLO distributions, generated at some fixed and higher resolution
scale (Q_0^2>1 GeV^2). The NNLO corrections imply in both approaches an
improved value of \chi^2, typically \chi^2_{NNLO} \sim 0.9\chi^2_{NLO}. The
dynamical NNLO uncertainties are somewhat smaller than the NLO ones and both
are, as expected, smaller than those of their "standard" counterparts. The
dynamical predictions for F_L(x,Q^2) become perturbatively stable already at
Q^2 = 2 - 3 GeV^2, where precision measurements could even delineate NNLO
effects in the very small-x region. Using these NNLO dynamical parton
distributions in the FFNS as input, we generate radiatively parton
distributions in the "variable flavor number factorization scheme" (VFNS) as
well, where also the heavy quark flavors (c,b,t) become massless partons within
the nucleon. Only within the VFNS are NNLO calculations feasible at present,
since the required partonic subprocesses are available only in the
approximation of massless initial-state partons. The NNLO predictions for gauge
boson production are typically larger (by more than 1 sigma) than the NLO ones,
and rates at LHC energies can be predicted with an accuracy of about 5%,
whereas at Tevatron they are more than 2 sigma above the NLO ones. The NNLO
predictions for SM Higgs boson production via the dominant gluon fusion process
have a total (PDFs and scale) uncertainty of about 10% at LHC which almost
doubles at the lower Tevatron energies; these predictions are typically about
20% larger than the ones at NLO but the total uncertainty bands overlap.
