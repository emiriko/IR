After a discovery of the Higgs boson the next question is what are its
couplings. At the LHC there should be many observable channels which can be
exploited to measure the relevant parameters in the Higgs sector. Using the
SFitter framework we map these measurements onto the parameter space of a
weak-scale effective theory with free Higgs boson couplings. Our analysis
benefits from the parameter determination tools and the error treatment used in
new-physics searches, to study individual parameters and their error bars as
well as parameter correlations. A special focus we will put on recent analyses
using jet substructure techniques.
