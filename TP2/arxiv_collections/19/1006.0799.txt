We introduce the resonant metalens, a cluster of coupled subwavelength
resonators. Dispersion allows the conversion of subwavelength wavefields into
temporal signatures while the Purcell effect permits an efficient radiation of
this information in the far-field. The study of an array of resonant wires
using microwaves provides a physical understanding of the underlying mechanism.
We experimentally demonstrate imaging and focusing from the far-field with
resolutions far below the diffraction limit. This concept is realizable at any
frequency where subwavelength resonators can be designed.
