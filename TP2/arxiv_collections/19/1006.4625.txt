Mixing properties of discrete-time quantum walks on two-dimensional grids
with torus-like boundary conditions are analyzed, focusing on their connection
to the complexity of the corresponding abstract search algorithm. In
particular, an exact expression for the stationary distribution of the coherent
walk over odd-sided lattices is obtained after solving the eigenproblem for the
evolution operator for this particular graph. The limiting distribution and
mixing time of a quantum walk with a coin operator modified as in the abstract
search algorithm are obtained numerically. On the basis of these results, the
relation between the mixing time of the modified walk and the running time of
the corresponding abstract search algorithm is discussed.
