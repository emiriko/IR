The strong and electromagnetic decays of $X(4350)$ with quantum numbers $J^P
=0^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ have been studied by using the effective Lagrangian
approach. The coupling constant between $X(4350)$ and $D_s^{\ast}D_{s0}^{\ast}$
is determined with the help of the compositeness condition which means that
$X(4350)$ is a bound state of $D_s^{\ast}D_{s0}^{\ast}$. Other coupling
constants applied in the calculation are determined phenomenologically. Our
numerical results show that, using the present data within the present model,
the possibility that $X(4350)$ is a $D_s^{\ast}D_{s0}^{\ast}$ molecule can not
be ruled out.
