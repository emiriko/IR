In this paper, we study the ordinarity of an isotrivial elliptic surface
defined over a field of positive characteristic. If an isotrivial elliptic
fibration $\pi:X \to C$ is given, $X$ is ordinary when the common fiber of
$\pi$ is ordinary and a certain finite cover of the base $C$ is ordinary. By
this result, we may obtain the ordinary reduction theorem for some kinds of
isotrivial elliptic fibrations.
