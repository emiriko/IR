The contribution of this paper is to provide a semantic model (using soft
constraints) of the words used by web-users to describe objects in a language
game; a game in which one user describes a selected object of those composing
the scene, and another user has to guess which object has been described. The
given description needs to be non ambiguous and accurate enough to allow other
users to guess the described shape correctly.
  To build these semantic models the descriptions need to be analyzed to
extract the syntax and words' classes used. We have modeled the meaning of
these descriptions using soft constraints as a way for grounding the meaning.
  The descriptions generated by the system took into account the context of the
object to avoid ambiguous descriptions, and allowed users to guess the
described object correctly 72% of the times.
