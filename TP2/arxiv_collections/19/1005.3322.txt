We report the compositional dependence of the electronic band structure for a
range of III-V alloys. Density functional theory with the PBE functional is
insufficient to mimic the electronic gap energies at different symmetry points
of the Brillouin zone. The HSE hybrid functional with screened exchange
accurately reproduces the experimental band gaps and, more importantly, the
alloy concentration of the direct-indirect gap crossovers for the III-V alloys
studied here: AlGaAs, InAlAs, AlInP, InGaP, and GaAsP.
