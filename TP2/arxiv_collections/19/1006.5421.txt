We discuss the effect of the recent change of $V_{\rm us}$ by three standard
deviations on the standard model predictions for neutron beta decay
observables. We also discuss the effect the experimental error bars of $V_{\rm
us}$ have on such predictions. Refined precision tests of the standard model
will be made by a combined effort to improve measurements in neutron beta decay
and in strangeness-changing decays. By itself the former will yield very
precise measurements of $V_{\rm ud}$ and make also very precise predictions for
$V_{\rm us}$.
