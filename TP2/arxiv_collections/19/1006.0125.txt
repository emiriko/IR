We develop an approximate model for the process of direct (nonsequential)
two-photon double ionization of atoms. Employing the model, we calculate
(generalized) total cross sections as well as energy-resolved differential
cross sections of helium for photon energies ranging from 39 to 54 eV. A
comparison with results of \textit{ab initio} calculations reveals that the
agreement is at a quantitative level. We thus demonstrate that this complex
ionization process is fully described by the simple model, providing insight
into the underlying physical mechanism. Finally, we use the model to calculate
generalized cross sections for the two-photon double ionization of neon in the
nonsequential regime.
