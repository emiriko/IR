Cosmological shocks are a critical part of large-scale structure formation,
and are responsible for heating the intracluster medium in galaxy clusters. In
addition, they are also capable of accelerating non-thermal electrons and
protons. In this work, we focus on the acceleration of electrons at shock
fronts, which is thought to be responsible for radio relics - extended radio
features in the vicinity of merging galaxy clusters. By combining high
resolution AMR/N-body cosmological simulations with an accurate shock finding
algorithm and a model for electron acceleration, we calculate the expected
synchrotron emission resulting from cosmological structure formation. We
produce synthetic radio maps of a large sample of galaxy clusters and present
luminosity functions and scaling relationships. With upcoming long wavelength
radio telescopes, we expect to see an abundance of radio emission associated
with merger shocks in the intracluster medium. By producing observationally
motivated statistics, we provide predictions that can be compared with
observations to further improve our understanding of magnetic fields and
electron shock acceleration.
