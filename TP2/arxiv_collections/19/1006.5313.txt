We have measured the cross section of the radiative process e+e- ->
pi+pi-gamma with the KLOE detector at the Frascati phi-factory DAPHNE, from
events taken at a CM energy W=1 GeV. Initial state radiation allows us to
obtain the cross section for e+e- -> pi+pi-, the pion form factor |F_pi|^2 and
the dipion contribution to the muon magnetic moment anomaly, Delta a_mu^{pipi}
= (478.5+-2.0_{stat}+-5.0_{syst}+-4.5_{th}) x 10^{-10} in the range 0.1 <
M_{pipi}^2 < 0.85 GeV^2, where the theoretical error includes a SU(3) ChPT
estimate of the uncertainty on photon radiation from the final pions. The
discrepancy between the Standard Model evaluation of a_mu and the value
measured by the Muon g-2 collaboration at BNL is confirmed.
