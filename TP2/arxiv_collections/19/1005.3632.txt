A joint characterization of reachability (controllability) and observability
(constructibility) for linear SISO nonuniformly sampled discrete systems is
presented. The work generalizes to the nonuniform sampling the criterion known
for the uniform sampling. Emphasis is on the nonuniform sampling sequence,
which is believed to be an additional element for analysis and handling of
discrete systems.
