We overview the status of the studies on neutrino oscillations with
accelerators at the present running experiments. Past and present results
enlighten the path towards the observation of massive neutrinos and the
settling of their oscillations. The very near future may still have addiction
from the outcome of the on-going experiments. OPERA is chosen as a relevant
example justified by the very recent results released.
