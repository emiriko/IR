The possible origin of the R-parity violating interactions in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model and its connection to the radiative symmetry
breaking mechanism (RSBM) is investigated. In the context of the simplest model
where the implementation of the RSBM is possible, we find that in the majority
of the parameter space R-parity is spontaneously broken at the low-scale. These
results hint at the possibility that R-parity violating processes will be
observed at the Large Hadron Collider, if Supersymmetry is realized in nature.
