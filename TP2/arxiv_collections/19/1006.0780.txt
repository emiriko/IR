We give a rigorous mathematical proof for the validity of the toric sheaf
cohomology algorithm conjectured in the recent paper by R. Blumenhagen, B.
Jurke, T. Rahn, and H. Roschy (arXiv:1003.5217). We actually prove not only the
original algorithm but also a speed-up version of it. Our proof is independent
from (in fact appeared earlier on the arXiv than) the proof by H. Roschy and T.
Rahn (arXiv:1006.2392), and has several advantages such as being shorter and
cleaner and can also settle the additional conjecture on "Serre duality for
Betti numbers" which was raised but unresolved in arXiv:1006.2392.
