The Galaxy Ultraviolet Explorer (GALEX) satellite has recently shown the
presence of an extended, outer ring studded with UV-bright knots surrounding
the lenticular galaxy NGC 4262. Such a structure---not detected in the
optical---is coupled with a ring of atomic (HI) gas. We want to show that both
star-forming and HI rings surrounding this SB0 galaxy share the same radial
distance from the galaxy center and spatial orientation. We want also to model
the kinematics of the ring(s) and of the galaxy body. We make use of archive
FUV and NUV GALEX data plus HI observations from the literature. We confirm
that the UV-bright and atomic gas rings of NGC 4262 have the same extent and
projected spatial orientation. Their kinematics is not coupled with that of the
galaxy stars. It is possible that NGC 4262 has undergone a major gas stripping
event in the past which gave origin to the present "necklace" of UV-bright
knots.
