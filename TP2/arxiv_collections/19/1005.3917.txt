We show that all geometric quantum gates (GQG's in short), which are quantum
gates only with geometric phases, are robust against control field strength
errors. As examples of this observation, we show (1) how robust composite
rf-pulses in NMR are geometrically constructed and (2) a composite rf-pulse
based on Trotter-Suzuki Formulas is a GQG.
