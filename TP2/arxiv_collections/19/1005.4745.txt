We investigate the spin- and energy dependent tunneling through a single
organic molecule (CoPc) adsorbed on a ferromagnetic Fe thin film, spatially
resolved by low-temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy.
Interestingly, the metal ion as well as the organic ligand show a significant
spin-dependence of tunneling current flow. State-of-the-art ab initio
calculations including also van-der-Waals interactions reveal a strong
hybridization of molecular orbitals and surface 3d states. The molecule is
anionic due to a transfer of one electron, resulting in a non-magnetic (S= 0)
state. Nevertheless, tunneling through the molecule exhibits a pronounced
spin-dependence due to spin-split molecule-surface hybrid states.
