Of the 26 transiting exoplanet systems with measurements of the
Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, eight have now been found to be significantly
spin-orbit misaligned in the plane of the sky. Unfortunately, the RM effect
only measures the angle between the orbit of a transiting exoplanet and the
spin of its host star projected in the plane of sky, leaving unconstrained the
compliment misalignment angle between the orbit of the planet and the spin of
its host star along the line of sight. I use a simple model of stellar rotation
benchmarked with observational data to statistically identify ten exoplanet
systems from a sample of 75 for which there is likely a significant degree of
misalignment along the line of sight between the orbit of the planet and the
spin of its host star. I find that HAT-P-7, HAT-P-14, HAT-P-16, HD 17156,
Kepler-5, Kepler-7, TrES-4, WASP-1, WASP-12, and WASP-14 are likely spin-orbit
misaligned along the line of sight. All ten systems have host stellar masses
M_star in the range 1.2 M_sun <= M_star <= 1.5 M_sun, and the probability of
this occurrence by chance is less than one in ten thousand. In addition, the
planets in the candidate misaligned systems are preferentially massive and
eccentric. The coupled distribution of misalignment from the RM effect and from
this anaylsis suggests that transiting exoplanets are more likely to be
spin-orbit aligned than expected given predictions for a transiting planet
population produced entirely by planet-planet scattering or Kozai cycles and
tidal friction. For that reason, there are likely two populations of close-in
exoplanet systems: a population of aligned systems and a population of
apparently misaligned systems in which the processes that lead to misalignment
or to the survival of misaligned systems operate more efficiently in systems
with massive stars and planets. (abridged)
