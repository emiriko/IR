Issues concerning the structure and evolution of core collapse progenitor
stars are discussed with an emphasis on interior evolution. We describe a
program designed to investigate the transport and mixing processes associated
with stellar turbulence, arguably the greatest source of uncertainty in
progenitor structure, besides mass loss, at the time of core collapse. An
effort to use precision observations of stellar parameters to constrain
theoretical modeling is also described.
