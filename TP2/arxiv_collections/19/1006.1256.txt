We rigorously derive explicit formulae for the pair correlation function of
the ground state of the free Fermi gas in the thermodynamic limit for general
geometries of the macroscopic regions occupied by the particles and arbitrary
dimension. As a consequence we also establish the asymptotic validity of the
local density approximation for the corresponding exchange energy. At constant
density these formulae are universal and do not depend on the geometry of the
underlying macroscopic domain. In order to identify the correlation effects in
the thermodynamic limit, we prove a local Weyl law for the spectral asymptotics
of the Laplacian for certain quantum observables which are themselves dependent
on a small parameter under very general boundary conditions.
