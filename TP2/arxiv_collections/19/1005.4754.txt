Nanopores -- nanosized holes that can transport ions and molecules -- are
very promising devices for genomic screening, in particular DNA sequencing.
Both solid-state and biological pores suffer from the drawback, however, that
the channel constituting the pore is long, viz. 10-100 times the distance
between two bases in a DNA molecule (0.5 nm for single-stranded DNA). Here, we
demonstrate that it is possible to realize and use ultrathin nanopores
fabricated in graphene monolayers for single-molecule DNA translocation. The
pores are obtained by placing a graphene flake over a microsize hole in a
silicon nitride membrane and drilling a nanosize hole in the graphene using an
electron beam. As individual DNA molecules translocate through the pore,
characteristic temporary conductance changes are observed in the ionic current
through the nanopore, setting the stage for future genomic screening.
