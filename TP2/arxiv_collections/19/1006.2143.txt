Josephson tunneling between nanoclusters is analyzed. The discrete nature of
the electronic energy spectra, including their shell ordering, is explicitly
taken into account. The treatment considers the two distinct cases of resonant
and non-resonant tunneling. It is demonstrated that the current density greatly
exceeds the value discussed in the conventional theory. Nanoparticles are shown
to be promising building blocks for nanomaterials-based tunneling networks.
