In this work we examine two recent effective shell model interactions, JUN45
and JJ4B, that have been proposed for use in the $f_{5/2},p_{3/2}, p_{1/2},
g_{9/2}$ model space for both protons and neutrons. We calculate a number of
quantities that did not enter into the fits undertaken to fix the parameters of
both interactions. In particular we consider static quadrupole moments (Q's) of
excited states of the even-even $^{70-76}$Ge isotopes, as well as the B(E2)
values in these nuclei. (We have previously studied $^{70}$Zn isotopes using
JJ4B.) Some striking disagreements between the JUN45 prediction and the
experimental results had already been noted for the quadrupole moments of the
$2_1^+$ states of these nuclei. We investigate whether these discrepancies also
occur for the JJ4B interaction. Subsequently, we also apply both interactions
to calculate the Q's of some more highly excited states and compare the two
sets of predictions regarding the nature of the nuclear states under
consideration. In order to gain insight into these more complex large-scale
shell-model calculations, we examine the corresponding and much simpler
single-j shell model calculations in the $g_{9/2}$ neutron shell.
