The evolution of distributed architectures and programming paradigms for
performance-oriented program development, challenge the state-of-the-art
technology for performance tools. The area of high performance computing is
rapidly expanding from single parallel systems to clusters and grids of
heterogeneous sequential and parallel systems. Performance analysis and tuning
applications is becoming crucial because it is hardly possible to otherwise
achieve the optimum performance of any application. The objective of this paper
is to study the state-of-the-art technology of the existing performance tools
for distributed systems. The paper surveys some representative tools from
different aspects in order to highlight the approaches and technologies used by
them.
