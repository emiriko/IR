This chapter presents some of the links between automata theory and symbolic
dynamics. The emphasis is on two particular points. The first one is the
interplay between some particular classes of automata, such as local automata
and results on embeddings of shifts of finite type. The second one is the
connection between syntactic semigroups and the classification of sofic shifts
up to conjugacy.
