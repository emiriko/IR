Muon spin spectroscopy and in particular the avoided level crossing technique
is introduced, with the aim of showing it as a very sensitive local probe for
electron spin relaxation in organic semiconductors. Avoided level crossing data
on TMS-pentacene at different temperatures are presented, and they are analysed
to extract the electron spin relaxation rate, that is shown to increase on
increasing the temperature from 0.02 MHz to 0.33 MHz at 3 K and 300 K
respectively.
