We present results from the earliest observations of DEBRIS, a Herschel Key
Programme to conduct a volume- and flux-limited survey for debris discs in
A-type through M-type stars. PACS images (from chop/nod or scan-mode
observations) at 100 and 160 micron are presented toward two A-type stars and
one F-type star: beta Leo, beta UMa and eta Corvi. All three stars are known
disc hosts. Herschel spatially resolves the dust emission around all three
stars (marginally, in the case of beta UMa), providing new information about
discs as close as 11 pc with sizes comparable to that of the Solar System. We
have combined these data with existing flux density measurements of the discs
to refine the SEDs and derive estimates of the fractional luminosities,
temperatures and radii of the discs.
