A universal mechanism for strong magnetic-field effects of nonmagnetic
organic semiconductors is presented. A weak magnetic field (less than hundreds
mT) can substantially change the charge carrier hopping coefficient between two
neighboring organic molecules when the two hopping states are not too
symmetric. Under the illumination of lights or under a high electric field, the
change of hopping coefficients leads also to the change of polaron density so
that photocurrent, photoluminescence, electroluminescence, magnetoresistance
and electrical-injection current become sensitive to a weak magnetic field. The
present theory can not only explain all observed features, but also provide a
solid theoretical basis for the widely used empirical fitting formulas.
