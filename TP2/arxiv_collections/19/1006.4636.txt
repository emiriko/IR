The QCD critical point can be found in heavy ion collision experiments via
the non-monotonic behavior of many fluctuation observables as a function of the
collision energy. The event-by-event fluctuations of various particle
multiplicities are enhanced in those collisions that freeze out near the
critical point. Higher, non-Gaussian, moments of the event-by-event
distributions of such observables are particularly sensitive to critical
fluctuations, since their magnitude depends on the critical correlation length
to a high power. We present quantitative estimates of the contribution of
critical fluctuations to the third and fourth moments of the pion, proton and
net proton multiplicities, as well as estimates of various measures of
pion-proton correlations, all as a function of the same five non-universal
parameters, one of which is the correlation length that parametrizes proximity
to the critical point. We show how to use nontrivial but parameter independent
ratios among these more than a dozen fluctuation observables to discover the
critical point. We also construct ratios that, if the critical point is found,
can be used to overconstrain the values of the non-universal parameters.
