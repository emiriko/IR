We show that the zero field normal-state resistivity above Tc for various
levels of electron doping-both for underdoped, optimally, and overdoped
LaO1-xFxFeAs, i.e. (x=0.05-0.075 and 0.1-0.2) and underdoped SmO1-xFxFeAs
(x=0.06- 0.1) members of the 1111-iron-pnictide superconductor family-can be
scaled in a broad temperature range from 20 to 300 K onto a single universal
curve. The scaling was performed using the energy scale Delta, the resistivity
rho(Delta) and the residual resistivity rho0 as scaling parameters as well as
applying a recently proposed model-independent scaling method (H. G. Luo, Y. H.
Su, and T. Xiang, Phys. Rev. B 77, 014529 (2008)). The scaling parameters have
been calculated and the compositional variation of Delta has been determined.
The existence of a universal metallic rho(T) curve is interpreted as an
indication of a single mechanism which dominates the scattering of the charge
carriers in LaO1-xFxFeAs (x= 0.05 to 0.075 and 0.1 to 0.2) and SmO1-xFxFeAs (x
= 0.06 to 0.1) .
