We demonstrate lasing oscillation in a three-dimensional photonic crystal
nanocavity. The laser is realized by coupling a cavity mode, which is localized
in a complete photonic bandgap and exhibits the highest quality factor of
~38,500, with high-quality semiconductor quantum dots. We show a systematic
change in the laser characteristics, including the threshold and the
spontaneous emission coupling factor by controlling the crystal size, which
consequently changes the strength of photon confinement in the third dimension.
This opens up many interesting possibilities for realizing future ultimate
light sources and three-dimensional integrated photonic circuits and for more
fundamental studies of physics in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics.
