Cygnus X-1 was the first X-ray source widely accepted to be a black hole
candidate and remains among the most studied astronomical objects in its class.
The detection of non-thermal radio, hard X-rays and gamma rays reveals the fact
that this kind of objects are capable of accelerating particles up to very high
energies.
  In order to explain the electromagnetic emission from Cygnus X-1 in the
low-hard state we present a model of a black hole corona with both relativistic
lepton and hadron content. We characterize the corona as a two-temperature hot
plasma plus a mixed non-thermal population in which energetic particles
interact with magnetic, photon and matter fields. Our calculations include the
radiation emitted by secondary particles (pions, muons and electron/positron
pairs). Finally, we take into account the effects of photon absorption. We
compare the results obtained from our model with data of Cygnus X-1 obtained by
the COMPTEL instrument.
