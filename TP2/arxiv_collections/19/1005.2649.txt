We investigate the system size scaling of the net defect number created by a
rapid quench in a second-order quantum phase transition from an O(N) symmetric
state to a phase of broken symmetry. Using a controlled mean-field expansion
for large N, we find that the net defect number variance in convex volumina
scales like the surface area of the sample for short-range correlations. This
behaviour follows generally from spatial and internal symmetries. Conversely,
if spatial isotropy is broken, e.g., by a lattice, and in addition long-range
periodic correlations develop in the broken-symmetry phase, we get the rather
counterintuitive result that the scaling strongly depends on the dimension
being even or odd: For even dimensions, the net defect number variance scales
like the surface area squared, with a prefactor oscillating with the system
size, while for odd dimensions, it essentially vanishes.
