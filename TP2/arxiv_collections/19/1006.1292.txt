We minimize a discrete version of the fourth-order curvature based Landau
free energy by extending Brakke's Surface Evolver. This model predicts
spherical as well as non-spherical shapes with dimples, bumps and ridges to be
the energy minimizers. Our results suggest that the buckling and faceting
transitions, usually associated with crystalline matter, can also be an
intrinsic property of non-crystalline membranes.
