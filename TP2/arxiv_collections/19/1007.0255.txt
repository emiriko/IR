Experiments that have been interpreted as providing evidence that the
pseudogap phase in cuprates is an electronic nematic are discussed from the
point of view of lattice structure. We conclude that existing experiments are
not sufficient to prove a nematic origin of the pseudogap in underdoped
cuprates.
