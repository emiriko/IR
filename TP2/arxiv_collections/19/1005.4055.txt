We study the possibility to replace the anti-neutrino run of a long baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment, with anti-neutrinos from muon decay at rest.
The low energy of these neutrinos allows the use of inverse beta decay for
detection in a Gadolinium-doped water Cerenkov detector. We show that this
approach yields a factor of five times larger anti-neutrino event sample. The
resulting discovery reaches in theta_13, the mass hierarchy and leptonic CP
violation are compared with those from a conventional superbeam experiment with
combined neutrino and anti-neutrino running. We find that this approach yields
a greatly improved reach for CP violation and theta_13 while leaving the
ability to measure the mass hierarchy intact.
