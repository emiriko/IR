We consider the cold bosonic ensemble trapped by a helical interference
pattern in the optical \textit{loop} scheme. This rotating helical potential is
produced by the two slightly detuned counter propagating Laguerre-Gaussian
laser beams with counter directed orbital angular momenta $\pm \ell\hbar $. The
detuning $\delta \omega$ may occur due to rotational Doppler effect. The
superfluid hydrodynamics is analysed for the large number of trapped atoms in
Thomas-Fermi approximation. For the highly elongated trap the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation is solved in a slowly varying envelope approximation. The speed of
axial translation and angular momenta of interacting atomic cloud are
evaluated. In the $T \rightarrow 0$ limit the angular momentum of the helical
cloud is expected to be zero while toroidal trapping geometry leads to $2\ell
\hbar$ angular momentum per trapped atom.
