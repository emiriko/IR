We classify super-symmetric solutions of the minimal $N=2$ gauged Euclidean
supergravity in four dimensions. The solutions with anti-self-dual Maxwell
field give rise to anti-self-dual Einstein metrics given in terms of solutions
to the $SU(\infty)$ Toda equation and more general three-dimensional
Einstein--Weyl structures. Euclidean Kastor--Traschen metrics are also
characterised by the existence of a certain super covariantly constant spinor.
