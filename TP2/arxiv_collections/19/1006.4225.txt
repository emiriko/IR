In this paper, we study the optimal secondary-link beamforming pattern that
balances between the SU's throughput and the interference it causes to PUs in
MIMO cognitive radio networks. In particular, we aim to maximize the throughput
of the SU, while keeping the interference temperature at the primary receivers
below a certain threshold.
  Unlike traditional MIMO systems, SUs may not have the luxury of knowing the
channel state information (CSI) on the links to PUs. This presents a key
challenge for a secondary transmitter to steer interference away from primary
receivers. In this paper, we consider three scenarios, namely when the
secondary transmitter has complete, partial, or no knowledge about the channels
to the primary receivers. In particular, when complete CSI is not available,
the interference-temperature constraints are to be satisfied with high
probability, thus resulting in chance constraints that are typically hard to
deal with. Our contribution is fourfold. First, by analyzing the distributional
characteristics of MIMO channels, we propose a unified homogeneous QCQP
formulation that can be applied to all three scenarios. The homogeneous QCQP
formulation, though non-convex, is amenable to semidefinite programming (SDP)
relaxation methods. Secondly, we show that the SDP relaxation admits no gap
when the number of primary links is no larger than two. Thirdly, we propose a
randomized polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a near-optimal solution
to the QCQP problem when there are more than two primary links. Finally, we
show that when the secondary transmitter has no CSI on the links to primary
receivers, the optimal solution to the QCQP problem can be found by a simple
matrix eigenvalue-eigenvector computation, which can be done much more
efficiently than solving the QCQP directly.
