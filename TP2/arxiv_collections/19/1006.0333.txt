Electrical contacts between nano-engineered systems are expected to
constitute the basic building blocks of future nano-scale electronics. However,
the accurate characterization and understanding of electrical contacts at the
nano-scale is an experimentally challenging task. Here we employ
low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy to investigate the conductance
of individual nano-contacts formed between flat Pb islands and their supporting
substrates. We observe a suppression of the differential tunnel conductance at
small bias voltages due to dynamical Coulomb blockade effects. The differential
conductance spectra allow us to determine the capacitances and resistances of
the electrical contacts which depend systematically on the island--substrate
contact area. Calculations based on the theory of environmentally assisted
tunneling agree well with the measurements.
