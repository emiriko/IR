We determine the evolution of the co-moving density of the most massive ($M_*
\geq 10^{12} M_\odot$) early-type galaxy population in the redshift range of $z
= 0.15$ - 0.45 in different stellar mass ranges using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) catalog. We find that the
co-moving number density of these galaxies grew exponentially, weakly depending
on the stellar mass range, as a function of cosmic time with a time-scale of
$\tau \simeq 1.16 \pm 0.16$ Gyr for at least 4 Gyr ending around $z \simeq
0.15$. This is about a factor of ten of growth between $z=0.5$ - 0.15. Since $z
\simeq 0.15$ a constant co-moving number density can be measured. According to
theoretical models the most massive early-type galaxies gain most of their
stellar mass via dry merging but the major merger rate measured by others
cannot account for the high growth in number density we measured thus, stellar
mass gain from minor mergers and slow, smooth accretion seems to play an
important role. We outline a simple analytic model that explains the observed
evolution based on the exponential decline of the luminosity function and sets
constraints on the time dependence of the close-pair fraction of merger
candidate galaxies.
