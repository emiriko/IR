The behavior of suspensions of rigid particles in a non-Newtonian fluid is
studied in the framework of a nonlinear homogenization method. Estimates for
the overall properties of the composite material are obtained. In the case of a
Herschel-Bulkley suspending fluid, it is shown that the properties of a
suspension with overall isotropy can be satisfactory modeled as that of a
Herschel-Bulkley fluid with an exponent equal to that of the suspending fluid.
Estimates for the yield stress and the consistency at large strain rate levels
are proposed. These estimates compare well to both experimental data obtained
by Mahaut et al [J. Rheol. 52, 287-313 (2008)] and to experimental data found
in the literature.
