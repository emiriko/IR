In this paper, we treat a local discrimination problem in the framework of
asymmetric hypothesis testing. We choose a known bipartite pure state
$\ket{\Psi}$ as an alternative hypothesis, and the completely mixed state as a
null hypothesis. As a result, we analytically derive an optimal type 2 error
and an optimal POVM for one-way LOCC POVM and Separable POVM. For two-way LOCC
POVM, we study a family of simple three-step LOCC protocols, and show that the
best protocol in this family has strictly better performance than any one-way
LOCC protocol in all the cases where there may exist difference between two-way
LOCC POVM and one-way LOCC POVM.
