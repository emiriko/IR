Muon-induced neutrons constitute a prominent background component in a number
of low count rate experiments, namely direct searches for Dark Matter. In this
work we describe a neutron detector to measure this background in an
underground laboratory, the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane. The system is
based on 1 m3 of Gd-loaded scintillator and it is linked with the muon veto of
the EDELWEISS-II experiment for coincident muon detection. The system was
installed in autumn 2008 and passed since then a number of commissioning tests
proving its full functionality. The data-taking is continuously ongoing and a
count rate of the order of 1 muon-induced neutron per day has been achieved.
