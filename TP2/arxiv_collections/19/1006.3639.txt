We present a new ab-initio method that uses similarity renormalization group
(SRG) techniques to continuously diagonalize nuclear many-body Hamiltonians. In
contrast with applications of the SRG to two- and three-nucleon interactions in
free space, we perform the SRG evolution "in medium" directly in the $A$-body
system of interest. The in-medium approach has the advantage that one can
approximately evolve $3,...,A$-body operators using only two-body machinery
based on normal-ordering techniques. The method is nonperturbative and can be
tailored to problems ranging from the diagonalization of closed-shell nuclei to
the construction of effective valence shell-model Hamiltonians and operators.
We present first results for the ground-state energies of $^4$He, $^{16}$O and
$^{40}$Ca, which have accuracies comparable to coupled-cluster calculations.
