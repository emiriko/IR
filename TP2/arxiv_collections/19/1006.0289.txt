The email is used daily by millions of people to communicate around the globe
and it is a mission-critical application for many businesses. Over the last
decade, unsolicited bulk email has become a major problem for email users. An
overwhelming amount of spam is flowing into users' mailboxes daily. In 2004, an
estimated 62% of all email was attributed to spam. Spam is not only frustrating
for most email users, it strains the IT infrastructure of organizations and
costs businesses billions of dollars in lost productivity. In recent years,
spam has evolved from an annoyance into a serious security threat, and is now a
prime medium for phishing of sensitive information, as well the spread of
malicious software. This work presents a first approach to attack the spam
problem. We propose an algorithm that will improve a classifier's results by
adjusting its training set data. It improves the document's vocabulary
representation by detecting good topic descriptors and discriminators.
