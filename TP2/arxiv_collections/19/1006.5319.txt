System of two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium with the account of
electric field is obtained. These equations are obtained in kinetic approach
using quasi-equilibrium distribution function of quasi-particles, which vanishs
collision integral of quasi-particles, and contains dependence on electric
field by means of phenomenological parameter {\alpha}. Using experimental data
at temperature range of 1,4 - 2 K, where basic role plays roton hydrodynamics,
the value of phenomenological parameter, is obtained.
