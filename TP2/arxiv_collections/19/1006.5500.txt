We report on the first experimental observation of higher-order modes guided
by soliton-induced waveguides in unbiased nematic liquid crystals. We find that
the nematicon waveguides operate in a bounded power region specific to each
guided mode. Below this region the guided beams diffract, above it the mode
mixing and coupling give rise to an unstable output.
