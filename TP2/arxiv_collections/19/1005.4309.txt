A (p,q)-analogue of the classical Rogers-Szego polynomial is defined by
replacing the q-binomial coefficient in it by the (p,q)-binomial coefficient.
Exactly like the Rogers-Szego polynomial is associated with the q-oscillator
algebra it is found that the (p,q)-Rogers-Szego polynomial is associated with
the (p,q)-oscillator algebra.
