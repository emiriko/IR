The magnetoresistance of InSb has been intensively investigated. The
experiments we perform here focus on weak field magnetoresistance of InSb thin
film. We investigate the magnetoresistance of InSb films in perpendicular,
tilted as well as parallel magnetic field. Our results verify the previous
observations concerning weak localization effect in InSb thin film. Moreover,
we systematically study the anisotropy of magnetoresistance of InSb. We find
that the existence of in-plane field can effectively suppress the weak
localization effect of InSb film. We fit the experimental data with two types
of models, the match between data and model is excellent. From the fitting
procedure, we get information about phase coherence time, spin-orbit scattering
time. The information about Zeeman effect and sample roughness are also
extracted from the fitting procedure.
