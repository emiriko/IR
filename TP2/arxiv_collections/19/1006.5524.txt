We demonstrate the classical stability of the BTZ black hole within the
context of topologically massive gravity. The linearized perturbation equations
can be solved exactly in this case. By choosing standard boundary conditions
appropriate to the stability problem, we demonstrate the absence of modes which
grow in time, for all values of the Chern-Simons coupling.
