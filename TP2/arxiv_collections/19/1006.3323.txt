We here report on the implementation of a microwave lens for neutral polar
molecules suitable to focus molecules both in low-field-seeking and in
high-field-seeking states. By using the TE_11m modes of a 12 cm long
cylindrically symmetric microwave resonator, Stark-decelerated ammonia
molecules are transversally confined. We investigate the focusing properties of
this microwave lens as a function of the molecules' velocity, the detuning of
the microwave frequency from the molecular resonance frequency, and the
microwave power. Such a microwave lens can be seen as a first important step
towards further microwave devices, such as decelerators and traps.
