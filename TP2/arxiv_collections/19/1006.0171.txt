Modeling artificial scanning electron microscope (SEM) and scanning ion
microscope images has recently become important. This is because of the need to
provide repeatable images with a priori determined parameters. Modeled
artificial images are highly useful in the evaluation of new imaging and
metrological techniques, like image-sharpness calculation, or drift-corrected
image composition (DCIC). Originally, the NIST-developed artificial image
generator was designed only to produce the SEM images of gold-on-carbon
resolution sample for image-sharpness evaluation. Since then, the new improved
version of the software was written in C++ programming language and is in the
Public Domain. The current version of the software can generate arbitrary
samples, any drift function, and many other features. This work describes
scanning in charged-particle microscopes, which is applied both in the
artificial image generator and the DCIC technique. As an example, the
performance of the DCIC technique is demonstrated.
