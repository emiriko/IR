NGC 2992 is an intermediate Seyfert 1 galaxy showing outflows on kilo parsec
scales which might be due either to AGN or starburst activity. We therefore aim
at investigating its central region for a putative starburst in the past and
its connection to the AGN and the outflows. Observations were performed with
the adaptive optics near infrared integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the
VLT, complemented by longslit observations with ISAAC on the VLT, as well as N-
and Q-band data from the Spitzer archive. The spatial and spectral resolutions
of the SINFONI data are 50 pc and 83 km/s, respectively. The field of view of
3" x 3" corresponds to 450 pc x 450 pc. Br_gamma equivalent width and line
fluxes from PAHs were compared to stellar population models to constrain the
age of the putative recent star formation. A simple geometric model of two
mutually inclined disks and an additional cone to describe an outflow was
developed to explain the observed complex velocity field in H_2 1-0S(1). The
morphologies of the Br_gamma and the stellar continuum are different suggesting
that at least part of the Br_gamma emission comes from the AGN. This is
confirmed by PAH emission lines at 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron and the strength
of the silicon absorption feature at 9.7 micron, which point to dominant AGN
activity with a relatively minor starburst contribution. We find a starburst
age of 40 Myr - 50 Myr from Br_gamma line diagnostics and the radio continuum;
ongoing star formation can be excluded. Both the energetics and the timescales
indicate that the outflows are driven by the AGN rather than the starburst. The
complex velocity field observed in H_2 1-0S(1) in the central 450 pc can be
explained by the superposition of the galaxy rotation and an outflow.
