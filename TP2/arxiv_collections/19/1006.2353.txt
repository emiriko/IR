We synthesized new layered iron arsenide oxides
(Fe2As2)(Sr4(Sc,Ti)3O8),(Fe2As2)(Ba4Sc3O7.5), and (Fe2As2)(Ba3Sc2O5). The
crystal structures of these compounds are tetragonal with a space group of
I4/mmm. The structure of (Fe2As2)(Sr4(Sc,Ti)3O8) and (Fe2As2)(Ba4Sc3O7.5)
consists of the alternate stacking of antifluorite Fe2As2 layers and triple
perovskite-type oxide layers. The interlayer distance between the Fe planes of
(Fe2As2)(Ba4Sc3O7.5) is ~18.7 A. Moreover, the a-axis of (Fe2As2)(Ba3Sc2O5) is
the longest among the layered iron pnictides, indicating the structural
flexibility of the layered iron pnictide containing perovskite-type layers. The
bulk sample of (Fe2As2)(Sr4(Sc0.6Ti0.4)3O8) exhibited diamagnetism up to 28 K
in susceptibility measurements.
