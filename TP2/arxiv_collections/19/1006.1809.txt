The recombination of an electron with an (initially) hydrogen-like ion is
investigated. The effect of the electron-electron interaction is treated
rigorously to the first order in the parameter 1/Z and within the
screening-potential approximation to higher orders in 1/Z, with Z being the
nuclear charge number. The two-electron correction contains the
dielectronic-recombination part, which contributes to the process not only
under the resonance condition for the projectile energy but also in the regions
far from resonances. The mechanism of the off-resonant dielectronic
recombination is studied in detail.
