We report the results of multifrequency-VLBI observations of
GHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources. The VLBI structure and component
spectra of some GPS sources are presented. Our VLBI results show that about 80%
of the GPS galaxies exhibit a compact double or CSO-like structure, while the
GPS quasars tend to show a core-jet. The component spectra of the GPS galaxies
are often steep/convex, and the core has a flat spectrum but it is usually
hidden or weak. In addition, we studied the variability of GPS sources by
comparing new flux density measures, acquired with the Urumqi 25m telescope at
4.85 GHz, with previous 87GB data. The results show that 44% of the GPS quasars
varied higher than 10% in passed 20 years, while the fraction is only 12% for
the GPS galaxies meaning that the GPS quasars are much more variable than GPS
galaxies. In total, 25% of GPS sources show >10% variability at 4.85 GHz in our
sample.
