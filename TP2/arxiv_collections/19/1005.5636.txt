The Hubble tuning fork diagram, based on morphology and established in the
1930s, has always been the preferred scheme for classification of galaxies.
However, the current large amount of data up to higher and higher redshifts
asks for more sophisticated statistical approaches like multivariate analyses.
Clustering analyses are still very confidential, and do not take into account
the unavoidable characteristics in our Universe: evolution. Assuming branching
evolution of galaxies as a 'transmission with modification', we have shown that
the concepts and tools of phylogenetic systematics (cladistics) can be
heuristically transposed to the case of galaxies. This approach that we call
"astrocladistics", has now successfully been applied on several samples of
galaxies and globular clusters. Maximum parsimony and distance-based approaches
are the most popular methods to produce phylogenetic trees and, like most other
studies, we had to discretize our variables. However, since astrophysical data
are intrinsically continuous, we are contributing to the growing need for
applying phylogenetic methods to continuous characters.
