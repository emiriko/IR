We present theory and experiments for the force-distance curve $F(z_0)$ of an
atomic force microscope (AFM) tip (radius $R$) indenting a supported fluid
bilayer (thickness $2d$). For realistic conditions the force is dominated by
the area compressibility modulus $\kappa_A$ of the bilayer, and, to an
excellent approximation, given by $F= \pi \kappa_A R z_0^2/(2d-z_0)^2$. The
experimental AFM force curves from coexisting liquid ordered and liquid
disordered domains in 3-component lipid bilayers are well-described by our
model, and provides $\kappa_A$ in agreement with literature values. The liquid
ordered phase has a yield like response that we model by hydrogen bond
breaking.
