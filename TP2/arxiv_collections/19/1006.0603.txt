We study the high temperature regime within the glass phase of an elastic
object with short ranged disorder. In that regime we argue that the scaling
functions of any observable are described by a continuum model with a
$\delta$-correlated disorder and that they are universal up to only two
parameters that can be explicitly computed. This is shown numerically on the
roughness of directed polymer models and by dimensional and functional
renormalization group arguments. We discuss experimental consequences such as
non-monotonous behaviour with temperature.
