Following the successful dipole test on 53 SCP SNe Ia presented at SAIt2004
in Milan, this 9th contribution to the ECM series beginning in 1999 in Naples
(43th SAIt meeting: "Revolutions in Astronomy") deals with the construction of
the new wedge-shaped Hubble diagram obtained with 398 supernovae of the SCP
Union Compilation (Kowalski et al. 2008) by applying a calculated correlation
between SNe Ia absolute blue magnitude MB and central redshift z0, according to
the expansion center model. The ECM distance D of the Hubble diagram (cz versus
D) is computed as the ratio between the luminosity distance DL and 1 + z.
Mathematically D results to be a power series of the light-space r run inside
the expanding cosmic medium or Hubble flow; thus its expression is independent
of the corresponding z. In addition one can have D = D(z, h) from the ECM
Hubble law by using the h convention with an anisotropic HX. It is proposed to
the meeting that the wedge-shape of this new Hubble diagram be confirmed
independently as mainly due to the ECM dipole anisotropy of the Hubble ratio
cz/D.
