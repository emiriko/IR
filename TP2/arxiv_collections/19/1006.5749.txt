Enterprise resource Planning (ERP) has become a key business driver in
today's world. Retailers are also trying to reap in the benefits of the ERP. In
most large Indian Retail Industry ERP systems have replaced nonintegrated
information systems with integrated and maintainable software. Retail ERP
solution integrates demand and supply effectively to help improve bottom line.
The implementation of ERP systems in such firms is a difficult task. So far,
ERP implementations have yielded more failures than successes. Very few
implementation failures are recorded in the literature because few companies
wish to publicize their implementation failure. This paper explores and
validates the existing literature empirically to find out the critical success
factors that lead to the success of ERP in context to Indian retail industry.
The findings of the results provide valuable insights for the researchers and
practitioners who are interested in implementing Enterprise Resource Planning
systems in retail industry, how best they can utilize their limited resources
and to pay adequate attention to those factors that are most likely to have an
impact upon the implementation of the ERP system.
