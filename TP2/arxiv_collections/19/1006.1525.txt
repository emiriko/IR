A microscopic theory of the dynamic spin susceptibility (DSS) in the
superconducting state within the t-J model is presented. It is based on an
exact representation for the DSS obtained by applying the Mori-type projection
technique for the relaxation function in terms of Hubbard operators. The static
spin susceptibility is evaluated by a sum-rule-conserving generalized
mean-field approximation, while the self-energy is calculated in the
mode-coupling approximation. The spectrum of spin excitations is studied in the
underdoped and optimally doped regions. The DSS reveals a resonance mode (RM)
at the antiferromagnetic wave vector Q = \pi(1,1) at low temperatures due to a
strong suppression of the damping of spin excitations. This is explained by an
involvement of spin excitations in the decay process besides the particle-hole
continuum usually considered in random-phase-type approximations. The spin gap
in the spin-excitation spectrum at Q plays a dominant role in limiting the
decay in comparison with the superconducting gap which results in the
observation of the RM even above $T_c$ in the underdoped region. A good
agreement with inelastic neutron-scattering experiments on the RM in YBCO
compounds is found.
