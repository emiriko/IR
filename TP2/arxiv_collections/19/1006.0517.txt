We describe the status of the HepData database system, following a major
re-development in time for the advent of LHC data. The new HepData system
benefits from use of modern database and programming language technologies, as
well as a variety of high-quality tools for interfacing the data sources and
their presentation, primarily via the Web. The new back-end provides much more
flexible and semantic data representations than before, on which new external
applications can be built to respond to the data demands of the LHC
experimental era. The HepData re-development was largely motivated by a desire
to have a single source of reference data for Monte Carlo validation and tuning
tools, whose status and connection to HepData we also briefly review.
