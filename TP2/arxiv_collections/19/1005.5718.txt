Moral Foundation Theory states that groups of different observers may rely on
partially dissimilar sets of moral foundations, thereby reaching different
moral valuations. The use of functional imaging techniques has revealed a
spectrum of cognitive styles with respect to the differential handling of novel
or corroborating information that is correlated to political affiliation. Here
we characterize the collective behavior of an agent-based model whose inter
individual interactions due to information exchange in the form of opinions are
in qualitative agreement with experimental neuroscience data. The main
conclusion derived connects the existence of diversity in the cognitive
strategies and statistics of the sets of moral foundations and suggests that
this connection arises from interactions between agents. Thus a simple
interacting agent model, whose interactions are in accord with empirical data
on conformity and learning processes, presents statistical signatures
consistent with moral judgment patterns of conservatives and liberals as
obtained by survey studies of social psychology.
