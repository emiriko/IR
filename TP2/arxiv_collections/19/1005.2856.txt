We propose a resonator-assisted entangling gate for spin qubits with high
fidelity. Each spin qubit corresponds to two electrons in a nanowire double
quantum dot, with the singlet and one of the triplets as the logical qubit
states. The gate is effected by virtual charge dipole transitions. We include
noise in our model to show feasibility of the scheme under current experimental
conditions.
