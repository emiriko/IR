The disk masses of four low surface brightness galaxies (LSB) were estimated
using marginal gravitational stability criterion and the stellar velocity
dispersion data which were taken from Pizzella et al., 2008 [1]. The
constructed mass models appear to be close to the models of maximal disk. The
results show that the disks of LSB galaxies may be significantly more massive
than it is usually accepted from their brightnesses. In this case their surface
densities and masses appear to be rather typical for normal spirals. Otherwise,
unlike the disks of many spiral galaxies, the LSB disks are dynamically
overheated.
