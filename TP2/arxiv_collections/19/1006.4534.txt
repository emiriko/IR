For a Brownian system the evolution of thermodynamic quantities is a
stochastic process. In particular, the work performed on a driven colloidal
particle held in an optical trap changes for each realization of the
experimental manipulation, even though the manipulation protocol remains
unchanged. Nevertheless, the work distribution is governed by established laws.
Here, we show how the measurement of the work distribution is influenced by the
presence of rotational, i.e. nonconservative, radiation forces. Experiments on
particles of different materials show that the rotational radiation forces, and
therefore their effect on the work distributions, increase with the particle
refractive index.
