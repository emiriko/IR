We have developed a two dimensional stochastic molecular dynamics model for
the description of intra cellular collective motion of bio motors, in
particular Kinesins, on a microtubular track. The model is capable or
reproducing the hand-over-hand mechanism of the directed motion along the
microtubule. The model gives the average directed velocity and the current of
Kinesins along the microtubule. It is shown that beyond a certain density of
Kinesins, the average velocity and current undergo notable decrease which is
due to formation of traffic jams in the system.
