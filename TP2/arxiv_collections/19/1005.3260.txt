In charged current weak interaction processes, neutrinos are produced in an
entangled state with the charged lepton. This correlated state is disentangled
by the measurement of the charged lepton in a detector at the production site.
We study the dynamical aspects of disentanglement, propagation and detection,
in particular the conditions under which the disentangled state is a coherent
superposition of mass eigenstates. The appearance and disappearance
far-detection processes are described from the time evolution of this
disentangled "collapsed" state. The familiar quantum mechanical interpretation
and factorization of the detection rate emerges when the quantum state is
disentangled on time scales \emph{much shorter} than the inverse oscillation
frequency, in which case the final detection rate factorizes in terms of the
usual quantum mechanical transition probability provided the final density of
states is insensitive to the neutrino energy difference. We suggest
\emph{possible} corrections for short-baseline experiments. If the charged
lepton is unobserved, neutrino oscillations and coherence are described in
terms of a reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out an un-observed
charged lepton. The diagonal elements in the mass basis describe the production
of mass eigenstates whereas the off diagonal ones provide a measure of
coherence. It is shown that coherences are of the same order of the diagonal
terms on time scales up to the inverse oscillation frequency, beyond which the
coherences oscillate as a result of the interference between mass eigenstates.
