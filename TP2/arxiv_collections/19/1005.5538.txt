This paper examines the possibility of using derivative-implied risk premia
to explain stock returns. The rapid development of derivative markets has led
to the possibility of trading various kinds of risks, such as credit and
interest rate risk, separately from each other. This paper uses credit default
swaps and equity options to determine risk premia which are then used to form
portfolios that are regressed against the returns of stock portfolios. It turns
out that both, credit risk and implied volatility, have high explanatory power
in regard to stock returns. Especially the returns of distressed stocks are
highly dependent on credit risk fluctuations. This finding leads to practical
implications, such as cross-hedging opportunities between equity and credit
instruments and potentially allows forecasting stock returns based on movements
in the credit market.
