The work deals with the thermodynamics of the universe bounded by the event
horizon. The matter in the universe has three constituents namely dark energy,
dark matter and radiation in nature and interaction between then is assumed.
The variation of entropy of the surface of the horizon is obtained from unified
first law while matter entropy variation is calculated from the Gibbss' law.
Finally, validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics is examined
and conclusions are written point wise.
