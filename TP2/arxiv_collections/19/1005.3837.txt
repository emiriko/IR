We consider the case of a pair of particles initially in a superposition
state corresponding to a separated pair of wave packets. We calculate
\emph{exactly} the time development of this non-Gaussian state due to
interaction with an \emph{arbitrary} heat bath. We find that coherence decays
continuously, as expected. We then investigate entanglement and find that at a
finite time the system becomes separable (not entangled). Thus, we see that
entanglement sudden death is also prevalent in continuous variable systems
which should raise concern for the designers of entangled systems.
