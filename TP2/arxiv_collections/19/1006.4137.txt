The augmented Lagrangiam method (ALM), widely used in quantum chemistry
constrained optimization problems, is applied in the context of the nuclear
Density Functional Theory (DFT) in the self-consistent constrained Skyrme
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (CHFB) variant. The ALM allows precise calculations of
multidimensional energy surfaces in the space of collective coordinates that
are needed to, e.g., determine fission pathways and saddle points; it improves
accuracy of computed derivatives with respect to collective variables that are
used to determine collective inertia; and is well adapted to supercomputer
applications.
