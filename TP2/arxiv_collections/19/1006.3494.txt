One of the main topics in the modern String Theory are the AdS/CFT dualities.
Proving such conjectures is extremely difficult since the gauge and string
theory perturbative regimes do not overlap. In this perspective, the discovery
of infinitely many conserved charges, i.e. the integrability, in the planar
AdS/CFT has allowed us to reach immense progresses in understanding and
confirming the duality. We review the fundamental concepts and properties of
integrability in two-dimensional sigma-models and in the AdS/CFT context. The
first part is focused on the AdS_5/CFT_4 duality, especially the classical and
quantum integrability of the type IIB superstring on AdS_5 x S^5 are discussed
in both pure spinor and Green-Schwarz formulations. The second part is
dedicated to the AdS_4/CFT_3 duality with particular attention to the type IIA
superstring on AdS_4 x CP^3 and its integrability. This review is based on a
shortened and revised version of the author's PhD thesis, discussed at Uppsala
University in September 2009.
