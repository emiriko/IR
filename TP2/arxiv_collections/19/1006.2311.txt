Spectra of the 9Be(e,e') reaction have been measured at the S-DALINAC at an
electron energy E_0 = 73 MeV and scattering angles of 93{\deg} and 141{\deg}
with high energy resolution up to excitation energies E_x = 8 MeV. The
astrophysically relevant resonance parameters of the first excited 1/2+ state
of 9Be have been extracted in a one-level approximation of R-matrix theory
resulting in a resonance energy E_R = 1.748(6) MeV and width Gamma_R = 274(8)
keV in good agreement with the latest 9Be(gamma,n) experiment but with
considerably improved uncertainties. However, the reduced B(E1) transition
strength deduced from an extrapolation of the (e,e') data to the photon point
is a factor of two smaller. Implications of the new results for a possible
production of 12C in neutron-rich astrophysical scenarios are discussed.
