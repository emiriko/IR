The emergence of a new discipline called space weather, which aims at
understanding and predicting the impact of solar activity on the terrestrial
environment and on technological systems, has led to a growing need for
analysing solar images in real time. The rapidly growing volume of solar
images, however, makes it increasingly impractical to process them for
scientific purposes. This situation has prompted the development of novel
processing techniques for doing feature recognition, image tracking, knowledge
extraction, etc. Here we focus on two particular concepts and list some of
their applications. The first one is Blind Source Separation (BSS), which has a
great potential for condensing the information that is contained in
multispectral images. The second one is multiscale (multiresolution, or
wavelet) analysis, which is particularly well suited for capturing
scale-invariant structures in solar images. This article provides a brief
overview of existing and potential applications to solar images taken in the
ultraviolet.
