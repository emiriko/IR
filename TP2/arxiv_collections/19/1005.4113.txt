We prove strong clustering of k-point correlation functions of zeroes of
Gaussian Entire Functions. In the course of the proof, we also obtain universal
local bounds for k-point functions of zeroes of arbitrary nondegenerate
Gaussian analytic functions.
  In the second part of the paper, we show that strong clustering yields the
asymptotic normality of fluctuations of some linear statistics of zeroes of
Gaussian Entire Functions, in particular, of the number of zeroes in measurable
domains of large area. This complements our recent results from the paper
"Fluctuations in random complex zeroes" (arXiv:1003.4251v1).
