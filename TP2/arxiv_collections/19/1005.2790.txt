The pseudorapidity density of charged particles produced at LHC collisions
are predicted by using two complementary production mechanisms with a set of
consistent integrated and unintegrated parton distributions. We discuss the
limiting fragmentation hypothesis and its possible violation, and we compare
our model with other partonic models.
