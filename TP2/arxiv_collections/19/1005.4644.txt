We review the main advances brought by the Spitzer Space Telescope in the
field of nearby galaxies studies, concentrating on a few subject areas,
including: (1) the physics of the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons that
generate the mid-infrared features between ~3.5 micron and ~20 micron; (2) the
use of the mid- and far-infrared emission from galaxies as star formation rate
indicators; and (3) the improvement of mid-infrared diagnostics to discriminate
between thermal (star-formation) and non-thermal (AGN) emission in galaxies and
galaxy centers.
