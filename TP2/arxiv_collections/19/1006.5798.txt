In this paper the cross sections of the processes $e^+ e^- \to H+\gamma,
H=\eta_c, \eta_c', \chi_{c0}, \chi_{c1}, \chi_{c2}$ are calculated. The
calculation is carried out at the leading twist approximation of light cone
formalism. Within this approach the leading logarithmic radiative and
relativistic corrections to the amplitudes are resumed. For the processes $e^+
e^- \to \eta_c, \eta_c'+\gamma$ one loop radiative corrections are taken into
account. It is also shown that one loop leading logarithmic radiative
corrections calculated within light cone formalism for the processes under
study coincide with that obtained by direct calculations of one loop diagrams
within nonrelativistic QCD.
