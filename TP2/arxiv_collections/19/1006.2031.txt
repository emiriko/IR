Savage et al. have recently put forward the claim that results from the
XENON10 experiment are incompatible with the totality of both DAMA/LIBRA and
CoGeNT experimental regions. In this brief note the source of this erroneous
conclusion is identified in a misinterpretation of the XENON10 efficiency in
the detection of S1 light from low-energy nuclear recoils.
