We provide a scheme for the generation of entangled number states of
Bose-Einstein condensates in multiple wells with cyclic pairwise connectivity.
The condensate ground state in a multiple well trap can self-evolve, when phase
engineered with specific initial phase differences between the neighboring
wells, to a macroscopic superposition state with controllable entanglement --
to multiple well generalization of double well NOON states. We demonstrate
through numerical simulations the creation of entangled states in three and
four wells and then explore the creation of "larger" entangled states where
there are either a larger number of particles in each well or a larger number
of wells. The type of entanglement produced as the particle numbers, or
interaction strength, increases changes in a novel and initially unexpected
manner.
