Having its origin in a successful mapping technique, the Fock-Tani formalism,
the corrected 3P0 model (C3P0) retains the basic aspects of the 3P0 predictions
with the inclusion of bound-state corrections. Evaluation of the decay
amplitudes has be performed for open-flavor strong decays in the light meson
sector. The bound-state corrections introduce a fine-tuning for the former 3P0
model, in particular, the adjustment of the D/S ratios in $b_{1}\to\omega\pi$,
$a_{1}\to\rho\pi$ and $h_1\to\rho\pi$ decays.
