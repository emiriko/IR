Non-Abelian gauge theory with a warped extra dimension is studied as a
quantum field theory at an intermediate scale that is regarded as being much
lower than the scale of the geometry stabilization and the Planck scale. Loop
corrections for zero-mode vertices are diagrammatically calculable in
perturbation at the intermediate scale. The contribution for each diagram can
be compared to the correspondent in the four-dimensional theory. It is found
that for a part of the contributions the coefficient for the logarithmic
scaling has the same value as the four-dimensional results. A viewpoint to
treat corrections associated with higher-dimensional operators is also
discussed.
