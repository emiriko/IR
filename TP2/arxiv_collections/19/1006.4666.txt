We derive Markovian master equations of single and interacting harmonic
systems in different scenarios, including strong internal coupling. By
comparing the dynamics resulting from the corresponding Markovian master
equations with exact numerical simulations of the evolution of the global
system, we precisely delimit their validity regimes and assess the robustness
of the assumptions usually made in the process of deriving the reduced
dynamics. The proposed method is sufficiently general to suggest that the
conclusions made here are widely applicable to a large class of settings
involving interacting chains subject to a weak interaction with an environment.
