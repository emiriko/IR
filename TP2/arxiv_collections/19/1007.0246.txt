In this paper, we find mechanisms for the generation of Fermi arcs using the
gauge/gravity correspondence. The gravity background is taken to be a charged
black hole with vector hair in asymptotically AdS4 spacetime. The response
function of fermion probes exhibits a p-wave gap in the dual superconductor. We
couple the fermions to a charged rank-two antisymmetric field. Assuming that
its spatial components condense, a novel type of open Fermi surface is
produced. We derive an analytical formula for the Green's function and study
its unique properties. The results are confirmed by separate numerical
computations.
  In the Appendix, we study the effect of a neutral scalar field on the
fermionic spectral functions. A suitable interaction term shifts the original
spin-up / spin-down Fermi momenta in opposite directions and thus the two nodal
points of the p-wave gap extend into Fermi pockets.
