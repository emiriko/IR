Collisionless entrainment of the surrounding matter imports the relativistic
baryon component in the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) fireball frame. We show that half
the fireball energy can be transferred from radiation to the comoving hot
motions of baryons under the photosphere. The yet baryon-poor fireball can
reexpand to a very high Lorentz factor (VHLF) \Gamma ~ 10^3-10^6 by its own
relativistic collisionless pressure beyond the photosphere (so-called
collisionless bulk acceleration), leading to internal and external shocks. A
simple synchrotron emission from the VHLF internal shocks produces (i) the
extra power-law spectral component with variability observed in the Fermi GeV
bursts, up to the TeV range for the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA),
(ii) the GeV onset delay with a weak luminosity dependence t_{delay} ~
L^{-1/5}, and (iii) the spectral break of GRB 090926 by the synchrotron cooling
break or the maximum synchrotron cutoff limited by the dynamical time, not by
the e+- creation cutoff. The relativistic baryon component could also heat the
photospheric thermal photons into the main GRB Band spectrum via pp, p\gamma
(Bethe-Heitler and photomeson), and Coulomb thermalization processes. In this
hot photosphere-internal-external shock model, we can predict the
anticorrelation of ~TeV neutrinos and GeV gamma-rays, which may be detectable
using IceCube. The spectral peak and luminosity (Yonetoku) relation is also
reproduced if the progenitor stars are nearly identical. We also discuss the
steep/shallow decay of early X-ray afterglows and short GRBs.
