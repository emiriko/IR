Interference of fractionally charged quasi-particles is expected to lead to
Aharonov-Bohm oscillations with periods larger than the flux quantum. However,
according to the Byers-Yang theorem, observables of an electronic system are
invariant under an adiabatic insertion of a quantum of singular flux. We
resolve this seeming paradox by considering a microscopic model of electronic
interferometers made from a quantum Hall liquid at filling factor 1/m. An
approximate ground state of such interferometers is described by a Laughlin
type wave function, and low-energy excitations are incompressible deformations
of this state. We construct a low-energy effective theory by restricting the
microscopic Hamiltonian of electrons to the space of incompressible
deformations and show that the theory of the quantum Hall edge so obtained is a
generalization of a chiral conformal field theory. In our theory, a
quasi-particle tunneling operator is found to be a single-valued function of
tunneling point coordinates, and its phase depends on the topology determined
by the positions of Ohmic contacts. We describe strong coupling of the edge
states to Ohmic contacts and the resulting quasi-particle current through the
interferometer with the help of a master equation. We find that the coherent
contribution to the average quasi-particle current through Mach-Zehnder
interferometers does not vanish after summation over quasi-particle degrees of
freedom. However, it acquires oscillations with the electronic period, in
agreement with the Byers-Yang theorem. Importantly, our theory does not rely on
any ad-hoc constructions, such as Klein factors, etc. When the magnetic flux
through an FP interferometer is varied with a modulation gate, current
oscillations have the quasi-particle periodicity, thus allowing for
spectroscopy of quantum Hall edge states.
