Obtaining a good momentum reconstruction of a jet is a compromise between
taking it large enough to catch the perturbative final-state radiation and
small enough to avoid too much contamination from the underlying event and
initial-state radiation. In this paper, we compute analytically the optimal jet
radius for dijet reconstructions and study its scale dependence. We also
compare our results with previous Monte-Carlo studies.
