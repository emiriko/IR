In this review we establish various connections between complex networks and
symmetry. While special types of symmetries (e.g., automorphisms) are studied
in detail within discrete mathematics for particular classes of deterministic
graphs, the analysis of more general symmetries in real complex networks is far
less developed. We argue that real networks, as any entity characterized by
imperfections or errors, necessarily require a stochastic notion of invariance.
We therefore propose a definition of stochastic symmetry based on graph
ensembles and use it to review the main results of network theory from an
unusual perspective. The results discussed here and in a companion paper show
that stochastic symmetry highlights the most informative topological properties
of real networks, even in noisy situations unaccessible to exact techniques.
