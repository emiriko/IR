In this letter we present a new form of the well known Chaplygin gas model by
introducing inhomogeneity in the EOS. This model explains $\omega=-1$ crossing.
Also we have given a graphical representation of the model using $\{r,s\}$
parameters. We have also considered an interaction of this model with the
scalar field by introducing a phenomenological coupling function and have shown
that the potential decays with time.
