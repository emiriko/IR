We report the first high pressure measurement of the Fe K-edge in hematite
(Fe$_2$O$_3$) by X-ray absorption spectroscopy in partial fluorescence yield
geometry. The pressure-induced evolution of the electronic structure as
Fe$_2$O$_3$ transforms from a high-spin insulator to a low-spin metal is
reflected in the x-ray absorption pre-edge. The crystal field splitting energy
was found to increase monotonically with pressure up to 48 GPa, above which a
series of phase transitions occur. Atomic multiplet, cluster diagonalization,
and density-functional calculations were performed to simulate the pre-edge
absorption spectra, showing good qualitative agreement with the measurements.
The mechanism for the pressure-induced phase transitions of Fe$_2$O$_3$ is
discussed and it is shown that ligand hybridization significantly reduces the
critical high-spin/low-spin pressure.
