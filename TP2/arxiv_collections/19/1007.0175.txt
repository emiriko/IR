The linearized potential of a moving test charge in a one-component fully
degenerate fermion plasma is studied using the Lindhard dielectric function.
The motion is found to greatly enhance the Friedel oscillations behind the
charge, especially for velocities larger than a half of the Fermi velocity, in
which case the asymptotic behavior of their amplitude changes from 1/r^3 to
1/r^2.5. In the absence of the quantum recoil (tunneling) the potential reduces
to a form similar to that in a classical Maxwellian plasma, with a difference
being that the plasma oscillations behind the charge at velocities larger than
the Fermi velocity are not Landau-damped.
