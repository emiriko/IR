Motivated by the recent computations of the quasinormal frequencies of higher
dimensional black holes we exactly calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the
Dirac field propagating in D-dimensional (D > 4) massless topological black
hole. From the exact values of the quasinormal frequencies for the fermion and
boson fields we discuss whether the recently proposed bound on the relaxation
time of a perturbed thermodynamical system is satisfied in D-dimensional
massless topological black hole. Also we study the consequences of these
results.
