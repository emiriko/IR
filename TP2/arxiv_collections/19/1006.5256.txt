We present the hardware and software systems implementing autonomous
operation, distributed real-time monitoring, and control for the EBEX
instrument. EBEX is a NASA-funded balloon-borne microwave polarimeter designed
for a 14 day Antarctic flight that circumnavigates the pole. To meet its
science goals the EBEX instrument autonomously executes several tasks in
parallel: it collects attitude data and maintains pointing control in order to
adhere to an observing schedule; tunes and operates up to 1920 TES bolometers
and 120 SQUID amplifiers controlled by as many as 30 embedded computers;
coordinates and dispatches jobs across an onboard computer network to manage
this detector readout system; logs over 3~GiB/hour of science and housekeeping
data to an onboard disk storage array; responds to a variety of commands and
exogenous events; and downlinks multiple heterogeneous data streams
representing a selected subset of the total logged data. Most of the systems
implementing these functions have been tested during a recent engineering
flight of the payload, and have proven to meet the target requirements. The
EBEX ground segment couples uplink and downlink hardware to a client-server
software stack, enabling real-time monitoring and command responsibility to be
distributed across the public internet or other standard computer networks.
Using the emerging dirfile standard as a uniform intermediate data format, a
variety of front end programs provide access to different components and views
of the downlinked data products. This distributed architecture was demonstrated
operating across multiple widely dispersed sites prior to and during the EBEX
engineering flight.
