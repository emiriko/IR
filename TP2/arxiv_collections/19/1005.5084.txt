Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the study
of fast magnetization dynamics with both frequency- and wavevector resolution.
Here, we report on a distinct improvement of this spectroscopic technique
towards two-dimensional wide-range wavevector selectivity in a backward
scattering geometry. Spin-wave wavevectors oriented perpendicular to the bias
magnetic field are investigated by tilting the sample within the magnet gap.
Wavevectors which are oriented parallel to the applied magnetic field are
analyzed by turning the entire setup, including the magnet system. The setup
features a wide selectivity of wavevectors up to 2.04\cdot 10E5 rad/cm for both
orientations, and allows selecting and measuring wavevectors of dipole- and
exchange-dominated spin waves of any orientation to the magnetization
simultaneously.
