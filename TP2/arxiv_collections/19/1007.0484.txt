Classifiers are often used to detect miscreant activities. We study how an
adversary can systematically query a classifier to elicit information that
allows the adversary to evade detection while incurring a near-minimal cost of
modifying their intended malfeasance. We generalize the theory of Lowd and Meek
(2005) to the family of convex-inducing classifiers that partition input space
into two sets one of which is convex. We present query algorithms for this
family that construct undetected instances of approximately minimal cost using
only polynomially-many queries in the dimension of the space and in the level
of approximation. Our results demonstrate that near-optimal evasion can be
accomplished without reverse-engineering the classifier's decision boundary. We
also consider general lp costs and show that near-optimal evasion on the family
of convex-inducing classifiers is generally efficient for both positive and
negative convexity for all levels of approximation if p=1.
