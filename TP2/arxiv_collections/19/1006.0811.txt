Many astrophysical data show that the expansion of our universe is
accelerating. In this paper, we study the model of phantom with O(N) symmetry
in background of loop quantum cosmology(LQC). We investigate the phase-space
stability of the corresponding autonomous system and find no stable node but
only 2 saddle points in the field of real numbers. The dynamics is similar to
the single-field phantom model in LQC[1]. The effect of O(N) symmetry just
influence the detail of the universe's evolution. This is a sharp contrast with
the result in general relativity, in which the dynamics of scalar fields models
with O$(N)$ symmetry are quite different from the single-field models[2][3][4].
