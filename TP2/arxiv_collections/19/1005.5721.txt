We develop a model of string dynamics with back-reaction from both scaling
and non-scaling loops taken into account. The evolution of a string network is
described by the distribution functions of coherence segments and kinks. We
derive two non-linear equations which govern the evolution of the two
distributions and solve them analytically in the limit of late times. We also
show that the correlation function is an exponential, and solve the dynamics
for the corresponding spectrum of scaling loops.
