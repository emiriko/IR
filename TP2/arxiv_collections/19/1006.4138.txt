The effect of sample shape on the depinning of the domain wall (DW) driven by
an applied magnetic field or a spin-polarized current is studied theoretically.
The shape effect resulting from the modulation of the sample width (geometric
pinning) can essentially affect the DW depinning. We found a good agreement
between the ratios of the critical values of the magnetic field and the
spin-polarized current predicted by the theory and measured in the experiment.
