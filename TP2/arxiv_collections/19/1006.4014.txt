In this survey, we describe two recent developments in quantum algorithms.
  The first new development is a quantum algorithm for evaluating a Boolean
formula consisting of AND and OR gates of size N in time O(\sqrt{N}). This
provides quantum speedups for any problem that can be expressed via Boolean
formulas. This result can be also extended to span problems, a generalization
of Boolean formulas. This provides an optimal quantum algorithm for any Boolean
function in the black-box query model.
  The second new development is a quantum algorithm for solving systems of
linear equations. In contrast with traditional algorithms that run in time
O(N^{2.37...}) where N is the size of the system, the quantum algorithm runs in
time O(\log^c N). It outputs a quantum state describing the solution of the
system.
