We apply the light bending model of X-ray variability to Suzaku data of the
Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15. We analyze the energy dependence of the root mean
square (rms) variability, and discuss conditions necessary for the model to
explain the characteristic decrease of the source variability around 5-8 keV. A
model, where the X-ray source moves radially rather than vertically close to
the disk surface, can indeed reproduce the reduced variability near the energy
of the Fe Kalpha line, although the formal fit quality is poor. The model then
predicts the energy spectra, which can be compared to observational data. The
spectra are strongly reflection dominated, and do not provide a good fit to
Suzaku spectral data of the source. The inconsistency of this result with some
previous claims can be traced to our using data in a broader energy band, where
effects of warm absorber in the spectrum cannot be neglected.
