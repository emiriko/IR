Algorithmic historiography was proposed by Eugene Garfield in collaboration
with Irving Sher in the 1960s, but further developed only recently into
HistCite^{TM} with Alexander Pudovkin. As in history writing, HistCite^{TM}
reconstructs by drawing intellectual lineages. In addition to cited references,
however, documents can be attributed a multitude of other variables such as
title words, keywords, journal names, author names, and even full texts. New
developments in multidimensional scaling (MDS) enable us not only to visualize
these patterns at each moment of time, but also to animate them over time.
Using title words, co-authors, and journal names in Garfield's oeuvre, the
method is demonstrated and further developed in this paper (and in the
animation at http://www.leydesdorff.net/garfield/animation). The variety and
substantive content of the animation enables us to write, visualize, and
animate the author's intellectual history.
