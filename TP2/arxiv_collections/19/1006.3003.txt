The properties of a new-born neutron star, produced in a core-collapse
supernova, can be strongly affected by the possible late fallback which occurs
several hours after the explosion. This accretion occurs in the regime
dominated by neutrino cooling, explored initially in this context by Chevalier
(1989). Here we revisit this approach in a 1D spherically symmetric model and
carry out numerical simulations in 2D in an accretion column onto a neutron
star considering detailed microphysics, neutrino cooling and the presence of
magnetic fields in ideal MHD. We compare our numerical results to the analytic
solutions and explore how the purely hydrodynamical as well as the MHD
solutions differ from them, and begin to explore how this may affect the
appearance of the remnant as a typical radio pulsar.
