During the last decade, lattice-Boltzmann (LB) simulations have been improved
to become an efficient tool for determining the permeability of porous media
samples. However, well known improvements of the original algorithm are often
not implemented. These include for example multirelaxation time schemes or
improved boundary conditions, as well as different possibilities to impose a
pressure gradient. This paper shows that a significant difference of the
calculated permeabilities can be found unless one uses a carefully selected
setup. We present a detailed discussion of possible simulation setups and
quantitative studies of the influence of simulation parameters. We illustrate
our results by applying the algorithm to a Fontainebleau sandstone and by
comparing our benchmark studies to other numerical permeability measurements in
the literature.
