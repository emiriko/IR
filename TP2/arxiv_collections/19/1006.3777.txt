I compute the difference of vector and axial vector current correlators in
the weak coupling phase of (lattice-regulated) SU(3) gauge theory with two
flavors of symmetric-representation dynamical fermions. This is a walking
theory at the bare parameter values chosen for the simulation. Otherwise, it is
not a conventional technicolor candidate. The correlator difference shows
scaling behavior in the fermion mass, and vanishes in the fermion zero mass
limit. Consequences for the phenomenology of similar systems which might be
candidates for beyond Standard Model physics are discussed. I check my
methodology against ordinary QCD, by computing the Gasser-Leutwyler coefficient
L_10 and the charged - neutral pion mass difference from an approximate
parameterization of the correlator.
