We demonstrate that the modulation instability of the zone boundary mode in a
finite (periodic) Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain is the necessary but not sufficient
condition for the efficient energy transfer by localized excitations. This
transfer results from the exclusion of complete energy exchange between
spatially different parts of the chain, and the excitation level corresponding
to that turns out to be twice more than threshold of zone boundary mode's
instability. To obtain this result one needs in far going extension of the
beating concept to a wide class of finite oscillatory chains. In turn, such an
extension leads to description of energy exchange and transition to energy
localization and transfer in terms of 'effective particles' and Limiting Phase
Trajectories. The 'effective particles' appear naturally when the frequency
spectrum crowding ensures the resonance interaction between zone boundary and
two nearby nonlinear normal modes, but there are no additional resonances. We
show that the Limiting Phase Trajectories corresponding to the most intensive
energy exchange between 'effective particles' can be considered as an
alternative to Nonlinear Normal Modes, which describe the stationary process.
