The study of evolution of networks has received increased interest with the
recent discovery that many real-world networks possess many things in common,
in particular the manner of evolution of such networks. By adding a dimension
of time to graph analysis, evolving graphs present opportunities and challenges
to extract valuable information. This paper introduces the Evolving Graph
Markup Language (EGML), an XML application for representing evolving graphs and
related results. Along with EGML, a software tool is provided for the study of
evolving graphs. New evolving graph drawing techniques based on the
force-directed graph layout algorithm are also explored. Our evolving graph
techniques reduce vertex movements between graph instances, so that an evolving
graph can be viewed with smooth transitions
