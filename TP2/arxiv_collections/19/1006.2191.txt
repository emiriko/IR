We consider the near-resonant interaction between a single atom and a focused
light mode, where a single atom localized at the focus of a lens can scatter a
significant fraction of light. Complementary to previous experiments on
extinction and phase shift effects of a single atom, we report here on the
measurement of coherently backscattered light. The strength of the observed
effect suggests combining strong focusing with the well-established methods of
cavity QED. We consider theoretically a nearly concentric cavity, which should
allow for a strongly focused optical mode. Simple estimates show that in a such
case one can expect a significant single photon Rabi frequency. This opens new
perspectives and a possibility to scale up the system consisting of many
atom+cavity nodes for quantum networking due to a significant technical
simplification of the atom--light interfaces.
