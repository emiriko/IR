In this paper we compute two important information-theoretic quantities which
arise in the application of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna
wireless communication systems: the distribution of the mutual information of
multi-antenna Gaussian channels, and the Gallager random coding upper bound on
the error probability achievable by finite-length channel codes. It turns out
that the mathematical problem underpinning both quantities is the computation
of certain Hankel determinants generated by deformed versions of classical
weight functions. For single-user MIMO systems, it is a deformed Laguerre
weight, whereas for multi-user MIMO systems it is a deformed Jacobi weight. We
apply two different methods to characterize each of these Hankel determinants.
First, we employ the ladder operators of the corresponding monic orthogonal
polynomials to give an exact characterization of the Hankel determinants in
terms of Painlev\'{e} differential equations. This turns out to be a
Painlev\'{e} V for the single-user MIMO scenario and a Painlev\'{e} VI for the
multi user scenario. We then employ Coulomb fluid methods to derive new
closed-form approximations for the Hankel determinants which, although formally
valid for large matrix dimensions, are shown to give accurate results for both
the MIMO mutual information distribution and the error exponent even when the
matrix dimensions are small. Focusing on the single-user mutual information
distribution, we then employ both the exact Painlev\'{e} representation and the
Coulomb fluid approximation to yield deeper insights into the scaling behavior
in terms of the number of antennas and signal-to-noise ratio. Among other
things, these results allow us to study the asymptotic Gaussianity of the
distribution as the number of antennas increase, and to explicitly compute the
correction terms to the mean, variance, and higher order cumulants.
