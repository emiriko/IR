We perform a global analysis of cosmological observables in generalized
cosmologies which depart from $\Lambda$CDM models by allowing non-vanishing
curvature $\Omega_k\neq 0$, dark energy with equation of state with $\omega\neq
-1$, the presence of additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm
rel}$, and neutrino masses $\Omega_\nu\neq 0$. By combining the data from
cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments (in particular the latest results
from WMAP-7), the present day Hubble constant (H0) measurement, the
high-redshift Type-I supernovae (SN) results and the information from large
scale structure (LSS) surveys, we determine the parameters in the
10-dimensional parameter space for such models. We present the results from the
analysis when the full shape information from the LSS matter power spectrum
(LSSPS) is included versus when only the corresponding distance measurement
from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) is accounted for. We compare the
bounds on the neutrino mass scale in these generalized scenarios with those
obtained for the 6+1 parameter analysis in $\Lambda{\rm CDM}+m_\nu$ models and
we also study the dependence of those on the set of observables included in the
analysis. Finally we combine these results with the information on neutrino
mass differences and mixing from the global analysis of neutrino oscillation
experiments and derive the presently allowed ranges for the two laboratory
probes of the absolute scale of neutrino mass: the effective electron neutrino
mass in single beta decay and the effective Majorana neutrino mass in
neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay.
