The propagation of the wave function of a particle is characterised by a
group and a phase velocity. The group velocity is associated with the
particle's classical velocity, which is always smaller than the speed of light,
and the phase velocity is associated with the propagation speed of the wave
function phase and is treated as being unphysical, since its value is always
greater than the speed of light. Here we show, using Sciama's Machian
formulation of rest mass energy, that this physical interpretation, for the
group and the phase velocity of the wave function, is only valid if the weak
equivalence principle strictly holds for the propagating particle, except for
the photon. In case this constraint is released the phase velocity of the wave
function could acquire a physical meaning in quantum condensates.
