Muon Tomography based on the measurement of multiple scattering of
atmospheric cosmic ray muons in matter is a promising technique for detecting
heavily shielded high-Z radioactive materials (U, Pu) in cargo or vehicles. The
technique uses the deflection of cosmic ray muons in matter to perform
tomographic imaging of high-Z material inside a probed volume. A Muon
Tomography Station (MTS) requires position-sensitive detectors with high
spatial resolution for optimal tracking of incoming and outgoing cosmic ray
muons. Micro Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD) technologies such as Gas Electron
Multiplier (GEM) detectors are excellent candidates for this application. We
have built and operated a minimal MTS prototype based on 30cm \times 30cm GEM
detectors for probing targets with various Z values inside the MTS volume. We
report the first successful detection and imaging of medium-Z and high-Z
targets of small volumes (~0.03 liters) using GEM-based Muon Tomography.
