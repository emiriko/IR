We present two observational campaigns performed with the RXTE satellite on
the black hole transient H 1743-322. The source was observed in outburst on two
separate occasions between October-November 2008 and May-July 2009. We have
carried out timing and spectral analysis of the data set, obtaining a complete
state classification of all the observations. We find that all the observations
are well described by using a spectral model consisting of a disk-blackbody, a
powerlaw + reflection + absorption and a gaussian emission component. During
the 2009 outburst the system followed the canonical evolution through all the
states seen in black hole transients. In the 2008 outburst only the hard states
were reached. The early evolution of the spectral parameters is consistent
between the two epochs, and it does not provide clues about the subsequent
behavior of the source. The variation of the flux associated to the two main
spectral components (i.e. disk and powerlaw) allows us to set a lower limit to
the orbital inclination of the system of >= 43{\deg}.
