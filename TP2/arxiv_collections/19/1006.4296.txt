We present the results of three-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations of adiabatic and spherically symmetric accretion in Kerr
space-time. We consider compact objects with spin parameter $|a_*| \le 1$
(black holes) and with $|a_*| > 1$ (super-spinars). Our full three-dimensional
simulations confirm the formation of equatorial outflows for high values of
$|a_*|$, as found in our previous work in 2.5 dimensions. We show that the
critical value of $|a_*|$ determining the onset of powerful outflows depends
mainly on the radius of the compact object. The phenomenon of equatorial
outflows can hardly occur around a black hole and may thus be used to test the
bound $|a_*| \le 1$ for astrophysical black hole candidates.
