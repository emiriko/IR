We employ the dynamical mean-field approximation to study the magnetic
properties of a model relevant for the dilute magnetic semiconductors. Our
model includes the spin-orbit coupling on the hole bands, the exchange
interaction, and the attractive Coulomb potential between the negatively
charged magnetic ions and the itinerant holes. The inclusion of the Coulomb
potential significantly renormalizes the exchange coupling and enhances the
ferromagnetic transition temperature for a wide range of couplings. We also
explore the effect of the spin-orbit interaction by using two different values
of the ratio of the effective masses of the heavy and light holes. We show that
in the regime of small $J_{c}$-$V$ the spin-orbit interaction enhances $T_{c}$,
while for large enough values of $J_{c}$-$V$ magnetic frustration reduces $T_c$
to values comparable to the previously calculated strong coupling limit.
