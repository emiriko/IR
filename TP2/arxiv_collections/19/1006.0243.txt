Aims. We investigate statistical equilibrium of Cr in the atmospheres of
late-type stars to show whether the systematic abundance discrepancy between Cr
I and Cr II lines, as often encountered in the literature, is due to deviations
from LTE. Furthermore, we attempt to interpret the NLTE trend of [Cr/Fe] with
[Fe/H] using chemical evolution models for the solar neighborhood. Methods.
NLTE calculations are performed for the model of Cr atom, comprising 340 levels
and 6806 transitions in total. We make use of the quantum-mechanical
photoionization cross-sections of Nahar (2009) and investigate sensitivity of
the model to uncertain cross-sections for H I collisions. NLTE line formation
is performed for the MAFAGS-ODF model atmospheres of the Sun and 10 metal-poor
stars with -3.2 < [Fe/H] < -0.5, and abundances of Cr are derived by comparison
of the synthetic and observed flux spectra. Results. We achieve good ionization
equilibrium of Cr for the models with different stellar parameters, if
inelastic collisions with H I atoms are neglected. The solar NLTE abundance
based on Cr I lines is 5.74 dex with {\sigma} = 0.05 dex; it is \sim 0.1 higher
than the LTE abundance. For the metal-poor stars, the NLTE abundance
corrections to Cr I lines range from +0.3 to +0.5 dex. The resulting [Cr/Fe]
ratio is roughly solar for the range of metallicities analyzed here, which is
consistent with current views on production of these iron peak elements in
supernovae. Conclusions. The tendency of Cr to become deficient with respect to
Fe in metal-poor stars is an artifact due to neglect of NLTE effects in the
line formation of Cr I, and it has no relation to peculiar physical conditions
in the Galactic ISM or deficiencies of nucleosynthesis theory.
