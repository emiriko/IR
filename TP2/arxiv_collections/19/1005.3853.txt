The dynamics of a large quantum spin coupled parametrically to an optical
resonator is treated in analogy with the motion of a cantilever in cavity
optomechanics. New spin optodynamic phenonmena are predicted, such as
cavity-spin bistability, optodynamic spin-precession frequency shifts, coherent
amplification and damping of spin, and the spin optodynamic squeezing of light.
