We present precise and deep optical photometry of the globular M92. Data were
collected in three different photometric systems: Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(g',r',i',z'; MegaCam@CFHT), Johnson-Kron-Cousins (B, V, I; various
ground-based telescopes) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Vegamag (F475W,
F555W, F814W; Hubble Space Telescope). Special attention was given to the
photometric calibration, and the precision of the ground-based data is
generally better than 0.01 mag. We computed a new set of {\alpha}-enhanced
evolutionary models accounting for the gravitational settling of heavy elements
at fixed chemical composition ([{\alpha}/Fe]=+0.3, [Fe/H]=-2.32 dex, Y=0.248).
The isochrones -- assuming the same true distance modulus ({\mu}=14.74 mag),
the same reddening (E(B-V)=0.025+-0.010 mag), and the same reddening law --
account for the stellar distribution along the main sequence and the red giant
branch in different Color-Magnitude Diagrams (i',g'-i' ; i',g'-r' ; i',g'-z' ;
I,B-I ; F814W,F475W-F814W). The same outcome applies to the comparison between
the predicted Zero-Age-Horizontal-Branch (ZAHB) and the HB stars. We also found
a cluster age of 11 +/- 1.5 Gyr, in good agreement with previous estimates. The
error budget accounts for uncertainties in the input physics and the
photometry. To test the possible occurrence of CNO-enhanced stars, we also
computed two sets of {\alpha}- and CNO-enhanced (by a factor of three) models
both at fixed total metallicity ([M/H]=-2.10 dex) and at fixed iron abundance.
We found that the isochrones based on the former set give the same cluster age
(11 +/- 1.5 Gyr) as the canonical {\alpha}-enhanced isochrones. The isochrones
based on the latter set also give a similar cluster age (10 +/- 1.5 Gyr). These
indings support previous results concerning the weak sensitivity of cluster
isochrones to CNO-enhanced chemical mixtures.
