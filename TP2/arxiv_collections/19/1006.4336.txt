The model accepted is one where during the Archean Eon the Earths climate was
clement despite the weaker Sun. The observational evidence that supports this
concept is: the emergence of life, the existence of evaporitic sediments and
the presence of terrigenous sediments, all of which require liquid water and
clement conditions. A theoretical argument used to support this idea is the so
called ice-albedo feedback, which states that if the Earth was frozen, it would
still be frozen.The aim of this document is to present an alternative scenario
in which a frozen world, "snowball" style, with liquid water at the bottom of
the sea, also allows for the emergence of life and evaporitic and terrigenous
sedimentation. Archean climatic evidence, available at present, is discussed
and can be reinterpreted to support the idea that, in Archean times, the
surface of the Earth was frozen. Also, a mathematical model is being developed
to demonstrate that the ice-albedo feedback is not an inevitable consequence of
a frozen Archean Eon. Results: Reinterpretation of the evidence shows that life
could appear within the oceanic depths and not necessarily on the surface. The
evaporitic sediments could have formed by saline saturation of the water
enclosed in the limited cavities of liquid water located at the bottom of the
ocean. Also, the terrigenous sediments could have been formed by catastrophic
currents of liquid water due to the fusion of the ice from the sub glacial
volcanoes. From the mathematical model it is deduced that the defrosting moment
of the Earth is towards the end of the Proterozoic, moment in which the
evidence shows the "snowball" Earth ends.
