Monte Carlo simulation has been performed in one-dimensional Lebwohl-Lasher
model and two dimensional XY-model using the Wang-Landau and the
Wang-Landau-Transition-Matrix Monte Carlo methods. Random walk has been
performed in the two-dimensional space comprising of energy-order parameter and
energy-correlation function and the joint density of states (JDOS) were
obtained. From the JDOS the order parameter, susceptibility and correlation
function are calculated. Agreement between the results obtained from the two
algorithms is very good.
