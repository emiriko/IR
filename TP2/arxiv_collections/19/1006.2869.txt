Using the Wang-Landau flat histogram Monte Carlo (FHMC) simulation technique,
we were able to study two types of triangulated spherical surface models in
which the two-dimensional extrinsic curvature energy is assumed in the
Hamiltonian. The Gaussian bond potential is also included in the Hamiltonian of
the first model, but it is replaced by a hard-wall potential in the second
model. The results presented in this paper are in good agreement with the
results previously reported by our group. The transition of surface
fluctuations and collapsing transition were studied using the canonical
Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation technique and were found to be of the
first-order. The results obtained in this paper also show that the FHMC
technique can be successfully applied to triangulated surface models. It is
non-trivial whether the technique is applicable or not to surface models
because the simulations are performed on relatively large surfaces.
