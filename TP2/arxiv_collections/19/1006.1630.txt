We report a comprehensive TF-muSR study of TiSe_2Cu_2. The magnetic
penetration depth was found to saturate at low temperature as expected in an
s-wave SC. As x is increased we find that the superfluid density increases and
the size of the superconducting gap, calculated from the temperature dependence
of the superfluid density, is approaching the BCS value. However, for low
values of x, the gap is smaller than the weak-coupling BCS prediction
suggesting that two superconducting gaps are present in the sample.
