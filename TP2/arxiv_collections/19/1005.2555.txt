We study coherent nonlinear dynamics of carriers under ultrafast interband
excitation of an intrinsic graphene. The Rabi oscillations of response appear
with increasing of pumping intensity. The photoexcited distribution is
calculated versus time and energy taking into account the effects of energy
relaxation and dephasing. Spectral and temporal dependencies of the response on
a probe radiation (transmission and reflection coefficients) are considered for
different pumping intensities and the Rabi oscillations versus time and
intensity are analyzed.
