The diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is an excellent candidate for
quantum information processing, whereas entangling separate NV centers is still
of great experimental challenge. We propose an one-step conditional phase flip
with three NV centers coupled to a whispering-gallery mode cavity by virtue of
the Raman transition and smart qubit encoding. As decoherence is much
suppressed, our scheme could work for more qubits. The experimental feasibility
is justified.
