Wave-vector resolved radio frequency (rf) spectroscopy data for an ultracold
trapped Fermi gas are reported for several couplings at Tc, and extensively
analyzed in terms of a pairing-fluctuation theory. We map the evolution of a
strongly interacting Fermi gas from the pseudogap phase into a fully gapped
molecular Bose gas as a function of the interaction strength, which is marked
by a rapid disappearance of a remnant Fermi surface in the single-particle
dispersion. We also show that our theory of a pseudogap phase is consistent
with a recent experimental observation as well as with Quantum Monte Carlo data
of thermodynamic quantities of a unitary Fermi gas above Tc.
