In this comment we show that there is a direct connection between coherent
exchange of energy among light and matter and the emission spectrum of a
microcavity quantum dot system as modeled in Phys. Rev. B 79, 235325 (2009)
[arXiv:0807.3194] by F. P. Laussy, E. del Valle, and C. Tejedor. To do so, we
show that in their model the necessary and sufficient conditions for having
eigenvalues with non-zero imaginary parts in the propagator of the bare mode
populations, are the same as for having strong coupling in the emission
spectrum. This amounts to saying that, whenever there is strong coupling there
will be oscillating frequencies in the dynamics of the populations. These
conditions are valid both for the case where matter is treated as bosonic or
fermionic, in the spontaneous emission case.
