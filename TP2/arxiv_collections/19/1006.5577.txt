Stellar pulsation offers a unique opportunity to constrain the intrinsic
parameters of stars and unveil their inner structure. The Kepler satellite is
collecting an enormous amount of data of unprecedent photometric precision,
which will allow us to test theory and obtain a very precise tomography of
stellar interiors. We attempt to determine the stars' fundamental parameters
Teff, log g, v sin i, and luminosity needed for computing asteroseismic models
and interpreting Kepler data. We report spectroscopic observations of 23
early-type Kepler asteroseismic targets, 13 other stars in the Kepler field,
that had not been selected to be observed. We measured the radial velocity by
performing a cross-correlation with template spectra to help us identify
non-single stars. Spectral synthesis was performed to derive the stellar
parameters of our target stars, and the state-of-the-art LTE atmospheric models
were computed. For all the stars of our sample, we derived the radial velocity,
Teff, log g, v sin i, and luminosities. For 12 stars, we performed a detailed
abundance analysis of 20 species, for 16, we could derive only the [Fe/H]
ratio. A spectral classification was also performed for 17 stars in the sample.
We identify two double-lined spectroscopic binaries, HIP96299 and HIP98551, the
former of which is an already known eclipsing binary, and two single-lined
spectroscopic binaries, HIP 97254 and HIP 97724. We also report two suspected
spectroscopic binaries, HIP92637 and HIP96762, and the detection of a possible
variability in the radial velocity of HIP 96277. Two of our program stars are
chemically peculiar, namely HIP93941, which we classify as B2 He-weak, and
HIP96210, which we classify as B6 HgMn. Finally, we find that HIP93522,
HIP93941, HIP93943, HIP96210 and HIP96762, are very slow rotators which makes
them very interesting and promising targets for asteroseismic modeling.
