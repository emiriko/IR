Tensor models are more-index generalizations of the so-called matrix models,
and provide models of quantum gravity with the idea that spaces and general
relativity are emergent phenomena. In this paper, a renormalization procedure
for the tensor models whose dynamical variable is a totally symmetric real
three-tensor is discussed. It is proven that configurations with certain
Gaussian forms are the attractors of the three-tensor under the renormalization
procedure. Since these Gaussian configurations are parameterized by a scalar
and a symmetric two-tensor, it is argued that, in general situations, the
infrared dynamics of the tensor models should be described by scalar-tensor
theories of gravity.
