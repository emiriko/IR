The Light-front quark model (LFQM) has been applied to calculate the
transition matrix elements of heavy hadron decays. However, it is noted that
using the traditional wave functions of the LFQM given in literature, the
theoretically determined decay constants of the $\Upsilon(nS)$ obviously
contradict to the data. It implies that the wave functions must be modified.
Keeping the orthogonality among the $nS$ states and fitting their decay
constants we obtain a series of the wave functions for $\Upsilon(nS)$. Based on
these wave functions and by analogy to the hydrogen atom, we suggest a modified
analytical form for the $\Upsilon(nS)$ wave functions. By use of the modified
wave functions, the obtained decay constants are close to the experimental
data. Then we calculate the rates of radiative decays of $\Upsilon(nS)\to
\eta_b+\gamma$. Our predictions are consistent with the experimental data on
decays $\Upsilon(3S)\to \eta_b+\gamma$ within the theoretical and experimental
errors.
