Encryption study basically deals with three levels of algorithms. The first
algorithm deals with encryption mechanism, second deals with decryption
Mechanism and the third discusses about the generation of keys and sub keys
used in the encryption study. In the given study, a new algorithm is discussed.
The algorithm executes a series of steps and generates a sequence. This
sequence is being used as sub key to be mapped to plain text to generate cipher
text. The strength of the encryption & Decryption process depends on the
strength of sequence generated against crypto analysis.. In this part of work
some statistical tests like Uniformity tests, Universal tests & Repetition
tests are tried on the sequence generated to test the strength of it.
