By amplifying photonic qubits it is possible to produce states that contain
enough photons to be seen with a human eye, potentially bringing quantum
effects to macroscopic scales [1]. In this paper we theoretically study quantum
states obtained by amplifying one side of an entangled photon pair with
different types of optical cloning machines for photonic qubits. We propose a
detection scheme that involves lossy threshold detectors (such as human eye) on
the amplified side and conventional photon detectors on the other side. We show
that correlations obtained with such coarse-grained measurements prove the
entanglement of the initial photon pair and do not prove the entanglement of
the amplified state. We emphasize the importance of the detection loophole in
Bell violation experiments by giving a simple preparation technique for
separable states that violate a Bell inequality without closing this loophole.
Finally we analyze the genuine entanglement of the amplified states and its
robustness to losses before, during and after amplification.
