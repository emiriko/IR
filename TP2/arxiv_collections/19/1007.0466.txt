Based on a scenario of the inhomogeneous big-bang nucleosynthesis (IBBN), we
investigate the detailed nucleosynthesis that includes the production of heavy
elements beyond Li-7. From the observational constraints on light elements of
He4 and D for the baryon-to-photon ratio given by WMAP, possible regions found
on the plane of the volume fraction of the high density region against the
ratio between high- and low-density regions.
  In these allowed regions, we have confirmed that the heavy elements beyond Fe
can be produced appreciably, where p- and/or r-process elements are produced
well simultaneously compared to the solar system abundances. We suggest that
recent observational signals such as He4 overabundance in globular clusters and
high metallicity abundances in quasars could be partly due to the results of
IBBN. Possible implications are given for the formation of the first generation
stars
