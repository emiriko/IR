A parametric analysis is an analysis whose input and output are parametrized
with a number of parameters which can be instantiated to abstract properties
after analysis is completed. This paper proposes to use Cousot and Cousot's
Cardinal power domain to capture functional dependencies of analysis output on
its input and obtain a parametric analysis by parametrizing a non-parametric
base analysis. We illustrate the method by parametrizing a $\pos$ based
groundness analysis of logic programs to a parametric groundness analysis. In
addition, a prototype implementation shows that generality of the parametric
groundness analysis comes with a negligible extra cost.
