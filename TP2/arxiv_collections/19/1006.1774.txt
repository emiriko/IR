The effects of Coulomb interactions on the electronic properties of bilayer
graphene nanoribbons (BGNs) covered by a gate electrode are studied
theoretically. The electron density distribution and the potential profile are
calculated self-consistently within the Hartree approximation. A comparison to
their single-particle counterparts reveals the effects of interactions and
screening. Due to the finite width of the nanoribbon in combination with
electronic repulsion, the gate-induced electrons tend to accumulate along the
BGN edges where the potential assumes a sharp triangular shape. This has a
profound effect on the energy gap between electron and hole bands, which
depends nonmonotonously on the gate voltage and collapses at intermediate
electric fields. We interpret this behavior in terms of interaction-induced
warping of the energy dispersion.
