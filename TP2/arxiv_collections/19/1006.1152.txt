We consider the mixed three-qubit bound entangled state defined as the
normalized projector on the subspace that is complementary to an Unextendible
Product Basis [C. H. Bennett et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385 (1999)]. Using
the fact that no product state lies in the support of that state, we compute
its entanglement by providing a basis of its subspace formed by
"minimally-entangled" states. The approach is in principle applicable to any
entanglement measure; here we provide explicit values for both the geometric
measure of entanglement and a generalized concurrence.
