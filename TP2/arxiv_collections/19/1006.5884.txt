In this article I trace the development of the human understanding of the
"Heart of Matter" from early concepts of "elements" (or alternatively
"Panchmahabhootas") to the current status of "quarks" and "leptons" as the
fundamental constituents of matter, interacting together via exchange of the
various force carrier particles called "gauge bosons" such as the photon,
W/Z-boson etc. I would like to show how our understanding of the fundamental
constituents of matter has gone hand in hand with our understanding of the
fundamental forces in nature. I will also outline how the knowledge of particle
physics at the "micro" scale of less than a Fermi(one millionth of a
nanometer), enables us to offer explanations of Cosmological observations at
the "macro" scale. Consequently these observations, may in turn, help us
address some very fundamental questions of the Physics at the "Heart of the
Matter".
