The term describing the coupling between total angular momentum and
energy-momentum in the hydrogen atom is isolated from the radial Dirac equation
and used to replace the corresponding orbital angular momentum coupling term in
the radial K-G equation. The resulting spin-corrected K-G equation is a second
order differential equation that contains no matrices. It is solved here to
generate the same energy eigenvalues for the hydrogen atom as the Dirac
equation.
