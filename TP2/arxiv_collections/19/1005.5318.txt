We aim to understand the role of NN cross-sections, equation of state as well
as different model ingredients such as width of Gaussian, clusterisation range
and different clusterisation algorithms in multifragmentation using quantum
molecular dynamics model. We notice that all model ingredients have sizable
effect on the fragment pattern.
