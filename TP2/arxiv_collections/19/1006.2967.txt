Jet cross sections can be in principle compared to simple pQCD calculations,
based on the hypothesis of factorization. But often it is useful or even
necessary to not only compute the production rate of the very high pt jets, but
in addition the "rest of the event". The proposed talk is based on recent work,
where we try to construct an event generator fully compatible with pQCD which
allows to compute complete events, consisting of high pt jets plus all the
other low pt particles produced at the same time. Whereas in "generators of
inclusive spectra" like Pythia one may easily trigger on high pt phenomena,
this is not so obvious for "generators of physical events", where in principle
one has to generate a very large number of events in order to finally obtain
rare events (like those with a very high pt jet). We recently developped an
independnat block method which allow us ta have a direct access to dedicated
variables 1. We will present latest results concerning this approach.
