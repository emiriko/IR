Consider a path of non-degenerate eigenstates of unitary operators or
Hamiltonians with minimum eigenvalue gap G. The eigenpath traversal problem is
to transform one or more copies of the initial to the final eigenstate.
Solutions to this problem have applications ranging from quantum physics
simulation to optimization. For Hamiltonians, the conventional way of doing
this is by applying the adiabatic theorem. We give ``digital'' methods for
performing the transformation that require no assumption on path continuity or
differentiability other than the absence of large jumps. Given sufficient
information about eigenvalues and overlaps between states on the path, the
transformation can be accomplished with complexity O(L/G log(L/e)), where L is
the angular length of the path and e is a specified bound on the error of the
output state. We show that the required information can be obtained in a first
set of transformations, whose complexity per state transformed has an
additional factor that depends logarithmically on a maximum angular velocity
along the path. This velocity is averaged over constant angular distances and
does not require continuity. Our methods have substantially better behavior
than conventional adiabatic algorithms, with fewer conditions on the path. They
also improve on the previously best digital methods and demonstrate that path
length and the gap are the primary parameters that determine the complexity of
state transformation along a path.
