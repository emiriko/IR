We investigate charge dynamics in a two-electron double quantum dot. The
quantum dot is manipulated by using a time-dependent external voltage that
induces charge oscillations between the dots. We study the dependence of the
charge dynamics on the external magnetic field and on the periodicity of the
external potential. We find that for suitable parameter values, it is possible
to induce both one-electron and two-electron oscillations between the dots.
