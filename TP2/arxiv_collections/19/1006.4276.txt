We complete classification of mutation-finite cluster algebras by extending
the technique derived by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston to skew-symmetrizable
case. We show that for every mutation-finite skew-symmetrizable matrix a
diagram characterizing the matrix admits an unfolding which embeds its mutation
class to the mutation class of some mutation-finite skew-symmetric matrix. In
particular, this establishes a correspondence between a large class of
skew-symmetrizable mutation-finite cluster algebras and triangulated marked
bordered surfaces.
