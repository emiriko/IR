Users of Institutional Repositories and Digital Libraries are known by their
needs for very specific information about one or more subjects. To characterize
users profiles and offer them new documents and resources is one of the main
challenges of today's libraries. In this paper, a Selective Dissemination of
Information service is described, which proposes an Ontology-based Context
Aware system for identifying user's context (research subjects, work team,
areas of interest). This system enables librarians to broaden users profiles
beyond the information that users have introduced by hand (such as institution,
age and language). The system requires a context retrieval layer to capture
user information and behavior, and an inference engine to support context
inference from many information sources (selected documents and users'
queries).
