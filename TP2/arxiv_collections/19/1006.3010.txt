This is the sixth, concluding part of a series of papers the first five of
which have been submitted to the present archive in mid 1998 and published as
INR preprints in 1999. The present paper was printed as an INR preprint, too,
but for nonscientific reasons was never made public in any form, electronic or
hard-copy. In it I define the bivector derivative for four- and five-vector
fields in the case of arbitrary Riemannian geometry; examine a more general
case of five-vector affine connection; introduce the five-vector analog of the
curvature tensor; and consider a possible five-vector generalization of the
Einstein and Kibble-Sciama equations. In conclusion, I define the bivector
derivative for the fields of nonspacetime vectors and tensors and derive a
possible five-vector generalization of Maxwell's equation.
