A robust thermodynamic argument shows that a small reduction of the effective
coupling constant $\alpha$ of QED greatly enhances the Compton scattering cross
section and that the Thomson scattering length is connected to a fundamental
scale $\lambda$. A discussion provides a possible quantum interpretation of
this enormous sensitivity to changes in the effective coupling constant
$\alpha$.
