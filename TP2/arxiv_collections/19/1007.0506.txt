By numerical and variational solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we
studied the localization of a noninteracting and weakly-interacting
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a disordered cold atom lattice and a speckle
potential. In the case of a single BEC fragment, the variational analysis
produced good results. For a weakly disordered potential, the localized BECs
are found to have an exponential tail as in weak Anderson localization. We also
investigated the expansion of a noninteracting BEC in these potential. We find
that the BEC will be locked in an appropriate localized state after an initial
expansion and will execute breathing oscillation around a mean shape when a BEC
at equilibrium in a harmonic trap is suddenly released into a disorder
potential.
