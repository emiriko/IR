We have investigated structure, electronic, and magnetic properties of
metal-terminated zigzag graphene nanoribbons (M-ZGNRs) by first-principles
calculations. Two families of metal terminations are studied: (1) 3d-transition
metals (TMs) Fe, Co, and Ni and (2) noble metals (NMs) Cu, Ag, and Au. All
systems have spin-polarized edge states with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering
between two edges, except Co-ZGNRs and Ni-ZGNRs which exhibit negligibly small
energy differences between AFM and ferromagnetic states with the given ribbon
width. In the AFM state the TM terminations transform semiconducting ZGNRs into
metallic ones while the band gap remains in ZGNR with NM terminations.
Ferromagnetic states of M-ZGNRs with TM terminations show a high degree of spin
polarization at the Fermi energy. We predict a large magnetoresistance in
Fe-ZGNR junctions with a low, uniform magnetic switching field.
