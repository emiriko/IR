In the quantum regime information can be copied with only a finite fidelity.
This fidelity gradually increases to 1 as the system becomes classical. In this
article we show how this fact can be used to directly measure the amount of
radiated power. We demonstrate how these principles could be used to build a
practical primary standard.
