Solar flares are currently understood as the explosive release of energy
stored in the form of stressed magnetic fields. In many cases, the released
energy seems to take the form of large numbers of electrons accelerated to high
energies or alternatively plasma heated to very high temperatures. The
transport of this energy into the remaining portion of the atmosphere results
in violent mass motion and strong emission across the electromagnetic spectrum.
One important phenomenon observed during flares is the appearance in coronal
magnetic loops of large amounts of upflowing, soft X-ray emitting plasma. It is
believed that this is due to chromospheric evaporation, the process of heating
cool chromospheric material beyond its ability to radiate. The pressure
increase in the evaporated plasma leads to a number of interesting phenomena in
the flare chromosphere. The sudden pressure increase initiates a downward
moving "chromospheric condensation", an overdense region which gradually
decelerates as it accretes material and propagates into the gravitationally
stratified chromosphere. Solutions to an equation of motion for this
condensation shows that its motion decays after about one minute of propagation
into the chromosphere. When the front of this downflowing region is supersonic
relative to the atmosphere ahead of it, a radiating shock will form. If the
downflow is rapid enough, the shock strength should be sufficient to excite UV
radiation normally associated with the transition region, and furthermore, the
radiating shock will be brighter than the transition region. These results lead
to a number of observationally testable relationships between the optical and
ultraviolet spectra from the condensation and radiating shock.
