The model is built in which the main global properties of classical and
quasi-classical black holes become local. These are the event horizon,
"no-hair", temperature and entropy. Our construction is based on the features
of a quantum collapse, discovered when studying some quantum black hole models.
But our model is purely classical, and this allows to use selfconsistently the
Einstein equations and classical (local) thermodynamics and explain in this way
the log(3)-puzzle.
