Main objective of this paper is to describe the dynamic transition of the
incompressible MHD equations in a rectangular domain in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Our
analysis shows that the system undergoes a first dynamic transition either to
multiple equilibria or to periodic solutions. In the case of transition to
multiple equilibria, the transition is a type-I (continuous) transition. In the
case of transition to periodic solutions, the transition can be either type-I
or type-II (jump).
