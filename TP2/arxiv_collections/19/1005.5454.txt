The magnetization distribution, its energetic characterization by the
interlayer coupling constants and lattice dynamics of (001)-oriented Fe/Pt
multilayers are investigated using density functional theory combined with the
direct method to determine phonon frequencies. It is found that ferromagnetic
order between consecutive Fe layers is favoured, with the enhanced magnetic
moments at the interface. The bilinear and biquadratic coupling coefficients
between Fe layers are shown to saturate fast with increasing thickness of
nonmagnetic Pt layers which separate them. The phonon calculations demonstrate
a rather strong dependence of partial iron phonon densities of states on the
actual position of Fe monolayer in the multilayer structure.
