We show that the measure of the so-called {\it release-energy}, which is an
experimentally accessible quantity, makes it possible to assess the value of
the Mott gap in the presence of the confinement potential that is unavoidable
in the actual experimental setup. Indeed, the curve of the release-energy as a
function of the total number of particles shows kinks that are directly related
to the existence of excitation gaps. Calculations are presented within the
Gutzwiller approach, but the final results go beyond this simple approximation
and represent a genuine feature of the real system. In the case of harmonic
confinement, the Mott gaps may be renormalized with respect to the uniform
case. On the other hand, in the case of the recently proposed off-diagonal
confinement, our results show an almost perfect agreement with the homogeneous
case.
