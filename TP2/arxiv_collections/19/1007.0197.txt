We study the phase behavior of bowl-shaped particles using computer
simulations. These particles were found experimentally to form a meta-stable
worm-like fluid phase in which the bowl-shaped particles have a strong tendency
to stack on top of each other [M.Marechal et al, Nano Letters 10, 1907 (2010)].
In this work, we show that the transition from the low-density fluid to the
worm-like phase has an interesting effect on the equation of state. The
simulation results also show that the worm-like fluid phase transforms
spontaneously into a columnar phase for bowls that are sufficiently deep.
Furthermore, we describe the phase behavior as obtained from free energy
calculations employing Monte Carlo simulations. The columnar phase is stable
for bowl shapes ranging from infinitely thin bowls to surprisingly shallow
bowls. Aside from a large region of stability for the columnar phase, the phase
diagram features four novel crystal phases and a region where the stable fluid
contains worm-like stacks.
