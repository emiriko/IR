Insertion of transposed elements within mammalian genes is thought to be an
important contributor to mammalian evolution and speciation. Insertion of
transposed elements into introns can lead to their activation as alternatively
spliced cassette exons, an event called exonization. Elucidation of the
evolutionary constraints that have shaped fixation of transposed elements
within human and mouse protein coding genes and subsequent exonization is
important for understanding of how the exonization process has affected
transcriptome and proteome complexities. Here we show that exonization of
transposed elements is biased towards the beginning of the coding sequence in
both human and mouse genes. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
revealed that exonization of transposed elements can be population-specific,
implying that exonizations may enhance divergence and lead to speciation. SNP
density analysis revealed differences between Alu and other transposed
elements. Finally, we identified cases of primate-specific Alu elements that
depend on RNA editing for their exonization. These results shed light on TE
fixation and the exonization process within human and mouse genes.
