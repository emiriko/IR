Structure function of e+e- to hadrons cross section proportional to the
longitudinal part of the hadron tensor is power suppressed with respect to an
event shape variable in the two-jet region. In the SCET framework, we study the
event shape distribution for this structure function to NLL level of accuracy.
As, a result we obtain the angular distribution of hadron jets as a function of
the thrust, in the two jet region. We further examine effects of
non-perturbative hadronization corrections by adopting a shape function that
reproduce the observed event shape distributions. Impacts of our findings on
the electroweak measurements via the jet angular forward-backward asymmetry are
discussed.
