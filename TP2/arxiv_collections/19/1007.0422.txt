We survey in this paper the main contributions of Oded Schramm related to
noise sensitivity. We will describe in particular his various works which
focused on the "spectral analysis" of critical percolation (and more generally
of Boolean functions), his work on the shape-fluctuations of first passage
percolation and finally his contributions to the model of dynamical
percolation.
