Kinematic fitting, where constraints such as energy and momentum conservation
are imposed on measured four-vectors of jets and leptons, is an important tool
to improve the resolution in high-energy physics experiments. At future e+ e-
colliders, photon radiation parallel to the beam carrying away large amounts of
energy and momentum will become a challenge for kinematic fitting. A photon
with longitudinal momentum p_z^\gamma (\eta) is introduced, which is
parametrized such that \eta ~follows a normal distribution. In the fit, \eta
~is treated as having a measured value of zero, which corresponds to p_z^\gamma
(\eta)=0. As a result, fits with constraints on energy and momentum
conservation converge well even in the presence of a highly energetic photon,
while the resolution of fits without such a photon is retained. A fully
simulated and reconstructed e+ e- -> qqqq event sample at \sqrt{s}=500 GeV is
used to investigate the performance of this method under realistic conditions,
as expected at the International Linear Collider.
