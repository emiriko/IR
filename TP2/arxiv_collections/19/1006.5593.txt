The LHC is a promising machine to discover new physics in the top sector.
There are several models that predict the existence of heavy colored resonances
decaying to top quarks in the TeV energy range. The production of such
resonances might generate a sizable charge asymmetry of top versus antitop
quarks. At the Tevatron, a 2 sigma discrepancy with the SM prediction for the
forward--backward asymmetry has been found, boosting a renewed interest for
this kind of models. We consider a toy model with general flavour dependent
couplings of the resonance to quarks, of both vector and axial-vector kind and
investigate the possible constraints on the coupling space from the measurement
of the asymmetry and the invariant mass distribution at the Tevatron. Then, we
define a central asymmetry in a specific kinematic region and investigate its
signature at the LHC as well as its statistical significance, for exclusive
processes.
