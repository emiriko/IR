A version of indifference valuation of a European call option is proposed
that includes statistical regularities of nonstochastic randomness. Classical
relations (forward contract value and Black-Scholes formula) are obtained as
particular cases. We show that in the general case of nonstochastic randomness
the minimal expected profit of uncovered European option position is always
negative. A version of delta hedge is proposed.
