This is an announcement of the first official release ver.1.0 of a Python
system NZMATH for number theory. We overview all functions in NZMATH 1.0, show
main properties after former report on NZMATH 0.5.0, and describe new features
for stable development. The most important point of the release is that we can
now treat number fields. The second big change is that new type of polynomial
programs are provided. Elliptic curve primality proving and its related
programs are also available, where we partly use a library outside NZMATH as an
advantage of writing the system only by Python. On method of development, a new
feature is that NZMATH is registered on SourceForge as an open source project
to keep continuous development of the project. This is a unique attempt among
existing systems for number theory.
