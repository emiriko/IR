The potential of silicon nanowires (SiNWs), (diameter < 10 nm) to transform
into rigid bundle-like structures with distinct phonon confinement under high
pressure (<= 15 GPa), instead of amorphising as per previous reports, is
demonstrated using in-situ Raman spectroscopy. The newly observed splitting of
the second order transverse optical (2TO) Raman mode into 2TO(L) and 2TO(W)
phonon modes at >= 5 GPa establishes a highly anisotropic and mode-dependent
pressure response of these SiNWs. Properties of the novel structures are
superior compared to other nano-structured silicon and bulk-Si in terms of
increased linear modulus, more localized phonon confinement and less
anharmonicity.
