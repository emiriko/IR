This comment is in response to the article titled "A Non-Parametric Estimate
of Mass Scoured in Galaxy Cores" (arXiv:1006.0488) written by Hopkins and
Hernquist. This comment politely mentions two relevant papers in which the main
conclusion from Hopkins & Hernquist had already been published six years ago
using the core-Sersic model. It then explains why Hopkins & Hernquist's concern
about the core-Sersic model is not valid.
