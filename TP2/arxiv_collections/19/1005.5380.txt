In this paper, we discuss alternative means of measuring the possible
presence of local parity violation in relativistic heavy ion collisions. We
focus on the phenomenon of charge separation and introduce the charged dipole
vector $\hat{Q}^c_1$, which will measure the charge separation on an
event-by-event basis. Using Monte Carlo events, we demonstrate the method and
its discriminating power. In particular we show that such an analysis will
reveal the strength of charge separation effect and its azimuthal correlation
with the reaction plane. We further show that our proposed method may be able
to distinguish between the actual charge separation effect and effects due to
certain two particle correlations. The connection to present measurements based
on particle correlations is discussed.
