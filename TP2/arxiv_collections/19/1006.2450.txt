Stanley defined a partition function t(n) as the number of partitions
$\lambda$ of n such that the number of odd parts of $\lambda$ is congruent to
the number of odd parts of the conjugate partition $\lambda'$ modulo 4. We show
that t(n) equals the number of partitions of n with an even number of hooks of
even length. We derive a closed-form formula for the generating function for
the numbers p(n)-t(n). As a consequence, we see that t(n) has the same parity
as the ordinary partition function p(n) for any n. A simple combinatorial
explanation of this fact is also provided.
