Spin accumulation is generated by injecting an unpolarized charge current
into a channel of GaAs two-dimensional electron gas subject to an in-plane
magnetic field, then measured in a non-local geometry. Unlike previous
measurements that have used spin-polarized nanostructures, here the spin
accumulation arises simply from the difference in bulk conductivities for
spin-up and spin-down carriers. Comparison to a diffusive model that includes
spin subband splitting in magnetic field suggests a significantly enhanced
electron spin susceptibility in the 2D electron gas.
