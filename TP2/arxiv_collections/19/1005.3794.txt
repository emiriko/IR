We investigate the growth of dynamic heterogeneity in a glassy hard-sphere
mixture for volume fractions up to and including the mode-coupling transition.
We use an 80 000 particle system to test a new procedure to evaluate a dynamic
correlation length xi(t): we determine the ensemble independent dynamic
susceptibility chi_4(t) and use it to facilitate evaluation of xi(t) from the
small wave vector behavior of the four-point structure factor. We analyze
relations between the alpha relaxation time tau_alpha, chi_4(tau_alpha), and
xi(tau_alpha). We find that mode-coupling like power laws provide a reasonable
description of the data over a restricted range of volume fractions, but the
power laws' exponents differ from those predicted by the inhomogeneous
mode-coupling theory. We find xi(tau_alpha) ~ ln(tau_alpha) over the full range
of volume fractions studied, which is consistent with Adams-Gibbs-type
relation.
