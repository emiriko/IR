In network quality of service provisioning, premium services generally
require to keep a very small loss probability, which is infeasible to measure
directly. The proposed virtual queue scheme estimates the small packet loss
probability of a real queueing system by measuring queue statistics in a set of
separate virtual queues. A novel scaling property between the real queue and
the virtual queues is deduced on the basis of the maximum variance asymptotic
(MVA) theory. The new scheme retains the high accuracy and wide applicability
of the MVA method for aggregated traffic while avoiding the high computational
complexity in a direct application of the original MVA analysis in real time.
This makes it suitable for online measurement applications such as network
performance monitoring and measurement-based admission control.
