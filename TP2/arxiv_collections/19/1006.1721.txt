Several Delta Sct stars were photometrically monitored with the satellite
CoRoT and observed in high-resolution spectroscopy from ground. We present here
the preliminary analysis of the abundance analysis of several potential CoRoT
targets. Moreover, new insights are given about the problem of the huge number
of detected frequencies by comparing Delta Sct stars with normal A-stars.
