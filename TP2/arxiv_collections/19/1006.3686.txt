By means of ab initio calculations, we have investigated the effect of H
adsorption in the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of ultrathin
Co films on Ru(0001). Our calculations predict that H occupies hollow sites
preserving the two-dimensional 3-fold symmetry. The formation of a complete H
overlayer leads to a very stable surface with strong H-Co bonds. H tends to
suppress surface features, in particular, the enhancement of the magnetic
moments of the bare film. The H-induced effects are mostly confined to the Co
atoms bonded to H, independent of the H coverage or of the thickness and the
structure of the Co film. However, for partial H coverages a significant
increase occurs in the magnetic moment for the surface Co atoms not bonded to
H, leading to a net enhancement of surface magnetism.
