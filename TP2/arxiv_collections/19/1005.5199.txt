A theoretical study on the influence of organic functional groups on the
electronic properties of graphene related carbon materials was carried out.
Here we report, using density functional theory and tight-binding approach,
that the best candidates for conducting supramolecular devices can be obtained
by engineering the surface chemistry and stacking conformation of these
materials.
