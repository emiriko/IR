We present a new, BVIc photometric survey of the young open cluster IC4665,
which improves on previous studies of this young cluster by incorporating a
rigorous standardization procedure, thus providing high-fidelity colors and
magnitudes for cluster members. We use this new photometric dataset to
reevaluate the properties (age and distance) of IC4665. Namely, using a
statistical approach incorporating Tau^2 CMD modeling, we measure a
pre-main-sequence isochrone age and distance of 36+-9 Myr and 360+-12 pc, as
well as a upper-main-sequence turn-off age and distance of 42+-12 Myr and
357+-12 pc. These ages and distances are highly dependent on the isochrone
model and color used for the fitting procedure, with a possible range of ~10-20
Myr in age and ~20 pc in distance. This spread in calculated ages and distances
seen between colors and models is likely due to limitations in the individual
membership catalogs and/or systematic differences in the predicted stellar
parameters from the different sets of models. Interestingly, when we compare
the isochrone ages for IC4665 to the published lithium depletion boundary age,
28+-5 Myr, we observe that this cluster does not appear to follow the trend of
isochrone ages being 1.5 times smaller than lithium depletion boundary ages. In
addition, comparing the overall magnetic activity (X-ray and H-alpha emission)
in IC4665 with other well studied open clusters, we find the observed activity
distributions for this young cluster are best characterized by assuming an age
of 30-40 Myr, thus in agreement with our pre-main-sequence and turn-off
isochrone ages for IC4665. Overall, although some age discrepancies do exist,
particularly in the ages measured from pre-main-sequence isochrones, the range
of possible IC4665 ages derived from the various dating techniques employed
here is relatively small compared to that found for other well studied open
clusters.
