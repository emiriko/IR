We propose a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) by adding an extra
U(1) symmetry which is hidden from the SM sector. Such a hidden U(1) has not
been considered before, and its existence at the TeV scale can be explored at
the LHC. This hidden U(1) does not couple directly to the SM particles, and
couples only to new SU(2)_L singlet exotic quarks and singlet Higgs bosons, and
is broken at the TeV scale. The dominant signals at the high energy hadron
colliders are multi lepton and multi b-jet final states with or without missing
energy. We calculate the signal rates as well as the corresponding Standard
Model background for these final states. A very distinctive signal is 6 high
p_T b-jets in the final state with no missing energy. For a wide range of the
exotic quarks masses the signals are observable above the background at the
LHC.
