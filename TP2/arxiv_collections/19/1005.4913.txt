Wave induced attraction of matter is a unique aspect of ponderomotive forcing
by electromagnetic (e/m) waves in plasmas. The Miller force, sometimes denoted
the gradient force, is of particular interest, because the direction as well as
magnitude of the Miller force on a plasma depends on the wave frequency. While
plasma is usually considered in its gaseous form, solid bodies can also be
treated as plasma, denoted solid-state plasma. The first experimental proof of
wave effects in magnetized solid-state plasmas (Lundqvist, 1949, Herlofson,
1950) came after the suggestion by Alfv\'en (1942) on the possible existence of
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves. However, most of our knowledge basis on
MHD/Alfv\'en waves have since then emerged from space- and laboratory (gaseous)
plasmas. It is therefore timely to investigate further the applicability of e/m
wave ponderomotive forcing on solid-state plasma. In this report we discuss the
applicability of the ponderomotive Miller force on solid-state plasmas. At this
stage the treatise will be rather qualitative, based on theories developed for
space plasma. We assume that e/m wave energy and momentum is transferred in a
thin surface layer constituting solid-state plasma. A Miller force results from
the wave pressure gradient set up in the surface layer. Since the solid body
constitute a coupled system (lattice), the Miller force will act on all atoms
in the body, the total force limited by the wave input power. A quantitative
comparison with experimental results obtained from a Cavendish vacuum
experiment (Lidgren and Lundin, 2010) gives a surprisingly good agreement
between theory and experiments. As further proof for e/m wave attraction of
matter, we show a simulation, taking into account the measured pendulum
offsets.
