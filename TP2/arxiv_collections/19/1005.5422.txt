Much of the progress in our understanding of dynamo mechanisms has been made
within the theoretical framework of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). However, for
sufficiently diffuse media, the Hall effect eventually becomes non-negligible.
We present results from three dimensional simulations of the Hall-MHD equations
subjected to random non-helical forcing. We study the role of the Hall effect
in the dynamo efficiency for different values of the Hall parameter, using a
pseudospectral code to achieve exponentially fast convergence. We also study
energy transfer rates among spatial scales to determine the relative importance
of the various nonlinear effects in the dynamo process and in the energy
cascade. The Hall effect produces a reduction of the direct energy cascade at
scales larger than the Hall scale, and therefore leads to smaller energy
dissipation rates. Finally, we present results stemming from simulations at
large magnetic Prandtl numbers, which is the relevant regime in hot and diffuse
media such a the interstellar medium.
