We introduce a theory of sequential causal inference in which learners in a
chain estimate a structural model from their upstream teacher and then pass
samples from the model to their downstream student. It extends the population
dynamics of genetic drift, recasting Kimura's selectively neutral theory as a
special case of a generalized drift process using structured populations with
memory. We examine the diffusion and fixation properties of several drift
processes and propose applications to learning, inference, and evolution. We
also demonstrate how the organization of drift process space controls fidelity,
facilitates innovations, and leads to information loss in sequential learning
with and without memory.
