We report on design and construction of a Zeeman slower for strontium atoms
which will be used in an optical atomic clock experiment. The paper describes
briefly required specifications of the device, possible solutions, and
concentrates on the chosen design. The magnetic field produced by the built
Zeeman slower has been measured and compared with the simulations. The system
consisting of an oven and Zeeman slower are designed to produce an atomic beam
of 10-12 s-1 flux and final velocity of ~30 m/s.
