A variety of descriptions of the conversion of a neutron into a strange star
have appeared in the literature over the years. Generally speaking, these works
treat the process as a mere phase transition or ignore everything but
microscopic kinetics, attempting to pin down the speed of the conversion and
its consequences. We revisit in this work the propagation of the hypothetical
"combustion" n $\to$ SQM in a dense stellar environment. We address in detail
the instabilities affecting the flame and present new results of application to
the turbulent regime. The acceleration of the flame, the possible transition to
the distributed regime and further deflagration-to-detonation mechanism are
addressed. As a general result, we conclude that the burning happens in (at
least) either the turbulent Rayleigh-Taylor or the distributed regime. In both
cases the velocity of the conversion of the star is several orders of magnitude
larger than vlam, making the latter irrelevant in practice for this problem. A
transition to a detonation is by no means excluded, actually it seems to be
favored by the physical setting, but a definitive answer would need a full
numerical simulation.
