A recent work by Dubeibe et al. [Phys. Rev. D 75, 023008 (2007)] stated that
chaos phenomenon of test particles in gravitational field of rotating neutron
stars which are described by Manko, Sanabria-Gomez, and Manko (Manko et al.)
metric can only occur when the stars have oblate deformation. But the chaotic
motions they found are limited in a very narrow zone which is very close to the
center of the massive bodies. This paper argues that this is impossible because
the region is actually inside of the stars, so the motions cannot exist at this
place. In this paper, we scan all parameters space and find chaos and unstable
fixed points outside of stars with big mass-quadrupole moments. The
calculations show that chaos can only occur when the stars have prolate
deformation. Because real deformation of stars should be oblate, all orbits of
test particles around the rotating neutron stars described by Manko et al.
solutions are regular. The case of nonzero dipolar magnetic moment has also
been taken into account in this study.
