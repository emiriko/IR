While distributed systems with transfer of processes have become pervasive,
methods for reasoning about their behaviour are underdeveloped. In this paper
we propose a bisimulation technique for proving behavioural equivalence of such
systems modelled in the \emph{higher-order $\pi$-calculus with passivation}
(and restriction). Previous research for this calculus is limited to context
bisimulations and normal bisimulations which are either impractical or unsound.
In contrast, we provide a sound and useful definition of \emph{environmental
bisimulations}, with several non-trivial examples. Technically, a central point
in our bisimulations is the clause for parallel composition, which must account
for passivation of the spawned processes in the middle of their execution.
