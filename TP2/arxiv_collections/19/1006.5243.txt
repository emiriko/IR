We present the wavelength and spectral resolution characterisation of the
Integral Field Unit (IFU) Medium Resolution Spectrometer for the Mid-InfraRed
Instrument (MIRI), to fly onboard the James Webb Space Telescope in 2014. We
use data collected using the Verification Model of the instrument and develop
an empirical method to calibrate properties such as wavelength range and
resolving power in a portion of the spectrometer's full spectral range (5-28
microns). We test our results against optical models to verify the system
requirements and combine them with a study of the fringing pattern in the
instrument's detector to provide a more accurate calibration. We show that
MIRI's IFU spectrometer will be able to produce spectra with a resolving power
above R=2800 in the wavelength range 6.46-7.70 microns, and that the unresolved
spectral lines are well fitted by a Gaussian profile.
