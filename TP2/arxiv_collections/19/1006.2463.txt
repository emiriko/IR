This paper is the first in a series devoted to the hard X-ray whole sky
survey performed by the INTEGRAL observatory over seven years. Here we present
an improved method for image reconstruction with the IBIS coded mask telescope.
The main improvements are related to the suppression of systematic effects
which strongly limit sensitivity in the region of the Galactic Plane (GP),
especially in the crowded field of the Galactic Center (GC). We extended the
IBIS/ISGRI background model to take into account the Galactic Ridge X-ray
Emission (GRXE). To suppress residual systematic artifacts on a reconstructed
sky image we applied nonparametric sky image filtering based on wavelet
decomposition. The implemented modifications of the sky reconstruction method
decrease the systematic noise in the ~20 Ms deep field of GC by ~44%, and
practically remove it from the high-latitude sky images. New observational data
sets, along with an improved reconstruction algorithm, allow us to conduct the
hard X-ray survey with the best currently available minimal sensitivity 3.7E-12
erg/s/cm2 ~0.26 mCrab in the 17-60 keV band at a 5 sigma detection level. The
survey covers 90% of the sky down to the flux limit of 6.2E-11 erg/s/cm2 (~4.32
mCrab) and 10% of the sky area down to the flux limit of 8.6E-12 erg/s/cm2
(~0.60 mCrab).
