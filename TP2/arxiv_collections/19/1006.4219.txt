We present an experimental and theoretical study of electronic spin
decoherence in ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in bulk
high-purity diamond at room temperature. Under appropriate conditions, we find
ensemble NV spin coherence times (T_2) comparable to that of single NVs, with
T_2 > 600 microseconds for a sample with natural abundance of 13C and
paramagnetic impurity density ~10^15 cm^(-3). We also observe a sharp decrease
of the coherence time with misalignment of the static magnetic field relative
to the NV electronic spin axis, consistent with theoretical modeling of NV
coupling to a 13C nuclear spin bath. The long coherence times and increased
signal-to-noise provided by room-temperature NV ensembles will aid many
applications of NV centers in precision magnetometry and quantum information.
