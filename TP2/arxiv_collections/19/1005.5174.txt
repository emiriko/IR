We report direct measurements of spin transport in a trapped, partially
condensed spinor Bose gas. Detailed analyses of spin flux in this
out-of-equilibrium quantum gas are performed by monitoring the flow of atoms in
different hyperfine spin states. The main mechanisms for motion in this system
are exchange scattering and potential energy inhomogeneity, which lead to spin
waves in the normal component and domain formation in the condensate. We find a
large discrepancy in domain formation timescales with those predicted by
potential-driven formation, indicating strong coupling of the condensate to the
normal component spin wave.
