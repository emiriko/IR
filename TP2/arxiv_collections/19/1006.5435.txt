We extend the concept of entanglement spectrum from the geometrical to the
particle bipartite partition. We apply this to several Fractional Quantum Hall
(FQH) wavefunctions on both sphere and torus geometries to show that this new
type of entanglement spectra completely reveals the physics of bulk quasihole
excitations. While this is easily understood when a local Hamiltonian for the
model state exists, we show that the quasiholes wavefunctions are encoded
within the model state even when such a Hamiltonian is not known. As a
nontrivial example, we look at Jain's composite fermion states and obtain their
quasiholes directly from the model state wavefunction. We reach similar
conclusions for wavefunctions described by Jack polynomials.
