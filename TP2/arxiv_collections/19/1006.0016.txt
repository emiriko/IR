The concept of walking wave is introduced from classical relativistic
positions. One- and three-dimensional walking waves considered with their wave
equations and dispersion equations. It is shown that wave characteristics (de
Broglie's and Compton's wavelengths) and corpuscular characteristics
(energy-momentum vector and the rest mass) of particle may be expressed through
parameters of walking wave. By that the new view on a number concepts of physic
related with wave-particle duality is suggested.
