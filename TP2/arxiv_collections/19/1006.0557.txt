The influence of alpha clustering on nuclear reaction dynamics is
investigated using the giant dipole resonance (GDR) lineshape studies in the
reactions 20Ne (Elab=145,160 MeV) + 12C and 20Ne (Elab=160 MeV) + 27Al,
populating 32S and 47V, respectively. The GDR lineshapes from the two systems
are remarkably different from each other. Whereas, the non alpha-like 47V
undergoes Jacobi shape transition and matches exceptionally well with the
theoretical GDR lineshape estimated under the framework rotating liquid drop
model (RLDM) and thermal shape fluctuation model (TSFM) signifying shape
equilibration, for alpha cluster 32S an extended prolate kind of shape is
observed. This unusual deformation, seen directly via -decay for the first
time, is predicted to be due to the formation of orbiting di-nuclear
configuration or molecular structure of 16O+ 16O in 32S superdeformed band.
