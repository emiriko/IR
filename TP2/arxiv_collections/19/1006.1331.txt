We study the possibility of testing experimentally signatures of P-odd
effects related with the vorticity of the medium. The Chiral Vortaic Effect is
generalized to the case of conserved charges different from the electric one.
In the case of baryonic charge and chemical potential such effect should
manifest itself in neutron asymmetries at the NICA accelerator complex measured
by the MPD detector. The required accuracy may be achieved in a few months of
accelerator running. We also discuss polarization of the hyperons and P-odd
correlations of particle momenta (handedness) as probes of vorticity.
