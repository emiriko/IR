V391 Peg (HS2201+2610) is an extreme horizontal branch subdwarf B (sdB) star,
it is an hybrid pulsator showing p- and g-mode oscillations, and hosts a
3.2/sini M_Jup planet at an orbital distance of about 1.7 AU. In order to
improve the characterization of the star, we measured the pulsation amplitudes
in the u'g'r' SLOAN photometric bands using ULTRACAM at the William Herschel
4.2 m telescope and we compared them with theoretical values. The preliminary
results presented in this article conclusively show that the two main pulsation
periods at 349.5 and 354.1 s are a radial and a dipole mode respectively. This
is the first time that the degree index of multiple modes has been uniquely
identified for an sdB star as faint as V391 Peg (B=14.4), proving that
multicolor photometry is definitely an efficient technique to constrain mode
identification, provided that the data have a high enough quality.
