The SuperNEMO project aims to search for neutrinoless double beta decay
($0\nu\beta\beta$) up to a sensitivity of 10$^{26}$ years for the
$0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life (down to $\sim$ 50~meV in the effective Majorana
neutrino mass), using $\sim$100 kg of source and a `tracko-calo' detector. The
current status of the 2006--2010 R\&D programme is discussed here.
