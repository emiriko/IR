We report on an all-electrical measurement of the spin Hall effect in
epitaxial Fe/In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As heterostructures with n-type channel doping (Si)
and highly doped Schottky tunnel barriers. A transverse spin current generated
by an ordinary charge current flowing in the In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As is detected by
measuring the spin accumulation at the edges of the channel. The spin
accumulation is identified through the observation of a Hanle effect in the
Hall voltage measured by pairs of ferromagnetic contacts. We investigate the
bias and temperature dependence of the resulting Hanle signal and determine the
skew and side-jump contributions to the total spin Hall conductivity.
