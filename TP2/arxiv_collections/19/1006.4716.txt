The nuclei 163,164Dy have been investigated using the Oslo method on data
from the pick-up reaction 164Dy(3He,alpha gamma)163Dy and the inelastic
scattering 164Dy(3He,3He' gamma)164Dy, respectively. The radiative strength
functions for both nuclei have been extracted, and a small resonance centered
around Eg ?3 MeV is observed in both cases. The parameters of this so-called
pygmy M1 resonance (the scissors mode) are compared to previous results on
160,161,162Dy using the Oslo method, and to data on 163Dy measured by the
Prague group using the two-step cascade method. In particular, the integrated
reduced transition probability B(M1) of the pygmy resonance is compared with
neighboring dysprosium isotopes. We also observe an enhanced strength in the
region above gamma energy around 5 MeV in 164Dy. Possible origins of this
feature are discussed.
