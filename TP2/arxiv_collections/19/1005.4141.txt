We study heat dissipation from a (10,10) CNT to a SiO2 substrate using
equilibrium and non-equilibrium classical molecular dynamics. The CNT-substrate
thermal boundary conductance (TBC) is computed both from the relaxation time of
the CNT-substrate temperature difference, and from the time autocorrelation
function of the interfacial heat flux at equilibrium (Green-Kubo relation). The
power spectrum of interfacial heat flux fluctuation and the time evolution of
the internal CNT energy distribution suggest that: 1) thermal coupling is
dominated by long wavelength phonons between 0-10 THz, 2) high frequency (40-57
THz) CNT phonon modes are strongly coupled to sub-40 THz CNT phonon modes, and
3) inelastic scattering between the CNT phonons and substrate phonons
contributes to interfacial thermal transport. We also find that the low
frequency longitudinal acoustic (LA) and twisting acoustic (TA) modes do not
transfer energy to the substrate as efficiently as the low frequency transverse
optical (TO) mode.
