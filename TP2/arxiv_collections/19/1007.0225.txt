The activation of a specific immune response takes place in the lymphoid
organs such as the spleen. We present here a simplified model of the
proliferation of specific immune cells in the form of a single delay equation.
We show that the system can undergo switches in stability as the delay is
increased, and we interpret these results in the context of sustaining an
effective immune response to a dendritic cell vaccine.
