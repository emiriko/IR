Recent searches for new physics in ep collisions performed by the H1 and ZEUS
collaborations are presented. Limits on different contact interaction models,
large extra dimensions, R-parity violating SUSY, excited fermions and anomalous
flavour-changing top couplings are shown. In addition, searches for new physics
in exclusive final states such as events with isolated leptons and large
missing transverse momentum or multi-lepton final states are presented.
