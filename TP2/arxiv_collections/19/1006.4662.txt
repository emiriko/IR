In this paper we present a step forward to improve general physics as an
educational experience: the implementation of a new course component composed
by innovative workshop activities based on computational modelling in the
general physics course taken by first year biomedical engineering students at
the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the New Lisbon University. The
activities were created as interactive modelling experiments with Modellus, a
computer software tool designed to construct and explore mathematical models
based on functions, iterations and differential equations. Special emphasis was
given to cognitive conflicts in the understanding of physical concepts, to the
manipulation of multiple representations of mathematical models and to the
interplay between analytical and numerical solutions of physical problems. In
this work we describe these computational modelling activities and their
educational aims. We also discuss their effective impact on the students
learning of key physical and mathematical concepts of the course.
