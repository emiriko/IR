We study the time evolution of a high-momentum gluon or quark propagating
through an infinite, thermalized, partonic medium utilizing a Boltzmann
equation approach. We calculate the collisional energy loss of the parton,
study its temperature and flavor dependence as well as the the momentum
broadening incurred through multiple interactions. Our transport calculations
agree well with analytic calculations of collisional energy-loss where
available, but offer the unique opportunity to address the medium response as
well in a consistent fashion.
