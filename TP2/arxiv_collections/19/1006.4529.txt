Colossal enhancement of magnetoresistance has been achieved over a broad
temperature range which extends upto the room temperature, in ferromagnetic
metal-charge ordered insulator manganite multi-layers. The artificially created
phase coexistence in the multilayers reproduce the characteristic signatures of
metastability in the magnetotransport properties commonly observed in
electronically phase-separated manganites.
