We present a complete analysis of threshold resummation effects on direct
light and heavy gaugino pair production at the Tevatron and the LHC. Based on a
new perturbative calculation at next-to-leading order of SUSY-QCD, which
includes also squark mixing effects, we resum soft gluon radiation in the
threshold region at leading and next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, retaining
at the same time the full SUSY-QCD corrections in the finite coefficient
function. This allows us to correctly match the resummed to the perturbative
cross section. Universal subleading logarithms are resummed in full matrix
form. We find that threshold resummation slightly increases and considerably
stabilizes the invariant mass spectra and total cross sections with respect to
the next-to-leading order calculation. For future reference, we present total
cross sections and their theoretical errors in tabular form for several
commonly used SUSY benchmark points, gaugino pairs, and hadron collider
energies.
