We give some reductions among problems in (nonnegative) weighted #CSP which
restrict the class of functions that needs to be considered in computational
complexity studies. Our reductions can be applied to both exact and approximate
computation. In particular, we show that a recent dichotomy for unweighted #CSP
can be extended to rational-weighted #CSP.
