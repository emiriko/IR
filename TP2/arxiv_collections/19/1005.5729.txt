New measurements of neutral and charged current cross sections at large
negative four-momentum transfer squared Q^2 have been performed by H1 and ZEUS,
using up to the complete HERA II ep data, which was taken with polarised
electron and positron beams. The data are compared to predictions of the
Standard Model, based on various parton distribution function
parameterisations. The polarisation asymmetry of the neutral current
interaction is measured as a function of Q^2, as well as the polarisation
dependence of the charged current cross section and both are found to be in
agreement with the Standard Model expectation. The HERA II cross sections are
also combined with previously published HERA I data to obtain the most precise
unpolarised measurements.
