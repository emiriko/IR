We will discuss the following results C_n complexification of R(n) spaces,
C_n structure and the invariant surfaces C_n holomorphicity and harmonicity. We
also consider the link between C_n holomorphicity and the origin of spin 1/n.
In our approach appears a new geometry and N-ary algebras/symmetries.
