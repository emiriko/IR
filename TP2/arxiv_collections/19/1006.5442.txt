The overall goal of the described research project was to create applicable
quality assurance patterns for Java software systems using the aspect-oriented
programming language extension AspectJ 5. We tried to develop aspects to check
static quality criteria as a variable mutator convention and architectural
layering rules. We successfully developed aspects for automating the following
dynamic quality criteria: Parameterized Exception Chaining, Comfortable
Declaration of Parameterized Exceptions, Not-Null Checking of Reference
Variables.
