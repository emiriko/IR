Since the pioneering work of Eichten and Lane it has been known that the
scale of the interactions responsible for the generation of the strange-quark
mass in extended technicolor theories must, absent any "GIM-like" mechanism for
suppressing flavor-changing neutral currents, be greater than of order 1000
TeV. In this note we point out that the constraint from the neutral D-meson
system is now equally strong, implying that the charm quark mass must also
arise from flavor dynamics at a scale this high. We then quantify the degree to
which the technicolor condensate must be enhanced in order to yield the
observed quark masses, if the extended technicolor scale is of order 1000 TeV.
Our results are intended to provide a framework in which to interpret and apply
the results of lattice studies of conformal strongly interacting gauge
theories, and the corresponding numerical measurements of the anomalous
dimension of the mass operator in candidate theories of "walking" technicolor.
