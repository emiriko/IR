We investigate the Mott transition in the anisotropic kagom\'e lattice
Hubbard model using the cellular dynamical mean field theory combined with
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations. By calculating the double
occupancy and the density of states, we determine the interaction strength of
the first-order Mott transition and show that it becomes small as the
anisotropy increases. We also calculate the spin correlation functions and the
single-particle spectrum, and reveal that the quasiparticle and magnetic
properties change dramatically around the Mott transition; the spin
correlations are strongly enhanced and the quasiparticle bands are deformed. We
conclude that such dramatic changes are due to the enhancement of anisotropy
associated with the relaxation of frustration around the Mott transition.
