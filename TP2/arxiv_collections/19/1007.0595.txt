The present DAMA/LIBRA experiment and the former DAMA/NaI have cumulatively
released so far the results obtained with the data collected over 13 annual
cycles (total exposure: 1.17 ton $\times$ yr). They give a model independent
evidence of the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo on the basis of
the DM annual modulation signature at 8.9 $\sigma$ C.L. for the cumulative
exposure.
