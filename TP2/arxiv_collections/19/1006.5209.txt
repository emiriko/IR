The modern usage of the words astronomy and astrology is traced back to
distinctions, largely ignored in recent scholarship. Three interpretations of
celestial phenomena (in a geometric, a substantialist and a prognostic
versions) coexisted during the Hellenistic period. From Plato to Isidore of
Seville, semantic changes are evidenced and their later development is
sketched.
