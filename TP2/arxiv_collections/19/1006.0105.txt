Magnetic nanowires are a good platform to study fundamental processes in
Magnetism and have many attractive applications in recording such as
perpendicular storage and in spintronics such as non-volatile magnetic memory
devices (MRAM) and magnetic logic devices. In this work, nanowires are used to
study magnetization reversal processes through a novel geometric approach.
Reversal modes imprint a definite signature on a parametric curve representing
the locus of the critical switching field. We show how the different modes
affect the geometry of this curve depending on the nature of the anisotropy
(uniaxial or cubic anisotropy), demagnetization and exchange effects. The
samples we use are electrochemically grown Nickel and Cobalt nanowires.
