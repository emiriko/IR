Cold-atom interferometers with optical splitting and recombination use
off-resonant laser beams to split a cloud of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
into two clouds that travel along different paths and are then recombined again
using optical beams. After the recombination, the BEC in general populates both
the cloud at rest and the moving clouds. Measuring relative number of atoms in
each of these clouds yields information about the relative phase shift
accumulated by the atoms in the two moving clouds during the interferometric
cycle. We derive the expression for the probability of finding any given number
of atoms in each of the clouds, discuss features of the probability density
distribution, analyze its dependence on the relative accumulated phase shift as
a function of the strength of the interatomic interactions, and compare our
results with experiment.
