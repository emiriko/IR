We have used the Spitzer Space Telescope to obtain Multiband Imaging
Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) 24 um photometry for 37 members of the ~100 Myr
old open cluster Blanco 1. For the brightest 25 of these stars (where we have
3sigma uncertainties less than 15%), we find significant mid-IR excesses for
eight stars, corresponding to a debris disk detection frequency of about 32%.
The stars with excesses include two A stars, four F dwarfs and two G dwarfs.
The most significant linkage between 24 um excess and any other stellar
property for our Blanco 1 sample of stars is with binarity. Blanco 1 members
that are photometric binaries show few or no detected 24 um excesses whereas a
quarter of the apparently single Blanco 1 members do have excesses. We have
examined the MIPS data for two other clusters of similar age to Blanco 1 -- NGC
2547 and the Pleiades. The AFGK photometric binary star members of both of
these clusters also show a much lower frequency of 24 um excesses compared to
stars that lie near the single-star main sequence. We provide a new
determination of the relation between V-Ks color and Ks-[24] color for main
sequence photospheres based on Hyades members observed with MIPS. As a result
of our analysis of the Hyades data, we identify three low mass Hyades members
as candidates for having debris disks near the MIPS detection limit.
