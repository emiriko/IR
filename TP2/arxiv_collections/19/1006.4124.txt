We derive exact expressions for the fluctuation conductivity in two
dimensional superconductors as a function of temperature and magnetic field in
the whole fluctuation region above the upper critical field H_{c2}(T). Focusing
on the vicinity of the quantum phase transition near zero temperature, we
propose that as the magnetic field approaches the line near H_{c2}(0) from
above, a peculiar dynamic state consisting of clusters of coherently rotating
fluctuation Cooper-pairs forms and estimate the characteristic size and
lifetime of such clusters. We find the zero temperature magnetic field
dependence of the the transverse magnetoconductivity above H_{c2}(0) in layered
superconductors.
