We study phenomenological consequences of the Standard Model extension by the
new spin-1 chiral fields with the internal quantum numbers of the electroweak
Higgs doublets. There are at least three different classes of theories, all
motivated by the hierarchy problem, which predict new vector weak-doublets with
masses not far from the electro-weak scale. We discuss resonance production of
these neutral chiral Z* bosons at hadron colliders. The bosons can be observed
as a Breit-Wigner resonance peak in the invariant dilepton mass distributions
in the same way as the well-known extra gauge Z' bosons. This includes them
into a list of very interesting objects for early searches with the first LHC
data. Moreover, the Z* bosons have unique signatures in transverse momentum,
angular and pseudorapidity distributions of the final leptons, which allow to
distinguish them from the other heavy neutral resonances.
