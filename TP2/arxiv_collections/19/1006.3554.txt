We demonstrate methods to locally control the spin rotation of moving
electrons in a GaAs channel. The Larmor frequency of optically-injected spins
is modulated when the spins are dragged through a region of spin-polarized
nuclei created at a MnAs/GaAs interface. The effective field created by the
nuclei is controlled either optically or electrically using the ferromagnetic
proximity polarization effect. Spin rotation is also tuned by controlling the
carrier traverse time through the polarized region. We demonstrate coherent
spin rotations exceeding 4 pi radians during transport.
