In the spirit of geometric quantisation we consider representations of the
Heisenberg(--Weyl) group induced by hypercomplex characters of its centre. This
allows to gather under the same framework, called p-mechanics, the three
principal cases: quantum mechanics (elliptic character), hyperbolic mechanics
and classical mechanics (parabolic character). In each case we recover the
corresponding dynamic equation as well as rules for addition of probabilities.
Notably, we are able to obtain whole classical mechanics without any kind of
semiclassical limit h->0.
