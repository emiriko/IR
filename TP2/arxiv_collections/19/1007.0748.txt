Two recent measurements of beauty production in deep inelastic scattering
based on data collected by the ZEUS detector are summarised. In the first one,
the beauty fraction in the data was obtained from events with a muon and a jet.
In the second one, beauty cross sections were measured using the decay length
significance and mass of inclusive secondary vertices. Differential cross
sections are presented and compared to QCD predictions. The beauty contribution
to the inclusive proton structure function F_2^bbbar was extracted for the
jet+muon measurement and is compared to previous measurements and theoretical
predictions.
