A novel approach is proposed to group redundant time series in the frame of
causality. It assumes that (i) the dynamics of the system can be described
using just a small number of characteristic modes, and that (ii) a pairwise
measure of redundancy is sufficient to elicit the presence of correlated
degrees of freedom. We show the application of the proposed approach on fMRI
data from a resting human brain and gene expression profiles from HeLa cell
culture.
