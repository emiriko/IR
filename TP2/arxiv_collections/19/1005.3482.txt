We present an extension of the Standard Model (SM) based on the discrete
flavor symmetry S3 which gives a neutrino mass matrix with two-zero texture of
Fritzsch-type and nearly diagonal charged lepton mass matrix. The model is
compatible with the normal hierarchy only and predicts the sine squared of the
reactor angle to be 0.01 at the best fit values of solar and atmospheric
parameters and maximal leptonic CP violation.
