We study S=1/2 Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice with first and
second neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange (J_{1}-J_{2} model), employing exact
diagonalization in both S_z=0 basis and nearest neighbor singlet valence bond
(NNVB) basis. We find that for 0.2<J_2/J_1<0.3, NNVB basis gives a proper
description of the ground state in comparison with the exact results. By
analyzing the dimer-dimer as well as plaquette-plaquette correlations and also
defining appropriate structure factors, we investigate possible symmetry
breaking states as the candidate for the ground state in the frustrated region.
We provide body of evidences in favor of plaquette valence bond ordering for
0.2<J_2/J_1<0.3. By further increasing the ratio J_2/J_1, this state undergoes
a transition to the staggered dimerized state.
