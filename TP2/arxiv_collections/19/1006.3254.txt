Quantum Monte Carlo approaches such as the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method
are among the most accurate many-body methods for extended systems. Their
scaling makes them well suited for defect calculations in solids. We review the
various approximations needed for DMC calculations of solids and the results of
previous DMC calculations for point defects in solids. Finally, we present
estimates of how approximations affect the accuracy of calculations for
self-interstitial formation energies in silicon and predict DMC values of
4.4(1), 5.1(1) and 4.7(1) eV for the X, T and H interstitial defects,
respectively, in a 16(+1)-atom supercell.
