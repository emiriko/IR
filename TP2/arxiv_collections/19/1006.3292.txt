In the X-ray spectra of most X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs)
absorption features with equivalent widths (EWs) of 50 -- 200 eV are observed.
We theoretically investigate different models to explain absorption features
and compare their properties with the observations. We consider various
theoretical models for the magnetized neutron star surface: naked condensed
iron surfaces and partially ionized hydrogen model atmospheres, including
semi-infinite and thin atmospheres above a condensed surface. The properties of
the absorption features (especially equivalent widths) and the angular
distributions of the emergent radiation are described for all models. A code
for computing light curves and integral emergent spectra of magnetized neutron
stars is developed. We assume a dipole surface magnetic field distribution with
a possible toroidal component and corresponding temperature distribution. A
model with two uniform hot spots at the magnetic poles can also be employed.
Light curves and spectra of highly magnetized neutron stars with parameters
typical for XDINSs are computed using different surface temperature
distributions and various local surface models. Spectra of magnetized model
atmospheres are approximated by diluted blackbody spectra with one or two
Gaussian lines having parameters, which allow us to describe the model
absorption features. To explain the prominent absorption features in the soft
X-ray spectra of XDINSs a thin atmosphere above the condensed surface can be
invoked, whereas a strong toroidal magnetic field component on the XDINS
surfaces can be excluded.
