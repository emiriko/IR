In response to a 1997 problem of M. Vidyasagar, we state a necessary and
sufficient condition for distribution-free PAC learnability of a concept class
$\mathscr C$ under the family of all non-atomic (diffuse) measures on the
domain $\Omega$. Clearly, finiteness of the classical Vapnik-Chervonenkis
dimension of $\mathscr C$ is a sufficient, but no longer necessary, condition.
Besides, learnability of $\mathscr C$ under non-atomic measures does not imply
the uniform Glivenko-Cantelli property with regard to non-atomic measures. Our
learnability criterion is stated in terms of a combinatorial parameter
$\VC({\mathscr C}\,{\mathrm{mod}}\,\omega_1)$ which we call the VC dimension of
$\mathscr C$ modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by
``thickening up'' single points in the definition of VC dimension to
uncountable ``clusters''. Equivalently, $\VC(\mathscr C\modd\omega_1)\leq d$ if
and only if every countable subclass of $\mathscr C$ has VC dimension $\leq d$
outside a countable subset of $\Omega$. The new parameter can be also expressed
as the classical VC dimension of $\mathscr C$ calculated on a suitable subset
of a compactification of $\Omega$. We do not make any measurability assumptions
on $\mathscr C$, assuming instead the validity of Martin's Axiom (MA).
