In the derivation of holographic dark energy density, the area law of the
black hole entropy plays a crucial role. However, the entropy-area relation can
be modified from the inclusion of quantum effects, motivated from the loop
quantum gravity, string theory and black hole physics. In this paper, we study
cosmological implication of the interacting entropy-corrected holographic dark
energy model in the framework of Brans-Dicke cosmology. We obtain the equation
of state and the deceleration parameters of the entropy-corrected holographic
dark energy in a non-flat Universe. As system's IR cutoff we choose the radius
of the event horizon measured on the sphere of the horizon, defined as
$L=ar(t)$. We find out that when the entropy-corrected holographic dark energy
is combined with the Brans-Dicke field, the transition from normal state where
$w_D >-1 $ to the phantom regime where $w_D <-1 $ for the equation of state of
interacting dark energy can be more easily achieved for than when resort to the
Einstein field equations is made.
