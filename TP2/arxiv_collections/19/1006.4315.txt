Dynamical counterflow effects on vortex evolution under the truncated
Gross-Pitaevskii equation are investigated. Standard longitudinal mutual
friction effects are produced and a dilatation of vortex rings is obtained at
large counterflow. A strong temperature-dependent anomalous slowdown of vortex
rings is observed and attributed to the presence of thermally exited Kelvin
waves. This generic effect of finite-temperature superfluids is estimated using
energy equipartition and orders of magnitude are given for weakly interacting
Bose-Einstein condensates and superfluid $^4{\rm He}$.
