It is anticipated that a number of techniques to measure the top quark mass
at the LHC will yield m_top with uncertainties of about 0.5-1 percent. These
uncertainties are mostly theoretical; they are usually estimated using parton
shower Monte Carlo programs whose reliability at this level of precision is
difficult to assess. The goal of this paper is to contrast those estimates with
the results of NLO QCD computations for a few observables, often discussed in
the context of high-precision top quark mass measurements at the LHC. In
particular, we study the NLO QCD corrections to the invariant mass distribution
of a charged lepton and a B-meson in lepton+jets channels. In the dilepton
channel we investigate the invariant mass distribution of a charged lepton and
a b-jet, the average energy of the two leptons and the average energy of the
b-jets from top decays.
