The present work proposes an idea to remove the long standing controversy
between the calculated and measured current amplitudes carried by a small
conducting ring upon the application of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux $\phi$.
Within a mean field Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation we numerically calculate
persistent current, Drude weight, low-field magnetic susceptibility and related
issues. Our analysis may be inspiring for studying magnetic response in
nano-scale loop geometries.
