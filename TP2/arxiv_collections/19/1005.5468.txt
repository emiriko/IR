The aim of this paper is to provide the mathematical framework for analyzing
the possibility of rendering one dimensional objects visible with difficulty
and ultimately invisible,by changing the experimental conditions to which they
are subdued. The calculation was performed using the Hubbard model,and it will
be based on a recent expression for a particular class of Q1D organic salts.
Two sets of material parameters for which the reflectivity of a 1D object tends
to zero have been determined.
