In May 2008, the Antares collaboration has completed the construction of the
first deep sea neutrino telescope in the Northern hemisphere. Antares is a 3D
array of 900 photomultipliers held in the sea by twelve mooring lines anchored
at a depth of 2500 m in the Mediterranean Sea 40 km off the southern French
coast. The detection principle is based on the observation of Cerenkov light
induced by charged particles produced in neutrino interactions in the matter
surrounding the detector.
