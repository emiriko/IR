The aim of this paper is to carry out a mathematical analysis of a system of
ordinary differential equations introduced by R. Lev Bar-Or to model the
interactions between T cells and macrophages. Under certain restrictions on the
parameters of the model, theorems are proved about the number of stationary
solutions and their stability. In some cases the existence of periodic
solutions or heteroclinic cycles is ruled out. Evidence is presented that the
same biological phenomena could be equally well described by a simpler model.
