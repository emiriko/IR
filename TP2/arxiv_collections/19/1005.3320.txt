When twisting a strip of paper or acetate under high longitudinal tension,
one observes, at some critical load, a buckling of the strip into a regular
triangular pattern. Very similar triangular facets have recently been observed
in solutions to a new set of geometrically-exact equations describing the
equilibrium shape of thin inextensible elastic strips. Here we formulate a
modified boundary-value problem for these equations and construct post-buckling
solutions in good agreement with the observed pattern in twisted strips. We
also study the force-extension and moment-twist behaviour of these strips by
varying the mode number n of triangular facets.
