A near-perfect, non-singular cylindrical invisibility cloak with diamond
cross section is achieved by a two-step coordinate transformation. A small line
segment is stretched and then blown up into a diamond space, and finally the
cloak consisting of four kinds and eight blocks of homogeneous transformation
media is obtained. Numerical simulations confirm the well performance of the
cloak. The operation bandwidth of the cloak is also investigated. Our scheme is
promising to create a simple and well-performed cloak in practice.
