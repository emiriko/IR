In order to reconstruct the global SEDs of the Magellanic Clouds over eight
decades in spectral range, we combined literature flux densities representing
the entire LMC and SMC respectively, and complemented these with maps extracted
from the WMAP and COBE databases covering the missing the 23--90 GHz (13--3.2
mm) and the poorly sampled 1.25--250 THz (240--1.25 micron). We have discovered
a pronounced excess of emission from both Magellanic Clouds, but especially the
SMC, at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. We also determined accurate
thermal radio fluxes and very low global extinctions for both LMC and SMC.
Possible explanations are briefly considered but as long as the nature of the
excess emission is unknown, the total dust masses and gas-to-dust ratios of the
Magellanic Clouds cannot reliably be determined.
