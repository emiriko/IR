The idea that chaotic set of quantum vortices can mimic classical turbulence,
or at least reproduce many main features, is currently actively being
developed. Appreciating significance of the challenging problem of the
classical turbulence it can be expressed that the idea to study it in terms of
quantized line is indeed very important and may be regarded as a breakthrough.
For this reason, this theory should be carefully scrutinized. One of the basic
arguments supporting this point of view is the fact that vortex tangle decays
at zero temperature, when the apparent mechanism of dissipation (mutual
friction) is absent. Since the all possible mechanisms of dissipation of the
vortex energy, discussed in the literature, are related to the small scales, it
is natural to suggest that the Kolmogorov cascade takes the place with the flow
of the energy, just as in the classical turbulence. In a series of recent
experiment attenuation of vortex line density was observed and authors
attribute this decay to the properties of the Kolmogorov turbulence. In the
present work we discuss alternative possibility of decay of the vortex tangle,
which is not related to dissipation at small scales. This mechanism is just the
diffusive like spreading of the vortex tangle. We discuss a number of the key
experiments, considering them both from the point of view of alternative
explanation and of the theory of Kolmogorov turbulence in quantum fluids.
