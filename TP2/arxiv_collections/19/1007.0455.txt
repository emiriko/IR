Centaurus A is the nearest radio-loud AGN and is detected from radio to very
high energy gamma-rays. Its nuclear spectral energy distribution shows two
peaks, one in the far-infrared band and another at about 150 keV. By assuming
the second peak is due to the electron synchrotron emission and the power index
for the differential spectrum of the very high energy cosmic ray proton to be
2.7 we show that only pp interaction is responsible for the observed GeV-TeV
emission from Centaurus A. We also found that indeed many very high energy
cosmic ray protons from Centaurus A can arrive on Earth thus supporting the
recent observation of two events by Pierre Auger Observatory.
