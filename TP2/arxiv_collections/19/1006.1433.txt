Algebraic lambda-calculi have been studied in various ways, but their
semantics remain mostly untouched. In this paper we propose a semantic analysis
of a general simply-typed lambda-calculus endowed with a structure of vector
space. We sketch the relation with two established vectorial lambda-calculi.
Then we study the problems arising from the addition of a fixed point
combinator and how to modify the equational theory to solve them. We sketch an
algebraic vectorial PCF and its possible denotational interpretations.
