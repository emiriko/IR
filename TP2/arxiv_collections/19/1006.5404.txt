In 1966 Leggett used a two-band superconductor to show that a new collective
mode could exist at low temperatures, corresponding to a counter-flow of the
superconducting condensates in each band. Here, the theory of electronic Raman
scattering in a superconductor by Klein and Dierker (1984) is extended to a
multiband superconductor. Raman scattering creates particle/hole pairs. In the
relevant $A_{1g}$\ symmetry, the attraction that produces pairing necessarily
couples excitations of superconducting pairs to these p/h excitations. In the
Appendix it is shown that for zero wave vector transfer $% q$ this coupling
modifies the Raman response and makes the long-range Coulomb correction null.
The 2-band result is applied to MgB$_{2}$ where this coupling activates
Leggett's collective mode. His simple limiting case is obtained when the
interband attractive potential is decreased to a value well below that given by
LDA theory. The peak from Leggett's mode is studied as the potential is
increased through the theoretical value: With realistic MgB$_{2}$\ parameters,
the peak broadens through decay into the continuum above the smaller ($\pi $
band) superconducting gap. Finite $q$ effects are also taken into account,
yielding a Raman peak that agrees well in energy with the experimental result
by Blumberg \textit{et el.} (2007). This approach is also applied to the $q=0$,
2-band model of the Fe-pnictides considered by Chubukov \textit{et al.}(2009).
