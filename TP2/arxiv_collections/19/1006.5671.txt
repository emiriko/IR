We have shown that, within the context of Scalar-Tensor theories, the
anisotropic Bianchi-type cosmological models evolve towards de Sitter universe.
A similar result holds in the case of cosmology in Lyra manifold. Thus the
analogue of cosmic no-hair theorem of Wald (1983) hold in both the cases. In
fact, during inflation there is no difference between scalar-tensor theories,
Lyra's manifold and general relativity (GR).
