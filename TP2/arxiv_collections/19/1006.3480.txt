The calculation of both spinor and tensor Green's functions in
four-dimensional conformally invariant field theories can be greatly simplified
by six-dimensional methods. For this purpose, four-dimensional fields are
constructed as projections of fields on the hypercone in six-dimensional
projective space, satisfying certain transversality conditions. In this way
some Green's functions in conformal field theories are shown to have structures
more general than those commonly found by use of the inversion operator. These
methods fit in well with the assumption of AdS/CFT duality. In particular, it
is transparent that if fields on AdS$_5$ approach finite limits on the boundary
of AdS$_5$, then in the conformal field theory on this boundary these limits
transform with conformal dimensionality zero if they are tensors (of any rank),
but with conformal dimension 1/2 if they are spinors or spinor-tensors.
