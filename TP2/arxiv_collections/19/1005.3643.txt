Solar flares presumably have an impact on the deepest layers of the solar
atmosphere and yet the observational evidence for such an impact is scarce.
Using ten years of measurements of the Na D$_{1}$ and Na D$_2$ Fraunhofer
lines, measured by GOLF onboard SOHO, we show that this photospheric line is
indeed affected by flares. The effect of individual flares is hidden by solar
oscillations, but a statistical analysis based on conditional averaging reveals
a clear signature. Although GOLF can only probe one single wavelength at a
time, we show that both wings of the Na line can nevertheless be compared. The
varying line asymmetry can be interpreted as an upward plasma motion from the
lower solar atmosphere during the peak of the flare, followed by a downward
motion.
