An exactly solvable variant of mixed spin-(1/2,1) Ising-Heisenberg diamond
chain is considered. Vertical spin-1 dimers are taken as quantum ones with
Heisenberg bilinear and biquadratic interactions and with single-ion
anisotropy, while all interactions between spin-1 and spin-1/2 residing on the
intermediate sites are taken in the Ising form. The detailed analysis of the
$T=0$ ground state phase diagram is presented. The phase diagrams have shown to
be rather rich, demonstrating large variety of ground states: saturated one,
three ferrimagnetic with magnetization equal to 3/5 and another four
ferrimagnetic ground states with magnetization equal to 1/5. There are also two
frustrated macroscopically degenerated ground states which could exist at zero
magnetic filed.
  Solving the model exactly within classical transfer-matrix formalism we
obtain an exact expressions for all thermodynamic function of the system. The
thermodynamic properties of the model have been described exactly by exact
calculation of partition function within the direct classical transfer-matrix
formalism, the entries of transfer matrix, in their turn, contain the
information about quantum states of vertical spin-1 XXZ dimer (eigenvalues of
local hamiltonian for vertical link).
