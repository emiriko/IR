A new $z$-stretching finite difference method is established for simulating
the paraxial light beam propagation through a lens in a cylindrically symmetric
domain. By introducing proper domain transformations, we solve corresponding
difference approximations on a uniform grid in the computational space for
great efficiency. A specialized matrix analysis method is constructed to study
the numerical stability. Interesting computational results are presented.
