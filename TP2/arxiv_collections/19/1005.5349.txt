We present the timing characteristics of the flash ADC readout of the GlueX
forward calorimeter, which depends on precise measurement of arrival time of
pulses from FEU 84-3 photomultiplier tubes to suppress backgrounds. The tests
presented were performed using two different 250 MHz prototype flash ADC
devices, one with eight-bit and one with twelve-bit sampling depth. All
measured time resolutions were better than 1 ns, independent of signal size,
which is the design goal for the GlueX forward calorimeter. For pulses with an
amplitude of 100 mV the timing resolution is 0.57 +- 0.18 ns, while for 500 mV
pulses it is 0.24 +- 0.08 ns.
