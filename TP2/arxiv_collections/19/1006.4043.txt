Large mass bolometers are used in particle physics experiments to search for
rare processes. By operating at low temperature, they are able to detect
particle energies from few keV up to several MeV, measuring the temperature
rise produced by the energy released. This study was performed on the
bolometers of the CUORE experiment. The response function of these detectors is
not linear in the energy range of interest, and it changes with the operating
temperature. The non-linearity is found to be dominated by the thermistor and
its biasing circuit. A method to obtain a linear response is the result of this
work. It allows a great simplification of the data analysis.
