In this paper, we unify all know iterative methods by introducing a new
explicit iterative scheme for approximation of common fixed points of finite
families of total asymptotically $I$-nonexpansive mappings. Note that such a
scheme contains as a particular case of the method introduced in [C.E. Chidume,
E.U. Ofoedu, \textit{Inter. J. Math. & Math. Sci.} \textbf{2009}(2009) Article
ID 615107, 17p]. We construct examples of total asymptotically nonexpansive
mappings which are not asymptotically nonexpansive. Note that no such kind of
examples were known in the literature. We prove the strong convergence theorems
for such iterative process to a common fixed point of the finite family of
total asymptotically $I-$nonexpansive and total asymptotically nonexpansive
mappings, defined on a nonempty closed convex subset of uniformly convex Banach
spaces. Moreover, our results extend and unify all known results.
