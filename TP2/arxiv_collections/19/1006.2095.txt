We predict the branching ratios of the lepton flavor violating Higgs decays
H^0\rightarrow e^{\pm} \mu^{\pm}, H^0\rightarrow e^{\pm} \tau^{\pm} and
H^0\rightarrow \mu^{\pm} \tau^{\pm} with the assumption that lepton flavor
violation is due to the unparticle mediation. Here, we consider an effective
interaction which breaks the conformal invariance after the electroweak
symmetry breaking and causes that unparticle becomes massive. The new
interaction results in a modification of the mediating unparticle propagator
and brings additional contribution to the branching ratios of the lepton flavor
violating decays with the new vertex including Higgs field and two unparticle
fields. We observe that the branching ratios of the decays under consideration
lie in the range of 10^{-6}-10^{-4}.
