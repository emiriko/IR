I consider variations in the definition of a General-Mass Variable Flavour
Number Scheme (GM-VFNS) for heavy flavour structure functions, both at
next-to-leading order (NLO) and at next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO). I also
define a new "optimal" scheme choice improving the smoothness of the transition
from one flavour number to the next. At both NLO and NNLO I investigate the
variation of the structure function for a fixed set of parton distribution
functions (PDFs) and also the change in the distributions when a new MSTW-type
global fit to data is performed for each GM-VFNS. At NLO the parton
distributions, and predictions using them at hadron colliders, can vary by ~2%
from the mean value. Use of the the Zero-Mass Variable Flavour Number Scheme,
which is simpler but only an approximation, leads to results a further couple
of percent or more outside this range. At NNLO there is far more stability with
varying GM-VFNS definition. Typical changes in PDFs and predictions are less
than 1%, with most variation at very small x values. This demonstrates that
mass-scheme variation is an additional and significant source of uncertainty
when considering parton distributions, but like other theoretical
uncertainties, it diminishes quickly as higher orders are included.
