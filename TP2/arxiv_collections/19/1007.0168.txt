A simple model is considered for an open system consisting of an aggregation
of magnetic particles (like greigite) in the presence of a magnetic field (H),
and interacting linearly with a bath of 3D harmonic oscillators. Using the
Feynman-Vernon formalism, as given in Weiss (termed FVW), the time-evolved
reduced density matrix (after eliminating the bath d.o.f.'s), is examined for
environmental decoherence as defined in the FVW formalism. While decoherence is
usually positive for most two-way couplings with the enviroment, it is found
that a $three-way$ interaction involving the system plus bath plus H-field all
together, can facilitate a $reversal$ of sign of this quantity! This may have
implications for quantum coherence based phenomena on the origins of life.
