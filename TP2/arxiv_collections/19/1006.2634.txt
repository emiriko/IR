Autocatalysis is a fundamental concept, used in a wide range of domains. From
the most general definition of autocatalysis, that is a process in which a
chemical compound is able to catalyze its own formation, several different
systems can be described. We detail the different categories of autocatalyses,
and compare them on the basis of their mechanistic, kinetic, and dynamic
properties. It is shown how autocatalytic patterns can be generated by
different systems of chemical reactions. The notion of autocatalysis covering a
large variety of mechanistic realisations with very similar behaviors, it is
proposed that the key signature of autocatalysis is its kinetic pattern
expressed in a mathematical form.
