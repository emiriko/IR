We consider an inhomogeneous quantum phase transition across a multicritical
point of the XY quantum spin chain. This is an example of a Lifshitz transition
with a dynamical exponent z = 2. Just like in the case z = 1 considered in New
J. Phys. 12, 055007 (2010) when a critical front propagates much faster than
the maximal group velocity of quasiparticles vq, then the transition is
effectively homogeneous: density of excitations obeys a generalized
Kibble-Zurek mechanism and scales with the sixth root of the transition rate.
However, unlike for z = 1, the inhomogeneous transition becomes adiabatic not
below vq but a lower threshold velocity v', proportional to inhomogeneity of
the transition, where the excitations are suppressed exponentially.
Interestingly, the adiabatic threshold v' is nonzero despite vanishing minimal
group velocity of low energy quasiparticles. In the adiabatic regime below v'
the inhomogeneous transition can be used for efficient adiabatic quantum state
preparation in a quantum simulator: the time required for the critical front to
sweep across a chain of N spins adiabatically is merely linear in N, while the
corresponding time for a homogeneous transition across the multicritical point
scales with the sixth power of N. What is more, excitations after the adiabatic
inhomogeneous transition, if any, are brushed away by the critical front to the
end of the spin chain.
