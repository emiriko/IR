An infinite family of relativistic finite thin disk model with magnetic field
is presented. The model is obtained for solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations
for static spacetimes by means of the Horsk\'y-Mitskievitch generating
conjecture. The vacuum limit of these obtained solutions is the well known
Morgan and Morgan solution. The obtained expressions are simply written in
terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates. The mass of the disks are finite and
the energy-momentum tensor agrees with all the energy conditions. The magnetic
field and the circular velocity are evaluated explicitly. All the physical
quantities obtained shown an acceptable
