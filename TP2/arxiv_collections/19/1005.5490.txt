Central Force Optimization is a global search and optimization algorithm that
searches a decision space by flying "probes" whose trajectories are
deterministically computed using two equations of motion. Because it is
possible for a probe to fly outside the domain of feasible solutions, a simple
errant probe retrieval method has been used previously that does not include
the directional information contained in a probe's acceleration vector. This
note investigates the effect of adding directionality to the "repositioning
factor" approach. As a general proposition, it appears that doing so does not
improve convergence speed or accuracy. In fact, adding directionality to the
original errant probe retrieval scheme appears to be highly inadvisable.
Nevertheless, there may be alternative probe retrieval schemes that do benefit
from directional information, and the results reported here may assist in or
encourage their development.
