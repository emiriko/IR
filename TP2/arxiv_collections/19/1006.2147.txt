The effect of alkaline earth substitution on structural parameters was
studied in high-quality single crystals of Ba(1-x)Sr(x)Fe2As2 and
Sr(1-x)Ca(x)Fe2As2 grown by the self-flux method. The results of single-crystal
and powder x-ray diffraction measurements suggest a continuous monotonic
decrease of both a- and c-axis lattice parameters, the c/a tetragonal ratio,
and the unit cell volume with decreasing alkaline earth atomic radius as
expected by Vegard's law. As a result, the system experiences a continuously
increasing chemical pressure effect in traversing the phase diagram from x=0 in
Ba(1-x)Sr(x)Fe2As2 to x=1 in Sr(1-x)Ca(x)Fe2As2.
