We measure current-voltage characteristics as function of magnetic field and
temperature in Nb strips of different thickness and width. The instability
voltage of the flux flow state related to the vortex critical velocity v* is
studied and compared with the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory. Beside the usual
power-law dependence v* ~ B^-1/2, in the low field range a new cross-over
field, Bcr1, is observed below which v* decreases by further lowering the
external magnetic field B. We ascribe this unexpected cross-over to vortex
channeling due to a fan-like penetration of the applied magnetic field as
confirmed by magneto-optic imaging. The observation of Bcr1 becomes a direct
evidence of a general feature in type-II superconducting films at low fields,
that is a channel-like vortex motion induced by the inhomogeneous magnetic
state caused by the relatively strong pinning.
