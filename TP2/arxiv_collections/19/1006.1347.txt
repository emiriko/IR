Correlations of charged hadrons of 1 < pT < 10 GeV/c with high pT direct
photons and pi^ 0 mesons in the range 5 <pT < 15 GeV/c are used to study jet
fragmentation in the photon+jet and di-jet channels, respectively. The
magnitude of the partonic transverse momentum, kT, is obtained by comparing to
a model incorporating a Gaussian kT smearing. The sensitivity of the associated
charged hadron spectra to the underlying fragmentation function is tested and
the data are compared to calculations using recent global fit results. The
shape of the direct photon-associated hadron spectrum as well as its charge
asymmetry are found to be consistent with a sample dominated by quark-gluon
Compton scattering. No significant evidence of fragmentation photon correlated
production is observed within experimental uncertainties.
