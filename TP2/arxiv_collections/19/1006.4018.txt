The Lambdac(2940)+ baryon with quantum numbers J(P) = 1/2(+) is considered as
a molecular state composed of a nucleon and D* meson. We give predictions for
the width of the radiative decay process Lambdac(2940)+ to Lambdac(2286)+ gamma
in this interpretation. Based on our results we argue that an experimental
determination of the radiative decay width of Lambdac(2940)+ is important for
the understanding of its intrinsic properties.
