We investigate constraints on dark energy fluctuations using type Ia
supernovae. If dark energy is not in the form of a cosmological constant, that
is if the equation of state is not equal to -1, we expect not only temporal,
but also spatial variations in the energy density. Such fluctuations would
cause local variations in the universal expansion rate and directional
dependences in the redshift-distance relation. We present a scheme for relating
a power spectrum of dark energy fluctuations to an angular covariance function
of standard candle magnitude fluctuations. The predictions for a
phenomenological model of dark energy fluctuations are compared to
observational data in the form of the measured angular covariance of Hubble
diagram magnitude residuals for type Ia supernovae in the Union2 compilation.
The observational result is consistent with zero dark energy fluctuations.
However, due to the limitations in statistics, current data still allow for
quite general dark energy fluctuations as long as they are in the linear
regime.
