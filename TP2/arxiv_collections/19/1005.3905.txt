We investigate a magnetic susceptibility of vortices in the B phase of
multicomponent triplet superfluid $^3$He focusing on a contribution of bound
fermionic states localized within vortex cores. Several order parameter
configurations relevant to different types of quantized vortices in $^3$He B
are considered. It is shown quite generally that an ac magnetic susceptibility
has a sharp peak at the frequency corresponding to the energy of interlevel
spacing in the spectrum of bound fermions. We suggest that measuring of a
magnetic resonance within vortex cores can provide a direct probe of a discrete
spectrum of bound vortex core excitations.
