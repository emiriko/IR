We report on VLBI, as well as VLA radio observations of the Type Ib/c
supernova 2009bb. The high radio luminosity of this supernova seems to require
relativistic outflow, implying that the early radio emission was
"engine-driven", that is driven by collimated outflow from a compact object,
even though no gamma-ray emission was seen. The radio light curve shows a
general decline, with a "bump" near t = 52 d, seen most prominently at 5 GHz.
The lightcurve bump could be either engine-driven, or it might represent the
turn-on of the normal radio emission from a supernova, driven by interaction
with the CSM rather than by the engine. We undertook VLBI observations to
resolve SN 2009bb's relativistic outflow. Our observations constrain the
angular outer radius at an age of 85 d to be <0.64 mas, corresponding to <4 x
10^17 cm and an average apparent expansion speed of <1.74c. This result is
consistent with the moderately relativistic ejecta speeds implied by the radio
luminosity and spectrum.
