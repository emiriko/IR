We demonstrate a technique to nanofabricate nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in
diamond based on broad-beam nitrogen implantation through apertures in electron
beam lithography resist. This method enables high-throughput nanofabrication of
single NV centers on sub-100 nm length scales. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy
(SIMS) measurements facilitate depth profiling of the implanted nitrogen to
provide three-dimensional characterization of the NV center spatial
distribution. Measurements of NV center coherence with on-chip coplanar
waveguides suggest a pathway for incorporating this scalable nanofabrication
technique in future quantum applications.
