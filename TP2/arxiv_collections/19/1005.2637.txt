Metamaterial cloaking has been proposed and studied in recent years following
several interesting approaches. One of them, the scattering-cancellation
technique, or plasmonic cloaking, exploits the plasmonic effects of suitably
designed thin homogeneous metamaterial covers to drastically suppress the
scattering of moderately sized objects within specific frequency ranges of
interest. Besides its inherent simplicity, this technique also holds the
promise of isotropic response and weak polarization dependence. Its theory has
been applied extensively to symmetrical geometries and canonical 3D shapes, but
its application to elongated objects has not been explored with the same level
of detail. We derive here closed-form theoretical formulas for infinite
cylinders under arbitrary wave incidence, and validate their performance with
full-wave numerical simulations, also considering the effects of finite lengths
and truncation effects in cylindrical objects. In particular, we find that a
single isotropic (idealized) cloaking layer may successfully suppress the
dominant scattering coefficients of moderately thin elongated objects, even for
finite lengths comparable with the incident wavelength, providing a weak
dependence on the incidence angle. These results may pave the way for
application of plasmonic cloaking in a variety of practical scenarios of
interest.
