We present ab initio calculations of the bandstructure of graphene and of
short zigzag graphene nanoribbons by the screened-exchange-LDA method (sX-LDA)
within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The inclusion of
non-local electron-electron interactions in this approach results in a
renormalization of the electronic bandstructure and the Fermi velocity compared
to calculations within local density approximation (LDA) gives good agreement
with experiment. Similarly, the band gaps in zigzag nanoribbons (ZGNR) are
widened by more than 200%, being of similar magnitude than bandgaps from past
studies based on quasiparticle bandstructures. We found a noticeable effect of
non-local exchange on the spin-polarization of the electronic ground state of
ZGNRs, compared to LDA and GGA-PW91 calculations.
