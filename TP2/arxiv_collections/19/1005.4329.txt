This paper addresses the problem of estimating the tail index of
distributions with heavy, Pareto-type tails for dependent data, that is of
interest in the areas of finance, insurance, environmental monitoring and
teletraffic analysis. A novel approach based on the max self-similarity scaling
behavior of block maxima is introduced. The method exploits the increasing lack
of dependence of maxima over large size blocks, which proves useful for time
series data. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the
proposed max-spectrum estimator for a large class of m-dependent time series,
in the regime of intermediate block-maxima. In the regime of large
block-maxima, we demonstrate the distributional consistency of the estimator
for a broad range of time series models including linear processes. The
max-spectrum estimator is a robust and computationally efficient tool, which
provides a novel time-scale perspective to the estimation of the
tail--exponents. Its performance is illustrated over synthetic and real data
sets.
