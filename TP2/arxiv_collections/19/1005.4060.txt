At the LHC and Tevatron strong initial-state radiation (ISR) plays an
important role. It can significantly affect the partonic luminosity available
to the hard interaction or contaminate a signal with additional jets and soft
radiation. An ideal process to study ISR is isolated Drell-Yan production, pp
-> X l+l- without central jets, where the jet veto is provided by the hadronic
event shape beam thrust tau_B. Most hadron collider event shapes are designed
to study central jets. In contrast, requiring tau_B << 1 provides an inclusive
veto of central jets and measures the spectrum of ISR. For tau_B << 1 we carry
out a resummation of alpha_s^n ln^m tau_B corrections at
next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic order. This is the first resummation at
this order for a hadron-hadron collider event shape. Measurements of tau_B at
the Tevatron and LHC can provide crucial tests of our understanding of ISR and
of tau_B's utility as a central jet veto.
