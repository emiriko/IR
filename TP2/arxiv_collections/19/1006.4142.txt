A comprehensive number of one-loop integrals in a theory with Wilson fermions
at $r=1$ is computed using the Burgio-Caracciolo-Pelissetto algorithm. With the
use of these results, the fermionic propagator in the coordinate representation
is evaluated, thus making it possible to extend the Luscher-Weisz procedure for
two-loop integrals to the fermionic case. Computations are performed with FORM
and REDUCE packages.
