We have investigated the ground state properties of polycrystalline CeCoAsO
by means of magnetization, specific heat and solid state NMR. Susceptibility
and specific-heat measurements suggest a ferromagnetic order at about,
$T_\mathrm{C}$=75 K. No further transitions are found down to 2 K. At 6.5 K a
complex Schottky type of anomaly shows up in the specific heat results. The
interplay between Ce-4f and Co-3d magnetism being responsible for that anomaly
is discussed. Furthermore $^{75}$As NMR investigations have been performed to
probe the magnetism on a microscopic scale. As-NMR spectra are analysed in
terms of first and second order quadrupolar interaction. The anisotropic shift
component $K_{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ could be derived from the
$^{75}$As powder spectra. Towards lower temperature a strong shift anisotropy
was found. Nonetheless $K_{\mathrm{iso}}$ tracks the bulk susceptibility down
to $T=$50 K very well. Furthermore the presence of weak correlations among the
Ce ions in the ferromagnetic state is discussed. The observed increase of $C/T$
towards lower temperatures supports this interpretation.
