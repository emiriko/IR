In this paper, we describe a numerical continuation method that enables
harmonic analysis of nonlinear periodic oscillators. This method is formulated
as a boundary value problem that can be readily implemented by resorting to a
standard continuation package - without modification - such as AUTO, which we
used. Our technique works for any kind of oscillator, including electronic,
mechanical and biochemical systems. We provide two case studies. The first
study concerns itself with the autonomous electronic oscillator known as the
Colpitts oscillator, and the second one with a nonlinear damped oscillator, a
non-autonomous mechanical oscillator. As shown in the case studies, the
proposed technique can aid both the analysis and the design of the oscillators,
by following curves for which a certain constraint, related to harmonic
analysis, is fulfilled.
