We show that the magnetic properties of antiferromagnetic layered NiCl$_{2}$
can be altered under nano-sizing depending on dimensionality and morphology
type of the corresponding nano-forms. By means of Monte-Carlo simulations
within classical Heisenberg model, the spin ordering, magnetic part of heat
capacity C$_{v}$ and N\'eel temperatures T$_{N}$ for multi-walled NiCl$_{2}$
nanotubes and a fullerene were calculated and analyzed in comparison with the
bulk NiCl$_{2}$ and multilayered two-dimensional NiCl$_{2}$ crystals and
nanostripes. We have found that the nano-structuring of NiCl$_{2}$ at the size
reducing and at the formation of the closed structures can influence
propitiously on the preservation of antiferromagnetic properties.
