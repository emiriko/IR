PG 1407+265 is a radio quiet quasar but has a relativistic jet. In this
report, we show some peculiar properties of its optical and X-ray emissions,
which indicate their possible non-thermal origins produced from jet. We use a
simple synchrotron + synchrotron self Compton (SSC) model to fit the emissions
with different ratios of energy densities between magnetic field and electrons
(\eta=UB/Ue), which predict different {\gamma}-ray luminosity. The First LAT
AGN Catalog (1LAC) did not include PG 1407+265, which indicates an upper limit
of {\gamma}-ray luminosity. This upper limit constrains the ratio unreasonable
large (\eta>10^4-10^5). This inversely indicates that the optical and X-ray
emissions may be not produced from the beaming jet. We discuss the physical
implications of these results.
