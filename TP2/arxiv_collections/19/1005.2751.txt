We know Schr\"{o}dinger equation describes the dynamics of quantum systems,
which don't include temperature. In this paper, we propose finite temperature
Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which can describe the quantum systems in an
arbitrary temperature. When the temperature T=0, it become Shr\"{o}dinger
equation.
