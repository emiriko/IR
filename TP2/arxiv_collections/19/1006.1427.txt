LS I+61303 is one of the few high-mass X-ray binaries that have been recently
observed at TeV and GeV energies. Here we investigate the hard X-ray spectral
and timing properties of this source using the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on-board
the INTEGRAL satellite. We carry out a systematic analysis based on all
available INTEGRAL data since December 28, 2002 up to April 30, 2008. The total
exposure time analyzed amounts to 2.1 Ms, hence more than doubling the previous
reported sample. The source is best detected in the 18-60 keV band, with a
significance level of 12.0 sigma. The hard X-ray data are best fit with a
simple power law with a photon index of ~ 1.7+-0.2. We detect a periodical
signal at 27 +- 4 days, matching the orbital period of 26.496 days previously
reported at other wavelengths. The hard X-rays orbital lightcurve is obtained
and compared with those derived at other frequencies.
