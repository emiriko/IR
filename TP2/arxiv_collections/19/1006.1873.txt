We study the effective screened electrostatic potential created by a
spheroidal colloidal particle immersed in an electrolyte, within the mean field
approximation, using Poisson--Botzmann equation in its linear and nonlinear
forms, and also beyond the mean field by means of Monte Carlo computer
simulation. The anisotropic shape of the particle has a strong effect on the
screened potential, even at large distances (compared to the Debye length) from
it. To quantify this anisotropy effect, we focus our study on the dependence of
the potential on the position of the observation point with respect with the
orientation of the spheroidal particle. For several different boundary
conditions (constant potential, or constant surface charge) we find that, at
large distance, the potential is higher in the direction of the large axis of
the spheroidal particle.
