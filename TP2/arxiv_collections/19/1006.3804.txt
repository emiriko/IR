The Standard Model of particle interactions is extended to include fermion
doublets (n,e)_R transforming under the gauge group SU(2)_R such that n is a
Dirac scotino (dark-matter fermion), with odd R parity. Based on recent CDMS
data, it is shown how this new dark left-right model (DLRM2) favors a Z' gauge
boson at around 1 or 2 TeV and be observable at the LHC. The new W_R gauge
bosons may also contribute significantly to lepton-flavor-changing processes
such as mu to e gamma and mu-e conversion in a nucleus or muonic atom.
