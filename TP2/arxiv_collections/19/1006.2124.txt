We investigate a class of near-extremal solutions of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar
theory with electric charge and power law scaling, dual to charged IR phases of
relativistic field theories at low temperature. These are exact solutions of
theories with domain wall vacua; hence, we use nonconformal holography to
relate the bulk and boundary theories. We numerically construct a global
interpolating solution between the IR charged solutions and the UV domain wall
vacua for arbitrary physical choices of Lagrangian parameters. By passing to a
conformal frame in which the domain wall metric becomes that of AdS, we uncover
a generalized scale invariance of the IR scaling solution, indicating a
connection to the physics of Lifshitz fixed points. Finally, guided by
effective field theoretic principles and the physics of nonconformal D-branes,
we argue for the applicability of domain wall holography even in theories with
AdS critical points, namely those theories for which a scalar potential is
dominated by a single exponential term over a large range.
