We investigate the dust associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) N49 in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as observed with the Herschel Space
Observatory. N49 is unusually bright because of an interaction with a molecular
cloud along its eastern edge. We have used PACS and SPIRE to measure the far IR
flux densities of the entire SNR and of a bright region on the eastern edge of
the SNR where the SNR shock is encountering the molecular cloud. Using these
fluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate the
dust mass associated with N49 to be about 10 Msun. The bulk of the dust in our
simple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 K, similar to that of
nearby molecular clouds. Unfortunately, as a result of the limited angular
resolution of Herschel at the wavelengths sampled with SPIRE, the uncertainties
are fairly large. Assuming this estimate of the dust mass associated with the
SNR is approximately correct, it is probable that most of the dust in the SNR
arises from regions where the shock speed is too low to produce significant
X-ray emission. The total amount of warm 50-60 K dust is ~0.1 or 0.4 Msun,
depending on whether the dust is modeled in terms of carbonaceous or silicate
grains. This provides a firm lower limit to the amount of shock heated dust in
N49.
