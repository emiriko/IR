The correlated metal UCoGe is a weak itinerant ferromagnet with a Curie
temperature T_C = 3 K and a superconductor with a transition temperature T_s =
0.6 K. We review its basic thermal, magnetic - on the macro and microscopic
scale - and transport properties, as well as the response to high pressure. The
data unambiguously show that superconductivity and ferromagnetism coexist below
T_s = 0.6 K and are carried by the same 5f electrons. We present evidence that
UCoGe is a p-wave superconductor and argue that superconductivity is mediated
by critical ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.
