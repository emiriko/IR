We investigate numerically the signatures of collective modes in the
tunneling spectra of superconductors. The larger strength of the signatures
observed in the high-Tc superconductors, as compared to classical low-Tc
materials, is explained by the low dimensionality of these layered compounds.
We also show that the strong-coupling structures are dips (zeros in the d2I/dV2
spectrum) in d-wave superconductors, rather than the steps (peaks in d2I/dV2)
observed in classical s-wave superconductors. Finally we question the
usefulness of effective density of states models for the analysis of tunneling
data in d-wave superconductors.
