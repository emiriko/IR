Mazin and Singh comment that the peaks in the Fourier-transformed
spectroscopic maps of Fe(Se,Te) are not related to the
quasi-particle-interference (QPI) but may be Bragg peaks associated with
chalcogen lattice and possible surface reconstruction which would be triggered
by surface-induced spin-density wave. We show that the peaks are too broad to
be assigned as Bragg peaks and are consistent with QPI.
