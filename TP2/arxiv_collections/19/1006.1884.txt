The main theme of this review is the many-body physics of vortices in quantum
droplets of bosons or fermions, in the limit of small particle numbers. Systems
of interest include cold atoms in traps as well as electrons confined in
quantum dots. When set to rotate, these in principle very different quantum
systems show remarkable analogies. The topics reviewed include the structure of
the finite rotating many-body state, universality of vortex formation and
localization of vortices in both bosonic and fermionic systems, and the
emergence of particle-vortex composites in the quantum Hall regime. An overview
of the computational many-body techniques sets focus on the configuration
interaction and density-functional methods. Studies of quantum droplets with
one or several particle components, where vortices as well as coreless vortices
may occur, are reviewed, and theoretical as well as experimental challenges are
discussed.
