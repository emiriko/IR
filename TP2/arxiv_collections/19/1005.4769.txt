Network tomography aims at inferring internal network characteristics based
on measurements at the edge of the network. In loss tomography, in particular,
the characteristic of interest is the loss rate of individual links and
multicast and/or unicast end-to-end probes are typically used. Independently,
recent advances in network coding have shown that there are advantages from
allowing intermediate nodes to process and combine, in addition to just
forward, packets. In this paper, we study the problem of loss tomography in
networks with network coding capabilities. We design a framework for estimating
link loss rates, which leverages network coding capabilities, and we show that
it improves several aspects of tomography including the identifiability of
links, the trade-off between estimation accuracy and bandwidth efficiency, and
the complexity of probe path selection. We discuss the cases of inferring link
loss rates in a tree topology and in a general topology. In the latter case,
the benefits of our approach are even more pronounced compared to standard
techniques, but we also face novel challenges, such as dealing with cycles and
multiple paths between sources and receivers. Overall, this work makes the
connection between active network tomography and network coding.
