Time-dependent transport through two capacitively coupled quantum dots is
studied in the framework of the generalized master equation. The Coulomb
interaction is included within the exact diagonalization method. Each dot is
connected to two leads at different times, such that a steady state is
established in one dot before the coupling of the other dot to its leads. By
appropriately tuning the bias windows on each dot we find that in the final
steady state the transport may be suppressed or enhanced. These two cases are
explained by the redistribution of charge on the many-body states built on both
dots. We also predict and analyze the transient mutual charge sensing of the
dots.
