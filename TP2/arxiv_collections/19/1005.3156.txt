We report the details of the construction and calibration of an ultra
sensitive surface rheometer, inspired by the setup described in [C.F. Brooks et
al Langmuir 15, 2450 (1999)], which makes use of high resolution video tracking
of the motion of a floating magnetized needle and is capable of measuring the
viscoelastic response of a Langmuir monolayer with an accuracy of 10^-5 N/m.
This instrument is then employed for the rheological characterization of a
Langmuir monolayer of a photosensitive azobenzene polymer, which can be brought
out of equilibrium by a suitable photoperturbation. The complex dynamic shear
modulus G= G' + i G" is measured as a function of temperature and illumination
power and wavelength. The reversible rheological ch anges induced in the film
by photo-perturbation are monitored during time, observing a transition from a
predominantly elastic (G' > G'') to a viscoelastic (G' \approx G'') regime.
These results are confirmed by comparison with independent measurements
performed by us using other rheological techniques. Finally a discussion is
made, taking into account the results of a recent x-ray photon correlation
spectroscopy experiment on the same polymer in equilibrium and out of
equilibrium.
