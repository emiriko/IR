Interference at the radio receiver is a key source of degradation in quality
of service of wireless communication systems. This paper presents a unified
framework for OFDM/FBMC interference characterization and analysis in
asynchronous environment. Multi-user interference is caused by the timing
synchronization errors which lead to the destruction of the orthogonality
between subcarriers. In this paper, we develop a theoretical analysis of the
asynchronous interference considering the multi-path effects on the
interference signal. We further propose an accurate model for interference that
provides a useful computational tool in order to evaluate the performance of an
OFDM/FBMC system in a frequency selective fading environment. Finally,
simulation results confirmed the accuracy of the proposed model.
