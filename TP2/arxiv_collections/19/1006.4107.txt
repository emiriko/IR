In this addendum of our paper [D. Burgarth and V. Giovannetti, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 99, 100501 (2007)] we prove that during the transformation that allows
one to enforce control by relaxation on a quantum system, the ancillary memory
can be kept at a finite size, independently from the fidelity one wants to
achieve. The result is obtained by introducing the quantum analog of
defragmentation algorithms which are employed for efficiently reorganizing
classical information in conventional hard-disks. Our result also implies that
the reduced dynamics in any noisy system can be simulated with finitely many
resources.
