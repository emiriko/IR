We construct and compare a variety of simple models for strange stars,
namely, hypothetical self-bound objects made of a cold stable version of the
quark-gluon plasma. Exact, quasi-exact and numerical models are examined to
find the most economical description for these objects. A simple and successful
parametrization of them is given in terms of the central density, and many
differences among the models are explicitly shown and discussed.
