Results from the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in p-p and Au+Au collisions are
reviewed from the perspective of measurements in p-p collisions at the CERN-ISR
which serve as a basis for many of the techniques used. Issues such as J/Psi
suppression and hydrodynamical flow in A+A collisions require data from
LHC-Ions for an improved understanding. Suppression of high pT particles in
Au+Au collisions, first observed at RHIC, also has unresolved mysteries such as
the equality of the suppression of inclusive pi0 (from light quarks and gluons)
and direct-single electrons (from the decay of heavy quarks) in the transverse
momentum range 4< pT < 9 GeV/c. This disfavors a radiative explanation of
suppression and leads to a fundamental question of whether the Higgs boson
gives mass to fermions. Observation of an exponential distribution of direct
photons in central Au+Au collisions for 1< pT <2 GeV/c where hard-processes are
negligible and with no similar exponential distribution in p-p collisions
indicates thermal photon emission from the medium at RHIC, making PHENIX at the
moment ``the hottest experiment in Physics''.
