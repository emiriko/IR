We report the realization of a novel degenerate Fermi mixture with an
SU(2)*SU(6) symmetry in a cold atomic gas. We successfully cool the mixture of
the two fermionic isotopes of ytterbium 171Yb with the nuclear spin I=1/2 and
173Yb with I=5/2 below the Fermi temperature T_ F as 0.46T_F for 171Yb and
0.54T_F for 173Yb. The same scattering lengths for different spin components
make this mixture featured with the novel SU(2)*SU(6) symmetry. The nuclear
spin components are separately imaged by exploiting an optical Stern-Gerlach
effect. In addition, the mixture is loaded into a 3D optical lattice to
implement the SU(2)*SU(6) Hubbard model. This mixture will open the door to the
study of novel quantum phases such as a spinor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like
fermionic superfluid.
