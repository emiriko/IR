It is shown that the method of infinitesimal generators ("Racah's method")
can be broadly and systematically formulated as a method applicable to the
calculation of reduced coupling coefficients for a generic subalgebra chain
G>H, provided the reduced matrix elements of the generators of G and the
recoupling coefficients of H are known. The calculation of SO(5)>SO(4) reduced
coupling coefficients is considered as an example, and a procedure for
transformation of reduced coupling coefficients between canonical and physical
subalegebra chains is presented. The problem of calculating coupling
coefficients for generic irreps of SO(5), reduced with respect to any of its
subalgebra chains, is completely resolved by this approach.
