We investigate a possible inner relation between the familiar
Bekenstein-Hawking area-entropy relation and ours presented in a simple $D_0$
brane gas model on the basis of the kinematical holographic relation [KHR] in
the Yang's quantized space-time algebra (YSTA). We find out that the relation
between them is well understood through the idea of an {\it elementary}
Schwarzschild black hole realized on a single $[site]$ of Planckian scale in
our scheme. Related arguments possibly explain the origin of a certain kind of
universality as seen in $\eta =1/4$ in the Bekenstein-Hawking relation and lead
us to notice the similarity between the effective mass of $D_0$ brane, $\mu_S,$
inside black holes and the Hawking radiation temperature, $T_{H.R.} ( = 1/(8\pi
M_S) )$, both inversely proportional to the black hole mass $M_S$ and having
almost the same order of magnitude. Motivated by this fact, we introduce in our
scheme an ansatz which enables us self-consistently to equate $\mu_S$ to
$T_{H.R.}$ and leads us to an area-entropy relation with $\eta$ slightly
shifted from $1/4.$
