We present preliminary results about the detection of high redshift (U)LIRGs
in the Bullet cluster field by the PACS and SPIRE instruments within the
Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS) Program. We describe in detail a photometric
procedure designed to recover robust fluxes and deblend faint Herschel sources
near the confusion noise. The method is based on the use of the positions of
Spitzer/MIPS 24 um sources as priors. Our catalogs are able to reliably (5
sigma) recover galaxies with fluxes above 6 and 10 mJy in the PACS 100 and 160
um channels, respectively, and 12 to 18 mJy in the SPIRE bands. We also obtain
spectral energy distributions covering the optical through the
far-infrared/millimeter spectral ranges of all the Herschel detected sources,
and analyze them to obtain independent estimations of the photometric redshift
based on either stellar population or dust emission models. We exemplify the
potential of the combined use of Spitzer position priors plus independent
optical and IR photometric redshifts to robustly assign optical/NIR
counterparts to the sources detected by Herschel and other (sub-)mm
instruments.
