Ionic crystals terminated at oppositely charged polar surfaces are inherently
unstable and expected to undergo surface reconstructions to maintain
electrostatic stability. Essentially, an electric field that arises between
oppositely charged atomic planes gives rise to a built-in potential that
diverges with thickness. In ultra thin film form however the polar crystals are
expected to remain stable without necessitating surface reconstructions, yet
the built-in potential has eluded observation. Here we present evidence of a
built-in potential across polar \lao ~thin films grown on \sto ~substrates, a
system well known for the electron gas that forms at the interface. By
performing electron tunneling measurements between the electron gas and a
metallic gate on \lao ~we measure a built-in electric field across \lao ~of 93
meV/\AA. Additionally, capacitance measurements reveal the presence of an
induced dipole moment near the interface in \sto, illuminating a unique
property of \sto ~substrates. We forsee use of the ionic built-in potential as
an additional tuning parameter in both existing and novel device architectures,
especially as atomic control of oxide interfaces gains widespread momentum.
