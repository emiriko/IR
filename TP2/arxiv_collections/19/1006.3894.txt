Hahn and Wallsten wrote that network neutrality "usually means that broadband
service providers charge consumers only once for Internet access, do not favor
one content provider over another, and do not charge content providers for
sending information over broadband lines to end users." In this paper we study
the implications of non-neutral behaviors under a simple model of linear
demand-response to usage-based prices. We take into account advertising
revenues and consider both cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios. In
particular, we model the impact of side-payments between service and content
providers. We also consider the effect of service discrimination by access
providers, as well as an extension of our model to non-monopolistic content
providers.
