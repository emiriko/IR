We consider the presence of oscillations in the primordial bispectrum,
inspired by three different cosmological models; features in the primordial
potential, resonant type non-Gaussianities and deviation from the standard
Bunch Davies vacuum. In order to put constraints on their bispectra, a logical
first step is to put these into factorized form which can be achieved via the
recently proposed method of polynomial basis expansion on the tetrahedral
domain. We investigate the viability of such an expansion for the oscillatory
bispectra and find that one needs an increasing number of orthonormal mode
functions to achieve significant correlation between the expansion and the
original spectrum as a function of their frequency. To reduce the number of
modes required, we propose a basis consisting of Fourier functions
orthonormalized on the tetrahedral domain. We show that the use of Fourier mode
functions instead of polynomial mode functions can lead to the necessary
factorizability with the use of only 1/5 of the total number of modes required
to reconstruct the bispectra with polynomial mode functions. Moreover, from an
observational perspective, the expansion has unique signatures depending on the
orientation of the oscillation due to a resonance effect between the mode
functions and the original spectrum. This effect opens the possibility to
extract informa- tion about both the frequency of the bispectrum as well as its
shape while considering only a limited number of modes. The resonance effect is
independent of the phase of the reconstructed bispectrum suggesting Fourier
mode extraction could be an efficient way to detect oscillatory bispectra in
the data.
