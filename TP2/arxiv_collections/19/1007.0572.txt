In this communication, we show that the residence time of a Brownian
particle, defined as the cumulative time spent in a given region of space, can
be optimized as a function of the diffusion coefficient. We discuss the
relevance of this effect to several schematic experimental situations,
classified in the nature -- random or deterministic -- both of the observation
time and of the starting position of the Brownian particle.
