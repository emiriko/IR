The dynamics of two penetrating superfluids exhibit an intriguing variety of
nonlinear effects. Using two distinguishable components of a Bose-Einstein
condensate, we investigate the counterflow of two superfluids in a narrow
channel. We present the first experimental observation of trains of dark-bright
solitons generated by the counterflow. Our observations are theoretically
interpreted by three-dimensional numerical simulations for the coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations and the analysis of a jump in the two
relatively flowing components' densities. Counterflow induced modulational
instability for this miscible system is identified as the central process in
the dynamics.
