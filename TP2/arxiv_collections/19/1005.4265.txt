This paper describes the use of fuzzy logic controller for efficiency
optimization control of a drive while keeping good dynamic response. At
steady-state light-load condition, the fuzzy controller adaptively adjusts the
excitation current with respect to the torque current to give the minimum total
copper and iron loss. The measured input power such that, for a given load
torque and speed, the drive settles down to the minimum input power, i.e.,
operates at maximum efficiency. The low-frequency pulsating torque due to
decrementation of flux is compensated in a feed forward manner. If the load
torque or speed commands changes, the efficiency search algorithm is abandoned
and the rated flux is established to get the best dynamic response. The drive
system with the proposed efficiency optimization controller has been simulated
with lossy models of converter and machine, and its performance has been
thoroughly investigated.
