PKS 0558-504 is the brightest radio-loud Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy at
X-ray energies. Here we present results from the radio, optical, UV, and X-ray
bands obtained with Swift, XMM, and ATCA during a 10-day monitoring campaign in
September 2008. The simultaneous coverage at several wavelengths makes it
possible to investigate in detail the broadband spectral energy distribution
(SED) and the energetic of this source. The main results can be summarized as
follows. The ATCA reveals the presence of an extended radio emission in PKS
0558-504 with two lobe-like structures at ~7" from the bright central source.
The extended radio structure and the low value of the radio-loudness similar to
radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies coupled with constraints from higher energy bands
argue against a jet-dominated emission. The study of the SED, which is
dominated by a nearly constant optical-UV emission, supports the conclusion
that PKS 0558-504 is accreting at super-Eddington rate. This conclusion was
reached assuming M_BH=2.5e8 M_sun, which was obtained with a new scaling method
based on X-ray spectral variability results. A comparison between the accretion
luminosity and the kinetic power associated with the jet suggests that in this
source the accretion power dominates in agreement with the results obtained
from Radiation-MHD simulations of Galactic black holes (GBHs) accreting at the
Eddington rate. The combined findings from this panchromatic investigation
strongly suggest that PKS 0558-504 is a large-scale analog of GBHs in their
highly accreting intermediate state. Importantly, PKS 0558-504 may also be the
prototype of the parent population of the very radio-loud NLS1s recently
detected at gamma-ray energies.
