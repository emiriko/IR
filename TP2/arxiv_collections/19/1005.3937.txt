Transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) has recently been introduced as a
spectroscopic tool for molecular junctions where it offers the possibility to
probe molecular level energies at relatively low bias voltages. In this work we
perform extensive ab-initio calculations of the non-linear current voltage
relations for a broad class of single-molecule transport junctions in order to
assess the applicability and limitations of TVS. We find, that in order to
fully utilize TVS as a quantitative spectroscopic tool, it is important to
consider asymmetries in the coupling of the molecule to the two electrodes.
When this is taken properly into account, the relation between the transition
voltage and the energy of the molecular orbital closest to the Fermi level
closely follows the trend expected from a simple, analytical model.
