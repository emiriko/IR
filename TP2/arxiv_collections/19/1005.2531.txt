The recently developed frequency extraction algorithm [G.R. Werner and J.R.
Cary, J. Comp. Phys. 227, 5200 (2008)] that enables a simple FDTD algorithm to
be transformed into an efficient eigenmode solver is applied to a realistic
accelerator cavity modeled with embedded boundaries and Richardson
extrapolation. Previously, the frequency extraction method was shown to be
capable of distinguishing M degenerate modes by running M different simulations
and to permit mode extraction with minimal post-processing effort that only
requires solving a small eigenvalue problem. Realistic calculations for an
accelerator cavity are presented in this work to establish the validity of the
method for realistic modeling scenarios and to illustrate the complexities of
the computational validation process. The method is found to be able to extract
the frequencies with error that is less than a part in 10^5. The corrected
experimental and computed values differ by about one parts in 10^$, which is
accounted for (in largest part) by machining errors. The extraction of
frequencies and modes from accelerator cavities provides engineers and
physicists an understanding of potential cavity performance as it depends on
shape without incurring manufacture and measurement costs.
