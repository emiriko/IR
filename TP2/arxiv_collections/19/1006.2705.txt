The channel capacity between two users is affected by relativistic effects.
Under the presence of a fixed noise at the receiver, there appears an asymmetry
between "slowly aging" and "fast aging" observers which can be used to have
private communication transmission. We discuss some models for users inside
gravitational wells and in the twin paradox scenario.
