Iris recognition technology, used to identify individuals by photographing
the iris of their eye, has become popular in security applications because of
its ease of use, accuracy, and safety in controlling access to high-security
areas. Fusion of multiple algorithms for biometric verification performance
improvement has received considerable attention. The proposed method combines
the zero-crossing 1 D wavelet Euler number, and genetic algorithm based for
feature extraction. The output from these three algorithms is normalized and
their score are fused to decide whether the user is genuine or imposter. This
new strategies is discussed in this paper, in order to compute a multimodal
combined score.
