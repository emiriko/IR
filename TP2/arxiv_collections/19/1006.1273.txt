In an attempt to classify all of the overlap-free morphisms constructively
using the Latin-square morphism, we came across an interesting counterexample,
the Leech square-free morphism. We generalize the combinatorial properties of
the Leech square-free morphism to gain insights on a larger class of both
overlap-free morphisms and square-free morphisms.
