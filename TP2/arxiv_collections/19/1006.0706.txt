We present decidability results for termination of classes of term rewriting
systems modulo permutative theories. Termination and innermost termination
modulo permutative theories are shown to be decidable for term rewrite systems
(TRS) whose right-hand side terms are restricted to be shallow (variables occur
at depth at most one) and linear (each variable occurs at most once). Innermost
termination modulo permutative theories is also shown to be decidable for
shallow TRS. We first show that a shallow TRS can be transformed into a flat
(only variables and constants occur at depth one) TRS while preserving
termination and innermost termination. The decidability results are then proved
by showing that (a) for right-flat right-linear (flat) TRS, non-termination
(respectively, innermost non-termination) implies non-termination starting from
flat terms, and (b) for right-flat TRS, the existence of non-terminating
derivations starting from a given term is decidable. On the negative side, we
show PSPACE-hardness of termination and innermost termination for shallow
right-linear TRS, and undecidability of termination for flat TRS.
