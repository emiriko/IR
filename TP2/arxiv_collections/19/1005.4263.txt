A facial recognition system is a computer application for automatically
identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a

features from the image and a facial database.It is typically used in security
systems and can be compared to other biometrics such as fingerprint or eye iris
recognition systems. In this paper we focus on 3-D facial recognition system
and biometric facial recognision system. We do critics on facial recognision
system giving effectiveness and weaknesses. This paper also introduces scope of
