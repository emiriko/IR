Using effective field theory (EFT) techniques we calculate the
next-to-leading order (NLO) spin-orbit contributions to the gravitational
potential of inspiralling compact binaries. We use the covariant spin
supplementarity condition (SSC), and explicitly prove the equivalence with
previous results by Faye et al. in arXiv:gr-qc/0605139. We also show that the
direct application of the Newton-Wigner SSC at the level of the action leads to
the correct dynamics using a canonical (Dirac) algebra. This paper then
completes the calculation of the necessary spin dynamics within the EFT
formalism that will be used in a separate paper to compute the spin
contributions to the energy flux and phase evolution to NLO.
