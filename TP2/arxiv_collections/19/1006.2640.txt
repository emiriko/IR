Comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin) was observed with the Japanese infrared satellite
AKARI in the near-infrared at a post-perihelion heliocentric distance of 1.7
AU. Observations were performed with the spectroscopic (2.5--5.0 micron) and
imaging (2.4, 3.2, and 4.1 micron) modes on 2009 March 30 and 31 UT,
respectively. AKARI images of the comet exhibit a sunward crescent-like shape
coma and a dust tail extended toward the anti-solar direction. The 4.1 micron
image (CO/CO2 and dust grains) shows a distribution different from the 2.4 and
3.2 micron images (H2O and dust grains). The observed spectrum shows distinct
bands at 2.66 and 4.26 micron, attributed to H2O and CO2, respectively. This is
the fifth comet in which CO2 has been directly detected in the near-infrared
spectrum. In addition, CO at 4.67 micron and a broad 3.2--3.6 micron emission
band from C-H bearing molecules were detected in the AKARI spectrum. The
relative abundance ratios CO2/H2O and CO/H2O derived from the molecular
production rates are \sim 4%--5% and < 2%, respectively. Comet Lulin belongs to
the group that has relatively low abundances of CO and CO2 among the comets
observed ever.
