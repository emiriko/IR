We present a compilation of properties of the 105,783 quasars in the SDSS
Data Release 7 (DR7) quasar catalog. In this value-added product, we compile
continuum and emission line measurements around the Halpha, Hbeta, MgII and CIV
regions, as well as other quantities such as radio properties, broad absorption
line quasar (BALQSO) flags, and disk emitters. We also compile virial black
hole mass estimates based on various calibrations. For the fiducial virial mass
estimates we use the Vestergaard & Peterson (VP06) calibrations for Hbeta and
CIV, and our own calibration for MgII which matches the VP06 Hbeta masses on
average. We describe the construction of this catalog, and discuss its
limitations. The catalog and its future updates will be made publicly available
online.
