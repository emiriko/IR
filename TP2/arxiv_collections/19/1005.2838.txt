We briefly comment on the quantum area spectra of black holes, paying
particular attention to the size of the spacing between adjacent spectral
levels. It has previously been conjectured that this spacing is uniform with a
universal value of $8\pi$ in Planck units. In spite of a recent claim to the
contrary, we argue that this particular value remains, by far, the most
qualified candidate for a universal area gap.
