We study a one-dimensional random walk with memory in which the step lengths
to the left and to the right evolve at each step in order to reduce the
wandering of the walker. The feedback is quite efficient and lead to a
non-diffusive walk. The time evolution of the displacement is given by an
equivalent Markovian dynamical process. The probability density for the
position of the walker is the same at any time as for a random walk with
shrinking steps, although the two-time correlation functions are quite
different.
