We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study effects of disorder on the
quantum phase transition occurring versus the ratio g=J/J' in square-lattice
dimerized S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets with intra- and inter-dimer
couplings J and J'. The dimers are either randomly distributed (as in the
classical dimer model), or come in parallel pairs with horizontal or vertical
orientation. In both cases the transition violates the Harris criterion,
according to which the correlation-length exponent should satisfy nu >= 1. We
do not detect any deviations from the three-dimensional O(3) universality class
obtaining in the absence of disorder (where nu = 0.71). We discuss special
circumstances which allow nu<1 for the type of disorder considered here.
