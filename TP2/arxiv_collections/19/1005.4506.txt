We present measurements of transmission and reflection spectra of a microwave
photonic crystal composed of 874 metallic cylinders arranged in a triangular
lattice. The spectra show clear evidence of a Dirac point, a characteristic of
a spectrum of relativistic massless fermions. In fact, Dirac points are a
peculiar property of the electronic band structure of graphene, whose
properties consequently can be described by the relativistic Dirac equation. In
the vicinity of the Dirac point, the measured reflection spectra resemble those
obtained by conductance measurements in scanning tunneling microscopy of
graphene flakes.
