We report multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) study of the
innermost jet of 3C 84. We carried out 14-epoch VLBI observations during
2006-2009 with the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN) and the VLBI Exploration of
Radio Astrometry (VERA), immediately following the radio outburst that began in
2005. Comparison between VLBI lightcurve and single-dish lightcurve indicates
that the outburst was associated with the central ~1 pc core. We found that
this outburst accompanied the emergence of a new component, and the projected
speed of this new component was 0:23c from 2007/297 (2007 October 24) to
2009/114 (2009 April 24). We argue the site of gamma-ray emission detected by
Fermi/LAT and jet kinematics in connection with gamma-ray emission mechanism.
