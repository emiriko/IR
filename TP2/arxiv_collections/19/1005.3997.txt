We study the three-dimensional bosonic t-J model, i.e., the t-J model of
"bosonic electrons" at finite temperatures. This model describes a system of
cold bosonic atoms with two species in an optical lattice. The model is derived
from the Hubbard model for very large on-site repulsive interaction between
bosons of same species (hard-core nature) and also strong correlations between
different species. The operator B_{x\sigma} for an atom at the site x with a
two-component (pseudo-) spin \sigma (=1,2) is treated as a hard-core boson
operator, and represented by a composite of two slave particles; a spinon
described by a CP^1 field (Schwinger boson) z_{x\sigma} and a holon described
by a hard-core-boson field \phi_x as B_{x\sigma}=\phi^\dag_x z_{x\sigma}.
\phi_x is then expressed by a pseudo-spin, which is, in turn, represented by
another CP^1 (pseudo) spinon w_{x\eta} as \phi_x = w_{x2}^\dag w_{x1}. We then
have a double-CP^1 representation of the model by z_{x\sigma} and w_{x\eta}. By
means of Monte Carlo simulations of this bosonic t-J model, we study its phase
structure and the possible phenomena like appearance of antiferromagnetic
long-range order, Bose-Einstein condensation, phase separation, etc. They
should be compared with the possible experimental results of a recently studied
boson-boson mixture like ^87Rb and ^41K in an optical lattice.
