High temperature superconductivity was achieved by introducing holes in a
parent compound consisting of copper oxide layers separated by spacer layers.
It is possible to dope some of the parent compounds with electrons, and their
physical properties are bearing some similarities but also significant
differences from the hole doped counterparts. Here, we use a recently developed
first principles method, to study the electron doped cuprates and elucidate the
deep physical reasons why their behavior is so different than the hole doped
materials. We find that electron doped compounds are Slater insulators, e.g. a
material where the insulating behavior is the result of the presence of
magnetic long range order. This is in sharp contrast with the hole doped
materials, where the parent compound is a Mott charge transfer insulator,
namely a material which is insulating due to the strong electronic correlations
but not due to the magnetic order.
