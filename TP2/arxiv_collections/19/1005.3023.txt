We present a pepper-pot design in which we address the problem of penetration
by high energy particle, deriving analytical expressions and performing GEANT4
simulations for the estimation of the error introduced by a long (thick)
pepper-pot. We also show that a careful design allows to measure the emittance
of electron beam of several hundred MeV and beyond.
