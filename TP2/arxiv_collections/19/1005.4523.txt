We prove that the Consani-Scholten quintic, a Calabi-Yau threefold over QQ,
is Hilbert modular. For this, we refine several techniques known from the
context of modular forms. Most notably, we extend the Faltings-Serre-Livne
method to induced four-dimensional Galois representations over QQ. We also need
a Sturm bound for Hilbert modular forms; this is developed in an appendix by
Jose Burgos Gil and the second author.
