Many small proteins fold via a first-order "all-or-none" transition directly
from an expanded coil to a compact native state. Here we study an analogous
direct freezing transition from an expanded coil to a compact crystallite for a
simple flexible homopolymer. Wang-Landau sampling is used to construct the 1D
density of states for square-well chains of length 128. Analysis within both
the micro-canonical and canonical ensembles shows that, for a chain with
sufficiently short-range interactions, the usual polymer collapse transition is
preempted by a direct freezing or "folding" transition. A 2D free-energy
landscape, built via subsequent multi-canonical sampling, reveals a dominant
folding pathway over a single free-energy barrier. This barrier separates a
high entropy ensemble of unfolded states from a low entropy set of crystallite
states and the transition proceeds via the formation of a transition-state
folding nucleus. Despite the non-unique homopolymer ground state, the
thermodynamics of this direct freezing transition are identical to the
thermodynamics of two-state protein folding. The model chain satisfies the
van't Hoff calorimetric criterion for two-state folding and an Arrhenius
analysis of the folding/unfolding free energy barrier yields a Chevron plot
characteristic of small proteins.
