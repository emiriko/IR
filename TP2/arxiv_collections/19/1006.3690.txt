We present an adaptive method for the automatic scaling of Random-Walk
Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, which quickly and robustly identifies the
scaling factor that yields a specified overall sampler acceptance probability.
Our method relies on the use of the Robbins-Monro search process, whose
performance is determined by an unknown steplength constant. We give a very
simple estimator of this constant for proposal distributions that are
univariate or multivariate normal, together with a sampling algorithm for
automating the method. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated with
both simulated and real data examples. This approach could be implemented as a
useful component in more complex adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms,
or as part of automated software packages.
