ZEUS inclusive diffractive cross-section measurements have been used in a
next-to-leading-order QCD analysis to extract the diffractive parton
distribution functions. Data on diffractive dijet production in deep inelastic
scattering have also been used to constrain the gluon density. Predictions
based on the extracted parton densities are able to describe measurements of
dijet photoproduction.
