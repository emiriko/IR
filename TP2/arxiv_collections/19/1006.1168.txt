We investigate two-dimensional invisibility cloaking via transformation
optics approach. The cloaking media possess much more singular parameters than
those having been considered for three-dimensional cloaking in literature.
Finite energy solutions for these cloaking devices are studied in appropriate
weighted Sobolev spaces. We derive some crucial properties of the singularly
weighted Sobolev spaces. The invisibility cloaking is then justified by
decoupling the underlying singular PDEs into one problem in the cloaked region
and the other one in the cloaking layer. We derive some completely novel
characterizations of the finite energy solutions corresponding to the singular
cloaking problems. Particularly, some `hidden' boundary conditions on the
cloaking interface are shown for the first time. We present our study for a
very general system of PDEs, where the Helmholtz equation underlying acoustic
cloaking is included as a special case.
