We show that non-linear optical structures involving a balanced gain-loss
profile, can act as unidirectional optical valves. This is made possible by
exploiting the interplay between the fundamental symmetries of parity (P) and
time (T), with optical nonlinear effects. This novel unidirectional dynamics is
specifically demonstrated for the case of an integrable PT-symmetric nonlinear
system.
