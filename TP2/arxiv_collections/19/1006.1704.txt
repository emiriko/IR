After Aceh's quake many earthquakes have struck Indonesia alternately and
even other disasters have been a threat for every citizen in this country.
Actually an everyday occurrence on earth and more than 3 million earthquakes
occur every year, about 8,000 a day, or one every 11 seconds in Indonesia there
are 5 to 30 quakes prediction everyday. Government's responsibility to protect
the citizen has been done by making National body of disaster management.
Preparing, saving and distribution logistic become National body of disaster
management's responsibility to build information management. Many law's
products have been produced as a government's responsibility to give secure
life for the citizen. We can not prevent them totally, we have to learn to live
with them and need to be prepared all the time, need to learn how to mitigate
risk of losses in such events by managing crisis and emergencies correctly.
After disaster happens respond must be rapidly and at an optimal level to save
lives and help to victims. DSS is information technology environment which can
be used to help human in order to learn from past earthquake, record it, learn
and plan for future mitigation and hope will reduce the disaster risk in the
future. Using web technology for DSS will give value added where not only make
a strategic decision for the decision maker, but for others who need national
