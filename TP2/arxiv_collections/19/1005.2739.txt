It is suggested that quantum mechanics is not fundamental but emerges from
classical information theory applied to causal horizons. The path integral
quantization and quantum randomness can be derived by considering information
loss of fields or particles crossing Rindler horizons for accelerating
observers. This implies that information is one of the fundamental roots of all
physical phenomena. The connection between this theory and Verlinde's entropic
gravity theory is also investigated.
