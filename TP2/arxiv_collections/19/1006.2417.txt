We discuss the possible influence of a cosmic magnetic field on the
macroscopic quantum tunneling process associated, in a cosmological context, to
the decay of the "false vacuum." We find a close analogy with the effects of an
external magnetic field applied to a Josephson junction in the context of
low-temperature/high-temperature superconducting devices.
