The r-mode instability in rotating compact stars is used to constrain the
phase of matter at high density. The color-flavor-locked phase with kaon
condensation (CFL-K0) and without (CFL) is considered in the temperature range
10^8K < T <10^{11} K. While the bulk viscosity in either phase is only
effective at damping the r-mode at temperatures T > 10^{11} K, the shear
viscosity in the CFL-K0 phase is the only effective damping agent all the way
down to temperatures T > 10^8 K characteristic of cooling neutron stars.
However, it cannot keep the star from becoming unstable to gravitational wave
emission for rotation frequencies f ~ 56-11 Hz at T ~ 10^8-10^9 K. Stars
composed almost entirely of CFL or CFL-K0 matter are ruled out by observation
of rapidly rotating neutron stars, indicating that dissipation at the
quark-hadron interface or nuclear crust interface must play a key role in
damping the instability.
