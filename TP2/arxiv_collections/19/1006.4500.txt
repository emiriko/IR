A few issues on gluon confinement are addressed with the help of a
renormalizable gauge model obtained by introducing a replica of the
Faddeev-Popov action and a soft breaking of the BRST symmetry. Confinement
turns out to be encoded in the spectral properties of the corresponding
correlation functions. While the propagators of the elementary fields have no
interpretation in terms of physical excitations, examples of local composite
operators whose two-point correlation functions possess a spectral
representation with positive spectral density can be introduced. These
composite operators turn out to be left invariant by the BRST transformations,
a feature which has strong consequences on their renormalizability properties.
Moreover, they display a direct interpretation in terms of i-particles [1],
which are the unphysical modes corresponding to a confining propagator of the
Gribov type. A possible way to take into account the effects of the Gribov
copies is also outlined.
