We describe a new scheme to interconvert stationary and photonic qubits which
is based on indirect qubit-light interactions mediated by a mechanical
resonator. This approach does not rely on the specific optical response of the
qubit and thereby enables optical quantum interfaces for a wide range of solid
state spin and charge based systems. We discuss the implementation of quantum
state transfer protocols between distant nodes of a large scale network and
evaluate the effect of the main noise sources on the resulting state transfer
fidelities. For the specific examples of electronic spin qubits and
superconducting charge qubits we show that high fidelity quantum communication
protocols can be implemented under realistic experimental conditions.
