We present a good description of recent experimental data on forward
di-hadron azimuthal correlations measured in deuteron-gold collisions at RHIC,
where monojet production has been observed. Our approach is based on the Color
Glass Condensate effective theory for the small-x degrees of freedom of the
nuclear wave function, including the use of non-linear evolution equations with
running QCD coupling. Our analysis provides further evidence for the presence
of saturation effects in RHIC data.
