We find the optimal scheme for quantum phase estimation in the presence of
loss when no a priori knowledge on the estimated phase is available. We prove
analytically an explicit lower bound on estimation uncertainty, which shows
that, as a function of number of probes, quantum precision enhancement amounts
at most to a constant factor improvement over classical strategies
