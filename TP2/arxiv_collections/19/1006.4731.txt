We review some of the features of the evolutions equations for transverse
momentum dependent parton distributions recently proposed by us. We briefly
describe the new ingredients entering the equations and their relationship with
ordinary evolution equations. We comment on possible choices for the initial
conditions and then show results for the evolved distributions obtained by
numerical implementation of the equations. By computing the average transverse
momentum at different scale we highlight some general properties of the
solutions.
