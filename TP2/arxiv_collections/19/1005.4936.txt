We show that the low-energy dynamics of anyons in (1+1)-dimensions with the
smallest number of derivatives and C, P and T symmetric interactions, are dual
to the sine-Gordon model for bosonic fields. We discuss in particular the
Tomonaga-Luttinger, Thirring and Schwinger models, as well as their deformation
by relevant and marginal operators. In the presence of electromagnetic
interactions, the mass of the meson from anyon confinement and the chiral
anomaly get corrected by the statistical parameter.
