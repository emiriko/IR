Two important features of TeV-scale radiative seesaw models, in which tiny
neutrino masses are generated at the quantum level, are an extended scalar
(Higgs) sector and the Majorana nature. We study phenomenological aspects of
these models at the ILC. It is found that the Majorana nature of the models can
be tested directly via the electron-positron and electron-electron collision
experiments.
