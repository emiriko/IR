We investigate the transmission and reflection survival probabilities for the
chaotic stadium billiard with two holes placed asymmetrically. Classically,
these distributions are shown to have algebraic or exponential decays depending
on the choice of injecting hole and exact expressions are given for the first
time and confirmed numerically. As there is no reported quantum theoretical or
experimental analogue we propose a model for experimental observation of the
asymmetric transport using semiconductor nano-structures and comment on the
relevant quantum time-scales.
