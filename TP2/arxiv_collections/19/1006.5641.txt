On the basis of the author's earlier results, a new source function for a
numerical wind-wave model optimized by the criterion of accuracy and speed of
calculation is substantiated. The proposed source function includes (a) an
optimized version of the discrete interaction approximation for parametrization
of the nonlinear evolution mechanism, (b) a generalized empirical form of the
input term modified by adding a special block of the dynamic boundary layer of
the atmosphere, and (c) a dissipation term quadratic in the wave spectrum.
Particular attention is given to a theoretical substantiation of the least
investigated dissipation term. The advantages of the proposed source function
are discussed by its comparison to the analogues used in the widespread models
of the third generation WAM and WAVEWATCH. At the initial stage of assessing
the merits of the proposed model, the results of its testing by the system of
academic tests are presented. In the course of testing, some principals of this
procedure are formulated. The possibility of using the testing results to study
the physics of evolution processes in wind waves is shown. It is noted that the
specially added block of the dynamic boundary layer of the atmosphere makes it
possible to give an exhaustive description of the air-sea-interface's
characteristics, which may be used to improve wave forecasting. This new
modeling quality allows us to make a statement about the construction of a
model of the next (fourth) generation.
