Monograph includes the results of the scientific work of the author for
approximately 10 years and it is dedicated to theoretical studies of the
structure of light atomic nuclei on the basis of potential cluster model with
the forbidden states. Are examined questions of the single-valued construction
of the intercluster potentials, which contain the forbidden states and
simultaneously applied in the continuous and discrete spectra for the light
nuclear systems with a mass of from 2 to 16. Is presented the mathematical
apparatus and some calculation methods, utilized in the cluster model. Many
questions, until now, considered here did not be reflected in the monographic
literature. The book can represent interest for the students of elder courses,
probationers, graduate students and scientific workers, who work in the field
of theoretical nuclear physics. This Book is written in Russian, but will
perhaps present certain interest.
