In this paper we propose an alternative approach for the assessment of
network vulnerability under random and intentional attacks as compared to the
results obtained from the "vulnerability function" given by Criado et al.
[Criado et al. (Int. J. Comput. Math., 86 (2) (2009), pp. 209-218)]. By using
spectral and statistical measurements, we assess robustness as the antonym to
vulnerability of complex networks and suggest a tentative ranking for
vulnerability, based on the interpretation of quantified network
characteristics. We conclude that vulnerability function, derived from the
network's degree distribution and its variations only, is not general enough to
reflect the lack of robustness due to the specific configurations in graphs
with hierarchical or centralized structures. The spectral and statistical
metrics, on the other hand, capture different aspects of network topology which
provide a more thorough assessment of network vulnerability.
