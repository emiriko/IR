Micro-Hall magnetometry is employed to study the magnetization dynamics of a
single, micron-size CrO$_2$ grain. With this technique we track the motion of a
single domain wall, which allows us to probe the distribution of imperfections
throughout the material. An external magnetic field along the grain's easy
magnetization direction induces magnetization reversal, giving rise to a series
of sharp jumps in magnetization. Supported by micromagnetic simulations, we
identify the transition to a state with a single cross-tie domain wall, where
pinning/depinning of the wall results in stochastic Barkhausen jumps.
