In this paper we study the factorization and resummation of s-channel single
top quark production in the Standard Model at both the Tevatron and the LHC. We
show that the production cross section in the threshold limit can be factorized
into a convolution of hard function, soft function and jet function via
soft-collinear-effective-theory (SCET), and resummation can be performed using
renormalization group equation in the momentum space resummation formalism. We
find that in general, the resummation effects enhance the Next-to-Leading-Order
(NLO) cross sections by about $3%-5%$ at both the Tevatron and the LHC, and
significantly reduce the factorization scale dependence of the total cross
section at the Tevatron, while at the LHC we find that the factorization scale
dependence has not been improved, compared with the NLO results.
