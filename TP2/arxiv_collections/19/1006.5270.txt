This paper proposes a simple setup for introducing an artificial magnetic
field for neutral atoms in 2D optical lattices. This setup is based on the
phenomenon of photon-assisted tunneling and involves a low-frequency periodic
driving of the optical lattice. This low-frequency driving does not affect the
electronic structure of the atom and can be easily realized by the same means
which employed to create the lattice. We also address the problem of detecting
this effective magnetic field. In particular, we study the center of mass
wave-packet dynamics, which is shown to exhibit certain features of cyclotron
dynamics of a classical charged particle.
