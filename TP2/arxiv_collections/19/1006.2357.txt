The linear sigma model with quarks at very low temperatures provides an
effective description for the thermodynamics of the strong interaction in cold
and dense matter, being especially useful at densities found in compact stars
and protoneutron star matter. Using the MSbar one-loop effective potential, we
compute quantities that are relevant in the process of nucleation of droplets
of quark matter in this scenario. In particular, we show that the model
predicts a surface tension of \Sigma ~ 5-15 MeV/fm^2, rendering nucleation of
quark matter possible during the early post-bounce stage of core collapse
supernovae. Including temperature effects and vacuum logarithmic corrections,
we find a clear competition between these features in characterizing the
dynamics of the chiral phase conversion, so that if the temperature is low
enough the consistent inclusion of vacuum corrections could help preventing the
nucleation of quark matter during the collapse process. We also discuss the
first interaction corrections that come about at two-loop order.
