Parametric resonances provide a mechanism by which particles can be created
just after inflation. Thus far, attention has focused on a single or many
inflaton fields coupled to a single scalar field. However, generically we
expect the inflaton to couple to many other relativistic degrees of freedom
present in the early universe. Using simulations in an expanding
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime, in this paper we show how
preheating is affected by the addition of multiple fields coupled to the
inflaton. We focus our attention on gravitational wave production--an important
potential observational signature of the preheating stage. We find that
preheating and its gravitational wave signature is robust to the coupling of
the inflaton to more matter fields.
