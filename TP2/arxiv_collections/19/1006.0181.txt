Fluctuations around a Bose-Einstein condensate can be described by means of
Bogolubov theory leading to the notion of quasiparticle and antiquasiparticle
familiar to non-relativistic condensed matter practitioners. On the other hand,
we already know that these perturbations evolve according to a relativistic
Klein-Gordon equation in the long wavelength approximation. For shorter
wavelengths, we show that this equation acquires nontrivial corrections which
modify the Klein-Gordon product. In this approach, quasiparticles can also be
defined (up to the standard ambiguities due to observer-dependence). We
demonstrate that---in the low as well as in the high energy regimes---both
concepts of quasiparticle are actually the same, regardless of the formalism
(Bogolubov or Klein-Gordon) used to describe them. These results also apply to
any barotropic, inviscid, irrotational fluid, with or without quantum
potential. Finally, we illustrate how the quantization of these systems of
quasiparticles proceeds by analyzing a stationary configuration containing an
acoustic horizon. We show that there are several possible choices of a regular
vacuum state, including a regular generalization of the Boulware vacuum. Issues
such us Hawking radiation crucially depend on this vacuum choice.
