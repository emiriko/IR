We consider the generation of fermion masses in an emergent model of
electroweak symmetry breaking with composite $W,Z$ gauge bosons. A universal
bulk fermion profile in a warped extra dimension is used for all fermion
flavors. Electroweak symmetry is broken at the UV (or Planck) scale where
boundary mass terms are added to generate the fermion flavor structure. This
leads to flavor-dependent nonuniversality in the gauge couplings. The effects
are suppressed for the light fermion generations but are enhanced for the top
quark where the $Zt{\bar t}$ and $Wt{\bar b}$ couplings can deviate at the
$10-20%$ level in the minimal setup. By the AdS/CFT correspondence our model
implies that electroweak symmetry is not a fundamental gauge symmetry. Instead
the Standard Model with massive fermions and $W,Z$ gauge bosons is an effective
chiral Lagrangian for some underlying confining strong dynamics at the TeV
scale, where mass is generated without a Higgs mechanism.
