A new method of antenna radiation pattern reconstruction using Chebyshev
polynomials was presented in this paper. The analysis starts from the data
measured in the frequency domain, and it corresponds to a direct propagating
between two antennas and reflected propagating waves from the copper plate. The
accuracy of this technique is evaluated at the frequency of 3.35GHz by the
anechoic conditions. As a result, the Chebyshev method shows us a good
performance in the E-plane in the range of -70{\deg} ~0{\deg}.
