We provide electrical circuit descriptions for bulk plasmons, single surface
plasmons, and parallel-plate plasmons. Simple circuits can reproduce the
exactly known frequency versus wave-vector dispersion relations for all these
cases, with reasonable accuracy. The circuit paradigm directly provides a
characteristic wave-impedance, Zo, that is rarely discussed in the context of
plasmonics. The case of a single-surface-plasmon is particularly interesting
since it can be modeled as a transmission line, even though there is no return
current conductor. The capacitance/unit length and the Faraday inductance/unit
length, of a flat metal surface, are C'=2epsilon_okW, and L'=epsilon_o/2kW
respectively, (where k is wave-vector, and W is the width of the flat metal
surface). We believe that many other metal-optic geometries can be described
within the circuit paradigm, with the prerequisite that the distributed
capacitance and inductance must be calculated for each particular geometry
