The combination of low-temperature specific-heat and
nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) measurements reveals important information of
the ground-state properties of CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$, which has been proposed as a
rare example of a tetragonal Kondo-insulator (KI). The NMR
spin-latticerelaxation rate $1/T_1$ deviates from the Korringa law below 100 K
signaling the onset of an energy gap $\Delta E_g1/k_B \simeq 30$K. This gap is
stable against magnetic fields up to 10 T. Below 10 K, however, unusual
low-energy excitations of in-gap states are observed, which depend strongly on
the field H. The specific heat C detects these excitations in the form of an
enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma = C(T)/T$ : In zero field, $\gamma$
increases steeply below 5 K, reaching a maximum at 0.1 K, and then saturates at
$\gamma = 0.6$ J/molK$^2$. This maximum is shifted to higher temperatures with
increasing field suggesting a residual density of states at the Fermi level
developing a spin gap $\Delta E_g2$. A simple model, based on two narrow
quasiparticle bands located at the Fermi level - which cross the Fermi level in
zero field at 0.022 states/meV f.u. - can account qualitatively as well as
quantitatively for the measured observables. In particular, it is demonstrated
that fitting our data of both specific heat and NMR to the model, incorporating
a Ce magnetic moment of $\mu = \Delta E_g1/\mu_{0H} \simeq 1 \mu_B$, leads to
the prediction of the field dependence of the gap. Our measurements rule out
the presence of a quantum critical point as the origin for the enhanced
$\gamma$ in CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ and suggest that this arises rather from correlated,
residual in-gap states at the Fermi level. This work provides a fundamental
route for future investigations into the phenomenon of narrow-gap formation in
the strongly correlated class of system
