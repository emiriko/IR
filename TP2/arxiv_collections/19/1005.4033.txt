We present a near-linear time algorithm that approximates the edit distance
between two strings within a polylogarithmic factor; specifically, for strings
of length n and every fixed epsilon>0, it can compute a (log n)^O(1/epsilon)
approximation in n^(1+epsilon) time. This is an exponential improvement over
the previously known factor, 2^(O (sqrt(log n))), with a comparable running
time (Ostrovsky and Rabani J.ACM 2007; Andoni and Onak STOC 2009). Previously,
no efficient polylogarithmic approximation algorithm was known for any
computational task involving edit distance (e.g., nearest neighbor search or
sketching).
  This result arises naturally in the study of a new asymmetric query model. In
this model, the input consists of two strings x and y, and an algorithm can
access y in an unrestricted manner, while being charged for querying every
symbol of x. Indeed, we obtain our main result by designing an algorithm that
makes a small number of queries in this model. We then provide a
nearly-matching lower bound on the number of queries.
  Our lower bound is the first to expose hardness of edit distance stemming
from the input strings being "repetitive", which means that many of their
substrings are approximately identical. Consequently, our lower bound provides
the first rigorous separation between edit distance and Ulam distance, which is
edit distance on non-repetitive strings, such as permutations.
