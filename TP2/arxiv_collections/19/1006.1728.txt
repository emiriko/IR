A corpuscular simulation model of optical phenomena that does not require the
knowledge of the solution of a wave equation of the whole system and reproduces
the results of Maxwell's theory by generating detection events one-by-one is
presented. The event-based corpuscular model is shown to give a unified
description of multiple-beam fringes of a plane parallel plate, single-photon
Mach-Zehnder interferometer, Wheeler's delayed choice, photon tunneling,
quantum erasers, two-beam interference, double-slit, and
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm and Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiments.
