A number of new and planned radio telescopes will consist of large arrays of
low-gain antennas operating at frequencies below 300 MHz. In this frequency
regime, Galactic noise can be a significant or dominant contribution to the
total noise. This, combined with mutual coupling between antennas, makes it
difficult to predict the sensitivity of these instruments. This paper describes
a system model and procedure for estimating the system equivalent flux density
(SEFD) - a useful and meaningful metric of the sensitivity of a radio telescope
- that accounts for these issues. The method is applied to LWA-1, the first
"station" of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) interferometer. LWA-1 consists of
512 bowtie-type antennas within a 110 x 100 m elliptical footprint, and is
designed to operate between 10 MHz and 88 MHz using receivers having noise
temperature of about 250 K. It is shown that the correlation of Galactic noise
between antennas significantly desensitizes the array for beam pointings which
are not close to the zenith. It is also shown that considerable improvement is
possible using beamforming coefficients which are designed to optimize
signal-to-noise ratio under these conditions. Mutual coupling is found to play
a significant role, but does not have a consistently positive or negative
influence. In particular, we demonstrate that pattern multiplication (assuming
the behavior of single antennas embedded in the array is the same as those same
antennas by themselves) does not generate reliable estimates of SEFD.
