The bosonic f(R) gravity function is derived from a chiral F(R) supergravity
model for the first time. We find an existence of the upper limit (or AdS
bound) on the scalar curvature, as well as a solution with a vanishing
cosmological constant. We compare our simple model of F(R) supergravity to the
well known Starobinsky model of chaotic inflation.
