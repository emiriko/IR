The gauge symmetry breaking in 3-3-1 models can be implemented dynamically
because at the scale of a few TeVs the U(1)_X coupling constant becomes strong.
The exotic quark T introduced in the model will form a condensate breaking
SU(3)_L x U(1)_X to electroweak symmetry. In this work we explore the full
realization of the dynamical symmetry breaking of an 3-3-1 model to U(1)_{em}
considering a model based on SU(2)_TC x SU(3)_L x U(1)_X. We compute the mass
generated for the charged and neutral gauge bosons of the model that result
from the symmetry breaking, and verify the equivalence between a 3-3-1 model
with a scalar content formed by the set of the fundamental scalar bosons (chi),
(rho) and (eta) with a 3-3-1 model where the dynamical symmetry breaking is
implanted by the system formed by the set of composite bosons (Phi_T),
(Phi_TC(1)) and (Phi_TC(2)). In this model the minimal composite scalar content
is fixed by the condition of the cancellation of triangular anomaly in TC
sector.
