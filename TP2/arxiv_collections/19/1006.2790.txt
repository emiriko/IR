The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity in insulator systems
with a Coulomb gap in the density of states is expressed by a very simple
function which coincides with the Efros-Shklovskii T^(-1/2)result, at
temperatures lower than some value Tlim. Above this limit it consists of the
product of the Mott T^(-1/4) exponential with another one like a simply
thermally activation process. It fits well several experimental results
reported as having a crossover between the Efros-Shklovskii and Mott regimes,
and allows the determination of the gap parameters even in experiments that do
not reach the T^(-1/2) regime. Also it accounts for some experimental results
reported to follow a T^(-n) behavior with 0.5<n<1.
