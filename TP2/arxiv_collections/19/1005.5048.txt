We study the isochronicity of centers at $O\in \mathbb{R}^2$ for systems
$$\dot x=-y+A(x,y),\;\dot y=x+B(x,y),$$ where $A,\;B\in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$, which
can be reduced to the Li\'enard type equation. When $deg(A)\leq 4$ and $deg(B)
\leq 4$, using the so-called C-algorithm we found $36$ new families of
isochronous centers. When the Urabe function $h=0$ we provide an explicit
general formula for linearization. This paper is a direct continuation of
\cite{BoussaadaChouikhaStrelcyn2010} but can be read independantly.
