The issue of the influence of coronal holes (CHs) on coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) in causing solar energetic particle (SEP) events is revisited. It is a
continuation and extension of our previous work (Shen et al., 2006), in which
no evident effect of CHs on CMEs in generating SEPs were found by statistically
investigating 56 CME events. This result is consistent with the conclusion
obtained by Kahler in 2004. In this paper, we extrapolate the coronal magnetic
field, define CHs as the regions consisting of only open magnetic field lines
and perform a similar analysis on this issue for totally 76 events by extending
the study interval to the end of 2008. Three key parameters, CH proximity, CH
area and CH relative position, are involved in the analysis. The new result
confirms the previous conclusion that CHs did not show any evident effect on
CMEs in causing SEP events.
