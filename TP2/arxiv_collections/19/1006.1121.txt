We present a family of loss-tolerant quantum strong coin flipping protocols;
each protocol differing in the number of qubits employed. For a single qubit we
obtain a bias of 0.4, reproducing the result of Berl\'{i}n et al. [Phys. Rev. A
80, 062321 (2009)], while for two qubits we obtain a bias of 0.3975. Numerical
evidence based on semi-definite programming indicates that the bias continues
to decrease as the number of qubits is increased but at a rapidly decreasing
rate.
