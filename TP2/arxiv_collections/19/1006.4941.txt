Error-correction process has to be carried out periodically to prevent
accumulation of errors in fault-tolerant quantum computation. It is believed
that the best choice to get maximum threshold value is carrying out an
error-correction process after each quantum gate operation. Result of this note
shows that the optimal error-correction period depends on the value of k which
is the level number of concatenated quantum error-correction code.
