The standard procedure to determine (analytically) the values of the quark
masses is to relate QCD two-point functions to experimental data in the
framework of QCD sum rules. In the case of the light quark sector, the ideal
Green function is the pseudoscalar correlator which involves the quark masses
as an overall multiplicative factor. For the past thirty years this method has
been affected by systematic uncertainties originating in the hadronic resonance
sector, thus limiting the accuracy of the results. Recently, a major
breakthrough has been made allowing for a considerable reduction of these
systematic uncertainties and leading to light quark masses accurate to better
than 8%. This procedure will be described in this talk for the up-, down-,
strange-quark masses, after a general introduction to the method of QCD sum
rules.
