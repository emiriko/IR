We study the behavior of energy levels in two dimensions for exotic atoms,
i.e., when a long-range attractive potential is supplemented by a short-range
interaction, and compare the results with these of the one- and
three-dimensional cases. The energy shifts are well reproduced by a scattering
length formula $ \delta{E}= A_0^2/\ln (a/R)$, where $a$ is the scattering
length in the short-range potential, $A_0^2/(2\,\pi)$ the square of the wave
function at the origin in the external potential, and $R$ is related to the
derivative with respect to the energy of the solution that is regular at large
distances.
