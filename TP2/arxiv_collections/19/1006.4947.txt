In the book the mathematical methods of nuclear cross sections and phases of
elastic scattering, energy and characteristics of bound states in two- and
three-particle nuclear systems, when the potentials of interaction contain not
only central, but also tensor component, are presented. Are given the
descriptions of the mathematical numerical calculation methods and computer
programs in the algorithmic language "BASIC" for "Turbo Basic" of firm
"Borland" for the computers of the type IBM PC AT. For the numerical solutions
of the initial Schroedinger equations are used finite- difference and
variational methods, and also method of Runge-Kutta with the automatic calling
sequence on the assigned accuracy of results for the scattering phase shifts
and binding energy. Is given the description not of the standard methods of
solving the system of equations of Schroedinger to the bound states and the
alternative to Schmidt's method, method of solution of the generalized matrix
problem at the eigenvalues. The developed programs make it possible to
determine the wave functions of relative motion of nuclear fragments,
calibrated to the correct asymptotic behavior taking into account Coulomb
interaction. The programs of the extraction of nuclear phases (phase shift
analysis) from the differential elastic cross sections are given. The book can
be used as the textbook according to the numerical mathematical methods for the
students and the graduate students of the physical and mathematical specialties
of higher educational institutions. This Book is written in Russian, but will
perhaps present certain interest.
