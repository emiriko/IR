We study the Q^2-evolution of the form factors (FFs) for the
nucleon-to-N(1680) transition in the framework of an effective field theory. To
this end, the intrinsic symmetries of the spin-5/2 Rarita-Schwinger (RS) fields
are analyzed, and a Lagrangian of the electromagnetic N-N(1680) interactions is
constructed. The Lagrangian preserves all the intrinsic symmetries of the
spin-5/2 field--point and gauge invariance--and does not involve lower-spin
components of the reducible RS field. Besides, the symmetries postulate the
definitions of the Lagrangian FFs. These FFs are modeled as dispersionlike
expansions in a vector-meson--dominance model. A good agreement with the
experimental data is achieved.
