Excitation functions of elastic and inelastic 7Be+p scattering were measured
in the energy range between 1.6 and 2.8 MeV in the c.m. An R-matrix analysis of
the excitation functions provides strong evidence for new positive parity
states in 8B. A new 2+ state at an excitation energy of 2.55 MeV was observed
and a new 0+ state at 1.9 MeV is tentatively suggested. The R-matrix and Time
Dependent Continuum Shell Model were used in the analysis of the excitation
functions. The new results are compared to the calculations of contemporary
theoretical models.
