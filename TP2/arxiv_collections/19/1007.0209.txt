The UV spectra of nova-like variables are dominated by emission from the
accretion disk, modified by scattering in a wind emanating from the disk. Here
we model the spectra of RW Tri and UX UMa, the only two eclipsing nova-likes
which have been observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in the
far-ultraviolet, in an attempt to constrain the geometry and the ionization
structure of their winds. Using our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code we
computed spectra for simply-parameterized axisymmetric biconical outflow models
and were able to find plausible models for both systems. These reproduce the
primary UV resonance lines - N V, Si IV, and C IV - in the observed spectra in
and out of eclipse. The distribution of these ions in the wind models is
similar in both cases as is the extent of the primary scattering regions in
which these lines are formed. The inferred mass loss rates are 6% to 8% of the
mass accretion rates for the systems. We discuss the implication of our point
models for our understanding of accretion disk winds in cataclysmic variables.
