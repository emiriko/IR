Time- and spatially-resolved Faraday rotation spectroscopy is used to measure
the magnitude and direction of the momentum-dependent spin splitting in
strained InGaAs epilayers. The epilayers are lattice-matched to the GaAs
substrate and designed to reduce inhomogeneous effects related to strain
relaxation. Measurements of momentum-dependent spin splitting as a function of
electron spin drift velocity along [100], [010], [110] and [1$\overline{1}$0]
directions enable separation of isotropic and anisotropic effective magnetic
fields that arise from uniaxial and biaxial strain along $\langle$110$\rangle$.
We relate our findings to previous measurements and theoretical predictions of
spin splitting for inversion symmetry breaking in bulk strained semiconductors.
