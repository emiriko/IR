We use data mining techniques for finding 82 previously unreported common
proper motion pairs from the PPM-Extended catalogue. Special-purpose software
automating the different phases of the process has been developed. The software
simplifies the detection of the new pairs by integrating a set of basic
operations over catalogues. The operations can be combined by the user in
scripts representing different filtering criteria. This procedure facilitates
testing the software and employing the same scripts for different projects.
