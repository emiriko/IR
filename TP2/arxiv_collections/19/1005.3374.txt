We study the performance of common quantum stabilizer codes in the presence
of asymmetric and correlated errors. Specifically, we consider the depolarizing
noisy quantum memory channel and perform quantum error correction via the five
and seven-qubit stabilizer codes. We characterize these codes by means of the
entanglement fidelity as function of the error probability and the degree of
memory. We show that their performances are lowered by the presence of
correlations and we compute the error probability threshold values for codes
effectiveness. Furthermore, we uncover that the asymmetry in the error
probabilities does not affect the performance of the five-qubit code while it
does affect the performance of the seven-qubit code which results less
effective when considering correlated and symmetric depolarizing errors but
more effective for correlated and asymmetric errors.
