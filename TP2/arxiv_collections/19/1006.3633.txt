We propose to implement the Jaynes-Cummings model by coupling a
few-micrometer large atomic ensemble to a quantized cavity mode and classical
laser fields. A two-photon transition resonantly couples the single-atom ground
state |g> to a Rydberg state |e> via a non-resonant intermediate state |i>, but
due to the interaction between Rydberg atoms only a single atom can be
resonantly excited in the ensemble. This restricts the state space of the
ensemble to the collective ground state |G> and the collectively excited state
|E> with a single Rydberg excitation distributed evenly on all atoms. The
collectively enhanced coupling of all atoms to the cavity field with coherent
coupling strengths which are much larger than the decay rates in the system
leads to the strong coupling regime of the resulting effective Jaynes-Cummings
model. We use numerical simulations to show that the cavity transmission can be
used to reveal detailed properties of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder of excited
states, and that the atomic nonlinearity gives rise to highly non-trivial
photon emission from the cavity. Finally, we suggest that the absence of
interactions between remote Rydberg atoms may, due to a combinatorial effect,
induce a cavity-assisted excitation blockade whose range is larger than the
typical Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction length.
