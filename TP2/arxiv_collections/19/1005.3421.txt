We consider a temporal version of the CHSH scenario using projective
measurements on a single quantum system. It is known that quantum correlations
in this scenario are fundamentally more general than correlations obtainable
with the assumptions of macroscopic realism and non-invasive measurements. In
this work, we also educe some fundamental limitations of these quantum
correlations. One result is that a set of correlators can appear in the
temporal CHSH scenario if and only if it can appear in the usual spatial CHSH
scenario. In particular, we derive the validity of the Tsirelson bound and the
impossibility of PR-box behavior. The strength of possible signaling also turns
out to be surprisingly limited, giving a maximal communication capacity of
approximately 0.32 bits. We also find a temporal version of Hardy's nonlocality
paradox with a maximal quantum value of 1/4.
