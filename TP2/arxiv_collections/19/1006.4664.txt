Thin films of (1-x)BiFeO<sub>3</sub>-xPbTiO<sub>3</sub> (BF-xPT) with x ~
0.60 were fabricated on Pt/Si substrates by chemical solution deposition of
precursor BF and PT layers alternately in three different multilayer
configurations. These multilayer deposited precursor films upon annealing at
700{\deg}C in nitrogen show pure perovskite phase formation. In contrast to the
equilibrium tetragonal structure for the overall molar composition of
BF:PT::40:60, we find monoclinic structured BF-xPT phase of M<sub>A</sub> type.
Piezo-force microscopy confirmed ferroelectric switching in the films and
revealed different normal and lateral domain distributions in the samples. Room
temperature electrical measurements show good quality ferroelectric hysteresis
loops with remanent polarization, Pr, of up to 18 {\mu}C/cm<sup>2</sup> and
leakage currents as low as 10<sup>-7</sup> A/cm<sup>2</sup>.
