This work is a continuation of studies presented in the papers
arXiv:0911.5597, arXiv:1003.4523. In the work it is demonstrated that with the
use of one and the same parameter deformation may be described for several
cases of the General Relativity within the scope of both the Generalized
Uncertainty Principle (UV-cutoff) and the Extended Uncertainty Principle
(IR-cutoff). All these cases have a common thermodynamic interpretation of the
corresponding gravitational equations. Consideration is given to the
possibility for extension of the obtained results to more general cases.
Possible generalization of the uncertainty relation for the pair (cosmological
constant, "space-time volume"), where the cosmological constant is regarded as
a dynamic quantity at high and low energies is analyzed.
