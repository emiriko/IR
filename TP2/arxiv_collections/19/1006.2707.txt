WASP-33 is a fast rotating, main sequence star which hosts a hot Jupiter
moving along a retrograde and almost polar orbit with semi-major axis a = 0.02
au and eccentricity provisionally set to e = 0. The quadrupole mass moment J_2
and the proper angular momentum S of the star are 1900 and 400 times,
respectively, larger than those of the Sun. Thus, huge classical and
relativistic non-Keplerian orbital effects should take place in such a system.
In this paper we investigate the perspectives in detecting them (Abridged)
