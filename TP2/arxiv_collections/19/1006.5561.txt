Recursive domain equations have natural solutions. In particular there are
domains defined by strictly positive induction. The class of countably based
domains gives a computability theory for possibly non-countably based
topological spaces. A $ qcb_{0} $ space is a topological space characterized by
its strong representability over domains. In this paper, we study strictly
positive inductive definitions for $ qcb_{0} $ spaces by means of domain
representations, i.e. we show that there exists a canonical fixed point of
every strictly positive operation on $qcb_{0} $ spaces.
