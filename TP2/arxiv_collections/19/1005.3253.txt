We present Suzaku observations of five hard X-ray selected nearby Seyfert 2
galaxies. All the sources were clearly detected with the pin Hard X-ray
Detector up to several tens of keV, allowing for a fairly good characterization
of the broad-band X-ray continuum. We find that a unique model, even including
multiple components, fails to represent the spectra of all the sources. Heavy
obscuration manifests itself in different flavours. For two sources there is
evidence for a reflection dominated continuum; among the other three, one is
"mildly" Compton thick (N_H ~ 10^24 cm-2), while the remaining two are heavily
obscured (N_H ~ 10^23.5 cm-2), but Compton thin. Strong, narrow, iron Kalpha
lines (EW ~ 1-2 keV) due to neutral or mildly ionized gas, are detected in
Compton thick AGN. In all of them the Kalpha line is accompanied by the Kbeta.
The intensity and shape of the soft X-ray spectrum are different from object to
object. Soft X--rays may originate from a nuclear component scattered off, or
leaking through, the X-ray absorber, plus thermal X-rays from the host galaxy.
Emission from circumnuclear gas photoionized by the active nucleus,
parameterized with a power law plus individual narrow Gaussian lines, also
provides an acceptable description of the soft X-ray spectra. The limited
Suzaku XIS CCD energy resolution does not allow us to draw firm conclusions on
the origin of the soft X--ray emission. We briefly discuss our findings in the
light of AGN Unified model and the geometry of the obscuring gas.
