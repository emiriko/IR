This paper is largely concerned with constructing coarse moduli spaces for
Artin stacks. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of
stability on an arbitrary Artin stack and construct a coarse moduli space for
the open substack of stable points. Also, we present an application to coherent
cohomology of Artin stacks.
