We use the recently introduced U(N) framework for loop quantum gravity to
study the dynamics of spin network states on the simplest class of graphs: two
vertices linked with an arbitrary number N of edges. Such graphs represent two
regions, in and out, separated by a boundary surface. We study the algebraic
structure of the Hilbert space of spin networks from the U(N) perspective. In
particular, we describe the algebra of operators acting on that space and
discuss their relation to the standard holonomy operator of loop quantum
gravity. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to make the restriction to
the isotropic/homogeneous sector of the model by imposing the invariance under
a global U(N) symmetry. We then propose a U(N) invariant Hamiltonian operator
and study the induced dynamics. Finally, we explore the analogies between this
model and loop quantum cosmology and sketch some possible generalizations of
it.
