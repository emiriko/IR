The present-day Universe appears to be homogeneous on very large scales. Yet
when the casual structure of the early Universe is considered, it becomes
apparent that the early Universe must have been highly inhomogeneous. The
current paradigm attempts to answer this problem by postulating the inflation
mechanism However, inflation in order to start requires a homogeneous patch of
at least the horizon size. This paper examines if dynamical processes of the
early Universe could lead to homogenization. In the past similar studies seem
to imply that the set of initial conditions that leads to homogenization is of
measure zero. This essay proves contrary: a set of initial conditions for
spontaneous homogenization of cosmological models can form a set of non-zero
measure.
