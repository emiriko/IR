The coefficients of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials $P_{v,w}(q)$ are
nonnegative integers that are upper semicontinuous on Bruhat order.
Conjecturally, the same properties hold for $h$-polynomials $H_{v,w}(q)$ of
local rings of Schubert varieties. This suggests a parallel between the two
families of polynomials. We prove our conjectures for Grassmannians, and more
generally, covexillary Schubert varieties in complete flag varieties, by
deriving a combinatorial formula for $H_{v,w}(q)$. We introduce \emph{drift
configurations} to formulate a new and compatible combinatorial rule for
$P_{v,w}(q)$. From our rules we deduce, for these cases, the coefficient-wise
inequality $P_{v,w}(q)\preceq H_{v,w}(q)$.
