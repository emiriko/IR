For quantum systems that are weakly coupled to a much 'bigger' environment,
thermalization of possibly far from equilibrium initial ensembles is
demonstrated: for sufficiently large times, the ensemble is for all practical
purposes indistinguishable from a canonical density operator under conditions
that are satisfied under many, if not all, experimentally realistic conditions.
