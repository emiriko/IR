It is argued that the Strong Free Will Theorem (Conway-Kochen) does not prove
nonlocal determinism wrong. This is done by the before-before (Suarez-Scarani)
experiment, which is used here to prove the following General Free Will
Theorem: If humans have a certain amount of free will, there are other free
beings outside space-time producing nonlocal effects in our world, which are
both random and lawful.
