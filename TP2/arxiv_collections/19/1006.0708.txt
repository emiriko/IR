The Blume-Capel model with infinite-range interactions presents analytical
solutions in both canonical and microcanonical ensembles and therefore, its
phase diagram is known in both ensembles. This model exhibits nonequivalent
solutions and the microcanonical thermodynamical features present peculiar
behaviors like nonconcave entropy, negative specific heat, and a jump in the
thermodynamical temperature. Examples of nonequivalent ensembles are in general
related to systems with long-range interactions that undergo canonical
first-order phase transitions. Recently, the extended gaussian ensemble (EGE)
solution was obtained for this model. The gaussian ensemble and its extended
version can be considered as a regularization of the microcanonical ensemble.
They are known to play the role of an interpolating ensemble between the
microcanonical and the canonical ones. Here, we explicitly show how the
microcanonical energy equilibrium states related to the metastable and unstable
canonical solutions for the Blume-Capel model are recovered from EGE, which
presents a concave "extended" entropy as a function of energy.
