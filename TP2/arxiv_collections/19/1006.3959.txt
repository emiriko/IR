Inspired by biological communication systems, molecular communication has
been proposed as a viable scheme to communicate between nano-sized devices
separated by a very short distance. Here, molecules are released by the
transmitter into the medium, which are then sensed by the receiver. This paper
develops a preliminary version of such a communication system focusing on the
release of either one or two molecules into a fluid medium with drift. We
analyze the mutual information between transmitter and the receiver when
information is encoded in the time of release of the molecule. Simplifying
assumptions are required in order to calculate the mutual information, and
theoretical results are provided to show that these calculations are upper
bounds on the true mutual information. Furthermore, optimized degree
distributions are provided, which suggest transmission strategies for a variety
of drift velocities.
