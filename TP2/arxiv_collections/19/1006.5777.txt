It has been suggested by Chen and Lai that the proper description of the
large scale structure formation of the universe in the post-reionization era,
which is conventionally characterized via gas hydrodynamics, should include the
plasma collective effects in the formulation. Specifically, it is the combined
pressure from the baryon thermal motions and the residual long-range
electrostatic potentials resulted from the imperfect Debye shielding, that
fights against the gravitational collapse. As a result, at small-scales the
baryons would oscillate at the ion-acoustic, instead of the conventional
neutral acoustic, frequency. In this paper we extend and improve the Chen-Lai
formulation with the attention to the Landau damping of the ion-acoustic
oscillations. Since T_e \sim T_i in the post-reionization era, the ion acoustic
oscillations would inevitably suffer the Landau damping which severely
suppresses the baryon density spectrum in the regimes of intermediate and high
wavenumber k. To describe this Landau-damping phenomenon more appropriately, we
find it necessary to modify the filtering wavenumber k_f in our analysis. It
would be interesting if our predicted Landau damping of the ion-acoustic
oscillations can be observed at high redshifts.
