We present a restriction of the solos calculus which is stable under
reduction and expressive enough to contain an encoding of the pi-calculus. As a
consequence, it is shown that equalizing names that are already equal is not
required by the encoding of the pi-calculus. In particular, the induced solo
diagrams bear an acyclicity property that induces a faithful encoding into
differential interaction nets. This gives a (new) proof that differential
interaction nets are expressive enough to contain an encoding of the
pi-calculus. All this is worked out in the case of finitary (replication free)
systems without sum, match nor mismatch.
