This contribution contains the introductory historical remarks that I
presented at IAU Symposium 270 on "Computational Star Formation" held in
Barcelona, Spain, May 31 - June 4, 2010. I give a personal view of some of the
early histoy of the subject and I comment on some of the important things that
were learned from numerical work on star formation.
