Tokai-to-Kamioka T2K is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment,
looking for sub-dominant muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations. One
of the primary aims of the T2K experiment is to narrow down the current limit
on the value of theta13 (which if this value large enough, suggests CP
violation in the neutrino sector) and to find whether theta23 is maximal, which
is crucial for constraining neutrino mass models. T2K produces a high power
neutrino beam at the J-PARC facility on the east coast of Japan, and this beam
is then characterised by the near detector ND280 280 m from the start of the
beam, the far detector (Super-Kamiokande), a 50 kton water Cherenkov detector,
then detects the beam at the oscillation maximum of 295 km on Japan's west
coast. T2K will be the first experiment to really study the electron neutrino
appearance measurement - whose result will be sensitive to theta13 arguably the
main physics goal of T2K. The ND280 detector is imperative to this measurement
and will be used to understand the electron neutrino appearance background. The
status of the T2K experiment and the predicted performance for the electron
neutrino appearance measurement is presented here.
