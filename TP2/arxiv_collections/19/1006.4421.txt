The road to becoming an astronomer is exciting, but often fraught with danger
and conflicting messages. A PhD student is inundated with catch-phrases such as
"publish or perish" and "it's not about the quantity, but the quality of work".
How do we know which advice to follow? How can we publish copious amounts of
quality work in only three years so as to maximize our success in the future?
How do we even know what "good quality" really is? With only a short time to
prepare ourselves for the big wide world of Astronomy, what is the best way for
a PhD student to maximize their research and ultimately maximize their success
as a real astronomer? The PhD students of today are the astronomers of
tomorrow, but their journey depends on a positive work environment in which
they can thrive and improve. Here I present the results of a survey of current
PhD students on how they believe they can maximize their success in science. I
find that PhD students in Australia expect to write more papers during their
PhD than is expected by their supervisors, but that they are generally happy
with the quality of their supervision. Above all, students love telescopes, and
hands-on observations are an important part of acquiring the knowledge and
culture necessary to becoming a real astronomer.
