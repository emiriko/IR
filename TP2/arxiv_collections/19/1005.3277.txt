We show that graphene in a strong magnetic field with partially filled Landau
levels sustains charged collective excitations, which are bound states of
three-particle complexes. Some of these states are optically bright and may be
detected in spectroscopy experiments, enhancing the current understanding of
electron-electron interactions in graphene. The states can be classified using
the geometrical symmetries - non-commutative magnetic translations and
generalized rotations - in addition to the dynamical SU(4) symmetry in
graphene. From the SU(4) symmetry point of view, such excitations are analogous
to bound states of two quarks and one antiquark qqqbar with four flavors. We
establish a flavor optical selection rule to identify the bright states for
experimental studies.
