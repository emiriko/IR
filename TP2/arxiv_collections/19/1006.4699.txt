A way to pose the entropic uncertainty principle for trace-preserving
super-operators is presented. It is based on the notion of extremal unraveling
of a super-operator. For given input state, different effects of each
unraveling result in some probability distribution at the output. As it is
shown, all Tsallis' entropies of positive order as well as some of Renyi's
entropies of this distribution are minimized by the same unraveling of a
super-operator. Entropic relations between a state ensemble and the generated
density matrix are revisited in terms of both the adopted measures. Using
Riesz's theorem, we obtain two uncertainty relations for any pair of
generalized resolutions of the identity in terms of the Renyi and Tsallis
entropies. The inequality with Renyi's entropies is an improvement of the
previous one, whereas the inequality with Tsallis' entropies is a new relation
of a general form. The latter formulation is explicitly shown for a pair of
complementary observables in a $d$-level system and for the angle and the
angular momentum. The derived general relations are immediately applied to
extremal unravelings of two super-operators.
