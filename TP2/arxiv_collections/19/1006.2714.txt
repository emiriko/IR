We present a study of neutrino-nucleus interactions at the T2K experiment
based on the GiBUU transport model. The aim of T2K is to measure $\nu_e$
appearance and $\theta_{13}$, but it will also be able to do a precise
measurement of $\nu_\mu$ disappearance. The former requires a good
understanding of $\pi^0$ production while the latter is closely connected with
a good understanding of quasielastic scattering. For both processes we
investigate the influence of nuclear effects and particular final-state
interactions on the expected event rates taking into account the T2K detector
setup.
