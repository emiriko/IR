The Smith-Purcell radiation is usually measured when an electron passes over
the grating of metallic stripes. However, for high frequencies (exceeding the
plasma frequency of the grating material) none material could be treated as a
conductor, but ought to be considered as a dielectric with plasma-like
permittivity. So for describing Smith-Purcell radiation in the range of high
frequencies new theoretical approaches are needed. In the present paper we
apply the simple variant of eikonal approximation developed earlier to the case
of radiation on the set of parallel semi-infinite dielectric plates. The
formulae obtained describe the radiation generated by the particles both
passing through the plates (traditionally referred as "transition radiation")
and moving in vacuum over the grating formed by the edges of the plates
(traditionally referred as "diffraction radiation", and, taking into account
the periodicity of the plates arrangement, as Smith-Purcell radiation).
