The aim of this paper is to study the spectrum of the $L^p$ Laplacian and the
dynamics of the $L^p$ heat semigroup on non-compact locally symmetric spaces of
higher rank. Our work here generalizes previously obtained results in the
setting of locally symmetric spaces of rank one to higher rank spaces.
Similarly as in the rank one case, it turns out that the $L^p$ heat semigroup
on $M$ has a certain chaotic behavior if $p\in(1,2)$ whereas for $p\geq 2$ such
a chaotic behavior never occurs.
