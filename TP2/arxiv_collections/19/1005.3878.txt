Based on the eigenfunction symmetry constraint of the q-deformed modified KP
hierarchy, a q-deformed mKP hierarchy with self-consistent sources
($q$-mKPHSCSs) is constructed. The q-mKPHSCSs contains two types of q-deformed
mKP equation with self-consistent sources. By combination of the dressing
method and the method of variation of constants, a generalized dressing
approach is proposed to solve the q-deformed KP hierarchy with self-consistent
sources ($q$-KPHSCSs). Using the gauge transformation between the $q$-KPHSCSs
and the $q$-mKPHSCSs, the q-deformed Wronskian solutions for the $q$-KPHSCSs
and the $q$-mKPHSCSs are obtained. The one-soliton solutions for the q-deformed
KP (mKP) equation with a source are given explicitly.
