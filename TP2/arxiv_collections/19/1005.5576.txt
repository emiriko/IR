Here we report on the preparation of transparent and flexible polymerized
graphite oxide, which is composed of carbons with sp3-hybridized orbitals and a
non-planar ring structure, and which demonstrates dispersion in its dielectric
constant at room temperature. This frequency dependence renders the material
suitable for creating miniaturized, flexible, and transparent variable
capacitors, allowing for smaller and simpler integrated electronic devices. We
discuss this polarizability in terms of space charge effects.
