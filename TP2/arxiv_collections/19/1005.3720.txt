The identification of the correct model for physics beyond the Standard Model
requires the determination of the spin of new particles. We investigate to
which extent the spin of a new particle $X$ can be identified in scenarios
where it decays dominantly in three-body decays $X\to f\bar{f} Y$. Here we
assume that $Y$ is a candidate for dark matter and escapes direct detection at
a high energy collider such as the LHC. We show that in the case that all
intermediate particles are heavy, one can get information on the spins of $X$
and $Y$ at the LHC by exploiting the invariant mass distribution of the two
standard model fermions. We develop a model-independent strategy to determine
the spins without prior knowledge of the unknown couplings and test it in a
series of Monte Carlo studies.
