The set of regulatory interactions between genes, mediated by transcription
factors, forms a species' transcriptional regulatory network (TRN). By
comparing this network with measured gene expression data one can identify
functional properties of the TRN and gain general insight into transcriptional
control. We define the subnet of a node as the subgraph consisting of all nodes
topologically downstream of the node, including itself. Using a large set of
microarray expression data of the bacterium Escherichia coli, we find that the
gene expression in different subnets exhibits a structured pattern in response
to environmental changes and genotypic mutation. Subnets with less changes in
their expression pattern have a higher fraction of feed-forward loop motifs and
a lower fraction of small RNA targets within them. Our study implies that the
TRN consists of several scales of regulatory organization: 1) subnets with more
varying gene expression controlled by both transcription factors and
post-transcriptional RNA regulation, and 2) subnets with less varying gene
expression having more feed-forward loops and less post-transcriptional RNA
regulation.
