The understanding of the interaction of nucleons in nuclear and neutron-rich
matter at non-zero temperature is important for a variety of applications
ranging from heavy-ion collisions to nuclear astrophysics. In this papre we
apply the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock method along with the Bonn B potential
to predict single-particle properties in symmetric nuclear matter and
neutron-rich matter at finite temperature. It is found that temperature effects
are generally small but can be significant at low density and momentum.
