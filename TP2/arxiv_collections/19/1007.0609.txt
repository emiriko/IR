We use a simple two-layer outer gap model, whose accelerator consists of a
primary region and a screening region, to discuss $\gamma$-ray spectrum of
mature pulsars detected by $Fermi$. By solving the Poisson equation with an
assumed simple step-function distributions of the charge density in these two
regions, the distribution of the electric field and the curvature radiation
process of the accelerated particles can be calculated. In the our model, the
properties of the phase-averaged spectrum can be completely specified by three
gap parameters, i.e. the fractional gap size in the outer magnetosphere, the
gap current in the primary region and the gap size ratio between the primary
region and the total gap size. We discuss how these parameters affect the
spectral properties. We argue that although the radiation mechanism in the
outer gap is curvature radiation process, the observed gamma-ray spectrum can
substantially deviate from the simple curvature spectrum because the overall
spectrum consists of two components, i.e. the primary region and screening
region. In some pulsars the radiation from the screening region is so strong
that the photon index from 100MeV to several GeV can be as flat as $\sim 2$. We
show the fitting fractional gap thickness of the canonical pulsars increases
with the spin down age. We find that the total gap current is about 50~\% of
the Goldreich-Julian value and the thickness of the screening region is a few
percent of the total gap thickness. We also find that the predicted \gamma$-ray
luminosity is less dependent on the spin down power ($L_{sd}$) for the pulsars
with $L_{sd}\ga 10^{36}$~erg/s, while the $\gamma$-ray luminosity decreases
with the spin down power for the pulsars with $L_{sd}\la 10^{36}$~erg/s.
