Thanks to the wide field of view of its gamma-ray imager, the AGILE satellite
obtained a long term monitoring of the brightest blazars in the sky and during
the first 3 years of operation detected several blazars in a high gamma-ray
state: 3C 279, 3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089, S5 0716+714, 3C 273, W Comae, and Mrk
421. Through the rapid dissemination of our alerts we were able to obtain also
multi-wavelength data from many observatories such as Spitzer, Swift, RXTE,
Suzaku, XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, MAGIC, VERITAS, and ARGO as well as
radio-to-optical coverage by means of the MOJAVE project, the GASP project of
the WEBT and the REM Telescope. This large coverage over the whole
electromagnetic spectrum gave us the opportunity to study the variability
correlations between the emission at different frequencies and to build truly
simultaneous spectral energy distributions of these sources from radio to
gamma-rays, investigating in detail the emission mechanisms of blazars and
uncovering in some cases a more complex behaviour with respect to the standard
models. We present an overview of the most interesting AGILE results on these
gamma-ray blazars and the relative multiwavelength data.
