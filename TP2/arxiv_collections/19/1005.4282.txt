We study lepton number violating decays of charged K, D, D_s, B and B_c
mesons of the form M^+\to {M'}^-\ell^+\ell^+, induced by the existence of
Majorana neutrinos. These processes provide information complementary to
neutrinoless double nuclear beta decays, and are sensitive to neutrino masses
and lepton mixing. We explore neutrino mass ranges m_N from below 1 eV to
several hundred GeV. We find that in many cases the branching ratios are
prohibitively small, however in the intermediate range m_\pi < m_N < m_{B_c},
in specific channels and for specific neutrino masses, the branching ratios can
be at the reach of high luminosity experiments like those at the LHC-b and
future Super flavor-factories, and can provide bounds on the lepton mixing
parameters.
