Recently Menard et al. detected a subtle but systematic change in the mean
color of quasars as a function of their projected separation from foreground
galaxies, extending to comoving separations of ~10Mpc/h, which they interpret
as a signature of reddening by intergalactic dust. We present theoretical
models of this remarkable observation, using SPH cosmological simulations of a
(50Mpc/h)^3 volume. Our primary model uses a simulation with galactic winds and
assumes that dust traces the intergalactic metals. The predicted galaxy-dust
correlation function is similar in form to the galaxy-mass correlation
function, and reproducing the MSFR data requires a dust-to-metal mass ratio of
0.24, about half the value in the Galactic ISM. Roughly half of the reddening
arises in dust that is more than 100Kpc/h from the nearest massive galaxy. We
also examine a simulation with no galactic winds, which predicts a much smaller
fraction of intergalactic metals (3% vs. 35%) and therefore requires an
unphysical dust-to-metal ratio of 2.18 to reproduce the MSFR data. In both
models, the signal is dominated by sightlines with E(g-i)=0.001-0.1. The
no-wind simulation can be reconciled with the data if we also allow reddening
to arise in galaxies up to several x 10^10 Msun. The wind model predicts a mean
visual extinction of A_V ~0.0133 mag out to z=0.5, with a
sightline-to-sightline dispersion similar to the mean, which could be
significant for future supernova cosmology studies. Reproducing the MSFR
results in these simulations requires that a large fraction of ISM dust survive
its expulsion from galaxies and its residence in the intergalactic medium.
Future observational studies that provide higher precision and measure the
dependence on galaxy type and environment will allow detailed tests for models
of enriched galactic outflows and the survival of IG dust.
