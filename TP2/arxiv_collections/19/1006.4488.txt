We theoretically study the nonlinear dynamics of the instability of
counter-superflow in two miscible Bose-Einstein condensates. The condensates
become unstable when the relative velocity exceeds a critical value, which is
called counter-superflow instability. We reveal that the counter-superflow
instability can lead to quantum turbulence by numerically solving the coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The modes amplified by the instability grow into
solitons and decay into quantized vortices.Eventually, the vortices become
tangled and quantum turbulence of two superfluids. We show that this process
may occur in experiments by investigating the dynamics in a 2D trapped system.
