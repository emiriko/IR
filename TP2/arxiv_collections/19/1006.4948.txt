Music composition used to be a pen and paper activity. These these days music
is often composed with the aid of computer software, even to the point where
the computer compose parts of the score autonomously. The composition of most
styles of music is governed by rules. We show that by approaching the
automation, analysis and verification of composition as a knowledge
representation task and formalising these rules in a suitable logical language,
powerful and expressive intelligent composition tools can be easily built. This
application paper describes the use of answer set programming to construct an
automated system, named ANTON, that can compose melodic, harmonic and rhythmic
music, diagnose errors in human compositions and serve as a computer-aided
composition tool. The combination of harmonic, rhythmic and melodic composition
in a single framework makes ANTON unique in the growing area of algorithmic
composition. With near real-time composition, ANTON reaches the point where it
can not only be used as a component in an interactive composition tool but also
has the potential for live performances and concerts or automatically generated
background music in a variety of applications. With the use of a fully
declarative language and an "off-the-shelf" reasoning engine, ANTON provides
the human composer a tool which is significantly simpler, more compact and more
versatile than other existing systems. This paper has been accepted for
publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
