The matrix product structure is considered on a regular lattice in the
hyperbolic plane. The phase transition of the Ising model is observed on the
hyperbolic $(5, 4)$ lattice by means of the corner-transfer-matrix
renormalization group (CTMRG) method. Calculated correlation length is always
finite even at the transition temperature, where mean-field like behavior is
observed. The entanglement entropy is also always finite.
