We study the interplay of dissipation and harmonic driving in the elliptical
billiard. These two competing processes balance each other, which leads to a
destruction of Fermi acceleration and thus to a saturation of the ensemble
averaged velocity. In particular, the emergence of dynamical attractors sharply
focuses the ensemble onto certain parts of phase space. The population of
individual attractors can be controlled by adding small hyperbolic elements to
certain parts of the boundary of the billiard. Furthermore, the position of the
attractors in momentum space can be adjusted by tuning parameters like the
dissipation constant or the driving amplitude and frequency. Thus, the
dissipative, driven elliptical billiard represents a powerful tool for particle
preparation.
