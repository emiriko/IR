It was previously shown that models with deformations of special relativity
that have an energy-dependent yet observer-independent speed of light suffer
from nonlocal effects that are in conflict with observation to very high
precision. In a recent preprint it has been claimed that this conclusion is
false. This claim was made by writing down expressions for modified
Lorentz-transformations the use of which does not reproduce the result. I will
show here that the failure to reproduce the result is not a consequence of a
novel and improved calculation, but a consequence of repeating the same
calculation but making an assumption that is in conflict with the assumptions
made to produce the original scenario. I will here explain what the physical
meaning of either assumption is and why the original assumption is the
physically meaningful one. I will then further explain why even making the
differing assumption does not remove but merely shift the problem and why the
bound derived by Amelino-Camelia et al is wrong.
