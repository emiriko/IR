Given a simple graph G, the graph associahedron KG is a simple polytope whose
face poset is based on the connected subgraphs of G. This paper defines and
constructs graph associahedra in a general context, for pseudographs with loops
and multiple edges, which are also allowed to be disconnected. We then consider
deformations of pseudograph associahedra as their underlying graphs are altered
by edge contractions and edge deletions.
