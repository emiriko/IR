Results of 2433 intensified CCD observations of double stars, made with the
26-inch refractor of the U.S. Naval Observatory are presented. Each observation
of a system represents a combination of over 2000 short-exposure images. These
observations are averaged into 1013 mean relative positions and range in
separation from 0.96" to 58.05", with a mean separation of 13.50". This is the
15th in this series of papers and covers the period 2008 January 3 through 2008
December 21.
