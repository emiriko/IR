We model the surface magnetic field and open flux of the Sun from 1913 to
1986 using a surface flux transport model, which includes the observed
cycle-to-cycle variation of sunspot group tilts. The model reproduces the
empirically derived time evolution of the solar open magnetic flux, and the
reversal times of the polar fields. We find that both the polar field and the
axial dipole moment resulting from this model around cycle minimum correlate
with the strength of the following cycle.
