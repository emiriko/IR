Heavy-fermion compounds are characterized by electronic correlation effects
at low energies which can directly be accessed with optical spectroscopy. Here
we present detailed measurements of the frequency- and temperature-dependent
conductivity of the heavy-fermion compound UPd2Al3 using broadband microwave
spectroscopy in the frequency range 45 MHz to 40 GHz at temperatures down to
1.7 K. We observe the full Drude response with a relaxation time up to 50 ps,
proving that the mass enhancement of the heavy charge carriers goes hand in
hand with an enhancement of the relaxation time. We show that the relaxation
rate as a function of temperature scales with the dc resistivity. We do not
find any signs of a frequency-dependent relaxation rate within the addressed
frequency range.
