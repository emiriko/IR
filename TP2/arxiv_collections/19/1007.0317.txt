The latest results from the commissioning of the SSD with cosmics are
presented in this paper. The hardware status of the detector, the front-end
electronics, cooling, data acquisition and issues related to the on-line
monitoring are shown. In addition, the procedures implemented and followed to
address the alignment with the rest of the ITS sub-detectors along with both
on-line and off-line calibration strategies are described. Finally, results
from simulations as well as from the reconstruction of cosmic data
demonstrating the performance of the detector are presented, proving that the
SSD is ready for the forthcoming proton-proton data taking.
