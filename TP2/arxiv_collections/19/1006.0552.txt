We study the scissors modes of dipolar boson and fermion gases trapped in a
spherically symmetric potential. We use the harmonic oscillator states to solve
the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation for bosons and the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock equation for fermions. It is pointed out that the scissors modes
of bosons and fermions can be of quite different nature.
