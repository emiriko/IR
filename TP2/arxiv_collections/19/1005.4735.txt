Notes of lectures for graduate students that were given at Lake Como in 1999,
covering the theory of linearized gravitational waves, their sources, and the
prospects at the time for detecting gravitational waves. The lectures remain of
interest for pedagogical reasons, and in particular because they contain a
treatment of current-quadrupole gravitational radiation (in connection with the
r-modes of neutron stars) that is not readily available in other sources.
