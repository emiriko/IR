We have studied the analytical Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics of
quantum correlations, such as entanglement, quantum discord and Bell
nonlocalities for three noisy qubits. Quantum correlation as measured by
quantum discord is found to be immune to death contrary to entanglement and
Bell nonlocality for initial GHZ- or W-type mixed states.
