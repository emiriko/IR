In this paper, we show that, due to the structural properties of the
resulting automaton obtained from a prior operation, the state complexity of a
combined operation may not be equal but close to the mathematical composition
of the state complexities of its component operations. In particular, we
provide two witness combined operations: reversal combined with catenation and
star combined with catenation.
