In this paper, we start from the geometric relativistic foundations to define
the basis upon which matter field theories are built, and their wave solutions
are investigated, finding that they display repulsive interactions able to
reproduce the exclusion principle in terms of its effects in a dynamical way,
then discussing possible consequences and problems.
