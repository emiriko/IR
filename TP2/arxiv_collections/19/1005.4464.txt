We present a theoretical calculation of the Lifshitz-van der Waals force
between two metallic slabs embedded in a fluid, taking into account the change
of the Drude parameters of the metals when in contact with liquids of different
index of refraction. For the three liquids considered in this work, water,
$CCl_3F$ and $ CBr_3F$ the change in the Drude parameters of the metal imply a
difference of up to 15% in the determination of the force at short separations.
These variations in the force is bigger for liquids with a higher index of
refraction.
