We analysed 866 observations of the neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary XTE
J1701-462 during its 2006-2007 outburst. XTE J1701-462 is the only example so
far of a source that during an outburst showed, beyond any doubt, spectral and
timing characteristics both of the Z and atoll type. We found that the lower
kHz QPO in the atoll phase has a significantly higher coherence and fractional
rms amplitude than any of the kHz QPOs seen during the Z phase, and that in the
same frequency range, atoll lower kHz QPOs show coherence and fractional rms
amplitude, respectively, 2 and 3 times larger than the Z kHz QPOs. Out of the
707 observations in the Z phase, there is no single observation in which the
kHz QPOs have a coherence or rms amplitude similar to those seen when XTE
J1701-462 was in the atoll phase, even though the total exposure time was about
5 times longer in the Z than in the atoll phase. Since it is observed in the
same source, the difference in QPO coherence and rms amplitude between the Z
and atoll phase cannot be due to neutron-star mass, magnetic field, spin,
inclination of the accretion disk, etc. If the QPO frequency is a function of
the radius in the accretion disk in which it is produced, our results suggest
that in XTE J1701-462 the coherence and rms amplitude are not uniquely related
to this radius. Here we argue that this difference is instead due to a change
in the properties of the accretion flow around the neutron star. Regardless of
the precise mechanism, our result shows that effects other than the geometry of
space time around the neutron star have a strong influence on the coherence and
rms amplitude of the kHz QPOs, and therefore the coherence and rms amplitude of
the kHz QPOs cannot be simply used to deduce the existence of the innermost
stable circular orbit around a neutron star.
