Sector decomposition in its practical aspect is a constructive method used to
evaluate Feynman integrals numerically. We present a new program performing the
sector decomposition and integrating the expression afterwards. The program can
be also used in order to expand Feynman integrals automatically in limits of
momenta and masses with the use of sector decompositions and Mellin--Barnes
representations. The program is parallelizable on modern multicore computers
and even on multiple computers. Also we demonstrate some new numerical results
for four-loop massless propagator master integrals.
