A tunable nanoscale "zipper" laser cavity, formed from two doubly clamped
photonic crystal nanobeams, is demonstrated. Pulsed, room temperature,
optically pumped lasing action at a wavelength of 1.3 micron is observed for
cavities formed in a thin membrane containing InAsP/GaInAsP quantum-wells.
Metal electrodes are deposited on the ends of the nanobeams to allow for
micro-electro-mechanical actuation. Electrostatic tuning and modulation of the
laser wavelength is demonstrated at a rate of 0.25nm/V^2 and a frequency as
high as 6.7MHz, respectively.
