We study a generalization of the \emph{Frobenius problem}: given $k$ positive
relatively prime integers, what is the largest integer $g_0$ that cannot be
represented as a nonnegative integral linear combination of these parameters?
More generally, what is the largest integer $g_s$ that has exactly $s$ such
representations? We illustrate a family of parameters, based on a recent paper
by Tripathi, whose generalized Frobenius numbers $g_0, \ g_1, \ g_2, ...$
exhibit unnatural jumps; namely, $g_0, \ g_1, \ g_k, \ g_{\binom{k+1}{k-1}}, \
g_{\binom{k+2}{k-1}}, ...$ form an arithmetic progression, and any integer
larger than $g_{\binom{k+j}{k-1}}$ has at least $\binom{k+j+1}{k-}$
representations. Along the way, we introduce a variation of a generalized
Frobenius number and prove some basic results about it.
