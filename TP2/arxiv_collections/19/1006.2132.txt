The vacuum of Quantum Chromodynamics is a superposition of degenerate states
with different topological numbers that are connected by tunneling (the
$\theta$-vacuum). The tunneling events are due to topologically non-trivial
configurations of gauge fields (e.g. the instantons) that induce local $\p$-odd
domains in Minkowski space-time. We study the quark fragmentation in this
topologically non-trivial QCD background. We find that even though QCD globally
conserves $\p$ and $\cp$ symmetries, two new kinds of $\p$-odd fragmentation
functions emerge. They generate interesting dihadron correlations: one is the
azimuthal angle correlation $\sim \cos(\phi_1 + \phi_2)$ usually referred to as
the Collins effect, and the other is the $\p$-odd correlation $\sim \sin(\phi_1
+ \phi_2)$ that vanishes in the cross section summed over many events, but
survives on the event-by-event basis. Using the chiral quark model we estimate
the magnitude of these new fragmentation functions. We study their experimental
manifestations in dihadron production in $e^+e^-$ collisions, and comment on
the applicability of our approach in deep-inelastic scattering, proton-proton
and heavy ion collisions.
