Heisenberg, Bohr and others were forced to renounce on the description of the
objective reality as the aim of physics because of the paradoxical quantum
phenomena observed on the atomic level. The contemporary quantum mechanics
created on the base of their positivism point of view must divide the world
into speakable apparatus which amplifies microscopic events to macroscopic
consequences and unspeakable quantum system. Examination of the quantum
phenomena corroborates the confidence expressed by creators of quantum theory
that the renunciation of realism should not apply on our everyday macroscopic
world. Nanostructures may be considered for the present as a boundary of
realistic description for all phenomena including the quantum one.
