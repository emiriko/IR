The influence of electron-electron scattering on the distribution function
and transport characteristics of intrinsic monolayer graphene is investigated
via an ensemble Monte Carlo simulation. Due to the linear dispersion relation
in the vicinity of the Dirac points, it is found that pair-wise collisions in
graphene do not conserve the ensemble average velocity in contrast to
conventional semiconductors with parabolic energy bands. Numerical results
indicate that electron-electron scattering can lead to a decrease in the low
field mobility by more than 80% for moderate electron densities. At high
densities, the impact gradually diminishes due to increased degeneracy.
