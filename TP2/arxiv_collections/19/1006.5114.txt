By using entropy and entropy production, we calculate the steady flux of some
phenomena. The method we use is a competition method, $S_S/\tau+\sigma={\it
maximum}$, where $S_S$ is system entropy, $\sigma$ is entropy production and
$\tau$ is microscopic interaction time. System entropy is calculated from the
equilibrium state by studying the flux fluctuations. The phenomena we study
include ionic conduction, atomic diffusion, thermal conduction and viscosity of
a dilute gas.
