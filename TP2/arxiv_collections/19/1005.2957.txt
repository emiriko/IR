The total and differential cross sections for associated strangeness
production in the $pp \to pK^+K^-p$ and $pp \to pK^+\pi^0\Sigma^0$ reactions
have been studied in a unified approach using an effective Lagrangian model. It
is assumed that both the $K^-p$ and $\pi^0\Sigma^0$ final states originate from
the decay of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance which was formed in the production
chain $pp\to p(N^*(1535)\to K^+\Lambda(1405))$. The available experimental data
are well reproduced, especially the ratio of the two total cross sections,
which is much less sensitive to the particular model of the entrance channel.
The significant coupling of the $N^*(1535)$ resonance to $\Lambda(1405) K$ is
further evidence for large $s \bar{s}$ components in the quark wave function of
the $N^*(1535)$ resonance.
