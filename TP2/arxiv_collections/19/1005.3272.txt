The S-matrix in quantum Yang-Mills gravity with translation gauge symmetry in
flat space-time is investigated. We obtain the generating functional of Green's
functions, i.e., the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude, for Yang-Mills gravity. The
unitarity and gauge invariance of the S-matrix in a class of gauge conditions
is preserved by massless ghost vector fields.
