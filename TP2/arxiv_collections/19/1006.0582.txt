Aims. The comparative study of several molecular species at the origin of the
gas phase chemistry in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) is a key input in
unraveling the coupled chemical and dynamical evolution of the ISM. Methods.
The lowest rotational lines of HCO+, HCN, HNC, and CN were observed at the
IRAM-30m telescope in absorption against the \lambda 3 mm and \lambda 1.3 mm
continuum emission of massive star-forming regions in the Galactic plane. The
absorption lines probe the gas over kiloparsecs along these lines of sight. The
excitation temperatures of HCO+ are inferred from the comparison of the
absorptions in the two lowest transitions. The spectra of all molecular species
on the same line of sight are decomposed into Gaussian velocity components.
Most appear in all the spectra of a given line of sight. For each component, we
derived the central opacity, the velocity dispersion, and computed the
molecular column density. We compared our results to the predictions of
UV-dominated chemical models of photodissociation regions (PDR models) and to
those of non-equilibrium models in which the chemistry is driven by the
dissipation of turbulent energy (TDR models). Results. The molecular column
densities of all the velocity components span up to two orders of magnitude.
Those of CN, HCN, and HNC are linearly correlated with each other with mean
ratios N(HCN)/N(HNC) = 4.8 $\pm$ 1.3 and N(CN)/N(HNC) = 34 $\pm$ 12, and more
loosely correlated with those of HCO+, N(HNC)/N(HCO+) = 0.5 $\pm$ 0.3,
N(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.9 $\pm$ 0.9, and N(CN)/N(HCO+) = 18 $\pm$ 9. These ratios
are similar to those inferred from observations of high Galactic latitude lines
of sight, suggesting that the gas sampled by absorption lines in the Galactic
plane has the same chemical properties as that in the Solar neighbourhood. The
FWHM of the Gaussian velocity components span the range 0.3 to 3 km s-1 and
those of the HCO+ lines are found to be 30% broader than those of CN-bearing
molecules. The PDR models fail to reproduce simultaneously the observed
abundances of the CN-bearing species and HCO+, even for high-density material
(100 cm-3 < nH < 104 cm-3). The TDR models, in turn, are able to reproduce the
observed abundances and abundance ratios of all the analysed molecules for the
moderate gas densities (30 cm-3 < nH < 200 cm-3) and the turbulent energy
observed in the diffuse interstellar medium. Conclusions. Intermittent
turbulent dissipation appears to be a promising driver of the gas phase
chemistry of the diffuse and translucent gas throughout the Galaxy. The details
of the dissipation mechanisms still need to be investigated.
