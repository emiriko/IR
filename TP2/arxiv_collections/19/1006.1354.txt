Thermohaline mixing has recently been proposed to occur in low-mass red
giants, with large consequence for the chemical yields of low-mass stars. We
investigate the role of thermohaline mixing during the evolution of stars
between 1Msun and 3Msun, in comparison to other mixing processes acting in
these stars. We use a stellar evolution code which includes rotational mixing,
internal magnetic fields and thermohaline mixing. We confirm that during the
red giant stage, thermohaline mixing has the potential to decrease the
abundance of ^3He which is produced earlier on the main sequence. In our models
we find that this process is working on the RGB only in stars with initial mass
M \simle 1.5Msun. Moreover we report that thermohaline mixing is present also
during core helium burning and beyond, and has the potential to change the
surface abundances of AGB stars. While we find rotational and magnetic mixing
to be negligible compared to the thermohaline mixing in the relevant layers,
the interaction of thermohaline motions with the differential rotation may be
essential to establish the time scale of thermohaline mixing in red giants. To
explain the surface abundances observed at the bump in the luminosity function,
the speed of the mixing process needs to be more than two orders of magnitude
higher than in our models. However it is not clear if thermohaline mixing is
the only physical process responsible for these surface abundance anomalies.
Therefore, at this stage, it is not possible to calibrate the efficiency of
thermohaline mixing against the observations.
