In the first part of this work we apply Bohr (old or naive quantum atomic)
theory for analysis of the remarkable electro-dynamical problem of magnetic
monopoles. We reproduce formally exactly some basic elements of the Dirac
magnetic monopoles theory, especially Dirac electric/magnetic charge
quantization condition. It follows after application of Bohr theory at the
system, simply called magnetic monopole "atom", consisting of the practically
standing, massive magnetic monopole as the "nucleus" and electron rotating
stable around magnetic monopole under magnetic and electrostatic interactions.
Also, in the second part of this work we suggest a simple solution of the
classical electron electromagnetic mass problem.
