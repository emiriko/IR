Applying braided Yang-Baxter equation quantum integrable and Bethe ansatz
solvable 1D anyonic lattice and field models are constructed. Along with known
models we discover novel lattice anyonic and $q$-anyonic models as well as
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) and the derivative NLS quantum field
models involving anyonic operators, $N$-particle sectors of which yield the
well known anyon gases, interacting through $\delta$ and derivative
$\delta$-function potentials.
