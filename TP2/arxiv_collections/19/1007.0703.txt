We investigate how to estimate from atom-position measurements the relative
phase of two Bose-Einstein condensates released from a double-well potential.
We demonstrate that the phase estimation sensitivity via the fit of the average
density to the interference pattern is fundamentally bounded by shot noise.
This bound can be overcome by estimating the phase from the measurement of
$\sqrt N$ (or higher) correlation function. The optimal estimation strategy
requires the measurement of the $N$-th order correlation function. We also
demonstrate that a second estimation method -- based on the detection of the
center of mass of the interference pattern -- provides sub shot-noise
sensitivity. Yet, the implementation of both protocols might be experimentally
challenging.
