The number of citations received by authors in scientific journals has become
a major parameter to assess individual researchers and the journals themselves
through the impact factor. A fair assessment therefore requires that the
criteria for selecting references in a given manuscript should be unbiased with
respect to the authors or the journals cited. In this paper, we advocate that
authors should follow two mandatory principles to select papers (later
reflected in the list of references) while studying the literature for a given
research: i) consider similarity of content with the topics investigated, lest
very related work should be reproduced or ignored; ii) perform a systematic
search over the network of citations including seminal or very related papers.
We use formalisms of complex networks for two datasets of papers from the arXiv
repository to show that neither of these two criteria is fulfilled in practice.
