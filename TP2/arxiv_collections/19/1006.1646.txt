Maximally supersymmetric mass deformation of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson
(BLG) theory corresponds to a {non-central} extension of the d=3 N=8 Poincare
superalgebra (allowed in three dimensions). We obtain its light-cone superspace
formulation which has a novel feature of the dynamical supersymmetry generators
being {cubic} in the kinematical ones. The mass deformation picks a
quaternionic direction, which breaks the SO(8) R-symmetry down to SO(4)xSO(4).
The Hamiltonian of the theory is shown to be a quadratic form of the dynamical
supersymmetry transformations, to all orders in the mass parameter, M, and the
structure constants, f^{a b c d}.
