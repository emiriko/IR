In many dynamical systems there is a large separation of time scales between
typical events and "rare" events which can be the cases of interest. Rare-event
rates are quite difficult to compute numerically, but they are of considerable
practical importance in many fields: for example transition times in chemical
physics and extinction times in epidemiology can be very long, but are quite
important. We present a very fast numerical technique that can be used to find
long transition times (very small rates) in low-dimensional systems, even if
they lack detailed balance. We illustrate the method for a bistable
non-equilibrium system introduced by Maier and Stein and a two-dimensional (in
parameter space) epidemiology model.
