This work builds on the following result of a previous article
(quant-ph/0509044): the matter field can be naturally eliminated from the
equations of the scalar electrodynamics (the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell
electrodynamics) in the unitary gauge. The resulting equations describe
independent dynamics of the electromagnetic field (they form a closed system of
partial differential equations). An improved derivation of this surprising
result is offered in the current work. It is also shown that for this system of
equations, a generalized Carleman linearization (Carleman embedding) procedure
generates a system of linear equations in the Hilbert space, which looks like a
second-quantized theory and is equivalent to the original nonlinear system on
the set of solutions of the latter. Thus, the relevant local realistic model
can be embedded into a quantum field theory. This model is equivalent to a
well-established model - the scalar electrodynamics, so it correctly describes
a large body of experimental data. Although it does not describe the electronic
spin and possibly some other experimental facts, it may be of great interest as
a "no drama quantum theory", as simple (in principle) as classical
electrodynamics. Possible issues with the Bell theorem are discussed.
