We study quadrupole and monopole core polarization using harmonic oscillator
wave funtions but with different length parameters for the valence particle as
compared to the core. We use perturbation theory with a delta interaction. The
results also hold for a density dependent delta interaction [1]. We study how
the amount of core polarization varies with the distance of the valence
particle from the core.
