Decentralised workflow management systems are a new research area, where most
work to-date has focused on the system's overall architecture. As little
attention has been given to the security aspects in such systems, we follow a
security driven approach, and consider, from the perspective of available
security building blocks, how security can be implemented and what new
opportunities are presented when empowering the decentralised environment with
modern distributed security protocols. Our research is motivated by a more
general question of how to combine the positive enablers that email exchange
enjoys, with the general benefits of workflow systems, and more specifically
with the benefits that can be introduced in a decentralised environment. This
aims to equip email users with a set of tools to manage the semantics of a
message exchange, contents, participants and their roles in the exchange in an
environment that provides inherent assurances of security and privacy. This
work is based on a survey of contemporary distributed security protocols, and
considers how these protocols could be used in implementing a distributed
workflow management system with decentralised control . We review a set of
these protocols, focusing on the required message sequences in reviewing the
protocols, and discuss how these security protocols provide the foundations for
implementing core control-flow, data, and resource patterns in a distributed
workflow environment.
