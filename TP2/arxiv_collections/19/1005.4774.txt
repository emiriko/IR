The market economy deals with many interacting agents such as buyers and
sellers who are autonomous intelligent agents pursuing their own interests. One
such multi-agent system (MAS) that plays an important role in auctions is the
combinatorial auctioning system (CAS). We use this framework to define our
concept of fairness in terms of what we call as "basic fairness" and "extended
fairness". The assumptions of quasilinear preferences and dominant strategies
are taken into consideration while explaining fairness. We give an algorithm to
ensure fairness in a CAS using a Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). We use an
algorithm of Sandholm to achieve optimality. Basic and extended fairness are
then analyzed according to the dominant strategy solution concept.
