This paper presents multiplicity measurements that have been performed with
ALICE based on minimum-bias data at 0.9 and 2.36 TeV. Results are shown of the
pseudorapidity density and the multiplicity distribution in different phase
space windows. The analysis and correction procedures are discussed and the
results are compared to previous measurements and to model predictions.
