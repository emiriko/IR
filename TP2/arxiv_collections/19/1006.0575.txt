In this demonstration, we propose a model for the management of XML time
series (TS), using the new XQuery 1.1 window operator. We argue that
centralized computation is slow, and demonstrate XQ2P, our prototype of
efficient XQuery P2P TS computation in the context of financial analysis of
large data sets (>1M values).
