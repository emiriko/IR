The Ehrenfest time scale in quantum transport separates essentially classical
propagation from wave interference and here we consider its effect on the
transmission and reflection through quantum dots. In particular we calculate
the Ehrenfest time dependence of the next-to-leading-order quantum corrections
to the transmission and reflection for dc and ac transport and check that our
results are consistent with current conservation relations. Looking as well at
closed systems, we finally demonstrate how the contributions analyzed here
imply changes in the calculation given in [P. W. Brouwer, S. Rahav and C. Tian,
Phys. Rev. E, 74, 066208 (2006)] of the next to leading order of the spectral
form factor. Our semiclassical result coincides with the result obtained in [C.
Tian and A. I. Larkin, Phys. Rev. B, 70, 035305 (2004)] by field-theoretical
methods.
