We review recent progress towards a determination of a set of polarized
parton distributions from a global set of deep-inelastic scattering data based
on the NNPDF methodology, in analogy with the unpolarized case. This method is
designed to provide a faithful and statistically sound representation of parton
distributions and their uncertainties. We show how the FastKernel method
provides a fast and accurate method for solving the polarized DGLAP equations.
We discuss the polarized PDF parametrizations and the physical constraints
which can be imposed. Preliminary results suggest that the uncertainty on
polarized PDFs, most notably the gluon, has been underestimated in previous
studies.
