A strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) of heavy constituent
quasiparticles is studied by a path-integral Monte-Carlo method, which improves
the corresponding classical simulations by extending them to the quantum
regime. It is shown that this method is able to reproduce the lattice equation
of state and also yields valuable insight into the internal structure of the
QGP. The results indicate that the QGP reveals liquid-like rather than gas-like
properties. At temperatures just above the critical one it was found that bound
quark-antiquark states still survive. These states are bound by effective
string-like forces. Quantum effects turned out to be of prime importance in
these simulations.
