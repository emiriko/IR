We present the results of a comprehensive study of the gamma-ray burst 080928
and of its afterglow. GRB 080928 was a long burst detected by Swift/BAT and
Fermi/GBM. It is one of the exceptional cases where optical emission had
already been detected when the GRB itself was still radiating in the gamma-ray
band. For nearly 100 seconds simultaneous optical, X-ray and gamma-ray data
provide a coverage of the spectral energy distribution of the transient source
from about 1 eV to 150 keV. In particular, we show that the SED during the main
prompt emission phase agrees with synchrotron radiation. We constructed the
optical/near-infrared light curve and the spectral energy distribution based on
Swift/UVOT, ROTSE-IIIa (Australia), and GROND (La Silla) data and compared it
to the X-ray light curve retrieved from the Swift/XRT repository. We show that
its bumpy shape can be modeled by multiple energy-injections into the forward
shock.Furthermore, we investigate whether the temporal and spectral evolution
of the tail emission of the first strong flare seen in the early X-ray light
curve can be explained by large-angle emission (LAE). We find that a
nonstandard LAE model is required to explain the observations. Finally, we
report on the results of our search for the GRB host galaxy, for which only a
deep upper limit can be provided.
