Starting from the QCD sum rules with nonlocal condensates for the pion
distribution amplitude, we derive another sum rule for its derivative and its
"integral" derivatives---defined in this work. We use this new sum rule to
analyze the fine details of the pion distribution amplitude in the endpoint
region $x\sim 0$. The results for endpoint-suppressed and flat-top (or
flat-like) pion distribution amplitudes are compared with those we obtained
with differential sum rules by employing two different models for the
distribution of vacuum-quark virtualities. We determine the range of values of
the derivatives of the pion distribution amplitude and show that
endpoint-suppressed distribution amplitudes lie within this range, while those
with endpoint enhancement---flat-type or CZ-like---yield values outside this
range.
