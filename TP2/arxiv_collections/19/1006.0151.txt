This dissertation describes the effect of quenched randomness on first order
phase transitions in lattice systems, classical and quantum. It is proven that
a large class of quantum lattice systems in low dimension (d <= 2 or, with
suitable continuous symmetry, d <= 4) cannot exhibit first-order phase
transitions in the presence of suitable ("direct") quenched disorder.
