Graphical rule, describing that any single-mode homodyne detection turns a
given continuous-variable (CV) graph state into a new one, is presented.
Employing two simple graphical rules: local complement operation and vertex
deletion (single quadrature-amplitude $\hat{x}$ measurement), the graphical
rule for any single-mode quadrature component measurement can be obtained. The
shape of CV weighted graph state may be designed and constructed easily from a
given larger graph state by applying this graphical rule.
