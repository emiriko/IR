We study the performance and convergence properties of the Susceptibility
Propagation (SusP) algorithm for solving the Inverse Ising problem. We first
study how the temperature parameter (T) in a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
generating the data influences the performance and convergence of the
algorithm. We find that at the high temperature regime (T>4), the algorithm
performs well and its quality is only limited by the quality of the supplied
data. In the low temperature regime (T<4), we find that the algorithm typically
does not converge, yielding diverging values for the couplings. However, we
show that by stopping the algorithm at the right time before divergence becomes
serious, good reconstruction can be achieved down to T~2. We then show that
dense connectivity, loopiness of the connectivity, and high absolute
magnetization all have deteriorating effects on the performance of the
algorithm. When absolute magnetization is high, we show that other methods can
be work better than SusP. Finally, we show that for neural data with high
absolute magnetization, SusP performs less well than TAP inversion.
