We outline an exact approach to decoherence and entanglement problems for
continuous variable systems. The method is based on a construction of quantum
distribution functions introduced by Ford and Lewis \cite{ford86} in which a
system in thermal equilibrium is placed in an initial state by a measurement
and then sampled by subsequent measurements. With the Langevin equation
describing quantum Brownian motion, this method has proved to be a powerful
tool for discussing such problems. After reviewing our previous work on
decoherence and our recent work on disentanglement, we apply the method to the
problem of a pair of particles in a correlated Gaussian state. The initial
state and its time development are explicitly exhibited. For a single
relaxation time bath at zero temperature exact numerical results are given. The
criterion of Duan et al. \cite{duan00} for such states is used to prove that
the state is initially entangled and becomes separable after a finite time
(entanglement sudden death).
