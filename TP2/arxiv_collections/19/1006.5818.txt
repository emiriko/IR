Contraction, expansion and despinning have been common in the past evolution
of Solar System bodies. These processes deform the lithosphere until it breaks
along faults. The type and orientation of faults are usually determined under
the assumption of a constant lithospheric thickness, but lithospheric thinning
can occur at the equator or at the poles due either to latitudinal variation in
solar insolation or to localized tidal dissipation. Using thin elastic shells
with variable thickness, I show that the equatorial thinning of the lithosphere
transforms the homogeneous and isotropic fault pattern caused by
contraction/expansion into a pattern of faults striking east-west, preferably
formed in the equatorial region. By contrast, lithospheric thickness variations
only weakly affect the despinning faulting pattern consisting of equatorial
strike-slip faults and polar normal faults. If contraction is added to
despinning, the despinning pattern first shifts to thrust faults striking
north-south and then to thrust faults striking east-west. If the lithosphere is
thinner at the poles, the tectonic pattern caused by contraction/expansion
consists of faults striking north/south. On Iapetus, contraction or expansion
on a lithosphere thinner at the equator explains the location and orientation
of the equatorial ridge. On Mercury, the combination of contraction and
despinning makes possible the existence of zonal provinces of thrust faults
differing in orientation (north-south or east-west), which may be relevant to
the orientation of lobate scarps.
