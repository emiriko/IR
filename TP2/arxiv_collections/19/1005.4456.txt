We examine three methods of constructing correlated Student-$t$ random
variables. Our motivation arises from simulations that utilise heavy-tailed
distributions for the purposes of stress testing and economic capital
calculations for financial institutions. We make several observations regarding
the suitability of the three methods for this purpose.
