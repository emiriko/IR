An effective white-noise Langevin equation is derived that describes
long-time phase dynamics of a limit-cycle oscillator subjected to weak
stationary colored noise. Effective drift and diffusion coefficients are given
in terms of the phase sensitivity of the oscillator and the correlation
function of the noise, and are explicitly calculated for oscillators with
sinusoidal phase sensitivity functions driven by two typical colored Gaussian
processes. The results are verified by numerical simulations using several
types of stochastic or chaotic noise. The drift and diffusion coefficients of
oscillators driven by chaotic noise exhibit anomalous dependence on the
oscillator frequency, reflecting the peculiar power spectrum of the chaotic
noise.
