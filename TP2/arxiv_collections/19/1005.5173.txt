According to quantum theory, measurements generate random outcomes, in stark
contrast with classical mechanics. This raises the question of whether there
could exist an extension of the theory which removes this indeterminism, as
suspected by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR). Although this has been shown
to be impossible, existing results do not imply that the current theory is
maximally informative. Here we ask the more general question of whether any
improved predictions can be achieved by any extension of quantum theory. Under
the assumption that measurements can be chosen freely, we answer this question
in the negative: no extension of quantum theory can give more information about
the outcomes of future measurements than quantum theory itself. Our result has
significance for the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as applications
to tasks that exploit the inherent randomness in quantum theory, such as
quantum cryptography.
