The persistent current, i.e. the equilibrium direct electric current
circulating in realistic rings, some authors interpreted as dissipationless in
spite of non-zero resistance of the rings, whereas the other one suppose that
this current can not decay at dissipation. The observation of potential
difference connected with the persistent current may give new important
information about paradoxical nature of this quantum phenomena observed in
nanostructures.
