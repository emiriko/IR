Phenomenological and numerical studies of the small scale spectra of energy
are presented for high Reynolds number rotating Boussinesq flows in unit
aspect-ratio domains. We introduce a non-dimensional parameter Gamma such that
when the potential vorticity is nearly linear in the dynamical variables, we
deduce that for Gamma much less than 1, the potential enstrophy suppresses the
transfer of horizontal kinetic energy into wavemodes with large horizontal
component k_h while forcing it to become independent of vertical wavevector
component k_z, scaling as k_h^{-5}. When Gamma much greater than 1, the
potential enstrophy suppresses the transfer of potential energy into the
wavemodes with large vertical component k_z while forcing it to become
independent of k_h, scaling as k_z^{-5) power. Spectra computed from
high-resolution simulations of the Boussinesq equations with isotropic
low-wavenumber forcing are used to explore such anisotropic constraints on the
energy and provide a posteriori justification for the joint flux ansatz used to
obtain the (-5) scaling exponent. In all cases the empirical evidence points to
both energy and potential enstrophy being jointly transferred downscale with
the spectral scaling of the the former constrained by the latter.
