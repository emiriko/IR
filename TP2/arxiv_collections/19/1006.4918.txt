Supmech, the universal mechanics developed in the previous two papers,
accommodates both quantum and classical mechanics as subdisciplines (a brief
outline is included for completeness); this feature facilitates, in a supmech
based treatment of quantum measurements, an unambiguous treatment of the
apparatus as a quantum system approximated well by a classical one. Taking
explicitly into consideration the fact that observations on the apparatus are
made when it has `settled down after the measurement interaction' and are
restricted to macroscopically distinguishable pointer readings, the unwanted
superpositions of (system + apparatus) states are shown to be suppressed; this
provides a genuinely physics based justification for the (traditionally
\emph{postulated}) von Neumann projection/collapse rule. The decoherence
mechanism brought into play by the stated observational constraints is free
from the objections against the traditional decoherence program.
