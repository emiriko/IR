We have measured individual tunneling events and Coulomb step shapes in
single-electron boxes with opaque superconductor-normal metal tunnel junctions.
We observe anomalous broadening of the Coulomb step with decreasing temperature
in a manner that is consistent with activation of first-order tunneling events
by an external dissipative electromagnetic environment. We demonstrate that the
rates for energetically unfavourable tunneling events saturate to finite values
at low temperatures, and that the saturation level can be suppressed by more
than an order of magnitude by a capacitive shunt near the device. The findings
are important in assessing the performance limits of any single-electronic
device. In particular, master equation based simulations show that the
electromagnetic environment realized in the capacitively shunted devices allows
for a metrologically accurate charge pump based on hybrid tunnnel junctions.
