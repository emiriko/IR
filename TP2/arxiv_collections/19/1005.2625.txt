Decay rates of unpolarized top quarks into longitudinally and transversally
polarized W bosons are calculated to second order in the strong coupling
constant alpha_s. Including the finite bottom quark mass and electroweak
effects, the Standard Model predictions for the W boson helicity fractions are
F_L=0.687(5), F_+=0.0017(1), and F_-=0.311(5).
