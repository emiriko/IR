We investigate local contents in $N$-qubit generalized Greenberger, Horne,
and Zeilinger (GHZ) states. We suggest a decomposition for correlations in the
GHZ states into a nonlocal and fully local part, and find a lower and upper
bound on the local content. Our lower bound reproduces the previous result for
N=2 [Scarani, Phys. Rev. A. 77, 042112 (2008)] and decreases rapidly with $N$.
