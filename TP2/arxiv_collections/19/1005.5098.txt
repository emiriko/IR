The recently discovered exoplanet Gl581d is extremely close to the outer edge
of its system's habitable zone, which has led to much speculation on its
possible climate. We have performed a range of simulations to assess whether,
given simple combinations of chemically stable greenhouse gases, the planet
could sustain liquid water on its surface. For best estimates of the surface
gravity, surface albedo and cloud coverage, we find that less than 10 bars of
CO2 is sufficient to maintain a global mean temperature above the melting point
of water. Furthermore, even with the most conservative choices of these
parameters, we calculate temperatures above the water melting point for CO2
partial pressures greater than about 40 bar. However, we note that as Gl581d is
probably in a tidally resonant orbit, further simulations in 3D are required to
test whether such atmospheric conditions are stable against the collapse of CO2
on the surface.
