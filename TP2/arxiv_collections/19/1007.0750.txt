Atomic resolution imaging is demonstrated using a hybrid scanning
tunneling/near-field microwave microscope (microwave-STM). The microwave
channels of the microscope correspond to the resonant frequency and quality
factor of a coaxial microwave resonator, which is built in to the STM scan head
and coupled to the probe tip. We find that when the tip-sample distance is
within the tunneling regime, we obtain atomic resolution images using the
microwave channels of the microwave-STM. We attribute the atomic contrast in
the microwave channels to GHz frequency current through the tip-sample tunnel
junction. Images of the surfaces of HOPG and Au(111) are presented.
