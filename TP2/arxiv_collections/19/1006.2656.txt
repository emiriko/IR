We present a numerical study of shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of
symmetric nuclear matter, pure neutron matter and $\beta$-stable nuclear
matter, in the framework of the Brueckner theory. The calculation of in-medium
cross sections and nucleon effective masses is performed with a consistent two
and three body interaction. The investigation covers a wide baryon density
range as requested in the applications to neutron stars. The results for the
transport coefficients in $\beta$-stable nuclear matter are used to make
preliminary predictions on the damping time scales of non radial modes in
neutron stars.
