A statistical model is advanced for describing quantum turbulence in a
superfluid system with Bose-Einstein condensate. Such a turbulent superfluid
can be realized for trapped Bose atoms subject to either an alternating
trapping potential or to an alternating magnetic field modulating the atomic
scattering length by means of Feshbach resonance. The turbulent system is
represented as a continuous mixture of states each of which is characterized by
its own vorticity corresponding to a particular vortex.
