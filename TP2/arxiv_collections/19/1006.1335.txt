Directional detection of galactic Dark Matter requires 3D reconstruction of
low energy nuclear recoils tracks. A dedicated acquisition electronics with
auto triggering feature and a real time track reconstruction software have been
developed within the framework of the MIMAC project of detector. This
auto-triggered acquisition electronic uses embedded processing to reduce data
transfer to its useful part only, i.e. decoded coordinates of hit tracks and
corresponding energy measurements. An acquisition software with on-line
monitoring and 3D track reconstruction is also presented.
