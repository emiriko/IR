Complex dynamics deals with the iteration of holomorphic functions. As is
well- known, the first functions to be studied which gave non-trivial dynamics
were quadratic polynomials, which produced beautiful computer generated
pictures of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set. In the same spirit, this article
aims to study the dynamics of the simplest non-trivial quasiregular mappings.
These are mappings in R^2 which are a composition of a quadratic polynomial and
an affine stretch.
