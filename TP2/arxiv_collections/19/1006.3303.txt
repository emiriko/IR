We extend the results of Watson, which link quantum unique ergodicity on
arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces with subconvexity for the triple product L
function, to the case of arithmetic hyperbolic three manifolds. We work with
the full unitary dual of SL(2,C), and consider QUE for automorphic forms of
arbitrary fixed weight and growing spectral parameter. We obtain our results by
constructing microlocal lifts of nonspherical automorphic forms using
representation theory, and quantifying the generalised triple product formula
of Ichino in the case of complex places.
