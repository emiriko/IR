We examine a model of classical deterministic computing in which the ground
state of the classical system is a spatial history of the computation. This
model is relevant to quantum dot cellular automata as well as to recent
universal adiabatic quantum computing constructions. In its most primitive
form, systems constructed in this model cannot compute in an error free manner
when working at non-zero temperature. However, by exploiting a mapping between
the partition function for this model and probabilistic classical circuits we
are able to show that it is possible to make this model effectively error free.
We achieve this by using techniques in fault-tolerant classical computing and
the result is that the system can compute effectively error free if the
temperature is below a critical temperature. We further link this model to
computational complexity and show that a certain problem concerning finite
temperature classical spin systems is complete for the complexity class
Merlin-Arthur. This provides an interesting connection between the physical
behavior of certain many-body spin systems and computational complexity.
