We investigated how the stability of macroscopic states in the associative
memory model is affected by synaptic depression. To this model, we applied the
dynamical mean-field theory, which has recently been developed in stochastic
neural network models with synaptic depression. By introducing a sublattice
method, we derived macroscopic equations for firing state variables and
depression variables. By using the macroscopic equations, we obtained the phase
diagram when the strength of synaptic depression and the correlation level
among stored patterns were changed. We found that there is an unstable region
in which both the memory state and mixed state cannot be stable and that
various switching phenomena can occur in this region.
