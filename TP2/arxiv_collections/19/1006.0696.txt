The singularities of the electromagnetic field are derived to include all the
point-like multipoles representing an electric charge and current distribution.
We show that for higher orders, it is more efficient to have fields represented
in terms of symmetric and trace free moments. In the static case, the
delta-singularities are expressed for arbitrary multipole orders, while in the
dynamic case we restrict ourselves to the lower orders. The algorithm we give
can be easily extended to the next orders.
