Network latency and packet loss are considered to be an important requirement
for realistic evaluation of Peer-to-Peer protocols. Dedicated clusters, such as
Grid'5000, do not provide the variety of network latency and packet loss rates
that can be found in the Internet. However, compared to the experiments
performed on testbeds such as PlanetLab, the experiments performed on dedicated
clusters are reproducible, as the computational resources are not shared. In
this paper, we perform experiments to study the impact of network latency and
packet loss on the time required to download a file using BitTorrent. In our
experiments, we observe a less than 15% increase on the time required to
download a file when we increase the round-trip time between any two peers,
from 0 ms to 400 ms, and the packet loss rate, from 0% to 5%. Our main
conclusion is that the underlying network latency and packet loss have a
marginal impact on the time required to download a file using BitTorrent.
Hence, dedicated clusters such as Grid'5000 can be safely used to perform
realistic and reproducible BitTorrent experiments.
