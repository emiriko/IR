We report on the development of ARCONS, the ARray Camera for Optical to
Near-IR Spectrophotometry. This photon counting integral field unit (IFU),
being built at UCSB and Caltech with detectors fabricated at JPL, will use a
unique, highly multiplexed low temperature detector technology known as
Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). These detectors, which operate
at 100 mK, should provide photon counting with energy resolution of R =
E/{\delta}E > 20 and time resolution of a microsecond, with a quantum
efficiency of around 50%. We expect to field the instrument at the Palomar 200"
telescope in the first quarter of 2011 with an array containing 1024 pixels in
a 32x32 pixel form factor to yield a field of view of approximately 10x10
arcseconds. The bandwidth of the camera is limited by the rising sky count rate
at longer wavelengths, but we anticipate a bandwidth of 0.35 to 1.35 {\mu}m
will be achievable. A simple optical path and compact dewar utilizing a
cryogen-free adiabatic demagnetization refridgerator (ADR) allows the camera to
be deployed quickly at Naysmith or Coude foci at a variety of telescopes. A
highly expandable software defined radio (SDR) readout that can scale up to
much larger arrays has been developed.
