Given an n x n matrix A, we present a simple, element-wise sparsification
algorithm that zeroes out all sufficiently small elements of A and then retains
some of the remaining elements with probabilities proportional to the square of
their magnitudes. We analyze the approximation accuracy of the proposed
algorithm using a recent, elegant non-commutative Bernstein inequality, and
compare our bounds with all existing (to the best of our knowledge)
element-wise matrix sparsification algorithms.
