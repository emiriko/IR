The mass of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson was constrained by the Large
Electron-Positron (LEP) collider to be above 114.4 GeV. Simple extensions of
the scalar sector like adding singlets and/or doublets allow the lightest Higgs
to be much lighter via a reduction in its coupling to gauge bosons. Such a
light Higgs could have evaded the LEP searches but could be detected at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the process pp -> h j -> tau^+ tau^- j, where j
is a resolved jet. We conclude that in some Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)
extensions of the scalar sector, a very light Higgs state could be detected at
the 14 TeV LHC with early data.
