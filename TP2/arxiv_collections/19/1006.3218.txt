We present a census of molecular outflows across four active regions of star
formation in the Perseus molecular cloud (NGC 1333, IC348/HH211, L1448 and
L1455), totalling an area of over 1000 sq arcmin. This is one of the largest
surveys of outflow evolution in a single molecular cloud published to date. We
analyse large-scale, sensitive CO J=3-2 datasets from the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope, including new data towards NGC 1333. Where possible we make use of
our complementary 13CO and C18O data to correct for the 12CO optical depth and
measure ambient cloud properties. Of the 65 submillimetre cores in our fields,
we detect outflows towards 45. We compare various parameters between the
outflows from Class 0 and I protostars, including their mass, momentum, energy
and momentum flux. Class 0 outflows are longer, faster, more massive and have
more energy than Class I outflows. The dynamical time-scales we derive from
these outflows are uncorrelated to the age of the outflow driving source,
computed from the protostar's bolometric temperature. We confirm the results of
Bontemps et al., that outflows decrease in force as they age, suggesting a
decline in the mass accretion rate. If F_rad=L_bol/c is the flux expected in
radiation from the central source, then F_CO(Class I)~100F_rad and F_CO(Class
0)~1000F_rad. Finally, we note that the total energy contained in outflows in
NGC 1333, L1448 and L1455 is greater than the estimated turbulent energy in the
respective regions, which may have implications for the regions' evolution.
