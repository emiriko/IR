We present an extended structural study of globular complexes made by mixing
a positively charge protein (lysozyme) and a negatively charged polyelectrolyte
(PSS). We study the influence of all the parameters that may act on the
structure of the complexes (charge densities and concentration of the species,
partial hydrophobicity of the polyion chain, ionic strength). The structures on
a 15 scale range lying from 10{\AA} to 1000{\AA} are measured by SANS. Whatever
the conditions, the same structure is found, based on the formation of dense
globules of ~ 100{\AA} with a neutral core and a volume fraction of organic
species (compacity) of ~ 0.3. At higher scale, the globules are arranged in
fractal aggregates. Zetametry measurements show that globular complexes have a
total positive charge when the charge ratio of species introduced in the
mixture [-]/[+]intro > 1 and a total 20 negative charge when [-]/[+]intro < 1.
This comes from the presence of charged species in slight excess in a layer at
the surface of the globules. The globule finite size is determined by the Debye
length k-1 whatever the way the physicochemical parameters are modified in the
system, as long as chain-protein interactions are of simple electrostatics
nature. The mean number of proteins per primary complex Nlyso_comp grows
exponentially on a master curve with k-1. This enables to picture 25 the
mechanisms of formation of the complexes. There is an initial stage of
formation where the growth of the complexes is only driven by attractions
between opposite species associated with counterion release. During the growth
of the complexes, the globules progressively repell themselves by electrostatic
repulsion because their charge increases. When this repulsion becomes dominent
in the system, globules stop growing and behave like charged colloids: they
aggregate 30 with a RLCA process, which leads to the formation of fractal
aggregates of dimension Df 2.1.
