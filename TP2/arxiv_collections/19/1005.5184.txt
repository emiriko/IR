We propose a predictive standard model for heavy electron systems based on a
detailed phenomenological two-fluid description of existing experimental data.
It leads to a new phase diagram that replaces the Doniach picture, describes
the emergent anomalous scaling behavior of the heavy electron (Kondo) liquid
measured below the lattice coherence temperature, T*, seen by many different
experimental probes, that marks the onset of collective hybridization, and
enables one to obtain important information on quantum criticality and the
superconducting/antiferromagnetic states at low temperatures. Because T* is
~J^2\rho/2, the nearest neighbor RKKY interaction, a knowledge of the
single-ion Kondo coupling, J, to the background conduction electron density of
states, \rho, makes it possible to predict Kondo liquid behavior, and to
estimate its maximum superconducting transition temperature in both existing
and newly discovered heavy electron families.
