It is shown that, modulo the automorphisms which fix the canonical diagonal
MASA point-wise, the group of those automorphisms of the Cuntz algebra O_n
which globally preserve both the diagonal and the core UHF-subalgebra is
isomorphic, via restriction, with the group of those homeomorphisms of the full
one-sided n-shift space which eventually commute along with their inverses with
the shift transformation. The image of this group in the outer automorphism
group of O_n can be embedded into the quotient of the automorphism group of the
full two-sided n-shift by its center, generated by the shift. If n is prime
then this embedding is an isomorphism.
