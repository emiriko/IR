We defined a sub-sample of twelve GPS sources which have not been observed
with the VLBI before, from the Parkes half-Jansky sample, and carried out VLBI
observations at 1.6 GHz and 5 GHz with the European VLBI Network (EVN) in 2006
and 2008, respectively, to classify the source structure and to find compact
symmetric objects (CSOs). Additionally, we carried out the 4.85 GHz flux
density observations for these sources with the Urumqi 25-m telescope between
the years 2007 and 2009 to study whether there is any variability in the total
flux density of the GPS sources. The results of the 5 GHz VLBI observations and
total flux densities of these sources are presented in this paper. From the
VLBI morphologies, the spectral indices of components and the total flux
variability of the twelve targets, we firmly classify three sources J0210+0419,
J1135$-$0021, and J2058+0540 as CSOs, and classify J1057+0012, J1203+0414, and
J1600$-$0037 as core-jet sources. The others J0323+0534, J0433$-$0229,
J0913+1454, J1109+1043, and J1352+0232 are labelled CSO candidates, and
J1352+1107 is a complex feature. Apart from core-jet sources, the total flux
densities of the CSOs and candidates are quite stable at 5 GHz both during a
long-term of $\sim$20 years relative to the PKS90 data and in a period between
2007 and 2009. The total flux densities are resolved-out by more than 20\% in
the 5 GHz VLBI images for 6 sources, probably because of diffuse emission. In
addition, we estimated the jet viewing angles $\Theta$ for the confirmed CSOs
by using the double-lobe flux ratio of the sources, the result being indicative
of relatively large $\Theta$ for the CSOs.
