We present the latest CDF searches for the Standard Model Higgs boson with
1.96 TeV center-of-mass energy collisions produced at the Fermilab Tevatron.
The data was collected with the CDF II detector at the Tevatron collider and
correspond to an integrated luminosity from 2 to 4.8 1/fb. To achieve maximal
sensitivity, many channels are analyzed including final states from gluon
fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with W and Z bosons.
