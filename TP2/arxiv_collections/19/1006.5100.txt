We define a testing equivalence in the spirit of De Nicola and Hennessy for
reactive probabilistic processes, i.e. for processes where the internal
nondeterminism is due to random behaviour. We characterize the testing
equivalence in terms of ready-traces. From the characterization it follows that
the equivalence is insensitive to the exact moment in time in which an internal
probabilistic choice occurs, which is inherent from the original testing
equivalence of De Nicola and Hennessy. We also show decidability of the testing
equivalence for finite systems for which the complete model may not be known.
