Various types of Lagrange and Finsler geometries and the Einstein gravity
theory, and modifications, can be modelled by nonholonomic distributions on
tangent bundles/ manifolds when the fundamental geometric objects are adapted
to nonlinear connection structures. We can convert such geometries and physical
theories into almost Kahler/ Poisson structures on (co)tangent bundles. This
allows us to apply the Fedosov quantization formalism to almost symplectic
connections induced by Lagrange-Finsler and/or Einstein fundamental geometric
objects. There are constructed respective nonholonomic versions of the trace
density maps for the zeroth Hochschild homology of deformation quantization of
distinguished algebras (in this work, adapted to nonlinear connection
structure). Our main result consists in an algebraic index theorem for
Lagrange-Finsler and Einstein spaces. Finally, we show how the Einstein field
equations for gravity theories and geometric mechanics models can be imbedded
into the formalism of deformation quantization and index theorem.
