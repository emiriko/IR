We present a qualitatively new approach to discover Higgs bosons of the MSSM
at the LHC using jet substructure techniques applied to boosted Higgs decays.
These techniques are ideally suited to the MSSM, since the lightest Higgs boson
overwhelmingly decays to $b\bar{b}$ throughout the entire parameter space,
while the heavier neutral Higgs bosons, if light enough to be produced in a
cascade, also predominantly decay to $b\bar{b}$. The Higgs production we
consider arises from superpartner production where superpartners cascade decay
into Higgs bosons. We study this mode of Higgs production for several
superpartner hierarchies: $m_{\tilde{q}}, m_{\tilde g} >
m_{\tilde{W},\tilde{B}} > m_h + \mu$; $m_{\tilde{q}}, m_{\tilde g} >
m_{\tilde{W},\tilde{B}} > m_{h,H,A} + \mu$; and $m_{\tilde{q}}, m_{\tilde g} >
m_{\tilde{W}} > m_h + \mu$ with $m_{\tilde{B}} \simeq \mu$. In these cascades,
the Higgs bosons are boosted, with $p_T > 200$ GeV a large fraction of the
time. Since Higgs bosons appear in cascades originating from squarks and/or
gluinos, the cross section for events with at least one Higgs boson can be the
same order as squark/gluino production. Given 10 fb$^{-1}$ of 14 TeV LHC data,
with $m_{\tilde{q}} \lsim 1$ TeV, and one of the above superpartner mass
hierarchies, our estimate of $S/\sqrt{B}$ of the Higgs signal is sufficiently
high that the $b\bar{b}$ mode can become the discovery mode of the lightest
Higgs boson of the MSSM.
