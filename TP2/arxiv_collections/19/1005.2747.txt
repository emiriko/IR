The experimental conditions leading to substantial reduction of
backscattering decay instability threshold in ECRH experiments in toroidal
devices are analyzed. It is shown that drastic decrease of threshold is
provided by non monotonic behavior of plasma density in the vicinity of
magnetic island and poloidal magnetic field inhomogeneity making possible
localization of ion Bernstein decay waves. The corresponding ion Bernstein wave
gain and the parametric decay instability pump power threshold is calculated.
