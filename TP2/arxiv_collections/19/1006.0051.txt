We present a method for estimating the complexity of an image based on
Bennett's concept of logical depth. Bennett identified logical depth as the
appropriate measure of organized complexity, and hence as being better suited
to the evaluation of the complexity of objects in the physical world. Its use
results in a different, and in some sense a finer characterization than is
obtained through the application of the concept of Kolmogorov complexity alone.
We use this measure to classify images by their information content. The method
provides a means for classifying and evaluating the complexity of objects by
way of their visual representations. To the authors' knowledge, the method and
application inspired by the concept of logical depth presented herein are being
proposed and implemented for the first time.
