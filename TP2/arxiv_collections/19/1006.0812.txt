Wishart correlation matrices are the standard model for the statistical
analysis of time series. The ensemble averaged eigenvalue density is of
considerable practical and theoretical interest. For complex time series and
correlation matrices, the eigenvalue density is known exactly. In the real
case, however, a fundamental mathematical obstacle made it forbidingly
complicated to obtain exact results. We use the supersymmetry method to fully
circumvent this problem. We present an exact formula for the eigenvalue density
in the real case in terms of twofold integrals and finite sums.
