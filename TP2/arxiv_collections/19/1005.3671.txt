Magnetic field and time induced steps have been observed in the recently
discovered ternary silicide R6Co1.67Si3. Huge relaxation steps are observed
across different loops in the low temperature magnetization isotherms. Giant
relaxation present in this system indicates the existence of incubation time to
get the saturated moment at a certain field. Measurement protocol sensitive
magnetization behavior observed in this system may arise from the strong
magnetostructural coupling and/or magnetic frustration. Electrical resistivity
and magnetoresistance also reflect the magnetic state of the compound.
Magnetocaloric effect is found to be large at temperatures close to the
magnetic transition temperature.
