We show that systems driven by an external force and described by Nose-Hoover
dynamics allow for a consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamics description when
the thermostatted variable is initially assumed in a state of canonical
equilibrium. By treating the "real" variables as the system and the
thermostatted variable as the reservoir, we establish the first and second law
of thermodynamics. As for Hamiltonian systems, the entropy production can be
expressed as a relative entropy measuring the system-reservoir correlations
established during the dynamics.
