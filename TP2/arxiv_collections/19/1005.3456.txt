We develop a unified, information theoretic interpretation of the
number-phase complementarity that is applicable both to finite-dimensional
(atomic) and infinite-dimensional (oscillator) systems. The relevant
uncertainty principle is obtained as a lower bound on {\it entropy excess}, the
difference between number entropy and phase knowledge, the latter defined as
the relative entropy with respect to the uniform distribution.
