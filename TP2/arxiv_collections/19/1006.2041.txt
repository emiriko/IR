We demonstrate compression of 95 keV, space-charge-dominated electron bunches
to sub-100 fs durations. These bunches have sufficient charge (200 fC) and are
of sufficient quality to capture a diffraction pattern with a single shot,
which we demonstrate by a diffraction experiment on a polycrystalline gold
foil. Compression is realized by means of velocity bunching as a result of a
velocity chirp, induced by the oscillatory longitudinal electric field of a 3
GHz radio-frequency cavity. The arrival time jitter is measured to be 80 fs.
