In this paper, we use coronal and heliospheric images from the STEREO
spacecraft to track streamer blobs into the heliosphere and to observe them
being swept up and compressed by the fast wind from low-latitude coronal holes.
From an analysis of their elongation/time tracks, we discover a 'locus of
enhanced visibility' where neighboring blobs pass each other along the line of
sight and their corotating spiral is seen edge on. The detailed shape of this
locus accounts for a variety of east-west asymmetries and allows us to
recognize the spiral of blobs by its signatures in the STEREO images: In the
eastern view from STEREO-A, the leading edge of the spiral is visible as a
moving wavefront where foreground ejections overtake background ejections
against the sky and then fade. In the western view from STEREO-B, the leading
edge is only visible close to the Sun-spacecraft line where the radial path of
ejections nearly coincides with the line of sight. In this case, we can track
large-scale waves continuously back to the lower corona and see that they
originate as face-on blobs.
