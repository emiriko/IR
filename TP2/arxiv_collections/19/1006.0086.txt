We present an optimized geometry for a 1.3 GHz superconducting cavity in
which the surface electromagnetic fields have been minimized and the bandwidth
of the fundamental mode has been maximized. We refer to this design as the New
Low Surface Field (NLSF) cavity. Earlier work focused on properties of the
fundamental mode. Here we additionally study higher order modes (HOMs), means
of damping them, and short range wake fields. A two-band circuit model is
employed in order to facilitate rapid characterization of cavity HOMs.
