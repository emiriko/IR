We performed first-principle calculations on the exchange interaction (EI)
between atoms in BCC-Fe strained volumetrically. Our results show that the
volume-dependence of the EI deviates considerably from the Bethe-Slater curve.
This behavior is discussed in terms of the on-site and/or inter-site direct
exchange interactions between electrons.
