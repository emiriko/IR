QED-model for the multichain qubit system with interactions of qubits and
chains between themselves on the example of the system of $\sigma$-polarons in
carbon zigzag nanotubes, interacting with quantized EM-field, is considered
analytically. The possibility of experimental detection of Rabi waves in
conventional stationary optical experiments for any quasi-1D system with strong
electron-photon interaction is predicted.
