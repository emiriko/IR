We delve deeper into the study of semimartingale attractors that we recently
introduced in Allouba and Langa \cite{AL0}. In this article we focus on second
order SPDEs of the Allen-Cahn type. After proving existence, uniqueness, and
detailed regularity results for our SPDEs and a corresponding random PDE of
Allen-Cahn type, we prove the existence of semimartingale global attractors for
these equations. We also give some results on the finite dimensional asymptotic
behavior of the solutions. In particular, we show the finite fractal dimension
of this random attractor and give a result on determining modes, both in the
forward and the pullback sense.
