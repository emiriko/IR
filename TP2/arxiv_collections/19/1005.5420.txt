An SU(2) lattice gauge theory with two doublets of complex scalar fields is
considered. All continuous symmetries are identified and, using the
nonperturbative methods of lattice field theory, the phase diagram is mapped
out by direct numerical simulation. Two-doublet models contain phase
transitions that separate qualitatively distinct regions of the parameter
space. In some regions global symmetries are spontaneously broken. For some
special choices of the model parameters, the symmetry-breaking order parameter
is calculated. The pattern of symmetry breaking is verified further through
observation of Goldstone bosons.
