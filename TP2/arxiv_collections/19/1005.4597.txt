We investigate under which conditions we can expect to observe quantum
brownian motion in a microscope. Using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we
investigate quantum brownian motion in an ohmic bath, and estimate temporal and
spatial accuracy required to observe a crossover from classical to quantum
behavior.
