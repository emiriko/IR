The interaction of intense extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses
($\lambda=32\rm\,nm$, $I=10^{11-14}$\,W/cm$^2$) with small rare-gas clusters
(Ar$_{147}$) is studied by quasi-classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our
analysis supports a very general picture of the charging and heating dynamics
in finite samples under short-wavelength radiation that is of relevance for
several applications of free-electron lasers. First, up to a certain photon
flux, ionization proceeds as a series of direct photoemission events producing
a jellium-like cluster potential and a characteristic plateau in the
photoelectron spectrum as observed in [Bostedt {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 100}, 013401 (2008)]. Second, beyond the onset of photoelectron trapping,
nanoplasma formation leads to evaporative electron emission with a
characteristic thermal tail in the electron spectrum. A detailed analysis of
this transition is presented. Third, in contrast to the behavior in the
infrared or low vacuum ultraviolet range, the nanoplasma energy capture
proceeds via {\it ionization heating}, i.e., inner photoionization of localized
electrons, whereas collisional heating of conduction electrons is negligible up
to high laser intensities. A direct consequence of the latter is a surprising
evolution of the mean energy of emitted electrons as function of laser
intensity.
