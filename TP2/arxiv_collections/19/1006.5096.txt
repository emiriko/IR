The weakest pre-expectation calculus has been proved to be a mature theory to
analyze quantitative properties of probabilistic and nondeterministic programs.
We present an automatic method for proving quantitative linear properties on
any denumerable state space using iterative backwards fixed point calculation
in the general framework of abstract interpretation. In order to accomplish
this task we present the technique of random variable abstraction (RVA) and we
also postulate a sufficient condition to achieve exact fixed point computation
in the abstract domain. The feasibility of our approach is shown with two
examples, one obtaining the expected running time of a probabilistic program,
and the other the expected gain of a gambling strategy.
  Our method works on general guarded probabilistic and nondeterministic
transition systems instead of plain pGCL programs, allowing us to easily model
a wide range of systems including distributed ones and unstructured programs.
We present the operational and weakest precondition semantics for this programs
and prove its equivalence.
