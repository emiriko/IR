The temporal evolution of systems undergoing symmetry breaking phase
transitions (SBTs) is of great fundamental interest not only in condensed
matter physics, but extends from cosmology to brain function and finance
\cite{topology,Kibble,Eltsov,Finance}. However, the study of such transitions
is often hindered by the fact that they are difficult to repeat, or they occur
very rapidly. Here we report for the first time on a high-time-resolution study
of the evolution of both bosonic and fermionic excitations through a second
order electronic charge-ordering SBT in a condensed matter system. Using a new
three-pulse femtosecond spectroscopy technique, we periodically quench our
model system into the high-symmetry state, detecting hitherto unrecorded
coherent aperiodic undulations of the order parameter (OP), critical slowing
down of the collective mode, and evolution of the particle-hole gap appearing
through the Peierls-BCS mechanism as the system evolves through the transition.
Numerical modeling based on Ginzburg-Landau theory is used to reproduce the
observations without free parameters. The close analogy with other Higgs
potentials in particle physics\cite{Higgs} gives new insight into hitherto
unexplored dynamics of both single particle and collective excitations through
a SBT. Of particular interest is the observation of spectro-temporal
distortions caused by disturbances of the field arising from spontaneous
annihilation of topological defects, similar to those discussed by the
Kibble-Zurek cosmological model.
