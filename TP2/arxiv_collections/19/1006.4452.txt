We make use of O(2r+1) spinning particle models to construct linearized
higher-spin curvatures in (A)dS spaces for fields of arbitrary half-integer
spin propagating in a space of arbitrary (even) dimension: the field
potentials, whose curvatures are computed with the present models, are
spinor-tensors of mixed symmetry corresponding to Young tableaux with D/2 - 1
rows and r columns, thus reducing to totally symmetric spinor-tensors in four
dimensions. The paper generalizes similar results obtained in the context of
integer spins in (A)dS.
