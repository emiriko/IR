We study the local factor at p of the semi-simple zeta function of a Shimura
variety of Drinfeld type for a level structure given at p by the pro-unipotent
radical of an Iwahori subgroup. Our method is an adaptation to this case of the
Langlands-Kottwitz counting method. We use Hecke algebra isomorphisms to
determine the test functions at p.
