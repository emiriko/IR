High efficiency collection of photons emitted by a point source over a wide
field-of-view (FoV) is crucial for many applications. Multi-scale optics over
improved light collection by utilizing small optical components placed close to
the optical source, while maintaining a wide FoV provided by conventional
imaging optics. In this work, we demonstrate collection efficiency of 26% of
photons emitted by a point-like source using a micromirror fabricated in
silicon with no significant decrease in collection efficiency over a 10 mm
object space.
