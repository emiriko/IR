This paper proposes a new methodological framework within which the heat
conductance in 1D lattices can be studied. The total process of heat
conductance is separated into two parts where the first one is the equilibrium
process at equal temperatures $T$ of both ends and the second one --
non-equilibrium with the temperature $\Delta T$ of one end and zero temperature
of the other. This approach allows significant decrease of computational time
at $\Delta T \to 0$. The threshold temperature $T_{\rm thr}$ is found which
scales $T_{\rm thr}(N) \sim N^{-3}$ with the lattice size $N$ and by convention
separates two mechanisms of heat conductance: phonon mechanism dominates at $T
< T_{\rm thr}$ and the soliton contribution increases with temperature at $T >
T_{\rm thr}$. Solitons and breathers are directly visualized in numerical
experiments. The problem of heat conductance in non-linear lattices in the
limit $\Delta T \to 0$ can be reduced to the heat conductance of harmonic
lattice with time-dependent stochastic rigidities determined by the equilibrium
process at temperature $T$. The detailed analysis is done for the $\beta$-FPU
lattice though main results are valid for one-dimensional lattices with
arbitrary potentials.
