We study the possibility that the Kaluza-Klein monopole (KK6) world-volume
action may be obtained from the multiple membranes (M2) action which is
described by BLG theory. We first point out that the infinite dimensional Lie
3-algebra based on the Nambu-Poisson structure could not only provide three
dimensional manifolds to allow M5 from M2, which was studied by previous
authors, but also provide five dimensional manifolds to allow KK6 from M2. We
next present a possible way that the U(1) field on KK6 world-volume action
could be produced form the gauge potential in BLG theory.
