Without any analytical assumption we solve the ladder QED2+1 in Minkowski
space. Obtained complex fermion propagator exhibits confinement in the sense
that it has no pole. Further, we transform Greens functions to the Temporal
Euclidean space, wherein we show that in the special case of ladder QED2+1 the
solution is fully equivalent to the Minkowski one. Obvious invalidity of Wick
rotation is briefly discussed. The infrared value of the dynamical mass is
compared with other known approaches, e.g. with the standard Euclidean
calculation.
