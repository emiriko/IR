Secret sharing in user hierarchy represents a challenging area for research.
Although a lot of work has already been done in this direc- tion, this paper
presents a novel approach to share a secret among a hierarchy of users while
overcoming the limitations of the already exist- ing mechanisms. Our work is
based on traditional (k +1; n)-threshold secret sharing, which is secure as
long as an adversary can compromise not more than k secret shares. But in real
life it is often feasible for an adversary to obtain more than k shares over a
long period of time. So, in our work we also present a way to overcome this
vulnerability, while implementing our hierarchical secret sharing scheme. The
use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography makes the computations easier and faster in
our work.
