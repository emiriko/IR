Fidelity is known to increase through any Kraus map: the fidelity between two
density matrices is less than the fidelity between their images via a Kraus
map. We prove here that, in average, fidelity is also increasing for any
discrete-time quantum filter: fidelity between the density matrix of the
underlying Markov chain and the density matrix of its associated quantum filter
is a sub-martingale. This result is not restricted to pure states. It also
holds true for mixed states.
