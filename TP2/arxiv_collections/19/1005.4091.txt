Symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures
(SIC-POVMs) are studied within the framework of the probability representation
of quantum mechanics. A SIC-POVM is shown to be a special case of the
probability representation. The problem of SIC-POVM existence is formulated in
terms of symbols of operators associated with a star-product quantization
scheme. We show that SIC-POVMs (if they do exist) must obey general rules of
the star product, and, starting from this fact, we derive new relations on
SIC-projectors. The case of qubits is considered in detail, in particular, the
relation between the SIC probability representation and other probability
representations is established, the connection with mutually unbiased bases is
discussed, and comments to the Lie algebraic structure of SIC-POVMs are
presented.
