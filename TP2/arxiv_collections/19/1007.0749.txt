One can always write the mass matrix for Weyl spinors so that it is
symmetric. However this is often not a good idea. It is usually incompatible
with irreducibility of the fermion representations. As a result, a symmetrized
mass term hides important symmetries and creates misleading difficulties that
are not genuinely part of the theory. This is true for the Standard Model for
example, and for its supersymmetric versions. There is a related subtlety,
involving symmetrization of the interaction terms, that is central to the SUSY
breaking mechanism of Cybersusy.
