The narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H0707-495 has previously been identified as
showing time lags between flux variations in the soft- (0.3-1 keV) and
medium-energy (1-4 keV) X-ray bands that oscillate between positive and
negative values as a function of the frequency of the mode of variation. Here
we measure and analyse the lags also between a harder X-ray band (4-7.5 keV)
and the soft and medium bands, using existing XMM-Newton data, and demonstrate
that the entire spectrum of lags, considering both the full energy range,
0.3-7.5 keV, and the full frequency range, 10^-5 < nu < 10^-2 Hz, are
inconsistent with previous claims of arising as reverberation associated with
the inner accretion disk. Instead we demonstrate that a simple reverberation
model, in which scattering or reflection is present in all X-ray bands,
explains the full set of lags without requiring any ad hoc explanation for the
time lag sign changes. The range of time delays required to explain the
observed lags extends up to about 1800 s in the hard band. The results are
consistent with reverberation caused by scattering of X-rays passing through an
absorbing medium whose opacity decreases with increasing energy and that
partially-covers the source. A high covering factor of absorbing and scattering
circumnuclear material is inferred.
