The efficiency of photodesorption of Rb atoms previously collected on polymer
organic film has been studied in detail. This study was carried out in a Pyrex
glass cell of which the inner surface was covered with (poly)dimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) film and illuminated by a powerful flash lamp. The desorption dynamic of
the Rb atoms density in the cell caused by the illumination and percentage of
desorbed atoms was studied by using of Rb resonance lamp and free running diode
laser as sources of probing light. It was determined that 85 percent collected
chemical active Rb atoms and stored during 16 seconds in the closed cell, 75
percent in the pumped cell can be desorbed by single flash of the lamp. The
number of stored atoms decays with a characteristic time of 60 min in isolated
cell and with a time 12.4 minutes in a pumped cell. We believe that this
efficient method of collection and fast realization of atoms or molecules could
be used for enhancement of sensitivity of existed sensors for the trace
detection of various elements (including toxic or radioactive ones) which is
important to environmental applications, medicine or in geology. The effect
might help to construct an efficient light-driven atomic source for a
magneto-optical trap in a case of extremely low vapor density or very weak flux
of atoms, such as artificial radioactive alkali atoms.
