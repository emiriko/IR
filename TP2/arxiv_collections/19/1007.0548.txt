Music Sight Reading is a complex process in which when it is occurred in the
brain some learning attributes would be emerged. Besides giving a model based
on actor-critic method in the Reinforcement Learning, the agent is considered
to have a neural network structure. We studied on where the sight reading
process is happened and also a serious problem which is how the synaptic
weights would be adjusted through the learning process. The model we offer here
is a computational model on which an updated weights equation to fix the
weights is accompanied too.
