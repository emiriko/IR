We show that molecular dynamics based moves in the Minima Hopping (MH) method
are more efficient than saddle point crossing moves which select the lowest
possible saddle point. For binary systems we incorporate identity exchange
moves in a way that allows to avoid the generation of high energy
configurations. Using this modified Minima Hopping method we reexamine the
binary Lennard Jones (BLJ) benchmark system with up to 100 atoms and we find a
large number of new putative global minima structures.
