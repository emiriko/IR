The melting of a binary system of charged particles confined in a {\it
quasi}-one-dimensional parabolic channel is studied through Monte Carlo
simulations. At zero temperature the particles are ordered in parallel chains.
The melting is anisotropic and different melting temperatures are obtained
according to the spatial direction, and the different types of particles
present in the system. Melting is very different for the single-, two- and
four-chain configurations. A temperature induced structural phase transition is
found between two different four chain ordered states which is absent in the
mono-disperse system. In the mixed regime, where the two types of particles are
only slightly different, melting is almost isotropic and a thermally induced
homogeneous distribution of the distinct types of charges is observed.
