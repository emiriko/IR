We present the dust properties of a small sample of Virgo cluster dwarf
galaxies drawn from the science demonstration phase data set of the Herschel
Virgo Cluster Survey. These galaxies have low metallicities (7.8 < 12 +
log(O/H) < 8.3) and star-formation rates < 10^{-1} M_{sun}/yr. We measure the
spectral energy distribution (SED) from 100 to 500 um and derive dust
temperatures and dust masses. The SEDs are fitted by a cool component of
temperature T < 20 K, implying dust masses around 10^{5} M_{sun} and
dust-to-gas ratios D within the range 10^{-3}-10^{-2}. The completion of the
full survey will yield a larger set of galaxies, which will provide more
stringent constraints on the dust content of star-forming dwarf galaxies.
