FU Tau belongs to a rare class of young, wide brown dwarf binaries. We have
resolved the system in a Chandra X-ray observation and detected only the
primary, FU Tau A. Hard X-ray emission, presumably from a corona, is present
but, unexpectedly, we detect also a strong and unusually soft component from FU
Tau A. Its X-ray properties, so far unique among brown dwarfs, are very similar
to those of the T Tauri star TW Hya. The analogy with TW Hya suggests that the
dominating soft X-ray component can be explained by emission from accretion
shocks. However, the typical free-fall velocities of a brown dwarf are too low
for an interpretation of the observed X-ray temperature as post-shock region.
On the other hand, velocities in excess of the free-fall speed are derived from
archival optical spectroscopy, and independent pieces of evidence for strong
accretion in FU Tau A are found in optical photometry. The high X-ray
luminosity of FU Tau A coincides with a high bolometric luminosity confirming
an unexplained trend among young brown dwarfs. In fact, FU Tau A is
overluminous with respect to evolutionary models while FU Tau B is on the 1 Myr
isochrone suggesting non-contemporaneous formation of the two components in the
binary. The extreme youth of FU Tau A could be responsible for its peculiar
X-ray properties, in terms of atypical magnetic activity or accretion.
Alternatively, rotation and magnetic field effects may reduce the efficiency of
convection which in turn affects the effective temperature and radius of FU Tau
A shifting its position in the HR diagram. Although there is no direct prove of
this latter scenario so far we present arguments for its plausibility.
