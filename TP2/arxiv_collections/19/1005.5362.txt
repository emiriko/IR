The bright and highly variable X-ray and radio source known as Cygnus X-3 was
among the first X-ray sources discovered, yet it remains in many ways an
enigma. Its known to consist of a massive, Wolf-Rayet primary in an extremely
tight orbit with a compact object. Yet one of the most basic of parameters -
the mass of the compact object - is not known. Nor is it even clear whether its
is a neutron star or a black hole. In this Paper we present our analysis of the
broad-band high-energy continua covering a substantial range in luminosity and
spectral morphology. We apply these results to a recently identified scaling
relationship which has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of the
compact object mass in a number of accretion powered binaries. This analysis
leads us to conclude that the compact object in Cygnus X-3 has a mass greater
than $4.2M_\odot$ thus clearly indicative of a black hole and as such resolving
a long-standing issue. The full range of uncertainty in our analysis and from
using a range of recently published distance estimates constrains the compact
object mass to lie between $4.2M_\odot$ and $14.4M_\odot$. Our favored
estimate, based on a 9.0 kpc distance estimate is $\sim 10 M_\odot$ with the
error margin of 3.2 solar masses. This result may thus pose challenges to
shared-envelope evolutionary models of compact binaries, as well as
establishing Cygnus X-3 as the first confirmed accretion-powered galactic
gamma-ray source.
