The Planck experiment will soon provide a very accurate measurement of Cosmic
Microwave Background anisotropies. This will let cosmologists determine most of
the cosmological parameters with unprecedented accuracy. Future experiments
will improve and complement the Planck data with better angular resolution and
better polarization sensitivity. This unexplored region of the CMB power
spectrum contains information on many parameters of interest, including
neutrino mass, the number of relativistic particles at recombination, the
primordial Helium abundance and the injection of additional ionizing photons by
dark matter self-annihilation. We review the imprint of each parameter on the
CMB and forecast the constraints achievable by future experiments by performing
a Monte Carlo analysis on synthetic realizations of simulated data. We find
that next generation satellite missions such as CMBPol could provide valuable
constraints with a precision close to that expected in current and near future
laboratory experiments. Finally, we discuss the implications of this
intersection between cosmology and fundamental physics.
