We study the effect of quenched randomness in the arc-length dependent
spontaneous curvature of a wormlike chain under tension. In the weakly bending
approximation in two dimensions, we obtain analytic results for the
force-elongation curve and the width of transverse fluctuations. We compare
quenched and annealed disorder and conclude that the former cannot always be
reduced to a simple change in the stiffness of the pure system. We also discuss
the effect of a random transverse force on the stretching response of a
wormlike chain without spontaneous curvature.
