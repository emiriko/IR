We study spin dynamics in a two-dimensional electron gas with a pure gauge
non-Abelian spin-orbit field, for which systems with balanced Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings, and the (110)-axis grown GaAs quantum wells
are typical examples. We demonstrate the duality of the spin evolution and the
electron-density dynamics in a system without spin-orbit coupling, which
considerably simplifies and deepens the analysis of spin-dependent processes.
This duality opens a venue for the understanding of this class of systems,
highly interesting for their applications in spintronics, through known
properties of the systems without spin-orbit coupling.
