We study the invariance under duality transformations in massless and massive
$p-$form field theories and obtain the Noether generators of the infinitesimal
transformations that correspond to this symmetry. These generators are realized
in geometrical representations that generalize the Loop Representation of the
Maxwell field, allowing for a geometrical interpretation which is studied.
