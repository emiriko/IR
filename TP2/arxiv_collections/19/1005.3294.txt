Bose-Einstein correlations have been measured using samples of proton-proton
collisions at 0.9 and 2.36 TeV center-of-mass energies, recorded by the CMS
experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The signal is observed in the
form of an enhancement of pairs of same-sign charged particles with small
relative four-momentum. The size of the correlated particle emission region is
seen to increase significantly with the particle multiplicity of the event.
