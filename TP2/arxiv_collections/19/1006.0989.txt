Lightning balls are very rare natural phenomena that appear as free floating
glowing globs, usually during electric activity in the atmosphere of the Earth.
Each year, hundreds of eyewitness accounts of such strange events are reported
to local journals, police and even military authorities. In spite of the fact
that the presence of beautifully colored flaming globs bearing strong
resemblances to lightning balls was reported in a great numbers of published
papers, these experimental results considered up yet were not able to offer
information to explain the actual origin of the ball lightning. This is due to
its appearance in very rare gases and the relatively small energy involved in
its emergence. This state of the art was changed in the last time by new
laboratory experiments showing that by very quick local injection of energy it
is possible to produce in air, under controllable laboratory conditions, free
floating flaming globs, the lifetime of which substantially surpasses the time
span in which they emerged. Today the flaming globes that appear in plasmas
that transport direct current are dubbed fireballs, whereas those which appear
in plasma created by high frequency electric fields, plasmoids. In the
following we will describe some of these experimental results but also other
ones obtained in different devices were plasma is present.
