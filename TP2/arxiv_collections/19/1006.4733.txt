We propose a middleware framework for deployment and subsequent autonomic
management of component-based distributed applications. An initial deployment
goal is specified using a declarative constraint language, expressing
constraints over aspects such as component-host mappings and component
interconnection topology. A constraint solver is used to find a configuration
that satisfies the goal, and the configuration is deployed automatically. The
deployed application is instrumented to allow subsequent autonomic management.
If, during execution, the manager detects that the original goal is no longer
being met, the satisfy/deploy process can be repeated automatically in order to
generate a revised deployment that does meet the goal.
