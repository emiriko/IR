Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy, which provides access to the TeV energy
range, is a young and rapidly developing discipline. Recent discoveries in this
waveband have important consequences for a wide range of topics in astrophysics
and astroparticle physics. This article is an attempt to review the
experimental status of this field and to provide the basic formulae and
concepts required to begin the interpretation of TeV observations.
