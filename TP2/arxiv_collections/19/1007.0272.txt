Surface photometry of the quiet Sun has achieved an angular resolution of
$0".1$ with the New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory revealing
that a disproportionate fraction of the oscillatory events appear above
observed bright point-like structures. During the tracking of these structures,
we noted that the more powerful oscillatory events are cospatial with them,
indicating that observed flux tubes may be the source of many observed
oscillatory events.
