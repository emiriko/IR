The entanglement of atomic system consists of two atoms interacts with a
deformed cavity mode is quantified by the means of Bloch vectors and the cross
dyadic of the travelling state inside the cavity. For large value of the
deformation the amplitude of Bloch vectors decrease very fast and consequently
the traveling state turns into mixed state quickly. The generated entangled
state is used as quantum channel to implement quantum teleportation protocol.
It is shown that both of the deformed parameter and the number of photons
inside the cavity play a central role on controlling the fidelity of the
transmitted information.
