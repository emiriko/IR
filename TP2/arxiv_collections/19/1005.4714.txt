Functional dependencies -- traditional, approximate and conditional are of
critical importance in relational databases, as they inform us about the
relationships between attributes. They are useful in schema normalization, data
rectification and source selection. Most of these were however developed in the
context of deterministic data. Although uncertain databases have started
receiving attention, these dependencies have not been defined for them, nor are
fast algorithms available to evaluate their confidences. This paper defines the
logical extensions of various forms of functional dependencies for
probabilistic databases and explores the connections between them. We propose a
pruning-based exact algorithm to evaluate the confidence of functional
dependencies, a Monte-Carlo based algorithm to evaluate the confidence of
approximate functional dependencies and algorithms for their conditional
counterparts in probabilistic databases. Experiments are performed on both
synthetic and real data evaluating the performance of these algorithms in
assessing the confidence of dependencies and mining them from data. We believe
that having these dependencies and algorithms available for probabilistic
databases will drive adoption of probabilistic data storage in the industry.
