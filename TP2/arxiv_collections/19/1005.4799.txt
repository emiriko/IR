A nano-fabrication technique is presented which enables the fabrication of
highly tunable devices on p-type, C-doped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures
containing shallow two-dimensional hole systems. The high tunability of these
structures is provided by the complementary electrostatic effects of intrinsic
in-plane gates and evaporated metallic top-gates. Quantum point contacts
fabricated with this technique were tested by electrical conductance
spectroscopy.
