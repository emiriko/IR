The transverse acoustic wave propagating along the [100] axis of the cubic
Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (acoustic $c_{44}$ mode) is doubly degenerate. A magnetic
field applied in the direction of propagation lifts this degeneracy and leads
to the rotation of the polarization vector - the magneto-acoustic Faraday
rotation. Here, we report on the observation and analysis of the
magneto-acoustic Faraday-effect in Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ in static and pulsed
magnetic fields. We present also a theoretical model based on magnetoelastic
coupling of 4$f$ electrons to both, acoustic and optical phonons and an
effective coupling between them. This model explains the observed linear
frequency dependence of the Faraday rotation angle.
