SPIRE, the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver, is the Herschel Space
Observatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. It contains a three-band
imaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, and an imaging Fourier
transform spectrometer (FTS) covering 194-671 {\mu}m (447-1550 GHz). In this
paper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of the
SPIRE instrument using a combination of the emission from the Herschel
telescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objects
and other astronomical targets. We present the photometric, spectroscopic and
spatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the "standard"
pipelines. The overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission is
estimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for the
spectrometer. However, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of the
spectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the SPIRE
spectrometer band. The spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to be
better than 1/10th of the line FWHM. The astrometric accuracy in SPIRE maps is
found to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. The photometric
calibration of the SPIRE instrument is currently determined by a combination of
uncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the data
processing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. Improvements in
processing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performance
will lead to the final calibration accuracy of SPIRE being determined only by
uncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.
