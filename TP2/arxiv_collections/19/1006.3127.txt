We study the dynamics of false vacuum bubbles in the Brans-Dicke theory of
gravity by using the thin shell or thin wall approximation. We consider a false
vacuum bubble that has a different value for the Brans-Dicke field between the
inside false vacuum region and the outside true vacuum region. Within a certain
limit of field values, the difference of field values makes the effective
tension of the shell negative. This allows new expanding false vacuum bubbles
to be seen by the outside observer, which are disallowed in Einstein gravity.
