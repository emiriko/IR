We generate bipartite states of light which exhibit an absence of multiphoton
coincidence events between two modes amid a constant background flux. These
`correlated photon holes' are produced by mixing a coherent state and
relatively weak spontaneous parametric down-conversion using a balanced
beamsplitter. Correlated holes with arbitrarily high photon numbers may be
obtained by adjusting the relative phase and amplitude of the inputs. We
measure states of up to five photons and verify their nonclassicality. The
scheme provides a route for observation of high-photon-number nonclassical
correlations without requiring intense quantum resources.
