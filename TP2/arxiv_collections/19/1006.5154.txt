The absolute proper motions of about 275 million stars from the Kharkov XPM
catalog have been obtained by comparing their positions in the 2MASS and
USNO--A2.0 catalogs with an epoch difference of about 45 yr for
northern-hemisphere stars and about 17 yr for southern-hemisphere stars. The
zero point of the system of absolute proper motions has been determined using
1.45 million galaxies. The equatorial components of the residual rotation
vector of the ICRS/UCAC2 coordinate system relative to the system of
extragalactic sources have been determined by comparing the XPM and UCAC2
stellar proper motions: \omega_{x,y,z}=(-0.06,0.17,-0.84)+/-(0.15,0.14,0.14)
mas yr^{-1}. These parameters have been calculated using about 1 million
faintest UCAC2 stars with magnitudes R_{UCAC2}>16^m and J>14^m.7,for which the
color and magnitude equation effects are negligible.
