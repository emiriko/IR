Orbital variation in reflected starlight from exoplanets could eventually be
used to detect surface oceans. Exoplanets with rough surfaces, or dominated by
atmospheric Rayleigh scattering, should reach peak brightness in full phase,
orbital longitude = 180 deg, whereas ocean planets with transparent atmospheres
should reach peak brightness in crescent phase near OL = 30 deg. Application of
Fresnel theory to a planet with no atmosphere covered by a calm ocean predicts
a peak polarization fraction of 1 at OL = 74 deg; however, our model shows that
clouds, wind-driven waves, aerosols, absorption, and Rayleigh scattering in the
atmosphere and within the water column, dilute the polarization fraction and
shift the peak to other OLs. Observing at longer wavelengths reduces the
obfuscation of the water polarization signature by Rayleigh scattering but does
not mitigate the other effects. Planets with thick Rayleigh scattering
atmospheres reach peak polarization near OL = 90 deg, but clouds and Lambertian
surface scattering dilute and shift this peak to smaller OL. A shifted Rayleigh
peak might be mistaken for a water signature unless data from multiple
wavelength bands are available. Our calculations suggest that polarization
alone may not positively identify the presence of an ocean under an Earth-like
atmosphere; however polarization adds another dimension which can be used, in
combination with unpolarized orbital light curves and contrast ratios, to
detect extrasolar oceans, atmospheric water aerosols, and water clouds.
Additionally, the presence and direction of the polarization vector could be
used to determine planet association with the star, and constrain orbit
inclination.
