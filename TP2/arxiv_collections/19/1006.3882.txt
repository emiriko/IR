The recent developments of high intensity ultra-short laser pulses have
raised the hopes of observing Schwinger vacuum pair production which is one of
the important non-perturbative phenomena in Quantum electrodynamics (QED). The
quantitative analysis of realistic high intensity laser pulses is vital for
understanding the effect of the field parameters on the momentum spectrum of
the produced particles. In this study, we analyze chirped laser pulses with a
sub-cycle structure, and investigate the effects of the chirp parameter on the
momentum spectrum of the produced particles. The combined effect of the chirp
and carrier phase of the laser pulse is also analyzed. These effects are
qualitatively explained by investigating the turning point structure of the
potential within the framework of the complex WKB scattering approach to pair
production.
