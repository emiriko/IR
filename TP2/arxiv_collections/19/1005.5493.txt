We consider a collection of fermions in a strong magnetic field coupled by a
purely three body repulsive interaction, and predict the formation of composite
fermions, leading to a remarkably rich phase diagram containing a host of
fractional quantum Hall states, a composite fermion Fermi sea, and a pairing
transition. This is entirely unexpected, because the appearance of composite
fermions and fractional quantum Hall effect is ordinarily thought to be a
result of strong two-body repulsion. Recent theoretical and experimental
breakthroughs in ultra-cold atoms and molecules have facilitated the
realization of such a system, where this physics can be tested.
