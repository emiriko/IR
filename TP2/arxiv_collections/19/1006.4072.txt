The Ernst method of removing nodal singularities from the charged C-metric
representing uniformly accelerated black holes with mass $m$, charge $q$ and
acceleration $A$ by "adding" an electric field $E$ is generalized. Utilizing
the new form of the C-metric found recently, Ernst's simple "equilibrium"
condition $mA=qE$ valid for small accelerations is generalized for arbitrary
$A$. The nodal singularity is removed also in the case of accelerating and
rotating charged black holes, and the corresponding equilibrium condition is
determined.
