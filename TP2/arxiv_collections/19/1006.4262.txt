Unlike c-plane nitrides, ``non-polar" nitrides grown in e.g. the a-plane or
m-plane orientation encounter anisotropic in-plane strain due to the anisotropy
in the lattice and thermal mismatch with the substrate or buffer layer. Such
anisotropic strain results in a distortion of the wurtzite unit cell and
creates difficulty in accurate determination of lattice parameters and solid
phase group-III content (x_solid) in ternary alloys. In this paper we show that
the lattice distortion is orthorhombic, and outline a relatively simple
procedure for measurement of lattice parameters of non-polar group III-nitrides
epilayers from high resolution x-ray diffraction measurements. We derive an
approximate expression for x_solid taking into account the anisotropic strain.
We illustrate this using data for a-plane AlGaN, where we measure the lattice
parameters and estimate the solid phase Al content, and also show that this
method is applicable for m-plane structures as well.
