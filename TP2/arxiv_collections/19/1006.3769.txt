A new layered iron arsenide oxide (Fe2As2)(Ca5(Mg,Ti)4Oy) and its structural
derivative were found in the Fe-As-Ca-Mg-Ti-O system. The crystal structure of
(Fe2As2)(Ca5(Mg,Ti)4Oy) is identical to that of (Fe2As2)(Ca5(Sc,Ti)4Oy), which
was reported in our previous study. The lattice constants of this compound are
a = 3.86(4) A and c = 41.05(2) A. In addition, another phase with a thicker
blocking layer was found. The structure of the compound and its derivative was
tentatively assigned through STEM observation as (Fe2As2)(Ca8(Mg,Ti)6Oy) with
sextuple perovskite-type sheets divided by a rock salt layer. The interlayer
Fe-Fe distance of this compound is ~30 A. The compound and its derivative
exhibited bulk superconductivity, as found from magnetization and resistivity
measurements.
