SrRietveld is a highly automated software toolkit for Rietveld refinement.
Compared to traditional refinement programs, it is more efficient to use and
easier to learn. It is designed for modern high throughput diffractometers and
capable of processing large numbers of data-sets with minimal effort. The new
software currently uses conventional Rietveld refinement engines, automating
GSAS and FullProf refinements. However, as well as automating and extending
many tasks associated with these programs, it is designed in a flexible and
extensible way so that in the future these engines can be replaced with new
refinement engines as they become available. SrRietveld is an open source
software package developed in Python.
