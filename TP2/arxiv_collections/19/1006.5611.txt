Cosmological phase transitions accompanied by some kind of symmetry breaking
would cause the creation of topological defects and the resulting production of
primordial magnetic field. Moreover, such a procedure inevitably affects the
cosmic background radiation and it may be observed today. Motivated by the
existence of stabilized embedded defects in the standard model of elementary
interactions, we discuss their application to the cosmological electromagnetic
field generation.
