Within time-dependent density functional theory, combined with the
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green functions, we devise a real space method to
investigate spin dynamics. Our scheme enables one to deduce the Coulomb
potential which assures a proper Goldstone mode is present. We illustrate with
application to 3$d$ adatoms and dimers on Cu(100).
