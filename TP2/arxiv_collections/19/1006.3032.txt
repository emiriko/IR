The I3322 inequality is the simplest bipartite two-outcome Bell inequality
beyond the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, consisting of three
two-outcome measurements per party. In case of the CHSH inequality the maximal
quantum violation can already be attained with local two-dimensional quantum
systems, however, there is no such evidence for the I3322 inequality. In this
paper a family of measurement operators and states is given which enables us to
attain the largest possible quantum value in an infinite dimensional Hilbert
space. Further, it is conjectured that our construction is optimal in the sense
that measuring finite dimensional quantum systems is not enough to achieve the
true quantum maximum. We also describe an efficient iterative algorithm for
computing quantum maximum of an arbitrary two-outcome Bell inequality in any
given Hilbert space dimension. This algorithm played a key role to obtain our
results for the I3322 inequality, and we also applied it to improve on our
previous results concerning the maximum quantum violation of several bipartite
two-outcome Bell inequalities with up to five settings per party.
