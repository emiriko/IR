In this paper a new multiscale modeling technique is proposed. It relies on a
recently introduced measure-theoretic approach, which allows to manage the
microscopic and the macroscopic scale under a unique framework. In the
resulting coupled model the two scales coexist and share information. This
allows to perform numerical simulations in which the trajectories and the
density of the particles affect each other. Crowd dynamics is the motivating
application throughout the paper.
