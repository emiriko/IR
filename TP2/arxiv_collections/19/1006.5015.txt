For the first time it has become possible to compare global 3D general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) jet formation simulations directly to
very-long baseline interferometric multi-frequency polarization observations of
the pc-scale structure of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets. Unlike the jet
emission, which requires post hoc modeling of the non-thermal electrons, the
Faraday rotation measures (RMs) depend primarily upon simulated quantities and
thus provide a robust way in which to confront simulations with observations.
We compute RM distributions of 3D global GRMHD jet formation simulations, with
which we explore the dependence upon model and observational parameters,
emphasizing the signatures of structures generic to the theory of MHD jets.
With typical parameters, we find that it is possible to reproduce the observed
magnitudes and many of the structures found in AGN jet RMs, including the
presence of transverse RM gradients. In our simulations the RMs are generated
within a smooth extension of the jet itself, containing ordered toroidally
dominated magnetic fields. This results in a particular bilateral morphology
that is unlikely to arise due to Faraday rotation in distant foreground clouds.
However, critical to efforts to probe the Faraday screen will be resolving the
transverse jet structure. Therefore, the RMs of radio cores may not be reliable
indicators of the properties of the rotating medium. Finally, we are able to
constrain the particle content of the jet, finding that at pc-scales AGN jets
are electromagnetically dominated, with roughly 2% of the comoving energy in
nonthermal leptons and much less in baryons.
