The neutron-rich N=50 isotones 82Ge and 84Se were investigated using
intermediate-energy Coulomb excitation on a 197Au target and inelastic
scattering on 9Be. As typical for intermediate-energy Coulomb excitation with
projectile energies exceeding 70 MeV/nucleon, only the first 2^+ states were
excited in 82Ge and 84Se. However, in the inelastic scattering on a 9Be target,
a strong population of the first 4^+ state was observed for 84Se, while there
is no indication of a similarly strong excitation of the corresponding state in
the neighboring even-even isotone 82Ge. The results are discussed in the
framework of systematics and shell-model calculations using three different
effective interactions.
