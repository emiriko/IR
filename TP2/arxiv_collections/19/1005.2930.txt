Of the over 450 exoplanets known to date, more than 420 of them have been
discovered using radial velocity studies, a method that tells nothing about the
inclination of the planet's orbit. Because it is more likely that the companion
is a planetary-mass object in a moderate- to high-inclination orbit than a
low-mass stellar object in a nearly face-on orbit, the secondary bodies are
presumed to be planets. Interferometric observations allow us to inspect the
angular diameter fit residuals to calibrated visibilities in order to rule out
the possibility of a low-mass stellar companion in a very low-inclination
orbit. We used the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array
interferometer to observe 20 exoplanet host stars and considered five potential
secondary spectral types: G5 V, K0 V, K5 V, M0 V, and M5 V. If a secondary star
is present and is sufficiently bright, the effects of the added light will
appear in interferometric observations where the planet will not. All secondary
types could be eliminated from consideration for 7 host stars and no secondary
stars of any spectral type could be ruled out for 7 more. The remaining 6 host
stars showed a range of possible secondary types.
