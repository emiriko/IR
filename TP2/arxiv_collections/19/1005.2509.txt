Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) of single and few-layer thickness was exfoliated
on SiO2/Si substrate and characterized by Raman spectroscopy. The number of
S-Mo-S layers of the samples was independently determined by contact-mode
atomic-force microscopy. Two Raman modes, E12g and A1g, exhibited sensitive
thickness dependence, with the frequency of the former decreasing and that of
the latter increasing with thickness. The results provide a convenient and
reliable means for determining layer thickness with atomic-level precision. The
opposite direction of the frequency shifts, which cannot be explained solely by
van der Waals interlayer coupling, is attributed to Coulombic interactions and
possible stacking-induced changes of the intralayer bonding. This work
exemplifies the evolution of structural parameters in layered materials in
changing from the 3-dimensional to the 2-dimensional regime.
