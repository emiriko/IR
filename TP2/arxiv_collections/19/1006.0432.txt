The D0 Collaboration reported a 3.2sigma deviation from the standard model
prediction in the like-sign dimuon asymmetry. Assuming that new physics
contributes only to B_{d,s} mixing, we show that the data can be analyzed
without using the theoretical calculation of \Delta\Gamma_s, allowing for
robust interpretations. We find that this framework gives a good fit to all
measurements, including the recent CDF S_{\psi\phi} result. The data allow
universal new physics with similar contributions relative to the SM in the B_d
and B_s systems, but favors a larger deviation in B_s than in B_d mixing. The
general minimal flavor violation framework with flavor diagonal CP violating
phases can account for the former and remarkably even for the latter case. This
observation makes it simpler to speculate about which extensions with general
flavor structure may also fit the data.
