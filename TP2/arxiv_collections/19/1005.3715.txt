The revised version of the class I methanol maser catalog is presented. It
contains 198 sources - new class I methanol masers detected in the direction of
EGOs were added to the previous number (~160 sources have been published in the
first version of this catalog - see reference in the text). Electronic version
has been generated in the form of html file - http://www.asc.rssi.ru/MMI A
statistical analysis was carried out within 2' around a maser position to find
an identification of class I methanol masers with any objects typical for
star-forming regions - UCHII regions, IRAS sources, bipolar outflows, CS lines
as of dense gas tracer, masers (class II methanol masers, OH and H2O) and EGO.
None of the bipolar outflow, already registered in the direction of class I
methanol maser, did not coincide with EGO. The result is submitted in a form of
a diagram.
