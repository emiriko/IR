Dark matter is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in cosmology at the
present time. About 80% of the universe's gravitating matter is non-luminous,
and its nature and distribution are for the most part unknown. In this paper,
we will outline the history, astrophysical evidence, candidates, and detection
methods of dark matter, with the goal to give the reader an accessible but
rigorous introduction to the puzzle of dark matter. This review targets
advanced students and researchers new to the field of dark matter, and includes
an extensive list of references for further study.
