We consider the theoretical setting of a superfluid like 3He in a rotating
container, which is set between the two layers of a type-II superconductor. We
describe the superfluid vortices as a 2-dimensional Ising-like model on a
triangular lattice in presence of local magnetic fields. The interaction term
of the superfluid vortices with the Abrikosov vortices of the superconductor
appears then as a symmetry breaking term in the free energy. Such a term gives
a higher probability of quantum tunnelling across the potential barrier for
bubbles nucleation, thus favouring quantum cavitation.
