At the LHC, many new physics signatures feature the pair-production of
massive particles with subsequent direct or cascading decays to
weakly-interacting particles, such as SUSY scenarios with conserved conserved
R-parity or $H \to W(\ell\nu)W(\ell\nu)$. We present a set of dimension-less
variables that can assist the early discovery of processes of this type in
conjunction with a set of variables with mass dimension that will expedite the
characterization of these processes.
