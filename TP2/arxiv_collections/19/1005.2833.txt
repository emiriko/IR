We study a large population of globally coupled phase oscillators subject to
common white Gaussian noise and find analytically that the critical coupling
strength between oscillators for synchronization transition decreases with an
increase in the intensity of common noise. Thus, common noise promotes the
onset of synchronization. Our prediction is confirmed by numerical simulations
of the phase oscillators as well as of limit-cycle oscillators.
