micrOMEGAs is a tool for cold dark matter (DM) studies in generic extensions
of the standard model with a R-parity like discrete symmetry that guarantees
the stability of the lightest odd particle. The code computes the DM relic
density, the elastic scattering cross sections of DM on nuclei relevant for
direct detection, and the spectra of positrons, anti-protons and photons
originating from DM annihilation including porpagation of charged cosmic rays.
The cross sections and decay properties of new particles relevant for collider
studies are included as well as constraints from the flavour sector on the
parameter space of supersymmetric models.
