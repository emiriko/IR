In the following paper we provide a review and development of sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC) methods for option pricing. SMC are a class of Monte
Carlo-based algorithms, that are designed to approximate expectations w.r.t a
sequence of related probability measures. These approaches have been used,
successfully, for a wide class of applications in engineering, statistics,
physics and operations research. SMC methods are highly suited to many option
pricing problems and sensitivity/Greek calculations due to the nature of the
sequential simulation. However, it is seldom the case that such ideas are
explicitly used in the option pricing literature. This article provides an
up-to date review of SMC methods, which are appropriate for option pricing. In
addition, it is illustrated how a number of existing approaches for option
pricing can be enhanced via SMC. Specifically, when pricing the arithmetic
Asian option w.r.t a complex stochastic volatility model, it is shown that SMC
methods provide additional strategies to improve estimation.
