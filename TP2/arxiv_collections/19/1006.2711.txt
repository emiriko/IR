We consider the effect of recovery rates on a pool of credit assets. We allow
the recovery rate to depend on the defaults in a general way. Using the theory
of large deviations, we study the structure of losses in a pool consisting of a
continuum of types. We derive the corresponding rate function and show that it
has a natural interpretation as the favored way to rearrange recoveries and
losses among the different types. Numerical examples are also provided.
