We reverse a quantum nondemolition (QND) interaction and restore the signal
quantum state by measurement and feedforward. This operation corresponds to
quantum erasing for continuous variables (CVs). CV quantum eraser restores the
coherence of the signal quantum state by erasing the signal information leaking
to another system, where the information leaking is induced by the QND
interaction. We employ a homodyne measurement for erasing of the information.
Then, by performing a feedforward displacement operation, we restore the
initial quantum state together with its coherence. For verification, we use a
coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state as inputs, and then restore one of
them or the other, whichever we choose. Experimental results are shown as
Wigner functions, average fidelity, change in coherence, and trade-off between
leakage information and coherence.
