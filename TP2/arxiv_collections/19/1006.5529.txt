We report on a SANS investigation into the potential for these structural
reorganization of complexes composed of lysozyme and small PSS chains of
opposite charge if the physicochemical conditions of the solutions are changed
after their formation. Mixtures of solutions of lysozyme and PSS with high
matter content and with an introduced charge ratio [-]/[+]intro close to the
electrostatic stoichiometry, lead to suspensions that are macroscopically
stable. They are composed at local scale of dense globular primary complexes of
radius ~ 100 {\AA}; at a higher scale they are organized fractally with a
dimension 2.1. We first show that the dilution of the solution of complexes,
all other physicochemical parameters remaining constant, induces a macroscopic
destabilization of the solutions but does not modify the structure of the
complexes at submicronic scales. This suggests that the colloidal stability of
the complexes can be explained by the interlocking of the fractal aggregates in
a network at high concentration: dilution does not break the local aggregate
structure but it does destroy the network. We show, secondly, that the addition
of salt does not change the almost frozen inner structure of the cores of the
primary complexes, although it does encourage growth of the complexes; these
coalesce into larger complexes as salt has partially screened the electrostatic
repulsions between two primary complexes. These larger primary complexes remain
aggregated with a fractal dimension of 2.1. Thirdly, we show that the addition
of PSS chains up to [-]/[+]intro ~ 20, after the formation of the primary
complex with a [-]/[+]intro close to 1, only slightly changes the inner
structure of the primary complexes. Moreover, in contrast to the synthesis
achieved in the one-step mixing procedure where the proteins are unfolded for a
range of [-]/[+]intro, the native conformation of the proteins is preserved
inside the frozen core.
