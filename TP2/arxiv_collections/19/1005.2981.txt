The origin and possible universality of the stellar initial mass function
(IMF) is a major issue in astrophysics. One of the main objectives of the
Herschel Gould Belt Survey is to clarify the link between the prestellar core
mass function (CMF) and the IMF. We present and discuss the core mass function
derived from Herschel data for the large population of prestellar cores
discovered with SPIRE and PACS in the Aquila Rift cloud complex at d ~ 260 pc.
We detect a total of 541 starless cores in the entire ~11 deg^2 area of the
field imaged at 70-500 micron with SPIRE/PACS. Most of these cores appear to be
gravitationally bound, and thus prestellar in nature. Our Herschel results
confirm that the shape of the prestellar CMF resembles the stellar IMF, with
much higher quality statistics than earlier submillimeter continuum
ground-based surveys.
