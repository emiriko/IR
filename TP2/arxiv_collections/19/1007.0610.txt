We study coherent risk measures which are time-consistent for multiple
filtrations. We show that a coherent risk measure is time-consistent for every
filtration if and only if it is one of four main types. Furthermore, if the
risk measure is strictly monotone it is linear, and if the reference
probability space is not atomic then it is either linear or an essential
supremum.
