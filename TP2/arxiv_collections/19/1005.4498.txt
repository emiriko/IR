We have investigated the "weak chaos" exponent to see if it can be considered
as a classification parameter of different sandpile models. Simulation results
show that "weak chaos" exponent may be one of the characteristic exponents of
the attractor of \textit{deterministic} models. We have shown that the
(abelian) BTW sandpile model and the (non abelian) Zhang model posses different
"weak chaos" exponents, so they may belong to different universality classes.
We have also shown that \textit{stochasticity} destroys "weak chaos" exponents'
effectiveness so it slows down the divergence of nearby configurations. Finally
we show that getting off the critical point destroys this behavior of
deterministic models.
