We study the role of unbiased migration in cooperation in the framework of
spatial evolutionary game on a variety of spatial structures, involving regular
lattice, continuous plane and complex networks. A striking finding is that
migration plays a universal role in cooperation, regardless of the spatial
structures. For high degree of migration, cooperators cannot survive due to the
failure of forming cooperator clusters to resist attacks of defectors. While
for low degree of migration, cooperation is considerably enhanced compared to
statically spatial game, which is due to the strengthening of the boundary of
cooperator clusters by the occasionally accumulation of cooperators along the
boundary. The cooperator cluster thus becomes more robust than that in static
game and defectors nearby the boundary can be assimilated by cooperators, so
the cooperator cluster expands, which facilitates cooperation. The general role
of migration will be substantiated by sufficient simulations associated with
heuristic explanations.
