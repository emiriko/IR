Evidence for the energy threshold of creating the quark-gluon plasma in
nucleus-nucleus collisions, the so-called onset of deconfinement, has been
found by the energy scan program of the NA49 experiment at the CERN SPS. In
this paper we review the experimental and theoretical status of this
phenomenon. First, the basic, qualitative ideas are presented for non-experts.
Next, the latest experimental results are compared to a statistical model
within which the onset of deconfinement and its signals had been predicted.
Finally, alternative interpretations and open questions are discussed.
