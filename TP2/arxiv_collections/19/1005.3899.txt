The equilibrium structure of sunspots depends critically on its magnetic
topology and is dominated by magnetic forces. Tension force is one component of
the Lorentz force which balances the gradient of magnetic pressure in
force-free configurations. We employ the tension term of the Lorentz force to
clarify the structure of sunspot features like penumbral filaments, umbral
light bridges and outer penumbral fine structures. We compute vertical
component of tension term of Lorentz force over two active regions namely NOAA
AR 10933 and NOAA AR 10930 observed on 05 January 2007 and 12 December 2006
respectively. The former is a simple while latter is a complex active region
with highly sheared polarity inversion line (PIL). The vector magnetograms used
are obtained from Hinode(SOT/SP). We find an inhomogeneous distribution of
tension with both positive and negative signs in various features of the
sunspots. The existence of positive tension at locations of lower field
strength and higher inclination is compatible with the uncombed model of the
penumbral structure. Positive tension is also seen in umbral light bridges
which could be indication of uncombed structure of the light bridge. Likewise,
the upward directed tension associated with bipolar regions in the penumbra
could be a direct confirmation of the sea serpent model of penumbral
structures. Upward directed tension at the PIL of AR 10930 seems to be related
to flux emergence. The magnitude of the tension force is greater than the force
of gravity in some places, implying a nearly force-free configuration for these
sunspot features. From our study, magnetic tension emerges as a useful
diagnostic of the local equilibrium of the sunspot fine structures.
