Managing the transactions in real time distributed computing system is not
easy, as it has heterogeneously networked computers to solve a single problem.
If a transaction runs across some different sites, it may commit at some sites
and may failure at another site, leading to an inconsistent transaction. The
complexity is increase in real time applications by placing deadlines on the
response time of the database system and transactions processing. Such a system
needs to process Transactions before these deadlines expired. A series of
simulation study have been performed to analyze the performance under different
transaction management under conditions such as different workloads,
distribution methods, execution mode-distribution and parallel etc. The
scheduling of data accesses are done in order to meet their deadlines and to
minimize the number of transactions that missed deadlines. A new concept is
introduced to manage the transactions in dynamic ways rather than setting
computing parameters in static ways. With this approach, the system gives a
significant improvement in performance.
