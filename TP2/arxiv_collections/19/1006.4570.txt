In recent years reversible logic has been considered as an important issue
for designing low power digital circuits. It has voluminous applications in the
present rising nanotechnology such as DNA computing, Quantum Computing, low
power VLSI and quantum dot automata. In this paper we have proposed optimized
design of reversible sequential circuits in terms of number of gates, delay and
hardware complexity. We have designed the latches with a new reversible gate
and reduced the required number of gates, garbage outputs, and delay and
hardware complexity. As the number of gates and garbage outputs increase the
complexity of reversible circuits, this design will significantly enhance the
performance. We have proposed reversible D-latch and JK latch which are better
than the existing designs available in literature.
