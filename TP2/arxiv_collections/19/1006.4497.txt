Motivated by studies on current magnification in quantum mesoscopic systems
we consider sound and heat transmission in classical models of oscillator
chains. A loop of coupled oscillators is connected to two leads through which
one can either transmit monochromatic waves or white noise signal from heat
baths. We look for the possibility of current magnification in this system due
to some asymmetry introduced between the two arms in the loop. We find that
current magnification is indeed obtained for particular frequency ranges.
However the integrated current shows the effect only in the presence of a
pinning potential for the atoms in the leads. We also study the effect of
anharmonicity on current magnification.
