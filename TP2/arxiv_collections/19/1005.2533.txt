We introduce a simple model to study movie competition in the recommender
systems. Movies of heterogeneous quality compete against each other through
viewers' reviews and generate interesting dynamics of box-office. By assuming
mean-field interactions between the competing movies, we show that run-away
effect of popularity spreading is triggered by defeating the average review
score, leading to hits in box-office. The average review score thus
characterizes the critical movie quality necessary for transition from
box-office bombs to blockbusters. The major factors affecting the critical
review score are examined. By iterating the mean-field dynamical equations, we
obtain qualitative agreements with simulations and real systems in the
dynamical forms of box-office, revealing the significant role of competition in
understanding box-office dynamics.
