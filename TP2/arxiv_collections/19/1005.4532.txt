A remarkable property of naked singularities in general relativity is their
repulsive nature. The effects generated by repulsive gravity are usually
investigated by analyzing the trajectories of test particles which move in the
effective potential of a naked singularity. This method is, however, coordinate
and observer dependent. We propose to use the properties of the Riemann tensor
in order to establish in an invariant manner the regions where repulsive
gravity plays a dominant role. In particular, we show that in the case of the
Kerr-Newman singularity and its special subcases the method delivers plausible
results.
