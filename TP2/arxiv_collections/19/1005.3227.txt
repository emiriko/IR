A Neutrino Factory requires an intense and well-cooled (in transverse phase
space) muon beam. We discuss a hybrid approach for a linear 4D cooling channel
consisting of high-pressure gas-filled RF cavities- potentially allowing high
gradients without breakdown- and discrete LiH absorbers to provide the
necessary energy loss that results in the required muon beam cooling. We report
simulations of the channel performance and its comparison with the vacuum case;
we also briefly discuss technical and safety issues associated with cavities
filled with high-pressure hydrogen gas. Even with additional windows that might
be needed for safety reasons, the channel performance is comparable to that of
the original, all-vacuum Feasibility Study 2a channel on which our design is
based. If tests demonstrate that the gas-filled RF cavities can operate
effectively with an intense beam of ionizing particles passing through them,
our approach would be an attractive way of avoiding possible breakdown problems
with a vacuum RF channel.
