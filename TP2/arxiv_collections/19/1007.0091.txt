The manipulation of the electron spin degree of freedom is at the core of the
spintronics paradigm, which offers the perspective of reduced power
consumption, enabled by the decoupling of information processing from net
charge transfer. Spintronics also offers the possibility of devising hybrid
devices able to perform logic, communication, and storage operations. Graphene,
with its potentially long spin-coherence length, is a promising material for
spin-encoded information transport. However, the small spin-orbit interaction
is also a limitation for the design of conventional devices based on the
canonical Datta-Das spin-FET. An alternative solution can be found in magnetic
doping of graphene, or, as discussed in the present work, in exploiting the
proximity effect between graphene and Ferromagnetic Oxides (FOs). Graphene in
proximity to FO experiences an exchange proximity interaction (EPI), that acts
as an effective Zeeman field for electrons in graphene, inducing a spin
precession around the magnetization axis of the FO. Here we show that in an
appropriately designed double-gate field-effect transistor, with a bilayer
graphene channel and FO used as a gate dielectric, spin-precession of carriers
can be turned ON and OFF with the application of a differential voltage to the
gates. This feature is directly probed in the spin-resolved conductance of the
bilayer.
