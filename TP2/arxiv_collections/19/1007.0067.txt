We suggest that at high energy each space dimension has their own time
dimension, forming a 3-dimensional complex spacetime. Based on this hypothesis,
we propose that the primordial universe is made of six fundamental
anticommutative fields and their complex conjugate states. These fields are
called Hexad Preons which carry hypercolor degree of freedom transforming under
U(3,3) gauge group. Upon the breakdown of the gauge group from U(3,3) to its
maximal compact subgroup $U(3)\otimes U(3)$, the metric emerges. Leptons,
quarks, as well as other matter states may be formed from the subsequent
condensate of Hexad Preons. Strong and electroweak forces are manifestations of
the hypercolor interaction in the corresponding cases. Our framework may shed
light on many problems in cosmology and particle physics.
