This is the second article in a series of two dealing with the concept of
"resonant metalens" we introduced recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 203901
(2010)]. It is a new type of lens capable of coding in time and radiating
efficiently in the far field region sub-diffraction information of an object. A
proof of concept of such a lens is performed in the microwave range, using a
medium made out of a square lattice of parallel conducting wires with finite
length. We investigate a sub-wavelength focusing scheme with time reversal and
demonstrate experimentally spots with focal widths of {\lambda}/25. Through a
cross-correlation based imaging procedure we show an image reconstruction with
a resolution of {\lambda}/80. Eventually we discuss the limitations of such a
lens which reside essentially in losses.
