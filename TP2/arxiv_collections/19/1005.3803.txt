Heterogeneity in the degree distribution is known to suppress global
synchronization in complex networks of symmetrically coupled oscillators.
Scale-free networks display a great deal of heterogeneity, containing a few
nodes, termed hubs, that are highly connected, while most nodes receive only a
few connections. Here, we show that a group of synchronized nodes may appear in
scale-free networks: hubs undergo a transition to synchronization while the
other nodes remain unsynchronized. This general phenomenon can occur even in
the absence of global synchronization. Our results suggest that scale-free
networks may have evolved to complement various levels of synchronization.
