The Littlest Higgs Model with T-parity is one of the attractive candidates of
physics beyond the Standard Model. One of the important predictions of the
model is the existence of new heavy gauge bosons, where they acquire mass terms
through the breaking of global symmetry necessarily imposed on the model. The
determination of the masses are, hence, quite important to test the model. In
this paper, the measurement accuracy of the heavy gauge bosons at the
international linear collider (ILC) is reported.
