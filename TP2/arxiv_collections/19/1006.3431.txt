The paper is grounded on the author's book '"Thermal Death" on the Earth and
the scenario how to prevent it' (Moscow, URSS, 2009, bibl.571). While consuming
energy, we finally practically all the produced energy is dissipated as heat.
As the way of preventing the "thermal death" the author suggests that we should
transit to the thermocyclic power engineering based on using heat circulation
and build "cold storage plants" which must collect the dissipated heat and
transform it into forms of energy necessary to mankind. As a rule the
dissipated heat has low temperature gradients. For this reason the efficiency
of "cold storage plants" of the classic type (with coolers) is too small and
therefore they cannot be used as the basis of thermocyclic power engineering.
This fact makes us consider the perpetual motion engines of the second kind.
Having analyzed (excessively) numerous formulations of the Second Law of
thermodynamics, the author has concluded that the prohibition of these engines
is groundless. From the author's point of view this prohibition is a
consequence of the following mistakes made by the founders of Thermodynamics.
1. Having in mind the concept of non-exterminable phlogiston, S. Carnot made a
conclusion that the heat does not disappear but is only transferred from a warm
body to a cold one and therefore a cooler is necessary for any thermal engine.
However, today we know that while heat is consumed, it does disappear as heat
and converts into other forms of energy. Hence, Carnot's argumentation is
wrong. 2.The Entropy Increase Law is wrongly reduced to the Thermal Entropy
Increase "Law" while in Nature the Total Entropy Increase Law works. Due to
groundlessness of the Thermal Entropy Increase "Law", the thermal entropy can
decrease and a compensation of converting thermal energy into mechanical work
can be non-thermal. Therefore a cooler is not necessary for a thermal engine.
