Excitation of multicomponent dark matter in the galactic center has been
proposed as the source of low-energy positrons that produce the excess 511 keV
gamma rays that have been observed by INTEGRAL. Such models have also been
promoted to explain excess high-energy electrons/positrons observed by the
PAMELA, Fermi/LAT and H.E.S.S. experiments. We investigate whether one model
can simultaneously fit all three anomalies, in addition to further constraints
from inverse Compton scattering by the high-energy leptons. We find models that
fit both the 511 keV and PAMELA excesses at dark matter masses M < 400 GeV, but
not the Fermi lepton excess. The conflict arises because a more cuspy DM halo
profile is needed to match the observed 511 keV signal than is compatible with
inverse Compton constraints at larger DM masses.
