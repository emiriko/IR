In this Letter, we report on alpha particle emission through the nuclear
break-up in the reaction 40Ca on a 40Ca target at 50A MeV. It is observed that,
similarly to nucleons, alpha particles can be emitted to the continuum with
very specific angular distribution during the reaction. The alpha particle
properties can be understood as resulting from an alpha cluster in the daughter
nucleus that is perturbed by the short range nuclear attraction of the
collision partner and emitted. A time-dependent theory that describe the alpha
particle wave-function evolution is able to reproduce qualitatively the
observed angular distribution. This mechanism offers new possibilities to study
alpha particle properties in the nuclear medium.
