Statistical features of homogeneous, isotropic, two-dimensional turbulence is
discussed on the basis of a set of direct numerical simulations up to the
unprecedented resolution $32768^2$. By forcing the system at intermediate
scales, narrow but clear inertial ranges develop both for the inverse and for
direct cascades where the two Kolmogorov laws for structure functions are, for
the first time, simultaneously observed. The inverse cascade spectrum is found
to be consistent with Kolmogorov-Kraichnan prediction and is robust with
respect the presence of an enstrophy flux. The direct cascade is found to be
more sensible to finite size effects: the exponent of the spectrum has a
correction with respect theoretical prediction which vanishes by increasing the
resolution.
