We obtain all homogeneous solutions of new massive gravity models on S^3 and
AdS_3 by extending previously known results for the cosmological topologically
massive theory of gravity in three dimensions. In all cases, apart from the
maximally symmetric vacua, there are axially symmetric (i.e., bi-axially
squashed) as well as totally anisotropic (i.e., tri-axially squashed) metrics
of special algebraic type. Transitions among the vacua are modeled by instanton
solutions of 3+1 Horava-Lifshitz gravity with anisotropic scaling parameter
z=4.
