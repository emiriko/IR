The lifetimes of spin excitations of Mn adsorbates on CuN/Cu(100) are
computed from first-principles. The theory is based on a strong-coupling
T-matrix approach that evaluates the decay of a spin excitation due to
electron-hole pair creation. Using a previously developed theory [Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 103}, 176601 (2009) and Phys. Rev. B {\bf 81}, 165423 (2010)], we
compute the excitation rates by a tunneling current for all the Mn spin states.
A rate equation approach permits us to simulate the experimental results by
Loth and co-workers [Nat. Phys. {\bf 6}, 340 (2010)] for large tunnelling
currents, taking into account the finite population of excited states. Our
simulations give us insight into the spin dynamics, in particular in the way
polarized electrons can reveal the existence of an excited state population. In
addition, it reveals that the excitation process occurs in a way very different
from the deexcitation one. Indeed, while excitation by tunnelling electrons
proceeds via the s and p electrons of the adsorbate, deexcitation mainly
involves the d electrons.
