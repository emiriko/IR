On Taub-NUT spacetime, we investigate hydrodynamic properties of perfect
fluid spiraling inward toward the spacetime along a conical surface. On the
equatorial plane of the Taub-NUT spacetime, we derive radial equations of
motion with effective potentials and the Euler equation for steady state
axisymmetric fluid. Higher dimensional global embeddings are constructed inside
and outside the event horizons of the Taub-NUT spacetime. We also study the
effective potentials of particles on the Taub-NUT spacetime in terms of
gravitational magnetic monopole strength of the source, total energy and
angular momentum per unit rest mass of the particle.
