We describe and demonstrate a method to reconstruct an amplitude equation
from the nonlinear relaxation dynamics in the succession of the Rosensweig
instability. A flat layer of a ferrofluid is cooled such that the liquid has a
relatively high viscosity. Consequently, the dynamics of the formation of the
Rosensweig pattern becomes very slow. By sudden switching of the magnetic
induction, the system is pushed to an arbitrary point in the phase space
spanned by the pattern amplitude and the magnetic induction. Afterwards, it is
allowed to relax to its equilibrium point. From the dynamics of this
relaxation, we reconstruct the underlying fully nonlinear equation of motion of
the pattern amplitude. The measured nonlinear dynamics serves to select the
best weakly nonlinear expansion which describes this hysteretic transition.
