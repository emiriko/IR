The PIENU experiment aims at the measurement of the branching ratio R =
\Gamma (\pi -> e \nu + \pi -> e \nu \gamma) / \Gamma (\pi -> \mu \nu + \pi ->
\mu \nu \gamma) at the <0.1% precision level, with which mass scales of 1000
TeV/c^{2} can be searched for new pseudoscalar interactions. The status of the
experiment is described.
