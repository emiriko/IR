We argue that ultracold atoms in strongly shaken optical lattices can be
subjected to conditions similar to those experienced by electrons in
laser-irradiated crystalline solids, but without introducing secondary
polarization effects. As a consequence one can induce nonperturbative
multiphoton-like resonances due to the mutual penetration of ac-Stark-shifted
Bloch bands. These phenomena can be detected with a combination of currently
available laboratory techniques.
