We present a new analytical method to calculate the small angle CMB
temperature angular power spectrum due to cosmic (super-)string segments. In
particular, using our method, we clarify the dependence on the intercommuting
probability $P$. We find that the power spectrum is dominated by
Poisson-distributed string segments. The power spectrum for a general value of
$P$ has a plateau on large angular scales and shows a power-law decrease on
small angular scales. The resulting spectrum in the case of conventional cosmic
strings is in very good agreement with the numerical result obtained by Fraisse
et al.. Then we estimate the upper bound on the dimensionless tension of the
string for various values of $P$ by assuming that the fraction of the CMB power
spectrum due to cosmic (super-)strings is less than ten percents at various
angular scales up to $\ell=2000$. We find that the amplitude of the spectrum
increases as the intercommuting probability. As a consequence, strings with
smaller intercommuting probabilities are found to be more tightly constrained.
