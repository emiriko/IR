We have investigated shot noise and conduction of graphene field effect
nanoribbon devices at low temperature. By analyzing the exponential $I-V$
characteristics of our devices in the transport gap region, we found out that
transport follows variable range hopping laws at intermediate bias voltages $1
< V_{bias} < 12$ mV. In parallel, we observe a strong shot noise suppression
leading to very low Fano factors. The strong suppression of shot noise is
consistent with inelastic hopping, in crossover from one- to two-dimensional
regime, indicating that the localization length $l_{loc} < W$ in our
nanoribbons.
