In this paper, the systematisation and classification of modern quantum
technologies of information security against cyber-terrorist attack are carried
out. The characteristic of the basic directions of quantum cryptography from
the viewpoint of the quantum technologies used is given. A qualitative analysis
of the advantages and disadvantages of concrete quantum protocols is made. The
current status of the problem of practical quantum cryptography use in
telecommunication networks is considered. In particular, a short review of
existing commercial systems of quantum key distribution is given.
