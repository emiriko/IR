We prove the existence of static, asymptotically flat non-vacuum spacetimes
with axial symmetry where the matter is modeled as a collisionless gas. The
axially symmetric solutions of the resulting Einstein-Vlasov system are
obtained via the implicit function theorem by perturbing off a suitable
spherically symmetric steady state of the Vlasov-Poisson system.
