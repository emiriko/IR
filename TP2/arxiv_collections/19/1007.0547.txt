Many techniques have been proposed to speedup the performance of classic
Hough Transform. These techniques are primarily based on converting the voting
procedure to a hierarchy based voting method. These methods use approximate
decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a fast decision making
process that enhances the speed and reduces the space requirements.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is much faster
than a similar Fast Hough Transform.
