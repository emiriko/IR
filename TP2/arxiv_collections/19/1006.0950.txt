Using data from the HATNet survey for transiting exoplanets we measure
photometric rotation periods for 368 Pleiades stars with 0.4 Msun < M < 1.3
Msun. We detect periodic variability for 74% of the cluster members in this
mass range that are within our field-of-view, and 93% of the members with 0.7
Msun < M < 1.0 Msun. This increases, by a factor of five, the number of
Pleiades members with measured periods. Included in our sample are 14 newly
identified probable cluster members which have proper motions, photometry, and
rotation periods consistent with membership. We compare this data to the rich
sample of spectroscopically determined projected equatorial rotation velocities
(vsini) available in the literature for this cluster. For stars with M > 0.85
Msun the rotation periods, vsini and radius estimates are consistent with the
stars having an isotropic distribution of rotation axes, if a moderate
differential rotation law is assumed. For stars with M < 0.85 Msun the inferred
sini values are systematically larger than 1.0. These observations imply that
the combination of measured parameters P(vsini)/R is too large by \sim 24% for
low-mass stars in this cluster. By comparing our new mass-period relation for
the Pleiades to the slightly older cluster M35, we confirm previous indications
that the spin-down stalls at \sim 100 Myr for the slowest rotating stars with
0.7 Msun < M < 1.1 Msun a fact which may indicate that the internal transport
of angular momentum is inefficient in slowly rotating solar mass stars.
