(abridged) Numerous spectroscopic observations provide compelling evidence
for non-canonical processes that modify the surface abundances of low- and
intermediate-mass stars beyond the predictions of standard stellar theory. We
study the effects of thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing in
the 1-4 Msun range at solar metallicity. We present evolutionary models by
considering both thermohaline and rotation-induced mixing in stellar interior.
We discuss the effects of these processes on the chemical properties of stars
from the zero age main sequence up to the end of the second dredge-up on the
early-AGB for intermediate-mass stars and up to the AGB tip for low-mass stars.
Model predictions are compared to observational data for
lithium,12C/13C,[N/C],[Na/Fe],16O/17O, and 16O/18O in Galactic open clusters
and in field stars with well-defined evolutionary status,as well as in
planetary nebulae. Thermohaline mixing simultaneously accounts for the observed
behaviour of 12C/13C,[N/C], and lithium in low-mass stars that are more
luminous than the RGB bump, and its efficiency is increasing with decreasing
initial stellar mass. On the TP-AGB,thermohaline mixing leads to lithium
production, although the 7Li yields remain negative. Although the 3He stellar
yields are much reduced thanks to this process, we find that solar-metallicity,
low-mass stars remain net 3He producers. Rotation-induced mixing is found to
change the stellar structure so that in the mass range between \sim 1.5 and 2.2
Msun the thermohaline instability occurs earlier on the red giant branch than
in non-rotating models. Finally rotation accounts for the observed star-to-star
abundance variations at a given evolutionary status, and is necessary to
explain the features of CN-processed material in intermediate-mass stars.
