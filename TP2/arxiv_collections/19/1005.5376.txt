Supergranulation is a fluid-dynamical phenomenon taking place in the solar
photosphere, primarily detected in the form of a vigorous cellular flow pattern
with a typical horizontal scale of approximately 30--35~megameters, a dynamical
evolution time of 24--48~h, a strong 300--400~m/s (rms) horizontal flow
component and a much weaker 20--30~m/s vertical component. Supergranulation was
discovered more than sixty years ago, however, explaining its physical origin
and most important observational characteristics has proven extremely
challenging ever since, as a result of the intrinsic multiscale, nonlinear
dynamical complexity of the problem concurring with strong observational and
computational limitations. Key progress on this problem is now taking place
with the advent of 21st-century supercomputing resources and the availability
of global observations of the dynamics of the solar surface with high spatial
and temporal resolutions. This article provides an exhaustive review of
observational, numerical and theoretical research on supergranulation, and
discusses the current status of our understanding of its origin and dynamics,
most importantly in terms of large-scale nonlinear thermal convection, in the
light of a selection of recent findings.
