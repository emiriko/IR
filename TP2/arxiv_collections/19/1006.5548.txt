An analytical derivation of the probability density function (PDF) tail
describing the strongly correlated interface growth governed by the nonlinear
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation is provided. The PDF tail exactly coincides with a
Tracy-Widom distribution i.e. a PDF tail proportional to $\exp( - c
w_2^{3/2})$, where $w_2$ is the the width of the interface. The PDF tail is
computed by the instanton method in the strongly non-linear regime within the
Martin-Siggia-Rose framework using a careful treatment of the non-linear
interactions. In addition, the effect of spatial dimensions on the PDF tail
scaling is discussed. This gives a novel approach to understand the rightmost
PDF tail of the interface width distribution and the analysis suggests that
there is no upper critical dimension.
