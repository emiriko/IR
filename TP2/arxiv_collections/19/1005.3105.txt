Roche-lobe overflow and common envelope evolution are very important in
binary evolution, which is believed to be the main evolutionary channel to hot
subdwarf stars. The details of these processes are difficult to model, but
adiabatic expansion provides an excellent approximation to the structure of a
donor star undergoing dynamical time scale mass transfer. We can use this model
to study the responses of stars of various masses and evolutionary stages as
potential donor stars, with the urgent goal of obtaining more accurate
stability criteria for dynamical mass transfer in binary population synthesis
studies. As examples, we describe here several models with the initial masses
equal to 1 Msun and 10 Msun, and identify potential limitations to the use of
our results for giant-branch stars.
