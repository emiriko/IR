An experimental research concerning highly underexpanded jets made of
different gases from the surrounding ambient is here described. By selecting
different species of gases, it was possible to vary the jet-to-ambient density
ratio in the 0.04 to 12 range and observe its effect on the jet morphology. By
adjusting the stagnation and ambient pressures, it has been possible to select
the Mach number of the jets, independently from the density ratio. Each jet is
therefore characterized by its maximum Mach number, ranging from 10 to 50. The
Reynolds number range of the nozzle is 1000 to 50000. The spatial evolution of
the jets was observed over a much larger scale than the nozzle diameter. The
gas densities were evaluated from the light emission induced by an electron
beam and the gas concentrations were obtained by analyzing the color of the
emitted light. The results have shown that the morphology of the jets depends
to a greater extent on the density ratio. Jets that are lighter than the
ambient exhibit a more intense jet-ambient mixing than jets that are heavier
than the ambient, while the effects of changing the jet Mach number do not seem
to be too large in the explored range. These results can be expressed by means
of two simple scaling laws relevant to the near field (pre-Mach-disk) and the
mid-long term field (post-Mach-disk), respectively.
