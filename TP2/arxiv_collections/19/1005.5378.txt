We report unfiltered photometry during the first confirmed superoutburst of
the recently discovered dwarf nova, SDSS J073208.11+413008.7 and conclude that
it is a member of the SU UMa family. At its brightest, the star was magnitude
15.7. The outburst amplitude was nearly 5 magnitudes and it lasted about 14
days. We determined the mean superhump period from our first 3 nights of
observations as Psh = 0.07979(19) d, however analysis of the O-C residuals
showed a dramatic evolution in Psh during the outburst. During the first part
of the plateau phase the period increased with dPsh/dt = +2.81(9) x 10-3. There
was then an abrupt change following which the period decreased with dPsh/dt =
-0.78(12)x 10-3.The amplitude of the superhumps also varied, with a maximum
amplitude near the beginning of the outburst and a second maximum later in the
plateau phase. Analysis of archival data suggests that the star undergoes
frequent outbursts: we identified 10 normal outbursts and at least 3 likely
superoutbursts over a 4.5 year interval. We estimate that the superoutburst
period is around 215 days.
