In the framework of the spatial coherence wavelets, different features of the
first-order spatial coherence (Young's interference) are analysed by
calculating the corresponding marginal power spectrum, a close related quantity
to the classical Wigner Distribution Function (WDF) of the optical field. The
consideration of radiant and virtual point sources evidences some effects,
conventionally attributed to non-classical correlations of light, although such
type of correlations are not explicitly included in the model. Specifically, a
light state is produced that has similar morphology to the WDF of the
well-known quantum Schr\"odinger cat state.
