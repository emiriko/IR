We present an analysis of stellar population gradients in 4,546 Early-Type
Galaxies with photometry in $grizYHJK$ along with optical spectroscopy. A new
approach is described which utilizes color information to constrain age and
metallicity gradients. Defining an effective color gradient, $\nabla_{\star}$,
which incorporates all of the available color indices, we investigate how
$\nabla_{\star}$ varies with galaxy mass proxies, i.e. velocity dispersion,
stellar (M_star) and dynamical (M_dyn) masses, as well as age, metallicity, and
alpha/Fe. ETGs with M_dyn larger than 8.5 x 10^10, M_odot have increasing age
gradients and decreasing metallicity gradients wrt mass, metallicity, and
enhancement. We find that velocity dispersion and alpha/Fe are the main drivers
of these correlations. ETGs with 2.5 x 10^10 M_odot =< M_dyn =< 8.5 x 10^10
M_odot, show no correlation of age, metallicity, and color gradients wrt mass,
although color gradients still correlate with stellar population parameters,
and these correlations are independent of each other. In both mass regimes, the
striking anti-correlation between color gradient and alpha-enhancement is
significant at \sim 4sigma, and results from the fact that metallicity gradient
decreases with alpha/Fe. This anti-correlation may reflect the fact that star
formation and metallicity enrichment are regulated by the interplay between the
energy input from supernovae, and the temperature and pressure of the hot X-ray
gas in ETGs. For all mass ranges, positive age gradients are associated with
old galaxies (>5-7 Gyr). For galaxies younger than \sim 5 Gyr, mostly at
low-mass, the age gradient tends to be anti-correlated with the Age parameter,
with more positive gradients at younger ages.
