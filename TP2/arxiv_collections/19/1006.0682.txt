We design non-singular cloaks enabling objects to scatter waves like objects
with smaller size and very different shapes. We consider the Schrodinger
equation which is valid e.g. in the contexts of geometrical and quantum optics.
More precisely, we introduce a generalized non-singular transformation for star
domains, and numerically demonstrate that an object of nearly any given shape
surrounded by a given cloak scatters waves in exactly the same way as a smaller
object of another shape. When a source is located inside the cloak, it scatters
waves as if it would be located some distance away from a small object.
Moreover, the invisibility region actually hosts almost-trapped eigenstates.
Mimetism is numerically shown to break down for the quantified energies
associated with confined modes. If we further allow for non-isomorphic
transformations, our approach leads to the design of quantum super-scatterers:
a small size object surrounded by a quantum cloak described by a negative
anisotropic heterogeneous effective mass and a negative spatially varying
potential scatters matter waves like a larger nano-object of different shape.
Potential applications might be for instance in quantum dots probing.
