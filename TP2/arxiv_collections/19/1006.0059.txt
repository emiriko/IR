We propose a simple systematics of low lying 2+ energy levels and
electromagnetic transitions in semi-magic isotopic chains Z=28,50,82 and
isotonic chains N=28,50,82,126. To this purpose we use a two-level pairing plus
quadrupole Hamiltonian, within the spherical Quasiparticle Random Phase
Approximation (QRPA). We derive a simple relation connecting the 2+ energy with
the pairing gap and quadrupole-quadupole (QQ) interaction strength. It turns
out that the systematics of energy levels and B(E2) values predicted by this
simple model is fulfilled with a reasonable accuracy by all available
experimental data. Both systematics suggest that not only active nucleons but
also those filling closed shells play an important role.
