Species extinction occurs regularly and unavoidably in ecological systems.
The time scales for extinction can broadly vary and inform on the ecosystem's
stability. We study the spatio-temporal extinction dynamics of a paradigmatic
population model where three species exhibit cyclic competition. The cyclic
dynamics reflects the non-equilibrium nature of the species interactions. While
previous work focusses on the coarsening process as a mechanism that drives the
system to extinction, we found that unexpectedly the dynamics to extinction is
much richer. We observed three different types of dynamics. In addition to
coarsening, in the evolutionary relevant limit of large times, oscillating
traveling waves and heteroclinic orbits play a dominant role. The weight of the
different processes depends on the degree of mixing and the system size. By
analytical arguments and extensive numerical simulations we provide the full
characteristics of scenarios leading to extinction in one of the most
surprising models of ecology.
