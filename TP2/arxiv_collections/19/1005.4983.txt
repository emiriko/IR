Springs are used for a wide range of applications in physics and engineering.
Possibly, one of its most common uses is to study the nature of restoring
forces in oscillatory systems. While experiments that verify the Hooke's law
using springs are abundant in the physics literature, those that explore the
combination of several springs together are very rare. In this paper, an
experiment designed to study the static properties of a combination of springs
in series using only one single spring is presented. Paint marks placed on the
coils of the spring allowed us to divide it into segments, and considered it as
a collection of springs connected in series. The validity of Hooke's law for
the system and the relationship between the spring constant of the segments
with the spring constant of the entire spring is verified experimentally. The
easy setup, accurate results, and educational benefits make this experiment
attractive and useful for high school and first-year college students.
