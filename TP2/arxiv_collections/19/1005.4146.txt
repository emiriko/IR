The dynamics of interacting structured populations can be modeled by
$\frac{dx_i}{dt}= A_i (x)x_i$ where $x_i\in \R^{n_i}$, $x=(x_1,\dots,x_k)$, and
$A_i(x)$ are matrices with non-negative off-diagonal entries. These models are
permanent if there exists a positive global attractor and are robustly
permanent if they remain permanent following perturbations of $A_i(x)$.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for robust permanence are derived using
dominant Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_i(\mu)$ of the $A_i(x)$ with respect to
invariant measures $\mu$. The necessary condition requires $\max_i
\lambda_i(\mu)>0$ for all ergodic measures with support in the boundary of the
non-negative cone. The sufficient condition requires that the boundary admits a
Morse decomposition such that $\max_i \lambda_i(\mu)>0$ for all invariant
measures $\mu$ supported by a component of the Morse decomposition. When the
Morse components are Axiom A, uniquely ergodic, or support all but one
population, the necessary and sufficient conditions are equivalent.
Applications to spatial ecology, epidemiology, and gene networks are given.
