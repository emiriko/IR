To analyze an electromagnetic and strong hadron processes at low energies, we
consider the renormalizable model with the U0(1) x U(1) x SU(2) gauge symmetry.
This approach is based on the linear sigma-model extended by the gauge and
quark-meson interactions. Physical content and parameters of the model are
discussed. Theoretical predictions for some radiative decays of vector mesons
are in a good agreement with the experimental data.
