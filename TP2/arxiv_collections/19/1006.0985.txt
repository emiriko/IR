The HERschel Inventory of The Agents of Galaxy Evolution (HERITAGE) of the
Magellanic Clouds will use dust emission to investigate the life cycle of
matter in both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). Using the
Herschel Space Observatory's PACS and SPIRE photometry cameras, we imaged a 2x8
square degree strip through the LMC, at a position angle of ~22.5 degrees as
part of the science demonstration phase of the Herschel mission. We present the
data in all 5 Herschel bands: PACS 100 and 160 {\mu}m and SPIRE 250, 350 and
500 {\mu}m. We present two dust models that both adequately fit the spectral
energy distribution for the entire strip and both reveal that the SPIRE 500
{\mu}m emission is in excess of the models by 6 to 17%. The SPIRE emission
follows the distribution of the dust mass, which is derived from the model. The
PAH-to-dust mass (f_PAH) image of the strip reveals a possible enhancement in
the LMC bar in agreement with previous work. We compare the gas mass
distribution derived from the HI 21 cm and CO J=1-0 line emission maps to the
dust mass map from the models and derive gas-to-dust mass ratios (GDRs). The
dust model, which uses the standard graphite and silicate optical properties
for Galactic dust, has a very low GDR = 65(+15,-18) making it an unrealistic
dust model for the LMC. Our second dust model, which uses amorphous carbon
instead of graphite, has a flatter emissivity index in the submillimeter and
results in a GDR = 287(+25,-42) that is more consistent with a GDR inferred
from extinction.
