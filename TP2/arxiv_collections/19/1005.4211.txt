We search for CP violation in a sample of 4.7x10^4 Cabibbo suppressed D0 ->
K+K-pi+pi- decays. We use 470 fb-1 of data recorded by the BaBar detector at
the PeP2 asymmetric-energy e+e- storage rings running at center-of-mass
energies near 10.6 GeV. CP violation is searched for in the difference between
the T-odd asymmetries, obtained using triple product correlations, measured for
D0 and D0b decays. The measured At violation parameter is At = (1.0 +- 5.1_sta
+- 4.4_sys) x 10^-3.
