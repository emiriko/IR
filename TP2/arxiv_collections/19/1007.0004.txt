We investigate supercurrent-induced magnetization dynamics in a Josephson
junction with two misaligned ferromagnetic layers, and demonstrate a variety of
effects by solving numerically the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In
particular, we demonstrate the possibility to obtain supercurrent-induced
magnetization switching for an experimentally feasible set of parameters, and
clarify the favorable condition for the realization of magnetization reversal.
These results constitute a superconducting analogue to conventional
current-induced magnetization dynamics and indicate how spin-triplet
supercurrents may be utilized for practical purposes in spintronics.
