We address the typical strengths of hadronic parity-violating three-nucleon
interactions in "pion-less" Effective Field Theory in the nucleon-deuteron
(iso-doublet) system. By analysing the superficial degree of divergence of loop
diagrams, we conclude that no such interactions are needed at leading order.
The only two linearly independent parity-violating three-nucleon structures
with one derivative mix two-S and two-P-half waves with iso-spin transitions
Delta I = 0 or 1. Due to their structure, they cannot absorb any divergence
ostensibly appearing at next-to-leading order. This observation is based on the
approximate realisation of Wigner's combined SU(4) spin-isospin symmetry in the
two-nucleon system, even when effective-range corrections are included.
Parity-violating three-nucleon interactions thus only appear beyond
next-to-leading order. This guarantees renormalisability of the theory to that
order without introducing new, unknown coupling constants and allows the direct
extraction of parity-violating two-nucleon interactions from three-nucleon
experiments.
