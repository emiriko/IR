The merger of two white dwarfs (a.k.a. double degenerate merger) has often
been cited as a potential progenitor of type Ia supernovae. Here we combine
population synthesis, merger and explosion models with radiation-hydrodynamics
light-curve models to study the implications of such a progenitor scenario on
the observed type Ia supernova population. Our standard model, assuming double
degenerate mergers do produce thermonuclear explosions, produces supernova
light-curves that are broader than the observed type Ia sample. In addition, we
discuss how the shock breakout and spectral features of these double degenerate
progenitors will differ from the canonical bare Chandrasekhar-massed explosion
models. We conclude with a discussion of how one might reconcile these
differences with current observations.
