Four-quark correlators and the factorization hypothesis are analyzed in the
meson sector within Chiral Perturbation Theory. Factorization of the four-quark
condensate holds to leading and next to leading order. However at next to next
to leading order, a term with a nontrivial space-time dependence in the
four-quark correlator yields a divergent four-quark condensate, whereas the
two-quark condensate and the scalar susceptibility are finite. Such a
non-factorization term vanishes only in the chiral limit. We also comment on
how factorization still holds in the large $N_c$ limit, provided such a limit
is taken before renormalization.
