We examine the properties of the X-ray detected, Infrared Excess AGN or Dust
Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) in the Chandra Deep Fields (CDF). We find 26 X-ray
selected sources which obey the 24 micron to R-band flux ratio criterion
f_24/f_R>1000. These are at a median redshift of 2.3 while their IR
luminosities are above 10^12 solar. Their X-ray luminosities are all above a
few times 10^42 erg s-1 in the 2-10 keV band unambiguously arguing that these
host AGN. Nevertheless, their IR Spectral Energy Distributions are split
between AGN (Mrk231) and star-forming templates (Arp220). Our primary goal is
to examine their individual X-ray spectra in order to assess whether this X-ray
detected DOG population contains heavily obscured or even Compton-thick
sources. The X-ray spectroscopy reveals a mixed bag of objects. We find that
four out of the 12 sources with adequate photon statistics and hence reliable
X-ray spectra, show evidence for a hard X-ray spectral index (~1) or
harder,consistent with a Compton-thick spectrum. In total 12 out of the 26 DOGs
show evidence for flat spectral indices. However, owing to the limited photon
statistics we cannot differentiate whether these are flat because they are
reflection-dominated or because they show moderate amounts of absorption. Seven
DOGs show relatively steep spectra (>1.4) indicative of small column densities.
All the above suggest a fraction of Compton-thick sources that does not exceed
5%. The average X-ray spectrum of all 26 DOGs is hard (~1.1) or even harder
(~0.6) when we exclude the brightest sources. These spectral indices are well
in agreement with the stacked spectrum of X-ray undetected sources (~0.8 in the
CDFN). This could suggest (but not necessarily prove) that X-ray undetected
DOGs, in a similar fashion to the X-ray detected ones presented here, are
hosting a moderate fraction of Compton-thick sources.
