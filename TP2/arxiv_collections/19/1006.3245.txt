Current disruption (CD) and the related kinetic instabilities in the
near-Earth magnetosphere represent physical mechanisms which can trigger
multi-scale substorm activity including global reorganizations of the
magnetosphere. Lui et al. (2008) proposed a CD scenario in which the kinetic
scale linear modes grow and reach the typical dipolarization scales through an
inverse cascade. The experimental verification of the inverse nonlinear cascade
is based on wavelet analysis. In this paper the Hilbert-Huang transform is used
which is suitable for nonlinear systems and allows to reconstruct the
time-frequency representation of empirical decomposed modes in an adaptive
manner. It was found that, in the Lui et al. (2008) event, the modes evolve
globally from high-frequencies to low-frequencies. However, there are also
local frequency evolution trends oriented towards high-frequencies, indicating
that the underlying processes involve multi-scale physics and non-stationary
fluctuations for which the simple inverse cascade scenario is not correct.
