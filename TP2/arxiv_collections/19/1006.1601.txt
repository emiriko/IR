Based on a theorem we establish on dynamical decoupling of time-dependent
systems, we present a scheme of nested Uhrig dynamical decoupling (NUDD) to
protect multi-qubit systems in generic quantum baths to arbitrary decoupling
orders, using only single-qubit operations. The number of control pulses in
NUDD increases polynomially with the decoupling order. For general multi-level
systems, this scheme can preserve a set of unitary Hermitian system operators
which mutually either commute or anti-commute, and hence all operators in the
Lie algebra generated from this set of operators, generating an effective
symmetry group for the system up to a given order of precision. NUDD can be
implemented with pulses of finite amplitude, up to an error in the second order
of the pulse durations.
