This paper studies Emerton's Jacquet module functor for locally analytic
representations of p-adic reductive groups. When P is a parabolic subgroup
whose Levi factor M is not commutative, we show that passing to an isotypical
subspace for the derived subgroup of M gives rise to essentially admissible
locally analytic representations of the torus Z(M), which have a natural
interpretation in terms of rigid geometry. We use this to extend Emerton's
representation-theoretic construction of eigenvarieties by constructing
eigenvarieties interpolating automorphic representations whose local components
at p are not necessarily principal series.
