The square-gradient density-functional model with triple-parabolic free
energy, that was used previously to study the homogeneous bubble nucleation [J.
Chem. Phys. 129, 104508 (2008)], is used to study the stability of the critical
bubble nucleated within the bulk under-saturated stretched fluid. The stability
of the bubble is studied by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for the
fluctuation. The negative eigenvalue corresponds to the unstable growing mode
of the fluctuation. Our results show that there is only one negative eigenvalue
whose eigenfunction represents the fluctuation that corresponds to the
isotropically growing or shrinking nucleus. In particular, this negative
eigenvalue survives up to the spinodal point. Therefore the critical bubble is
not fractal or ramified near the spinodal.
