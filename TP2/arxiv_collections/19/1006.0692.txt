We derive the Mg/H ratio in the Orion nebula and in 30 Doradus. We also
derive the O/H and the Fe/O ratios in the extremely metal poor galaxy SBS
0335-052. We estimate the dust depletions of Mg, Si, and Fe in Galactic and
extragalactic H II regions. Based on these depletions we estimate the fraction
of O atoms embedded in dust as a function of the O/H ratio. We find an
increasing depletion of O with increasing O/H. The O depletion increases from
about 0.08 dex, for the metal poorest H II regions known, to about 0.12 dex,
for metal rich H II regions. This depletion has to be considered when comparing
nebular with stellar abundances.
