We study the $Z^\pm(4430)$ meson within a heavy hadron molecule
interpretation where the $Z$ is considered as a bound state of a vector
$D^\ast(2010)$ and an axial-vector $D_1(2420)$. We give predictions for the
strong hidden-charm $Z^\pm(4430) \to \pi^\pm \psi$ and $\pi^\pm\psi^\prime$
decay widths and also study the radiative $Z^\pm\;(J^P=1^-) \to \pi^\pm\gamma$
decay properties in a phenomenological Lagrangian approach. Our findings are
qualitatively in line with the experimental observation that the
$\pi^\pm\psi^\prime$ transition dominates over the $\pi^\pm\psi$ decay mode
despite a smaller phase space. The width for the radiative mode $\pi^\pm\gamma$
is sizable, allowing possible detection in future experiments.
