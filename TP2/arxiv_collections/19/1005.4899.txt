From a broader perspective, the heliosphere and planetary magnetospheres
provide a test bed to explore the plasma physics of the Universe. In
particular, the underlying nonlinear coupling of different spatial and temporal
scales plays a key role in determining the structure and dynamics of space
plasmas and electromagnetic fields. Plasmas and fields exhibit both laminar and
turbulent properties, corresponding to either well organized or disordered
states, and the development of quantitative theoretical and analytical
descriptions from physics based first principles is a profound challenge.
Limited observations and complications introduced by geometry and physical
parameters conspire to complicate the problem. Dimensionless scaling analysis
and statistical methods are universally applied common approaches that allow
for the application of related ideas to multiple physical problems. We discuss
several examples of the interplay between the scales in a variety of space
plasma environments, as exemplified in the presentations of the session
\textit{From Micro- to Macro-scales in the Heliosphere and Magnetospheres.}
