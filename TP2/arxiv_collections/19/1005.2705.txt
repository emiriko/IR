The spectra of far-infrared transmission in Tb3Fe5O12 magnetoelectric single
crystals have been studied in the range between 15 and 100 cm-1, in magnetic
fields up to 10 T, and for temperatures between 5 and 150 K. We attribute some
of the observed infrared-active excitations to electric-dipole transitions
between ligand-field split states of Tb3+ ions. Anticrossing between the
magnetic exchange excitation and the ligand-field transition occurs at the
temperature between 60 and 80 K. The corresponding coupling energy for this
interaction is 6 cm-1. Temperature-induced softening of the hybrid IR
excitation correlates with the increase of the static dielectric constant. We
discuss the possibility for hybrid excitations of magnons and ligand-field
states and their possible connection to the magnetoelectric effect in
Tb3Fe5O12.
