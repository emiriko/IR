The Tevatron provides 1.96 TeV ppbar collisions and allows for collection of
rich b-hadron samples to the two experiments CDF and D0. The study of heavy
flavor properties represents a fruitful opportunity to investigate the flavor
sector of the Standard Model (SM) and to look for hints of New Physics (NP).
Here we report the first measurement of polarization amplitudes in B^0_s
charmless decays, world leading results on b-hadron lifetimes, and measurements
of several other properties of b-hadrons.
