We consider the effects of decoherence on the entanglement of photonic
cluster states. Large photonic cluster states can be built by fusing together
smaller photonic cluster states via probabilistic fusion operations. For this
construction process it is necessary to store these smaller cluster states in
some way so as to have them available for attempted fusion operations. While in
storage the photonic cluster states may undergo dephasing. The effects of
dephasing on small, primitive cluster states is explored here with the aim of
determining how to locally rotate the qubits of the cluster state so as to lose
the least amount of entanglement due to the dephasing process.
