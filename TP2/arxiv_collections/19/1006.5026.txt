We propose a theory in electromagnetic dynamics, in which time and space are
equivalent with each other and have totally twelve dimensions. Then, we solve
that with realistic assumptions and find a steady state as a solution. The
solution draws a circle in complex space having six dimensions as a closed
string, which is an orbit passed by waves of two scalar fields having electric
and magnetic characters, respectively. We also discuss a possibility of
existing solutions of electromagnetic waves.
