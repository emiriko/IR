We present an efficient method for the calculation of free energy landscapes.
Our approach involves a history dependent bias potential which is evaluated on
a grid. The corresponding free energy landscape is constructed via a histogram
reweighting procedure a posteriori. Due to the presence of the bias potential,
it can be also used to accelerate rare events. In addition, the calculated free
energy landscape is not restricted to the actual choice of collective variables
and can in principle be extended to auxiliary variables of interest without
further numerical effort. The applicability is shown for several examples. We
present numerical results for the alanine dipeptide and the Met-Enkephalin in
explicit solution to illustrate our approach. Furthermore we derive an
empirical formula that allows the prediction of the computational cost for the
ordinary metadynamics variant in comparison to our approach which is validated
by a dimensionless representation.
