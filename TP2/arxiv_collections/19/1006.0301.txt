The algebraic structure and the spectral properties of a special class of
multi-component NLS equations, related to the symmetric spaces of {\bf
BD.I}-type are analyzed. The focus of the study is on the spectral theory of
the relevant Lax operators for different fundamental representations of the
underlying simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Special attention is paid to the
structure of the dressing factors in spinor representation of the orthogonal
simple Lie algebras of ${\bf B}_r\simeq so(2r+1,{\mathbb C})$ type.
