The transition rates for the 2_{1}^{+} states in 62,64,66Fe were studied
using the Recoil Distance Doppler-Shift technique applied to projectile Coulomb
excitation reactions. The deduced E2 strengths illustrate the enhanced
collectivity of the neutron-rich Fe isotopes up to N=40. The results are
interpreted by the generalized concept of valence proton symmetry which
describes the evolution of nuclear structure around N=40 as governed by the
number of valence protons with respect to Z~30. The deformation suggested by
the experimental data is reproduced by state-of-the-art shell calculations with
a new effective interaction developed for the fpgd valence space.
