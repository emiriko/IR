Atmospheric flows, an example of turbulent fluid flows, exhibit fractal
fluctuations of all space-time scales ranging from turbulence scale of mm -sec
to climate scales of thousands of kilometers - years and may be visualized as a
nested continuum of weather cycles or periodicities, the smaller cycles
existing as intrinsic fine structure of the larger cycles. The power spectra of
fractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form signifying long - range
correlations identified as self - organized criticality and are ubiquitous to
dynamical systems in nature and is manifested as sensitive dependence on
initial condition or 'deterministic chaos' in finite precision computer
realizations of nonlinear mathematical models of real world dynamical systems
such as atmospheric flows. Though the selfsimilar nature of atmospheric flows
have been widely documented and discussed during the last three to four
decades, the exact physical mechanism is not yet identified. There now exists
an urgent need to develop and incorporate basic physical concepts of nonlinear
dynamics and chaos into classical meteorological theory for more realistic
simulation and prediction of weather and climate. A review of nonlinear
dynamics and chaos in meteorology and atmospheric physics is summarized in this
paper.
