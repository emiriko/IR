Potential of the LHC to explore the phenomenology of the Kaluza-Klein (KK)
tower of gravitons in the scenarios of the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and
Dvali(ADD) model and Randall-Sundrum (RS) model is discussed via the process
${\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma}$ including the Standard Model one loop
diagram. The improved constraints on model parameters have been obtained
compared to the LEP and Tevatron sensitivity.
