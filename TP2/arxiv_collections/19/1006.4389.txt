We report the identification of presolar silicates (~177 ppm), presolar
oxides (~11 ppm), and one presolar SiO2 grain in the Allan Hills (ALHA) 77307
chondrite. Three grains having Si isotopic compositions similar to SiC X and Z
grains were also identified, though the mineral phases are unconfirmed. Similar
abundances of presolar silicates (~152 ppm) and oxides (~8 ppm) were also
uncovered in the primitive CR chondrite Queen Elizabeth Range (QUE) 99177,
along with 13 presolar SiC grains and one presolar silicon nitride. The O
isotopic compositions of the presolar silicates and oxides indicate that most
of the grains condensed in low-mass red giant and asymptotic giant branch
stars. Interestingly, unlike presolar oxides, few presolar silicate grains have
isotopic compositions pointing to low-metallicity, low-mass stars (Group 3).
The 18O-rich (Group 4) silicates, along with the few Group 3 silicates that
were identified, likely have origins in supernova outflows. This is supported
by their O and Si isotopic compositions. Elemental compositions for 74 presolar
silicate grains were determined by scanning Auger spectroscopy. Most of the
grains have non-stoichiometric elemental compositions inconsistent with
pyroxene or olivine, the phases commonly used to fit astronomical spectra, and
have comparable Mg and Fe contents. Non-equilibrium condensation and/or
secondary alteration could produce the high Fe contents. Transmission electron
microscopic analysis of three silicate grains also reveals non-stoichiometric
compositions, attributable to non-equilibrium or multistep condensation, and
very fine scale elemental heterogeneity, possibly due to subsequent annealing.
The mineralogies of presolar silicates identified in meteorites thus far seem
to differ from those in interplanetary dust particles.
