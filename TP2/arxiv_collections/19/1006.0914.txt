Despite strong experimental and theoretical evidence supporting
superresolution imaging based on microlenses, imaging mechanisms involved are
not well understood. Based on the transformation optics approach, we
demonstrate that microlenses may act as two-dimensional fisheye or Eaton
lenses. An asymmetric Eaton lens may exhibit considerable image magnification,
which has been confirmed experimentally.
