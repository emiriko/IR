We review, in a historical perspective, developments in physics which led to
the emergence of unifying ideas and theories. Some attention is paid to the
theoretical programme that started in the second decade of the XXth century and
whose objective was to reach a unified description of gravity and
electromagnetism. These attempts can be regarded as conceptually akin to the
contemporary "theories of everything" which aim to unify all interactions of
Nature.
