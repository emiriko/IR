The notion of spherically symmetric superfunctions as functions invariant
under the orthosymplectic group is introduced. This leads to dimensional
reduction theorems for differentiation and integration in superspace. These
spherically symmetric functions can be used to solve orthosymplectically
invariant Schroedinger equations in superspace, such as the (an)harmonic
oscillator or the Kepler problem. Finally the obtained machinery is used to
prove the Funk-Hecke theorem and Bochner's relations in superspace.
