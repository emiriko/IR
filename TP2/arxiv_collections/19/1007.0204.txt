The anomaly in the Cosmic Microwave Background known as the "Cold Spot" could
be due to the existence of an anomalously large spherical (few hundreds Mpc/h
radius) underdense region, called a "Void" for short. Such a structure would
have an impact on the CMB also at high multipoles l through Lensing. This would
then represent a unique signature of a Void. Modeling such an underdensity with
an LTB metric, we show that the Lensing effect leads to a large signal in the
non-diagonal two-point function, centered in the direction of the Cold Spot,
such that the Planck satellite will be able to confirm or rule out the Void
explanation for the Cold Spot, for any Void radius with a Signal-to-Noise ratio
of at least O(10).
