After the first detection of its binary nature, the spectroscopic monitoring
of the non-thermal radio emitter Cyg OB2 #9 (P=2.4yrs) has continued, doubling
the number of available spectra of the star. Since the discovery paper of 2008,
a second periastron passage has occurred in February 2009. Using a variety of
techniques, the radial velocities could be estimated and a first, preliminary
orbital solution was derived from the HeI5876 line. The mass ratio appears
close to unity and the eccentricity is large, 0.7--0.75. X-ray data from 2004
and 2007 are also analyzed in quest of peculiarities linked to binarity. The
observations reveal no large overluminosity nor strong hardness, but it must be
noted that the high-energy data were taken after the periastron passage, at a
time where colliding wind emission may be low. Some unusual X-ray variability
is however detected, with a 10% flux decrease between 2004 and 2007. To clarify
their origin and find a more obvious signature of the wind-wind collision,
additional data, taken at periastron and close to it, are needed.
