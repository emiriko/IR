We consider a different power counting in potential NRQCD by incorporating
the static potential exactly in the leading order Hamiltonian. We compute the
leading relativistic corrections to the inclusive electromagnetic decay ratios
in this new scheme. The effect of this new power counting is found to be large
(even for top). We produce an updated value for the $\eta_b$ decay to two
photons. This scheme also brings consistency between the weak coupling
computation and the experimental value of the charmonium decay ratio.
