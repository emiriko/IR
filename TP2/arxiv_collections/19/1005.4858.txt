We give a simple geometric argument to derive in a common manner
orthospectrum identities of Basmajian and Bridgeman. Our method also
considerably simplifies the determination of the summands in these identities.
For example, for every odd integer n, there is a rational function q_n of
degree 2(n-2) so that if M is a compact hyperbolic manifold of dimension n with
totally geodesic boundary S, there is an identity \chi(S) = \sum_i q_n(e^{l_i})
where the sum is taken over the orthospectrum of M. When n=3, this has the
explicit form \sum_i 1/(e^{2l_i}-1) = -\chi(S)/4.
