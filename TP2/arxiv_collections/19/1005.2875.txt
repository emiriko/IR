We study the noise of the intensity variance and of the intensity correlation
and structure functions measured in light scattering from a random medium in
the case when these quantities are obtained by averaging over a finite number N
of pixels of a digital camera. We show that the noise scales as 1/N in all
cases and that it is sensitive to correlations of signals corresponding to
adjacent pixels as well as to the effective time averaging (due to the finite
sampling time) and spatial averaging (due to the finite pixel size). Our
results provide a guide to estimation of noise level in such applications as
the multi-speckle dynamic light scattering, time-resolved correlation
spectroscopy, speckle visibility spectroscopy, laser speckle imaging etc.
