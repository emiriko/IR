The search for substellar companions around stars with different masses along
the main sequence is critical to understand the different processes leading to
the formation of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planets. In particular, the
existence of a large population of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs physically
bound to early-type main-sequence stars could imply that the massive planets
recently imaged at wide separations (10-100 AU) around A-type stars are
disc-born objects in the low-mass tail of the binary distribution. Our aim is
to characterize the environment of early-type main-sequence stars by detecting
brown dwarf or low-mass star companions between 10 and 500 AU. High contrast
and high angular resolution near-infrared images of a sample of 38 southern A-
and F-type stars have been obtained between 2005 and 2009 with the instruments
VLT/NaCo and CFHT/PUEO. Multi-epoch observations were performed to discriminate
comoving companions from background contaminants. About 41 companion candidates
were imaged around 23 stars. Follow-up observations for 83% of these stars
allowed us to identify a large number of background contaminants. We report the
detection of 7 low-mass stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.8 Msun in 6
multiple systems: the discovery of a M2 companion around the A5V star HD14943
and the detection of the B component of the F4V star HD41742 quadruple system;
we resolve the known companion of the F6.5V star HD49095 as a short-period
binary system composed by 2 M/L dwarfs. We also resolve the companions to the
astrometric binaries iot Crt (F6.5V) and 26 Oph (F3V), and identify a M3/M4
companion to the F4V star omi Gru, associated with a X-ray source. The global
multiplicity fraction measured in our sample of A and F stars is >16%. A
parallel velocimetric survey of our stars let us conclude that the imaged
companions can impact on the observed radial velocity measurements.
