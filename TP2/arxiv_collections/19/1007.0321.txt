Certain supersymmetric grand unified models predict that the coefficients of
the quadratic terms in the MSSM Higgs potential should be degenerate at the GUT
scale. We discuss some examples for such models, and we analyse the
implications of this peculiar condition of a GUT-scale degenerate Higgs mass
matrix for low-scale MSSM phenomenology. To this end we explore the parameter
space which is consistent with existing experimental constraints by means of a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis.
