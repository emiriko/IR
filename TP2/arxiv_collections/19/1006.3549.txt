Magnetic helicity has risen to be a major player in dynamo theory, with the
helicity of the small-scale field being linked to the dynamo saturation process
for the large-scale field. It is a nearly conserved quantity, which allows its
evolution equation to be written in terms of production and flux terms. The
flux term can be decomposed in a variety of fashions. One particular
contribution that has been expected to play a significant role in dynamos in
the presence of mean shear was isolated by Vishniac & Cho (2001, ApJ 550, 752).
Magnetic helicity fluxes are explicitly gauge dependent however, and the
correlations that have come to be called the Vishniac-Cho flux were determined
in the Coulomb gauge, which turns out to be fraught with complications in
shearing systems. While the fluxes of small-scale helicity are explicitly gauge
dependent, their divergences can be gauge independent. We use this property to
investigate magnetic helicity fluxes of small-scale field through direct
numerical simulations in a shearing-box system and find that in a numerically
usable gauge the divergence of the small-scale helicity flux vanishes, while
the divergence of the Vishniac-Cho flux remains finite. We attribute this
seeming contradiction to the existence of horizontal fluxes of small-scale
magnetic helicity with finite divergences even in our shearing-periodic domain.
