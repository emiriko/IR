Image steganography is the art of hiding information into a cover image. This
paper presents a novel technique for Image steganography based on Block-DCT,
where DCT is used to transform original image (cover image) blocks from spatial
domain to frequency domain. Firstly a gray level image of size M x N is divided
into no joint 8 x 8 blocks and a two dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (2-d
DCT) is performed on each of the P = MN / 64 blocks. Then Huffman encoding is
also performed on the secret messages/images before embedding and each bit of
Huffman code of secret message/image is embedded in the frequency domain by
altering the least significant bit of each of the DCT coefficients of cover
image blocks. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a high
capacity and a good invisibility. Moreover PSNR of cover image with stego-image
shows the better results in comparison with other existing steganography
approaches. Furthermore, satisfactory security is maintained since the secret
message/image cannot be extracted without knowing decoding rules and Huffman
table.
