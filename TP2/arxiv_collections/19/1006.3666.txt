The elementary excitation spectrum of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
antiferromagnetic (AFM) Heisenberg chain is described in terms of a pair of
freely propagating spinons. In the case of the Ising-like Heisenberg
Hamiltonian spinons can be interpreted as domain walls (DWs) separating
degenerate ground states. In dimension $d>1$, the issue of spinons as
elementary excitations is still unsettled. In this paper, we study two
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ AFM ladder models in which the individual chains are
described by the Ising-like Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The rung exchange
interactions are assumed to be pure Ising-type in one case and Ising-like
Heisenberg in the other. Using the low-energy effective Hamiltonian approach in
a perturbative formulation, we show that the spinons are coupled in bound
pairs. In the first model, the bound pairs are delocalized due to a four-spin
ring exchange term in the effective Hamiltonian. The appropriate dynamic
structure factor is calculated and the associated lineshape is found to be
almost symmetric in contrast to the 1d case. In the case of the second model,
the bound pair of spinons lowers its kinetic energy by propagating between
chains. The results obtained are consistent with recent theoretical studies and
experimental observations on ladder-like materials.
