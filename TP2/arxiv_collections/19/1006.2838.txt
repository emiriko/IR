The widespread emergence of the Internet as a platform for electronic data
distribution and the advent of structured information have revolutionized our
ability to deliver information to any corner of the world. Although Service
Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a paradigm for organizing and utilizing
distributed capabilities that may be under the control of different ownership
domains and implemented using various technology stacks and every organization
may not be geared up for this. To harness the various software / service
resources placed on various systems, we have proposed and implemented a model
that is able to establish discovery and sharing in load balanced P-grid
environment. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has
dramatically lowered the network traffic (nearly negligible), while achieving
load balancing in P2P grid systems. Our model is able to support discovery and
sharing of resources also.
