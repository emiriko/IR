We continue the development of a nonperturbative light-front Hamiltonian
method for the solution of quantum field theories by considering the one-photon
eigenstate of Lorentz-gauge QED. The photon state is computed nonperturbatively
for a Fock basis with a bare photon state and electron-positron pair states.
The calculation is regulated by the inclusion of Pauli-Villars (PV) fermions,
with one flavor to make the integrals finite and a second flavor to guarantee a
zero mass for the physical photon eigenstate. We compute in detail the
constraints on the PV coupling strengths that this zero mass implies. As part
of this analysis, we provide the complete Lorentz-gauge light-front QED
Hamiltonian with two PV fermion flavors and two PV photon flavors, which will
be useful for future work. The need for two PV photons was established
previously; the need for two PV fermions is established here.
