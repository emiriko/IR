A procedure that allows study of unstable stability of a boundary layer
between plasma and a magnetic field has been developed. Layer equilibrium for
one reason or another is not set but follows from strict solution of kinetic
equation with self-consistent electromagnetic field. Nicolson's solution was
used as equilibrium solution. The non-equilibrium component to the distribution
function was found and on this basis tensor of dielectric permeability
simulating the medium was (boundary layer) is calculated. This tensor
essentially differs from the known tensor for magnetoactive plasma. Equations
for electric field perturbation were obtained from the Maxwell's equations
completed with the derived constitutive equation. The technique of
determination of dispersion characteristics of perturbations of a boundary
layer was proposed. The theory is applicable to thermal nonrelativistic plasma.
