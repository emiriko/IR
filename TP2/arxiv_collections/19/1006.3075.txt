We investigate the emergence of large, localized, pseudo-stable
configurations (oscillons) from inflaton fragmentation at the end of inflation.
We predict the number density of large oscillons, and the conditions necessary
for their emergence in a class of inflationary models. Analytic estimates are
provided for a 3+1 and 1+1-dimensional universe. We test our predictions with
detailed numerical simulations in 1+1-dimensions. We see a zoo of oscillons
emerging from the simulations, including the usual small amplitude "sech"
oscillons as well as large "flat-topped" oscillons. The emergent oscillons
account for approximately 80 per cent of the energy density of the inflaton.
