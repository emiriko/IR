Entropy change in exclusive quark combination models is not an isolated
problem. Contrary to adding and tuning some parameters to the relevant model(s)
to fix the entropy, we show that it relates to the most general principles.
Unitarity of the combination model is demonstrated to play the central r\^{o}le
that guarantees the non-decrease of the entropy in the exclusive combination
process.
