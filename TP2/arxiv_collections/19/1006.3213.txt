In view of the fact that the $n = 1$ Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes in a model with
a Universal Extra Dimension (UED), could mimic supersymmetry signatures at the
LHC, it is necessary to look for the $n = 2$ KK modes, which have no analogues
in supersymmetry. We discuss the possibility of searching for heavy $n = 2$
vector boson resonances -- especially the $g_2$ -- through their decays to a
highly-boosted top quark-antiquark pair using recently-developed top-jet
tagging techniques in the hadronic channel. It is shown that $t\bar{t}$ signals
from the $n = 2$ gluon resonance are as efficient a discovery mode at the LHC
as dilepton channels from the $\gamma_2$ and $Z_2$ resonances.
