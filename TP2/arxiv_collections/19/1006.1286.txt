We compute the E-polynomials of a family of twisted character varieties by
proving they have polynomial count, and applying a result of N. Katz on the
counting functions.
  To compute the number of GF(q)-points of these varieties as a function of q,
we used a formula of Frobenius. Our calculations made use of the character
tables of Gl(n,q) and Sl(n,q), previously computed by J. A. Green and G.
Lehrer, and a result of Hanlon on the M\"obius function of a subposet of
set-partitions.
  The Euler Characteristics of these character varieties are calculated with
these polynomial.
