We report on the crystal structure of the quantum magnet (CuCl)LaNb2O7 that
was controversially described with respect to its structural organization and
magnetic behavior. Using high-resolution synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction,
electron diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and band structure
calculations, we solve the room-temperature structure of this compound
[alpha-(CuCl)LaNb2O7] and find two high-temperature polymorphs. The
gamma-(CuCl)LaNb2O7 phase, stable above 640K, is tetragonal with a(sub) = 3.889
A, c(sub) = 11.738 A, and the space group P4/mmm. In the gamma-(CuCl)LaNb2O7
structure, the Cu and Cl atoms are randomly displaced from the special
positions along the {100} directions. The beta-phase [a(sub) x 2a(sub) x
c(sub), space group Pbmm] and the alpha-phase [2a(sub) x 2a(sub) x c(sub),
space group Pbam] are stable between 640 K and 500 K and below 500 K,
respectively. The structural changes at 500 K and 640 K are identified as
order-disorder phase transitions. The displacement of the Cl atoms is frozen
upon the gamma --> beta transformation, while a cooperative tilting of the NbO6
octahedra in the alpha-phase further eliminates the disorder of the Cu atoms.
The low-temperature alpha-(CuCl)LaNb2O7 structure thus combines the two types
of the atomic displacements that interfere due to the bonding between the Cu
atoms and the apical oxygens of the NbO6 octahedra. The precise structural
information resolves the controversy between the previous computation-based
models and provides the long-sought input for understanding the magnetic
properties of (CuCl)LaNb2O7.
