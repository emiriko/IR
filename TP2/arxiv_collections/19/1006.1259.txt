We have employed the steepest descent method to optimise the variational
ground state quantum Monte Carlo wave function for He, Li, Be, B and C atoms.
We have used both the direct energy minimisation and the variance minimisation
approaches. Our calculations show that in spite of receiving insufficient
attention, the steepest descent method can successfully minimise the wave
function. All the derivatives of the trial wave function respect to spatial
coordinates and variational parameters have been computed analytically. Our
ground state energies are in a very good agreement with those obtained with
diffusion quantum Monte Carlo method (DMC) and the exact results.
