Analysis of the Interball-1 spacecraft data (1995-2000) has shown that the
solar wind ion flux sometimes increases or decreases abruptly by more than 20%
over a time period of several seconds or minutes. Typically, the amplitude of
such sharp changes in the solar wind ion flux (SCIFs) is larger than 0.5x10^8
cm^-2 s^-1. These sudden changes of the ion flux were also observed by the
Solar Wind Experiment (SWE), on board the WIND spacecraft, as the solar wind
density increases and decreases with negligible changes in the solar wind
velocity. SCIFs occur irregularly at 1 AU, when plasma flows with specific
properties come to the Earth's orbit. SCIFs are usually observed in slow,
turbulent solar wind with increased density and interplanetary magnetic field
strength. The number of times SCIFs occur during a day is simulated using the
solar wind density, magnetic field, and their standard deviations as input
parameters for a period of 5 years. A correlation coefficient of ~0.7 is
obtained between the modelled and the experimental data. It is found that SCIFs
are not associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), corotating interaction
regions (CIRs), or interplanetary shocks; however, 85% of the sector boundaries
are surrounded by SCIFs. The properties of the solar wind plasma for days with
5 or more SCIF observations are the same as those of the solar wind plasma at
the sector boundaries. One possible explanation for the occurrence of SCIFs
(near sector boundaries) is magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current
sheet or local current sheets. Other probable causes of SCIFs (inside sectors)
are turbulent processes in the slow solar wind and at the crossings of flux
tubes.
