We present a new approach for generating tiny neutrino masses. The Dirac
neutrino mass matrix gets contributions from two new Higgs doublets with their
vevs at the electroweak (EW) scale. Neutrino masses are tiny not because of
tiny Yukawa couplings, or very heavy ($\sim 10^{14}\textrm{GeV}$) right handed
neutrinos. They are tiny because of a cancelation in the Dirac neutrino mass
matrix (fine tuning). After fine tuning to make the Dirac neutrino mass matrix
at the $10^{-4}$ GeV scale, light neutrino masses are obtained in the correct
scale via the see-saw mechanism with the right handed neutrino at the EW scale.
The proposal links neutrino physics to collider physics. The Higgs search
strategy is completely altered. For a wide range of Higgs masses, the Standard
Model Higgs decays dominantly to $\nu_L N_R$ mode giving rise to the final
state $\bar{\nu} \nu \bar{b} b$, or $\bar{\nu} \nu \tau^+\tau^-$. This can be
tested at the LHC, and possibly at the Tevatron.
