Investigations into the heterogeneous pinning properties of the vortex state
created by partially nano-patterning single crystals of 2H-NbSe2 reveal an
atypical magnetization response which is significantly drive dependent.
Analysis of the magnetization response shows non-monotonic behavior of the
magnetization relaxation rate with varying magnetic field sweep rate. With all
the patterned pinning centers saturated with vortices, we find that the pinning
force experienced by the vortices continues to increase with increasing drive.
Our studies reveal an unconventional dynamic weak to strong pinning crossover
where the flow of the vortex state appears to be hindered or jammed as it is
driven harder through the interstitial voids in the patterned pinning lattice.
