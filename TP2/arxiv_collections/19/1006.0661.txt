We consider different patterns of supersymmetry breaking gaugino masses, and
implications of these patterns for the phenomenology of neutralinos and
charginos in models of low energy supersymmetry. We outline a general procedure
for obtaining approximate values for the neutralino masses relevant for our
analysis, and describe the constraints on the gaugino mass parameters which
follow from the present experimental limits on the mass of the lightest
chargino. We evaluate an upper bound on the mass of the lightest neutralino
that follows from the structure of the mass matrix in different models for the
gaugino mass parameters. Using the experimental lower limit for the chargino
mass, we examine the lower bound for the neutralino masses. Using a sum rule
for the squared masses of charginos and neutralinos, we discuss how to
distinguish between different models for the supersymmetry breaking scenarios.
We discuss in detail the decay modes of neutralinos and charginos in different
models of supersymmetry breaking. Our analysis shows that by measuring the
masses and decay properties of the neutralinos, one can distinguish between
different patterns of supersymmetry breaking in the gaugino sector. We then
compare the dark matter characteristics that arise in different models of
supersymmetry breaking.
