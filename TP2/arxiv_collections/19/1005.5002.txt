We prove that for a fairly large family of HNN extensions \Gamma, the group
measure space II_1 factor L^\infty(X) \rtimes \Gamma given by an arbitrary free
ergodic probability measure preserving action of \Gamma, has a unique group
measure space Cartan subalgebra up to unitary conjugacy. We deduce from this
new examples of W^*-superrigid group actions, i.e. where the II_1 factor
L^\infty(X) \rtimes \Gamma entirely remembers the group action that it was
constructed from.
