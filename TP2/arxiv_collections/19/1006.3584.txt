The multi-mode character of quantum fields imposes constraints on the
implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates between individual photons. So
far this has only been studied for the longitudinal degree of freedom. Here we
show that effects due to the transverse degrees of freedom significantly affect
quantum gate performance. We also discuss potential solutions, in particular
separating the two photons in the transverse direction.
