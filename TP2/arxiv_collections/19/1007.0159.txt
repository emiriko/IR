Often, when modelling a system there are properties and operations that are
related to a group of objects rather than to a single object. In this paper we
extend Java with Swarm Behavior, a new composition operator that associates
behavior with a collection of instances. The lookup resolution of swarm
behavior is based on the element type of a collection and is thus orthogonal to
the collection hierarchy.
