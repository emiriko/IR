The study of alternative models for elliptic curves has found recent interest
from cryptographic applications, once it was recognized that such models
provide more efficiently computable algorithms for the group law than the
standard Weierstrass model. Examples of such models arise via symmetries
induced by a rational torsion structure. We analyze the module structure of the
space of sections of the addition morphisms, determine explicit dimension
formulas for the spaces of sections and their eigenspaces under the action of
torsion groups, and apply this to specific models of elliptic curves with
parametrized torsion subgroups.
