The static vacuum spherically symmetric solutions of massive gravity theories
possess two integration constant: the mass M and a scalar charge S. The
presence of this scalar charge reflects the modification of the gravitational
interaction as compared to General Relativity. Surprisingly, these solutions
are non-linear even at large distances from the sources, implying that their
asymptotic behavior is different from that obtained in the linear perturbation
theory. The aim of this paper is to understand how these modified spherically
symmetric solutions emerge from a quasi-linear approximation in order to
generalize them to any arbitrary mass distribution. Along with these modified
solutions, we found a new class of static solutions having a Yukawa shape.
