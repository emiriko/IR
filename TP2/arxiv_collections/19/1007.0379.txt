The max-log-map (MLM) receiver is an approximated version of the well-known,
Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm. The MLM algorithm is attractive due
to its implementation simplicity. In practice, sliding-window implementations
are preferred; these practical implementations consider truncated signaling
neighborhoods around each transmission time instant. In this paper, we consider
sliding-window MLM receivers, where for any integer m, the MLM detector is
truncated to a length- m signaling neighborhood. For any number n of chosen
times instants, we derive exact expressions for both i) the joint distribution
of the MLM symbol reliabilities, and ii) the joint probability of the erroneous
MLM symbol detections. We show that the obtained expressions can be efficiently
evaluated using Monte-Carlo techniques. Our proposed method is efficient; the
most computationally expensive operation (in each Monte-Carlo trial) is an
eigenvalue decomposition of a size 2mn by 2mn matrix. Practical truncation
lengths can be easily handled. Finally, our proposed method is extremely
general, and various scenarios such as correlated noise distributions,
modulation coding, etc. may be easily accommodated.
