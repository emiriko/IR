This book presents our case in defense of a constructivist epistemological
framework and the use of compatible statistical theory and inference tools. The
basic metaphor of decision theory is the maximization of a gambler's expected
fortune, according to his own subjective utility, prior beliefs an learned
experiences. This metaphor has proven to be very useful, leading the
development of Bayesian statistics since its XX-th century revival, rooted on
the work of de Finetti, Savage and others. The basic metaphor presented in this
text, as a foundation for cognitive constructivism, is that of an
eigen-solution, and the verification of its objective epistemic status. The
FBST - Full Bayesian Significance Test - is the cornerstone of a set of
statistical tolls conceived to assess the epistemic value of such
eigen-solutions, according to their four essential attributes, namely,
sharpness, stability, separability and composability. We believe that this
alternative perspective, complementary to the one ofered by decision theory,
can provide powerful insights and make pertinent contributions in the context
of scientific research.
