The purpose of this article is to extend the lightcone worldsheet lattice
description of string theory to include the Neveu-Schwarz model. We model each
component of the fermionic worldsheet field by a critical Ising model. We show
that a simple choice of boundary conditions for the Ising variables leads to
the half integer modes required by the model. We identify the G-parity
operation within the Ising model and formulate the procedure for projecting
onto the even G-parity sector. We construct the lattice version of the three
open string vertex, with the necessary operator insertion at the interaction
point. We sketch a formalism for summing planar open string multi-loop
amplitudes, and we discuss prospects for numerically summing them. If
successful, the methods described here could provide an alternative to lattice
gauge theory for computations in large N QCD.
