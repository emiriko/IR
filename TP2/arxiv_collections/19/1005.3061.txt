In this Thesis we address the issue of consistent higher-spin interactions
taking String Theory as a "theoretical laboratory". We thus arrive at a simple
expression encompassing all three-point amplitudes for states belonging to the
first Regge trajectory of the open bosonic string, that are described by fully
symmetric tensors, and we explicitly construct the corresponding effective
action at the cubic level. A gauge invariant structure is seen to emerge in the
massless limit, in line with long-held expectations for high-energy string
scattering. We also study some properties of the field theory amplitudes that
arise from our effective Lagrangian and involve the exchange of infinitely many
higher-spin excitations. These results and other related developments will soon
appear in a joint publication with A. Sagnotti
