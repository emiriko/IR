Based on QCD sum rules we explore the consequences of a pure chiral
restoration scenario for the rho meson, where all chiral symmetry breaking
condensates are dropped whereas the chirally symmetric condensates remain at
their vacuum values. This pure chiral restoration scenario causes the drop of
the rho spectral moment by about 120 MeV. The complementarity of mass shift and
broadening is discussed. A simple parametrization of the rho spectral function
leads to a width of about 600 MeV if no shift of the peak position is assumed.
