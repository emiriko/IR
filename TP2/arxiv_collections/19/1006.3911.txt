A symmetric anti-parallel quantum pair of vortices is simulated using the
three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevski equations. The initial development before
cores interact directly demonstrates the traditional vortex dynamics of
stretching, curvature and torsion in a manner consistent with a filament
calculation and simulations of the classical, ideal Euler equations. Once the
cores begin to interact, reconnection develops in the vacuum that forms between
the pair. Out of the reconnection region, vortex waves are emitted with
properties similar to waves in the local induction approximation. These waves
propagate down the initial vortex and deepen. When they deepen far enough,
secondary reconnections occur and vortex rings form. Near this time, spectra
have a $k^{-3}$ regime. As the vortex rings fully separate, the high wavenumber
spectra grow until, at the final time simulated, spectra in two directions
develop nearly -5/3 subranges. This occurs without the dissipation of energy.
Preliminary analysis of the flow of energies in spectral scale and physical
space is discussed.
