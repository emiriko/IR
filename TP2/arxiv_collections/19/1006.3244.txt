We calculate the statistical significance of the anomalous deficit of
electron neutrinos measured in the radioactive source experiments of the GALLEX
and SAGE solar neutrino detectors taking into account the uncertainty of the
detection cross section. We found that the statistical significance of the
anomaly is about 3.0 sigma. A fit of the data in terms of neutrino oscillations
favors at about 2.7 sigma short-baseline electron neutrino disappearance with
respect to the null hypothesis of no oscillations.
