In this work we show that stationary light-matter excitations generated
inside a hollow one-dimensional waveguide filled with atoms, can be made to
generate a photonic two-component Lieb Liniger model. We explain how to prepare
and drive the atomic system to a strongly interacting regime where spin-charge
separation could be possible. We then proceed by explaining how to measure the
corresponding effective spin and charge densities and velocities through
standard optical methods based in measuring dynamically the emitted photon
intensities or by analyzing the photon spectrum. The relevant interactions
exhibit the necessary tunability both to generate and efficiently observe spin
charge separation with current technology.
