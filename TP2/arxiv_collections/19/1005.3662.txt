Using x-ray powder diffraction technique at various temperatures and applied
magnetic fields, we have studied the magnetostructural properties of
Ce(Fe0.95Si0.05)2. The x-ray diffraction data establish quantitative
relationships between bulk magnetization and the evolution of structurally
distinct phases with magnetic field and temperature, and confirm the distinct
features of first order phase transition like supercooling and superheating,
metastability, and phase co-existence of different structural polymorphs. We
observe the lattice volume mismatch across the structural phase transition,
which appears to be the cause for the step behavior of the magnetization
isotherms at low temperatures. The present study shows that the lattice
distortion has to be treated explicitly, like spin, along with the effects of
lattice-spin coupling to account for the magnetization behavior of this system.
This structure template can resolve the issue of kinetics in this material as
observed in different time scale measurements and with different experimental
protocols.
