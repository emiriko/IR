A fourth chiral generation, with $m_{t^\prime}$ in the range $\sim (300 -
500)$ GeV and a moderate value of the CP-violating phase can explain the
anomalous like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry observed recently by the D0
collaboration. The required parameters are found to be consistent with
constraints from other $B$ and $K$ decays. The presence of such quarks, apart
from being detectable in the early stages of the LHC, would also have important
consequences in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector.
