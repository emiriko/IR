The Hardy experiment is analyzed from the standpoint of the Transactional
Interpretation (TI) in its possibilist variant, PTI. It is argued that PTI

resolving the apparent paradox which arises from the mistaken notion that
components of the state vector labeled by spacetime regions imply the actual
presence of a corpuscle in that region.
