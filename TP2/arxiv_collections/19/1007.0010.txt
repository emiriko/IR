We report the results of extensive dynamical cluster approximation
calculations, based on a quantum Monte Carlo solver, for the two-dimensional
Kondo lattice model. Our particular cluster implementation renders possible the
simulation of spontaneous antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. By explicitly
computing the single-particle spectral function both in the paramagnetic and
antiferromagnetic phases, we follow the evolution of the Fermi surface across
this magnetic transition. The results, computed for clusters up to 16 orbitals,
show clear evidence for the existence of three distinct Fermi surface
topologies. The transition from the paramagnetic metallic phase to the
antiferromagnetic metal is continuous; Kondo screening does not break down and
we observe a back-folding of the paramagnetic heavy fermion band. Within the
antiferromagnetic phase and when the ordered moment becomes large the Fermi
surface evolves to one which is adiabatically connected to a Fermi surface
where the local moments are frozen in an antiferromagnetic order.
