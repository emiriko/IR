Properties of Term Rewriting Systems are called modular iff they are
preserved under (and reflected by) disjoint union, i.e. when combining two Term
Rewriting Systems with disjoint signatures. Convergence is the property of
Infinitary Term Rewriting Systems that all reduction sequences converge to a
limit. Strong Convergence requires in addition that redex positions in a
reduction sequence move arbitrarily deep. In this paper it is shown that both
Convergence and Strong Convergence are modular properties of non-collapsing
Infinitary Term Rewriting Systems, provided (for convergence) that the term
metrics are granular. This generalises known modularity results beyond metric
\infty.
