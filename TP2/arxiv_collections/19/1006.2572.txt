Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a number field, fibered over a
curve, with geometrically integral fibers. We prove that, supposing the
finiteness of $\sha(Jac(C))$, if the fibers over a generalised Hilbertian
subset satisfy the Hasse principle (resp. weak approximation), then the
Brauer-Manin obstruction coming from the base curve is the only obstruction to
the Hasse principle (resp. to weak approximation) for zero-cycles of degree 1
on $X$.
