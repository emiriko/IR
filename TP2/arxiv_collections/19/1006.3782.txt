Distributed medium access control (MAC) protocols are essential for the
proliferation of low cost, decentralized wireless local area networks (WLANs).
Most MAC protocols are designed with the presumption that nodes comply with
prescribed rules. However, selfish nodes have natural motives to manipulate
protocols in order to improve their own performance. This often degrades the
performance of other nodes as well as that of the overall system. In this work,
we propose a class of protocols that limit the performance gain which nodes can
obtain through selfish manipulation while incurring only a small efficiency
loss. The proposed protocols are based on the idea of a review strategy, with
which nodes collect signals about the actions of other nodes over a period of
time, use a statistical test to infer whether or not other nodes are following
the prescribed protocol, and trigger a punishment if a departure from the
protocol is perceived. We consider the cases of private and public signals and
provide analytical and numerical results to demonstrate the properties of the
proposed protocols.
