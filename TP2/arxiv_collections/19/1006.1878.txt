We investigate the modulational instability of a mathematical model [based on
the model proposed by T. Brabec and F. Krausz, Phys.Rev. Lett. 78, 3282(1997)]
appropriate for few cycle optical pulses with pulse duration as short as one
carrier oscillation cycle in the context of a standard silica fiber operating
at the telecommunication wavelength 1550 nm.
