The human immune system has numerous properties that make it ripe for
exploitation in the computational domain, such as robustness and fault
tolerance, and many different algorithms, collectively termed Artificial Immune
Systems (AIS), have been inspired by it. Two generations of AIS are currently
in use, with the first generation relying on simplified immune models and the
second generation utilising interdisciplinary collaboration to develop a deeper
understanding of the immune system and hence produce more complex models. Both
generations of algorithms have been successfully applied to a variety of
problems, including anomaly detection, pattern recognition, optimisation and
robotics. In this chapter an overview of AIS is presented, its evolution is
discussed, and it is shown that the diversification of the field is linked to
the diversity of the immune system itself, leading to a number of algorithms as
opposed to one archetypal system. Two case studies are also presented to help
provide insight into the mechanisms of AIS; these are the idiotypic network
approach and the Dendritic Cell Algorithm.
