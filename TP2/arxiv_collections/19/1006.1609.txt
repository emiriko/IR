The operation of the primary Coulomb blockade thermometer (CBT) is based on a
measurement of bias voltage dependent conductance of arrays of tunnel junctions
between normal metal electrodes. Here we report on a comparison of a CBT with a
high accuracy realization of the PLTS-2000 temperature scale in the range from
0.008 K to 0.65 K. An overall agreement of about 1% was found for temperatures
above 0.25 K. For lower temperatures increasing differences are caused by
thermalization problems which are accounted for by numerical calculations based
on electron-phonon decoupling.
