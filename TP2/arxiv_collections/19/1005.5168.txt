We propose a simple experiment to determine whether vortices persist above
the superconducting transition temperature Tc in the pseudogap phase of high
temperature cuprate superconductors. This involves using a magnetic dot to
stabilize a vortex in a thin cuprate film beneath the dot. We calculate the
magnetic field profile as a function of distance from the dot if a vortex is
present, and discuss possible measurements that could be done to detect this.
Finally, we comment on the temperature range where a stable vortex should be
observable.
