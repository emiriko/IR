A multi-frequency electron spin resonance (ESR) study provides evidence for
the occurrence of low temperature ferromagnetic/spin-glass behavior in aligned
arrays of sub-nanometer single walled carbon nanotubes confined in zeolite
nano-channels, owing to sp2-type non-bonding carbon associated localized states
with density of ~3 x 1019 /g. Features related to the much anticipated
conduction ESR are not detected. In the paramagnetic phase, the ESR linewidth
is found to be weakly dependent on microwave frequency.
