Understanding under what conditions interacting populations, whether they be
plants, animals, or viral particles, coexist is a question of theoretical and
practical importance in population biology. Both biotic interactions and
environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt
coexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic
and stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear
theory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and
differential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a
fixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this
weighted combination of populations' invasion rates is positive for any
(ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of
populations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth
rate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is
sufficient noise in the system, we show that the populations approach a unique
positive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence
criterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this
theory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits
coexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on
correlations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation
in mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time
Lotka-Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic
diversity in the presence of exploitative interactions.
