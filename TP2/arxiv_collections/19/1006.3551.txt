We consider analysis targets at the International Linear Collider in which
only a single photon can be observed. For such processes, we have developed a
method which uses likelihood distributions using the full event information
(photon energy and angle). The method was applied to a search for neutralino
pair production with a photon from initial state radiation (ISR) in the case of
supergravity in which the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle.
We determine the cross section required to observe the neutralino pair
production with ISR as a function of the neutralino mass in the range of 100 to
250 GeV.
