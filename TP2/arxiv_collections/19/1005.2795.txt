The Tevatron experiments have each accumulated about 6 \ifb good data since
the start of RUN II. This large dataset provided good opportunities for heavy
flavor spectroscopy studies at the Tevatron. This article will cover the recent
omega_b obervation, new $\Upsilon(nS)$ polarization studies as well as exotic
meson spectroscopy studies.
