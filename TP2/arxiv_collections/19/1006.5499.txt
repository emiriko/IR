Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is a state-of-the-art technique in designing
sophisticated apparatus for various applications in science and technology. We
adopted MCS based on GEANT (GEometry ANd Tracking) in order to design a simple
timeof-flight positron emission tomography (TOFPET). In MCS studies, a new
method of position reconstruction of positron-electron annihilation points has
been developed so far. Simulation results show that this technique may not be
useful for small animal imaging camera but might be practicable in diagnostic
TOFPET camera. Specific issue of this simulation technique is discussed.
