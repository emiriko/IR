An analog of the Meir-Wingreen formula for the steady-state heat current
through a model molecular junction is derived. The expression relates the heat
current to correlation functions that involve operators only acting on the
degrees of freedom of the molecular junction. As a result, the macroscopic heat
reservoirs are not treated explicitly. This allows one to exploit methods based
on a reduced description of the dynamics of a relatively small part of the
overall system to evaluate the heat current through a molecular junction. The
derived expression is applied to calculate the steady-state heat current in a
weak coupling limit, where Redfield theory is used to describe the reduced
dynamics of the molecular junction. The results are compared with those from
the previously developed approximate and numerically exact methods.
