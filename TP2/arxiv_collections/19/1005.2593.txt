We present a method that implement directional, perfect state transfers
within a branched spin network by exploiting quantum interferences in the
time-domain. That provides a tool to isolate subsystems from a large and
complex one. Directionality is achieved by interrupting the spin-spin coupled
evolution with periods of free Zeeman evolutions, whose timing is tuned to be
commensurate with the relative phases accrued by specific spin pairs. This
leads to a resonant transfer between the chosen qubits, and to a detuning of
all remaining pathways in the network, using only global manipulations. As the
transfer is perfect when the selected pathway is mediated by 2 or 3 spins,
distant state transfers over complex networks can be achieved by successive
recouplings among specific pairs/triads of spins. These effects are illustrated
with a quantum simulator involving 13C NMR on Leucine's backbone; a six-spin
network.
