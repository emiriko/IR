The search for events containing isolated leptons and missing transverse
momentum produced in ep collisions is performed individually and in a common
phase space with the H1 and ZEUS detectors at HERA. The combined H1 and ZEUS
data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 0.98 fb^-1 and comprises
the complete high energy data from the HERA programme. A total of 81 events are
observed in the data, compared to a Standard Model prediction of 87.8 \pm 11.0,
which is dominated by single W production. At large hadronic transverse
momentum P_T^X > 25 GeV in the e+p data, integrated luminosity 0.58 fb^-1, 23
data events are observed compared to a SM prediction of 14.0 \pm 1.9. The total
single W production cross section is measured as 1.06 \pm 0.16 (stat.) \pm 0.07
(sys.) in agreement with a SM expectation of 1.26 \pm 0.19. The isolated lepton
events are examined in the context of a search for anomalous single top
production, where the hadronic decays of the W are additionally considered.
Although several top-like candidates are present in the H1 data no clear signal
is observed and an upper limit on the anomalous single top production cross
section of < 0.25 pb is established at the 95% confidence level. This limit
corresponds to an upper bound on the anomalous magnetic coupling of < 0.18
assuming a top mass of 175 GeV.
