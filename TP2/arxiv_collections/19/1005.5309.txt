The discovery of the pseudogap in the cuprates created significant excitement
amongst physicists as it was believed to be a signature of pairing, in some
cases well above the room temperature. In this "pre-formed pairs" scenario, the
formation of pairs without quantum phase rigidity occurs below T*. These pairs
condense and develop phase coherence only below Tc. In contrast, several recent
experiments reported that the pseudogap and superconducting states are
characterized by two different energy scales, pointing to a scenario, where the
two compete. However a number of transport, magnetic, thermodynamic and
tunneling spectroscopy experiments consistently detect a signature of
phase-fluctuating superconductivity above leaving open the question of whether
the pseudogap is caused by pair formation or not. Here we report the discovery
of a spectroscopic signature of pair formation and demonstrate that in a region
of the phase diagram commonly referred to as the "pseudogap", two distinct
states coexist: one that persists to an intermediate temperature Tpair and a
second that extends up to T*. The first state is characterized by a doping
independent scaling behavior and is due to pairing above Tc, but significantly
below T*. The second state is the "proper" pseudogap - characterized by a
"checker board" pattern in STM images, the absence of pair formation, and is
likely linked to Mott physics of pristine CuO2 planes. Tpair has a universal
value around 130-150K even for materials with very different Tc, likely setting
limit on highest, attainable Tc in cuprates. The observed universal scaling
behavior with respect to Tpair indicates a breakdown of the classical picture
of phase fluctuations in the cuprates.
