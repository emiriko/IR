The result of the 3-year neutrino magnetic moment measurement at the Kalinin
Nuclear Power Plant with the GEMMA spectrometer is presented.
Antineutrino-electron scattering is investigated. A HPGe detector of 1.5 kg
placed at a distance of 13.9 m from the centre of the 3 GW_th reactor core is
used in the spectrometer. The antineutrino flux is 2.7x10^13 1/cm^2/s. The
differential method is used to extract nu-e electromagnetic scattering events.
The scattered electron spectra taken in 5184+6798 and 1853+1021 hours during
the reactor ON and OFF periods respectively are compared. The upper limits for
the neutrino magnetic moment with and without atomic ionization mechanism were
found to be 5.0x10^-12 and 3.2x10^-11 Bohr magnetons at 90% CL, respectively.
