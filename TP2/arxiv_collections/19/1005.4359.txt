Many-electron systems confined to a quasi-1D geometry by a cylindrical
distribution of positive charge have been investigated by density functional
computations in the unrestricted local spin density approximation. Our
investigations have been focused on the low density regime, in which electrons
are localised. The results reveal a wide variety of different charge and spin
configurations, including linear and zig-zag chains, single and double-strand
helices, and twisted chains of dimers. The spin-spin coupling turns from weakly
anti-ferromagnetic at relatively high density, to weakly ferromagnetic at the
lowest densities considered in our computations. The stability of linear chains
of localised charge has been investigated by analysing the radial dependence of
the self-consistent potential and by computing the dispersion relation of
low-energy harmonic excitations.
