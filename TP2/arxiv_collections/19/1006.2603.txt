We investigate a projective integration scheme for a kinetic equation in the
limit of vanishing mean free path, in which the kinetic description approaches
a diffusion phenomenon. The scheme first takes a few small steps with a simple,
explicit method, such as a spatial centered flux/forward Euler time
integration, and subsequently projects the results forward in time over a large
time step on the diffusion time scale. We show that, with an appropriate choice
of the inner step size, the time-step restriction on the outer time step is
similar to the stability condition for the diffusion equation, whereas the
required number of inner steps does not depend on the mean free path. We also
provide a consistency result. The presented method is asymptotic-preserving, in
the sense that the method converges to a standard finite volume scheme for the
diffusion equation in the limit of vanishing mean free path. The analysis is
illustrated with numerical results, and we present an application to the
Su-Olson test.
