Exclusive processes in hard electroproduction are one of the best place for
understanding QCD in view of its factorization properties. In particular, in
the limit of asymptotic gamma* p center of mass energy, they give an access to
the perturbative Regge properties of QCD. The HERA experiment recently provided
precise data for rho electroproduction, including all spin density matrix
elements. From QCD, it is expected that such a process should factorize between
a hard (calculable) coefficient function, and hadronic (p and rho) matrix
elements. Such a factorization is up to now only proven for a longitudinaly
polarized rho. Within the kt-factorization approach (valid at large gamma* p
invariant mass), we evaluate the impact factor of the transition gamma* -> rhoT
taking into account the twist 3 contributions. We show that a gauge invariant
expression is obtained with the help of QCD equations of motion.
  More generally, relying on these equations and on the invariance under
rotation on the light-cone of the factorized amplitude, the non-perturbative
Distribution Amplitudes can be reduced to a minimal set. This opens the way to
a consistent treatment of factorization for exclusive processes with a
transversally polarized vector meson, and clarifies the equivalence of two
proposed parametrizations of the rhoT distribution amplitudes, illustrated here
by the gamma* -> rhoT impact factor.
