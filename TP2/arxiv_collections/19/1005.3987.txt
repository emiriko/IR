White dwarfs inspiraling into black holes of mass $\MBH\simgt 10^5M_\odot$
are detectable sources of gravitational waves in the LISA band. In many of
these events, the white dwarf begins to lose mass during the main observational
phase of the inspiral. The mass loss starts gently and can last for thousands
of orbits. The white dwarf matter overflows the Roche lobe through the $L_1$
point at each pericenter passage and the mass loss repeats periodically. The
process occurs very close to the black hole and the released gas can accrete,
creating a bright source of radiation with luminosity close to the Eddington
limit, $L\sim 10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. This class of inspirals offers a promising
scenario for dual detections of gravitational waves and electromagnetic
radiation.
