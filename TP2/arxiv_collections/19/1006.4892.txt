Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a specification technique that
automatically certifies that all functional requirements are treated properly
by source code, through the connection of the textual description of these
requirements to automated tests. Given that in some areas, in special
Enterprise Information Systems, requirements are identified by Business Process
Modeling - which uses graphical notations of the underlying business processes,
this paper aims to provide a mapping from the basic constructs that form the
most common BPM languages to Behavior Driven Development constructs.
