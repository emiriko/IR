In this article, we take the X(1835) as a pseudoscalar baryonium state, and
calculate the mass spectrum of the baryon-antibaryon bound states $p\bar{p}$,
$\Sigma\bar{\Sigma}$, $\Xi\bar{\Xi}$, and $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ in the
framework of the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a phenomenological potential. The
numerical results indicate the $p\bar{p}$, $\Sigma\bar{\Sigma}$ and
$\Xi\bar{\Xi}$ bound states maybe exist, and the $X(1835)$ can be tentatively
identified as the $p\bar{p}$ bound state.
