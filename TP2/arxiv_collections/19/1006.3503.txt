The SiD detector concept is one of two currently accepted approaches to
providing a detector for the future International Linear Collider. The SiD
design philosophy is described and an overview of the concept given. Each major
component of SiD is described, with emphasis on the critical R&D issues in each
area. The context of the paper is evolution of the SiD design and the
associated R&D towards the Detailed Baseline Design in late 2012.
