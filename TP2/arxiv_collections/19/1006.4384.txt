The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider has collected several hundred
million cosmic ray events during 2008 and 2009. These data were used to
commission the Muon Spectrometer and to study the performance of the trigger
and tracking chambers, their alignment, the detector control system, the data
acquisition and the analysis programs. We present the performance in the
relevant parameters that determine the quality of the muon measurement. We
discuss the single element efficiency, resolution and noise rates, the
calibration method of the detector response and of the alignment system, the
track reconstruction efficiency and the momentum measurement. The results show
that the detector is close to the design performance and that the Muon
Spectrometer is ready to detect muons produced in high energy proton-proton
collisions.
