We present an analysis of the loop-induced couplings of the Higgs boson to
the massless gauge fields (gluons and photons) in the warped extra dimension
models where all Standard Model fields propagate in the bulk. We show that in
such models corrections to the hgg and $h{\gamma}{\gamma}$ couplings are
potentially very large. These corrections can lead to generically sizable
deviations in the production and decay rates of the Higgs boson, even when the
new physics states lie beyond the direct reach of the LHC.
