For the additive Gaussian noise channel with average codeword power
constraint, sparse superposition codes and adaptive successive decoding is
developed. Codewords are linear combinations of subsets of vectors, with the
message indexed by the choice of subset. A feasible decoding algorithm is
presented. Communication is reliable with error probability exponentially small
for all rates below the Shannon capacity.
