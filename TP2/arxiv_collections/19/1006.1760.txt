We investigate the thermodynamic phase transition taking place in the
Blume-Capel model in presence of quenched disorder in three dimensions (3D). In
particular, performing Exchange Montecarlo simulations, we study the behavior
of the order parameters accross the first order phase transition and its
related coexistence region. This transition is an Inverse Freezing.
