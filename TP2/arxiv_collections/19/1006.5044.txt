Kinetic exchange models have been successful in explaining the shape of the
income/wealth distribution in the economies. However, such models usually make
some ad-hoc assumptions when it comes to determining the savings factor. Here,
we examine a few models in and out of the domain of standard neo-classical
economics to explain the savings behavior of the agents. A number of new
results are derived and the rest conform with those obtained earlier.
Connections are established between the reinforcement choice and strategic
choice models with the usual kinetic exchange models.
