The absorption of thin hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers can be
efficiently enhanced through a controlled periodic patterning. Light is trapped
through coupling with photonic Bloch modes of the periodic structures, which
act as an absorbing planar photonic crystal. We theoretically demonstrate this
absorption enhancement through one or two dimensional patterning, and show the
experimental feasibility through large area holographic patterning. Numerical
simulations show over 50% absorption enhancement over the part of the solar
spectrum comprised between 380 and 750nm. It is experimentally confirmed by
optical measurements performed on planar photonic crystals fabricated by laser
holography and reactive ion etching.
