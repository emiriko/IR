In this talk we discuss a purely numerical approach to next-to-leading order
calculations in QCD. We present a simple formula, which provides a local
infrared subtraction term for the integrand of a one-loop amplitude. In
addition we briefly comment on local ultraviolet subtraction terms and on the
required deformation of the contour of integration.
