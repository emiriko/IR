Confinement processes arranging small polarons into insulating periodic
structures above certain conversion tempereture are considered. Vibronic
(Jahn-Teller) polarons associating inherent electric & magnetic dipoles coupled
to external fields lead to colossal field effects. Confinement modes based on
Poisson-Boltzmann equations of electrostatic strings and plates are deduced.
