We adapt the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, originally
devised to simulate the dynamics of 1D quantum systems, to simulate the
time-evolution of non-equilibrium stochastic systems. We describe this method
in detail; a system's probability distribution is represented by a matrix
product state (MPS) of finite dimension and then its time-evolution is
efficiently simulated by repeatedly updating and approximately re-factorizing
this representation. We examine the use of MPS as an approximation method,
looking at parallels between the interpretations of applying it to quantum
state vectors and probability distributions. In the context of stochastic
systems we consider two types of factorization for use in the TEBD algorithm:
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which ensures that the approximate
probability distribution is manifestly non-negative, and the singular value
decomposition (SVD). Comparing these factorizations we find the accuracy of the
SVD to be substantially greater than current NMF algorithms. We then apply TEBD
to simulate the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) for systems
of up to hundreds of lattice sites in size. Using exact analytic results for
the TASEP steady state, we find that TEBD reproduces this state such that the
error in calculating expectation values can be made negligible, even when
severely compressing the description of the system by restricting the dimension
of the MPS to be very small. Out of the steady state we show for specific
observables that expectation values converge as the dimension of the MPS is
increased to a moderate size.
