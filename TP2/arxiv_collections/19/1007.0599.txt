We present the results of a combined analysis of the kinematic and
photometric properties at large galactocentric radii of a sample of 14
low-luminosity early-type galaxies in the Fornax and Virgo clusters. From
Gemini South GMOS long-slit spectroscopic data we measure radial profiles of
the kinematic parameters v_{rot}, sigma, h_{3}, and h_{4} out to ~ 1 - 3
effective radii. Multi-band imaging data from the HST/ACS are employed to
evaluate surface brightness profiles and isophotal shape parameters of
ellipticity, position angle and discyness/boxiness. The galaxies are found to
host a cold and old stellar component which extend to the largest observed
radii and that is the dominant source of their dynamical support. The
prevalence of discy-shaped isophotes and the radial variation of their
ellipticity are signatures of a gradual gas dissipation. An early star-forming
collapse appears to be the main mechanism acting in the formation of these
objects. Major mergers are unlikely to have occurred in these galaxies. We can
not rule out a minor merging origin for these galaxies, but a comparison of our
results with model predictions of different merger categories places some
constraints on the possible merger progenitors. These merger events are
required to happen at high-redshift (i.e., z > 1), between progenitors of
different mass ratio (at least 3:1) and containing a significant amount of gas
(i.e., > 10 percent). A further scenario is that the low-luminosity galaxies
were originally late-type galaxies, whose star formation has been truncated by
removal of gas and subsequently the disc has been dynamically heated by high
speed encounters in the cluster environment.
