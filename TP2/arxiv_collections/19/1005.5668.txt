Magnetization of the frustrated $S=1/2$ chain compound LiCuVO$_4$, focusing
on high magnetic field phases, is reported. Besides a spin-flop transition and
the transition from a planar spiral to a spin modulated structure observed
recently, an additional transition was observed just below the saturation
field. This newly observed magnetic phase is considered as a spin nematic
phase, which was predicted theoretically but was not observed experimentally.
The critical fields of this phase and its dM/dH curve are in good agreement
with calculations performed in a microscopic model (M. E. Zhitomirsky and H.
Tsunetsugu, preprint, arXiv:1003.4096v2).
