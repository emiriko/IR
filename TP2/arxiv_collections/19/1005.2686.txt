An exact expression is derived for the $(\omega,p)=0$ thermal correlator of
shear stress in SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theory. I remove a logarithmic
divergence by taking a suitable linear combination of the shear correlator and
the correlator of the energy density. The operator product expansion shows that
the same linear combination has a finite limit when $\omega\to\infty$. It
follows that the vacuum-subtracted shear spectral function vanishes at large
frequencies at least as fast as $\alpha_s^2(\omega)$ and obeys a sum rule. The
trace anomaly makes a potential contribution to the spectral sum rule which
remains to be fully calculated, but which I estimate to be numerically small
for $T\gtrsim 3T_c$. By contrast with the bulk channel, the shear channel
spectral density is then overall enhanced as compared to the spectral density
in vacuo.
