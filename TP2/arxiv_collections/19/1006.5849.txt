We address the bosonic string pair creation in a system of parallel Dp-Dp'
(p<p') branes by applying the path integral formalism. We drive the string pair
creation rate by calculating the one loop vacuum amplitude of the setup in
presence of the background electric field defined over the Dp'-brane. It is
pointed out that just the components of the electric field defined over the $p$
spatial directions (the common directions along which the both D-branes are
extended) give rise to the pair creation
