We present a study of 649 \pm 35 e+e- --> ccbar events produced at
sqrt{s}~10.6 GeV containing both a Lambda_c baryon and a Lambda_c antibaryon.
The number observed is roughly four times that expected if the leading charmed
hadron types are uncorrelated, confirming an observation by the CLEO
Collaboration. We find a 2-jet topology in these events but very few additional
baryons, demonstrating that the primary c and cbar are predominantly contained
in a correlated baryon-antibaryon system. In addition to the charmed baryons we
observe on average 2.6 \pm 0.2 charged intermediate mesons, predominantly
pions, carrying 65% of the remaining energy.
