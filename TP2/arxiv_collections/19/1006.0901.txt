We present a microwave realization of finite tight-binding graphene-like
structures. The structures are realized using discs with a high index of
refraction. The discs are placed on a metallic surface while a second surface
is adjusted atop the discs, such that the waves coupling the discs in the air
are evanescent, leading to the tight-binding behavior. In reflection
measurements the Dirac point and a linear increase close to the Dirac point is
observed, if the measurement is performed inside the sample. Resonances due to
edge states are found close to the Dirac point if the measurements are
performed at the zigzag-edge or at the corner in case of a broken benzene ring.
