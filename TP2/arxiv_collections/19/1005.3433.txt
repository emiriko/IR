The communication process in a situation of emergency is discussed within the
Scheff theory of shame and pride. The communication involves messages from
media and from other persons. Three strategies are considered: selfish (to
contact friends), collective (to join other people) and passive (to do
nothing). We show that the pure selfish strategy cannot be evolutionarily
stable. The main result is that the community structure is statistically
meaningful only if the interpersonal communication is weak.
