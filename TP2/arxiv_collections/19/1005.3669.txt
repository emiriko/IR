Effects of Al, Mn and Sb dopings in CeFe2 and effect of applied pressure have
been investigated. Al doping gives rise to the FM-AFM transition and a
reduction in the magnetic moment and TC values, clearly indicating the growth
of the AFM component. Mn and Sb dopings only cause a reduction in TC value. It
is found that in general external pressure enhances the antiferromagnetism in
both the pure and the doped alloys. Enhancement of the Ce 4f- Fe 3d
hybridization as a result of dopings and with the external pressure may be the
reason for the stabilization of antiferromagnetism in these alloys.
