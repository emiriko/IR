We present an adaptive multigrid solver for application to the non-Hermitian
Wilson-Dirac system of QCD. The key components leading to the success of our
proposed algorithm are the use of an adaptive projection onto coarse grids that
preserves the near null space of the system matrix together with a simplified
form of the correction based on the so-called gamma_5-Hermitian symmetry of the
Dirac operator. We demonstrate that the algorithm nearly eliminates critical
slowing down in the chiral limit and that it has weak dependence on the lattice
volume.
