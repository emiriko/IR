There are ongoing efforts in detecting Hawking radiation from primordial
black holes (PBH) formed during the early universe. Here we put an upper limit
on the PBH number density that could have been formed prior to the big bang
nucleosynthesis era, based on the constraint that the PBH evaporation energy
consisting of high energy radiation not affect the observed abundances' of
elements, by disintegrating the nuclei.
