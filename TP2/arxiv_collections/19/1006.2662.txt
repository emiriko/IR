{This work aims to investigate the spectral structure of the parallel
electric field generated by strong anisotropic and balanced Alfvenic turbulence
in relation with the problem of electron acceleration from the thermal
population in solar flare plasma conditions.} {We consider anisotropic Alfvenic
fluctuations in the presence of a strong background magnetic field. Exploiting
this anisotropy, a set of reduced equations governing non-linear, two-fluid
plasma dynamics is derived. The low-$\beta$ limit of this model is used to
follow the turbulent cascade of the energy resulting from the non-linear
interaction between kinetic Alfven waves, from the large magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) scales with $k_{\perp}\rho_{s}\ll 1$ down to the small "kinetic" scales
with $k_{\perp}\rho_{s} \gg 1$, $\rho_{s}$ being the ion sound gyroradius.}
{Scaling relations are obtained for the magnitude of the turbulent
electromagnetic fluctuations, as a function of $k_{\perp}$ and $k_{\parallel}$,
showing that the electric field develops a component parallel to the magnetic
field at large MHD scales.} {The spectrum we derive for the parallel electric
field fluctuations can be effectively used to model stochastic resonant
acceleration and heating of electrons by Alfven waves in solar flare plasma
conditions}
