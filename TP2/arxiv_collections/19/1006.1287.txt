The ubiquitous appearance of regions of localized deformation (shear bands)
in different kinds of disordered materials under shear is studied in the
context of a mesoscopic model of plasticity. The model may or may not include
relaxational (aging) effects. In the absence of relaxational effects the model
displays a monotonously increasing dependence of stress on strain-rate, and
stationary shear bands do not occur. However, in start up experiments transient
(although long lived) shear bands occur, that widen without bound in time. I
investigate this transient effect in detail, reproducing and explaining a t^1/2
law for the thickness increase of the shear band that has been obtained in
atomistic numerical simulations. Relaxation produces a negative sloped region
in the stress vs. strain-rate curve that stabilizes the formation of shear
bands of a well defined width, which is a function of strain-rate. Simulations
at very low strain-rates reveal a non-trivial stick-slip dynamics of very thin
shear bands that has relevance in the study of seismic phenomena. In addition,
other non-stationary processes, such as stop-and-go, or strain-rate inversion
situations display a phenomenology that matches very well the results of recent
experimental studies.
