The wavelike processes of crystallization and melting or crystallization
waves are well known to exist at the 4He crystal surface in the rough state.
Much less is known about crystallization waves for the 4He crystal surface in
the smooth well-faceted state below the roughening transition temperature. To
meet the lack, we analyze here the spectrum of facet crystallization waves and
its dependence upon the wavelength, perturbation amplitude, and the number of
possible facet steps distributed somehow over the wavelength. All the
distinctive features of facet crystallization waves from conventional waves at
the rough surface result from a nonanalytic cusplike behavior in the angle
dependence for the surface tension of smooth crystal facets.
