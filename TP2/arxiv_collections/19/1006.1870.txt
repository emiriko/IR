We consider nucleation of amyloid fibrils in the case when the process occurs
by the mechanism of direct polymerization of practically fully extended protein
segments, i.e. beta-strands, into beta-sheets. Applying the classical
nucleation theory, we derive a general expression for the work to form a
nanosized amyloid fibril (protofilament) constituted of successively layered
beta-sheets. Analysis of this expression reveals that with increasing its size,
the fibril transforms from one-dimensional into two-dimensional aggregate in
order to preserve the equilibrium shape corresponding to minimal formation
work. We determine the size of the fibril nucleus, the fibril nucleation work
and the fibril nucleation rate as explicit functions of the concentration and
temperature of the protein solution. The results obtained are applicable to
homogeneous nucleation which occurs when the solution is sufficiently pure
and/or strongly supersaturated.
