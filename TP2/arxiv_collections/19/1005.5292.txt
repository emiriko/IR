We present a reduced-order heart model with the aim of introducing a novel
point of view in the interpretation of the pressure-volume loops. The novelty
of the approach is based on the definition of active contraction as opposed to
that of active stress. The consequences of the assumption are discussed with
reference to a specific pressure-volume loop characteristic of a normal human
patient.
