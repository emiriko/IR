This paper aims at determining the characteristics of a face image by
extracting its components. The FASY (FAce SYnthesis) System is a Face Database
Retrieval and new Face generation System that is under development. One of its
main features is the generation of the requested face when it is not found in
the existing database, which allows a continuous growing of the database also.
To generate the new face image, we need to store the face components in the
database. So we have designed a new technique to extract the face components by
a sophisticated method. After extraction of the facial feature points we have
analyzed the components to determine their characteristics. After extraction
and analysis we have stored the components along with their characteristics
into the face database for later use during the face construction.
