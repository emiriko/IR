We present a class of low energy type IIB supergravity solutions of two
D3-branes rotated by an angle $\alpha \in SU(2)$ in a linear dilaton pp-wave
background. The D-branes bound state configurations is found to preserve 1/16
of the total type IIB supersymmetries. We also present a class of D1-D5
solution by applying T-duality on $D3\perp D3$ configuration.
