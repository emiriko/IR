We show that in the trapped ion-laser interaction all the regimes may be
considered analytically. We may solve not only for different laser intensities,
but also away from resonance and from the Lamb-Dicke regime. It is found a
dispersive Hamiltonian for the high intensity regime, that, being diagonal, its
evolution operator may be easily calculated.
