Use of ARIMA model in Sensor network The basic idea of our energy efficient
information collection scheme is to suppress data transmission if the data
sampled by sensor nodes are predictable by the sink node. This is done in two
phases 1) Preliminary Data Collection- During this phase sink node collects
enough data so that it can build up ARIMA model for each node. Then sink node
selects a model for the particular node and sends back the corresponding model
parameters to the node and also keeps them with it. Selecting the model for a
node there is a tradeoff between energy consumption and accuracy of prediction.
So we choose the model according to C = {\alpha} xMAE + (1 - {\alpha}) x rtran
0=< {\alpha} =<1 where the model should minimize C. Here MAE is Mean Absolute
Error which is normalized by some predefined error tolerance and rtran is the
ratio of number of samples transmitted over total number of samples. 2)
Adaptive Data Collection- After the sensor node has received the model
parameters it checks each actual data value with the data value calculated from
the parameters received. If there is deviation beyond some predefined error
tolerance then only it sends the original data value to the sink node.
