AGNs with hard $\gamma$-ray emission identified so far are radio-loud. III Zw
2 is a radio intermediate AGN with a relativistic jet. We study its spectral
energy distribution (SED) and find that the broad band emissions are dominated
by the non-thermal emissions from the jet. We model its SED through a
synchrotron + inverse Compton (IC) model. The results show that the IC
component of III Zw 2 peaks at a few MeV, and the flux density drops rapidly at
higher energy with photon index $\Gamma\approx3.3$ above 0.1 GeV. The predicted
flux is slightly over the sensitivity of $Fermi$/LAT, but it is not included in
the first $Fermi$/LAT AGN catalog. The reason for this may be: 1) that the IC
peak is low and the spectrum is very steep above 0.1 GeV, 2) that III Zw 2 is
in the low state during the period of the $Fermi$/LAT operation. We also find
that III Zw 2 follows similar jet processes as those in $\gamma$-ray AGNs,
e.g., the relation between jet power and radiation power, called the blazar
sequence. We suggest that III Zw 2 may be a young source at an earlier stage of
jet activity.
