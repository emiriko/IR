The Langevin equation for a two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear guided vortex
motion in a tilted cosine pinning potential in the presence of an ac is exactly
solved in terms of a matrix continued fraction at arbitrary value of the Hall
effect. The influence of an ac of arbitrary amplitude and frequency on the dc
and ac magnetoresistivity tensors is analyzed. The ac density and frequency
dependence of the overall shape and the number and position of the Shapiro-like
steps on the anisotropic current-voltage characteristics are considered. The
influence of a subcritical or overcritical dc on the time-dependent stationary
ac longitudinal and transverse resistive vortex responses (on the frequency of
an ac drive W) in terms of the nonlinear impedance tensor Z and the nonlinear
ac response at W-harmonics are studied. Analytical formulas for 2D
temperature-dependent linear impedance tensor Zl in the presence of a dc which
depend on the angle a between the current-density vector and the guiding
direction of the washboard planar pinning potential are derived and analyzed.
Influence of a-anisotropy and the Hall effect on the nonlinear power absorption
by vortices is discussed.
