In this paper, we introduce the following problem in the theory of
algorithmic self-assembly: given an input shape as the seed of a tile-based
self-assembly system, design a finite tile set that can, in some sense,
uniquely identify whether or not the given input shape--drawn from a very
general class of shapes--matches a particular target shape. We first study the
complexity of correctly identifying squares. Then we investigate the complexity
associated with the identification of a considerably more general class of
non-square, hole-free shapes.
