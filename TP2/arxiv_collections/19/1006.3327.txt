We consider the time evolution of massless gravitino perturbations in
Schwarzschild black holes, and show that as in the case of fields of other
values of spin, the evolution comes in three stages, after an initial outburst
as a first stage, we observe the damped oscillations characteristic of the
quasinormal ringing stage, followed by long time tails. Using the sixth order
WKB method and Prony fitting of time domain data we determine the quasinormal
frequencies. There is a good correspondence between the results obtained by the
above two methods, and we obtain a considerable improvement with respect to the
previously obtained third order WKB results. We also show that the response of
a black hole depends crucially on the spin class of the perturbing field: the
quality factor becomes a decreasing function of the spin for boson
perturbations, whereas the opposite situation appears for fermion ones.
