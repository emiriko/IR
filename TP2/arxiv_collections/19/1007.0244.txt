A theory of optical emission of quantum dot arrays in quantum microcavities
is developed. The regime of the strong coupling between the quantum dots and
photonic mode of the cavity is considered. The quantum dots are modeled as
two-level systems. In the low pumping (linear) regime the emission spectra are
mainly determined by the superradiant mode where the effective dipoles of the
dots oscillate in phase. In the non-linear regime the superradiant mode is
destroyed and the emission spectra are sensitive to the parity of quantum dot
number. Further increase of the pumping results in the line width narrowing
being an evidence of the lasing regime.
