Dependence of hopping conductance on temperature and voltage for an ensemble
of modestly long one-dimensional wires is studied numerically using the
shortest-path algorithm. In a wide range of parameters this dependence can be
approximated by a power-law rather than the usual stretched-exponential form.
Relation to recent experiments and prior analytical theory is discussed.
