Transport properties are among the defining characteristics of many important
phases in condensed matter physics. In the presence of strong correlations they
are difficult to predict even for model systems like the Hubbard model. In real
materials they are in general obscured by additional complications including
impurities, lattice defects or multi-band effects. Ultracold atoms in contrast
offer the possibility to study transport and out-of-equilibrium phenomena in a
clean and well-controlled environment and can therefore act as a quantum
simulator for condensed matter systems. Here we studied the expansion of an
initially confined fermionic quantum gas in the lowest band of a homogeneous
optical lattice. While we observe ballistic transport for non-interacting
atoms, even small interactions render the expansion almost bimodal with a
dramatically reduced expansion velocity. The dynamics is independent of the
sign of the interaction, revealing a novel, dynamic symmetry of the Hubbard
model.
