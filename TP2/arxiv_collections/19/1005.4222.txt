Macroscopic plasma polarization, which is created by gravitation and other
mass-acting (inertial) forces in massive astrophysical objects is under
discussion. Non-ideality effect due to strong Coulomb interaction of charged
particles is introduced into consideration as a new source of such
polarization. Simplified situation of totally equilibrium isothermal star
without relativistic effects and influence of magnetic field is considered. The
study is based on variational approach combined with "local density
approximation". It leads to two local forms of thermodynamic equilibrium
conditions: constancy for generalized (electro)chemical potentials and/or
conditions of equilibrium for the forces acting on each charged specie. New
"non-ideality potential" and "non-ideality force" appear naturally in this
consideration. Hypothetical sequences of gravitational, inertial and
non-ideality polarization on thermo- and hydrodynamics of massive astrophysical
objects are under discussion.
