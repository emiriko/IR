Quasicrystals whose building blocks are of mesoscopic rather than atomic
scale have recently been discovered in several soft-matter systems. Contrary to
metallurgic quasicrystals whose source of stability remains a question of great
debate to this day, we argue that the stability of certain soft-matter
quasicrystals can be directly explained by examining a coarse-grained free
energy for a system of soft isotropic particles. We show, both theoretically
and numerically, that the stability can be attributed to the existence of two
natural length scales in the pair potential, combined with effective three-body
interactions arising from entropy. Our newly gained understanding of the
stability of soft quasicrystals allows us to point at their region of stability
in the phase diagram, and thereby may help control the self-assembly of
quasicrystals and a variety of other desired structures in future experimental
realizations.
