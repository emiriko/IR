We present a new method for the generation of rotationally and vibrationally
state-selected, translationally cold molecular ions in ion traps. Our technique
is based on the state-selective threshold photoionization of neutral molecules
followed by sympathetic cooling of the resulting ions with laser-cooled calcium
ions. Using N$_2^+$ ions as a test system, we achieve > 90 % selectivity in the
preparation of the ground rovibrational level and state lifetimes on the order
of 15 minutes limited by collisions with background-gas molecules. The
technique can be employed to produce a wide range of apolar and polar molecular
ions in the ground and excited rovibrational states. Our approach opens up new
perspectives for cold quantum-controlled ion-molecule-collision studies,
frequency-metrology experiments with state-selected molecular ions and
molecular-ion qubits.
