We carry out numerical diagonalization for much larger systems than before by
restricting the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge excitations to a basis that
is exact for a short-range interaction and very accurate for the Coulomb
interaction. This enables us to perform substantial tests of the predicted
universality of the edge physics. Our results provide compelling evidence that
the behavior of the FQH edge is intrinsically nonuniversal, even in the absence
of edge reconstruction, and therefore does not bear a sharp and unique relation
to the bulk FQH state.
