Beauty production in deep inelastic scattering with events in which a muon
and a jet are observed in the final state has been measured with the ZEUS
detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 114 pb^-1. The fraction of
events with beauty quarks in the data was determined using the distribution of
the transverse momentum of the muon relative to the jet. The cross section for
beauty production was measured in the kinematic range of photon virtuality, Q^2
> 2 Gev^2, and inelasticity, 0.05 < y < 0.7, with the requirement of a muon and
a jet. Total and differential cross sections are presented and compared to QCD
predictions. The beauty contribution to the structure function F_2 was
extracted and is compared to theoretical predictions.
