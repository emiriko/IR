Using the top-down approach, we study intersecting Dp-Dq brane configuration
in string theory and find examples, where there can be a quantum phase
transition at zero temperature induced by the violation of the
Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound at IR, which is done essentially by a
combination of charge density and magnetic fields. In particular, there exists
a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type of transition for D3-D5 and D5-D5
systems. The study of the BKT type of transition is initiated by Jensen et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 105}, 041601 (2010) ] for a D3-D5 system with nonzero
charge density and a magnetic field. Here, we show that one can have the BKT
transition for a D3-D5 system even in the absence of charge density but
requires multiple magnetic fields. In this case the field theory lives in 2+1
dimensions, whereas for the D5-D5 type, the transition requires the presence of
both the charge density and magnetic fields and the dual field theory lives on
a 3+1 dimensional spacetime. We also study the D3-D7 system but it does not
show the BKT type of transition.
