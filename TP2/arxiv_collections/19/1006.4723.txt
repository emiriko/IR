Recently Mora and Chevy [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 230402 (2010),
arXiv:1003.0213v2], in studying the energy of an atomic Fermi gas consisting of
a majority species, 1, and a minority species, 2, showed that, due to
interatomic interactions, the energy density E of the gas has a contribution of
the form E^(2)= f n_2^2 /2, where n_i is the density of species i. They
attribute this term to a `modification of the single polaron properties due to
Pauli blocking'. In this Comment, we demonstrate that E^(2) may equivalently be
understood in terms of the familiar interaction between minority atoms induced
by the majority component.
