In this tutorial we address the existence and stability of periodic and
quasiperiodic orbits in N degree of freedom Hamiltonian systems and their
connection with discrete symmetries. Of primary importance in our study are the
nonlinear normal modes (NNMs), i.e periodic solutions which represent
continuations of the system's linear normal modes in the nonlinear regime. We
examine the existence of such solutions and discuss different methods for
constructing them and studying their stability under fixed and periodic
boundary conditions. In the periodic case, we employ group theoretical concepts
to identify a special type of NNMs called one-dimensional "bushes". We describe
how to use linear combinations such NNMs to construct s(>1)-dimensional bushes
of quasiperiodic orbits, for a wide variety of Hamiltonian systems and exploit
the symmetries of the linearized equations to simplify the study of their
destabilization. Applying this theory to the Fermi Pasta Ulam (FPU) chain, we
review a number of interesting results, which have appeared in the recent
literature. We then turn to an analytical and numerical construction of
quasiperiodic orbits, which does not depend on the symmetries or boundary
conditions. We demonstrate that the well-known "paradox" of FPU recurrences may
be explained in terms of the exponential localization of the energies Eq of
NNM's excited at the low part of the frequency spectrum, i.e. q=1,2,3,....
Thus, we show that the stability of these low-dimensional manifolds called
q-tori is related to the persistence or FPU recurrences at low energies.
Finally, we discuss a novel approach to the stability of orbits of conservative
systems, the GALIk, k=2,...,2N, by means of which one can determine accurately
and efficiently the destabilization of q-tori, leading to the breakdown of
recurrences and the equipartition of energy, at high values of the total energy
E.
