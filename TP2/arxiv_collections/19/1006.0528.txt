This paper has been withdrawn by the author. In this short paper I will put
in evidence a problem nested in Ozawa's effort to block von Neumann's chains
and in his attributing the wave-collapse to a interaction between systems. This
suggests distinguishing sharply the mathematical world from the
phenomenological one.
