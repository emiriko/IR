Chaotic systems, that have a small Lyapunov exponent, do not obey the common
random matrix theory predictions within a wide "weak quantum chaos" regime.
This leads to a novel prediction for the rate of heating for cold atoms in
optical billiards with vibrating walls. The Hamiltonian matrix of the driven
system does not look like one from a Gaussian ensemble, but rather it is very
sparse. This sparsity can be characterized by parameters $s$ and $g$ that
reflect the percentage of large elements, and their connectivity respectively.
For $g$ we use a resistor network calculation that has direct relation to the
semi-linear response characteristics of the system.
