We study the statistical properties of population dynamics evolving in a
realistic two-dimensional compressible turbulent velocity field. We show that
the interplay between turbulent dynamics and population growth and saturation
leads to quasi-localization and a remarkable reduction in the carrying
capacity. The statistical properties of the population density are investigated
and quantified via multifractal scaling analysis. We also investigate
numerically the singular limit of negligibly small growth rates and
delocalization of population ridges triggered by uniform advection.
