In the past few years the field of hadron spectroscopy has seen renewed
interest due to the pubblication, initially mostly from B-Factories, of
evidences of states that do not match regular spectroscopy, but are rather
candidates for bound states with additional quarks or gluons. A huge effort in
understanding the nature of this new states and in building a new spectroscopy
is ongoing. This report reviews the experimental and theoretical state of the
art on heavy quarkonium exotic spectroscopy, with particular attention on the
steps towards a global picture.
