In this paper we present novel algorithmic solutions for several resource
processing and data transfer multicriteria optimization problems. The results
of most of the presented techniques are strategies which solve the considered
problems (almost) optimally. Thus, the developed algorithms construct
intelligent strategies which can be implemented by agents in specific
situations. All the described solutions make use of the properties of the
considered problems and, thus, they are not applicable to a very general class
of problems. However, by considering the specific details of each problem, we
were able to obtain very efficient results.
