The measurement of the Higgs coupling to W bosons is an important program at
the international linear collider (ILC) to search for the anomaly in the
coupling to the gauge bosons. We study the sensitivity of ILC to the Higgs
anomalous coupling to W bosons by using ZH->vvWW* events. In this article, we
report the status of the study.
