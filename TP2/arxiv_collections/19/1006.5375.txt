This paper investigates M-brane quantum geometry (and its representation by
equations involving the 3-bracket) by looking at the compactification of an
M-brane system to a D-brane system. Particularly of interest is the system
where coincident M2-branes end at an angle on an M5-brane, and its reduction to
D1- or F1-branes ending on a D3-brane. Since equations for the quantum
geometries of both of these systems are known, the paper will attempt to
directly relate them via a compactification.
