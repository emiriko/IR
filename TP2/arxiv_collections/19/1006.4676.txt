Reflection and transmission as a function of temperature have been measured
on a single crystal of the magnetoelectric ferrimagnetic compound
Cu$_{2}$OSeO$_{3}$ utilizing light spanning the far infrared to the visible
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The complex dielectric function and
optical properties were obtained via Kramers-Kronig analysis and by fits to a
Drude-Lortentz model. The fits of the infrared phonons show a magnetodielectric
effect near the transition temperature ($T_{c}\sim 60$~K). Assignments to
strong far infrared phonon modes have been made, especially those exhibiting
anomalous behavior around the transition temperature.
