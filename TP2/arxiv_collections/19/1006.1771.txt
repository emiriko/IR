A numerical approach to Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory is demonstrated and we
review its applications to several examples of current interest in the research
on superconductivity. This analysis also shows the applicability of the
two-dimensional approach to thin superconductors and the re-defined effective
GL parameter kappa. For two-gap superconductors, the conveniently written GL
equations directly show that the magnetic behavior of the sample depends not
just on the GL parameter of two bands, but also on the ratio of respective
coherence lengths.
