In this paper we demonstrate how stateful Byzantine Fault Tolerant services
may be hosted on a Chord ring. The strategy presented is fourfold: firstly a
replication scheme that dissociates the maintenance of replicated service state
from ring recovery is developed. Secondly, clients of the ring based services
are made replication aware. Thirdly, a consensus protocol is introduced that
supports the serialization of updates. Finally Byzantine fault tolerant
replication protocols are developed that ensure the integrity of service data
hosted on the ring.
