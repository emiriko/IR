We analyzed the behavior of the rotational velocity in the parent stars of
extrasolar planets. Projected rotational velocity v sin i and angular momentum
were combined with stellar and planetary parameters, for a unique sample of 147
stars, amounting to 184 extrasolar planets, including 25 multiple systems.
Indeed, for the present working sample we considered only stars with planets
detected by the radial-velocity procedure. Our analysis shows that the v sin i
distribution of stars with planets along the HR Diagram follows the well
established scenario for the rotation of intermediate to low main sequence
stars, with a sudden decline in rotation near 1.2Msun . The decline occurs
around Teff~ 6000 K, corresponding to the late-F spectral region. A statistical
comparison of the distribution of the rotation of stars with planets and a
sample of stars without planets indicates that the v sin i distribution for
these two families of stars is drawn from the same population distribution
function. We also found that the angular momentum of extrasolar planet parent
stars follows, at least qualitatively, Kraft's relation. The stars without
detected planets show a clear trend of angular momentum deficit compared to the
stars with planets, in particular for masses higher than about 1.25 Msun .
Stars with the largest mass planets tend to have angular momentum comparable to
or higher than the Sun.
