Massive quantum matter of prescribed spin permits infinitely many
possibilities of covariantization in terms of spinorial (undotted/dotted)
pointlike fields, whereas massless finite helicity representations lead to
large gap in this spinorial spectrum which for s=1 excludes vectorpotentials.
Since the nonexistence of such pointlike generators is the result of a deep
structural clash between modular localization and the Hilbert space setting of
QT, there are two ways out: gauge theory which sacrifies the Hilbert space and
keeps the pointlike formalism and the use of stringlike potentials which allows
to preserve the Hilbert space. The latter setting contains also
string-localized charge-carrying operators whereas the gauge theoretic
formulation is limited to point-like generated observables. This description
also gives a much better insight into the Higgs mechanism which leads to a
revival of the more physical "Schwinger-Higgs" screening idea. The new
formalism is not limited to m=0, s=1, it leads to renormalizable interactions
in the sense of power-counting for all s in massless representations. The
existence of stringlike vectorpotentials is preempted by the Aharonov-Bohm
effect in QFT; it is well-known that the use of pointlike vectorpotentials in
Stokes theorem would with lead to wrong results. Their use in Maxwell's
equations is known to lead to zero Maxwell charge. The role of
string-localization in the problem behind the observed invisibility and
confinement of gluons and quarks leads to new questions and problems. PACS:
