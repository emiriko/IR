We discuss a scheme based on Ehrenfest like equations to exhibit and classify
transitions between two phases (with "smaller" and "larger" masses) of Kerr AdS
black holes. We show that for fixed angular velocity this phase transition is
of second order as both Ehrenfest's equations are satisfied. Finally we make a
close connection of the results found from this analysis with those obtained
from the thermodynamic state space geometry approach.
