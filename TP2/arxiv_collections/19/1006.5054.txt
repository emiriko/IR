We explore the results of [V. Coffman, et al., Phys. Rev. A 61 (2000) 052306]
derived for general tripartite states in a dynamical context. We study a class
of physically motivated tripartite systems. We show that whenever entanglement
sudden death occurs in one of the partitions residual entanglement will appear.
For fourpartite systems however, the appearance of residual entanglement is not
conditioned by sudden death of entanglement. We can only say that if sudden
death of entanglement occurs in some partition there will certainly be residual
entanglement.
