We report on the detection and charge distribution analysis for nitrogen
substitutional dopants in single layer graphene membranes by
aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).
Further, we show that the ionicity of single-layer hexagonal boron nitride can
be confirmed from direct images. For the first time, we demonstrate by a
combination of HRTEM experiments and first-principles electronic structure
calculations that adjustments to the atomic potentials due to chemical bonding
can be discerned in HRTEM images. Our experiments open a way to discern
electronic configurations in point defects or other non-periodic arrangements
or nanoscale objects that can not be analyzed in an electron or x-ray
diffraction experiment.
