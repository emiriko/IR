Purpose: To develop a novel aperture-based algorithm for volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plan optimization with high quality and high
efficiency. Methods: The VMAT optimization problem is formulated as a
large-scale convex programming problem solved by a column generation approach.
We consider a cost function consisting two terms, the first which enforces a
desired dose distribution while the second guarantees a smooth dose rate
variation between successive gantry angles. At each iteration of the column
generation method, a subproblem is first solved to generate one more
deliverable MLC aperture which potentially decreases the cost function most
effectively. A subsequent master problem is then solved to determine the dose
rate at all currently generated apertures by minimizing the cost function. The
iteration of such an algorithm yields a set of deliverable apertures, as well
as dose rates, at all gantry angles. Results: The algorithm was preliminarily
tested on five prostate and five head-and-neck clinical cases, each with one
full gantry rotation and without any couch/collimator rotations. Compared to
corresponding co-planar IMRT treatment plans (9 fields for prostate cases and 5
fields for head-and-neck cases), the VMAT plans delivered much lower doses to
critical structures and more conformal doses to targets. Moreover, extremely
high efficiency has been achieved in our algorithm. It takes only 5~8 minutes
on CPU (MATLAB code on an Intel Xeon 2.27 GHz CPU) and 18~31 seconds on GPU
(CUDA code on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card) to generate such a plan.
Conclusions: We have developed an aperture-based VMAT optimization algorithm
which can generate clinically deliverable and high quality treatment plans at
very high efficiency.
