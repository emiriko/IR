We present additional evidence that dust is really forming along the red
giant branch (RGB) of 47 Tuc at luminosities ranging from above the horizontal
branch to the RGB-tip (Origlia et al. 2007). The presence of dust had been
inferred from an infrared excess in the (K-8) color, with K measured from high
spatial resolution ground based near-IR photometry and "8" referring to
Spitzer-IRAC 8 micron photometry. We show how (K-8) is a far more sensitive
diagnostic for detecting tiny circumstellar envelopes around warm giants than
colors using only the Spitzer-IRAC bands, for example the (3.6-8) color used by
Boyer et al. (2010). In addition, we also show high resolution HST-ACS I band
images of the giant stars which have (K-8) color excess. These images clearly
demonstrate that Boyer et al (2010) statement that our detections of color
excess associated with stars below the RGB-tip arise from blends and artefacts
is simply not valid.
