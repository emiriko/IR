We present the latest generation of
superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor Josephson tunnel junctions
with a step-like thickness of the ferromagnetic (F) layer. The F-layer
thicknesses $d_1$ and $d_2$ in both halves were varied to obtain different
combinations of positive and negative critical current densities $j_{c,1}$ and
$j_{c,2}$. The measured dependences of the critical current on applied magnetic
field can be well described by a model which takes into account different
critical current densities (obtained from reference junctions) and different
net magnetization of the multidomain ferromagnetic layer in both halves.
