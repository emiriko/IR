The origin of hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) is still unclear. About half of the
known sdBs are in close binary systems for which common envelope ejection is
the most likely formation channel. Little is known about this dynamic phase of
binary evolution. Due to the tidal influence of the companion in close binary
systems, the rotation of the primary becomes synchronised to its orbital
motion. In this case it is possible to constrain the mass of the companion, if
the primary mass, its projected rotational velocity as well as its surface
gravity are known. For the first time we measured the projected rotational
velocities of a large sdB binary sample from high resolution spectra. We
analysed a sample of 51 sdB stars in close binaries, 40 of which have known
orbital parameters comprising half of all such systems known today.
Synchronisation in sdB binaries is discussed both from the theoretical and the
observational point of view. The masses and the nature of the unseen companions
could be constrained in 31 cases. The companions to seven sdBs could be clearly
identified as late M stars. One binary may have a brown dwarf companion. The
unseen companions of nine sdBs are white dwarfs with typical masses. The mass
of one white dwarf companion is very low. In eight cases the companion mass
exceeds 0.9 solar masses, four of which even exceed the Chandrasekhar limit
indicating that they may be neutron stars. Even stellar mass black holes are
possible for the most massive companions. The distribution of the inclinations
of the systems with low mass companions appears to be consistent with
expectations, whereas a lack of high inclinations becomes obvious for the
massive systems. We show that the formation of such systems can be explained
with common envelope evolution and present an appropriate formation channel
including two phases of unstable mass transfer and one supernova explosion.
