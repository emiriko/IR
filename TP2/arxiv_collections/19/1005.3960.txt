I review various aspects of Feynman integrals, regularization and
renormalization. Following Bloch, I focus on a linear algebraic approach to the
Feynman rules, and I try to bring together several renormalization methods
found in the literature from a unifying point of view, using resolutions of
singularities. In the second part of the paper, I briefly sketch the work of
Belkale, Brosnan resp. Bloch, Esnault and Kreimer on the motivic nature of
Feynman integrals.
