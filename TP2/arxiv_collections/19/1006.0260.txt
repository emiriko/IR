DAEdALUS, a Decay-At-rest Experiment for delta_CP studies At the Laboratory
for Underground Science, provides a new approach to the search for CP violation
in the neutrino sector. The design utilizes low-cost, high-power proton
accelerators under development for commercial uses. These provide neutrino
beams with energy up to 52 MeV from pion and muon decay-at-rest. The experiment
searches for aninu_mu to antinu_e at short baselines corresponding to the
atmospheric Delta m^2 region. The antinu_e will be detected, via inverse beta
decay, in the 300 kton fiducial-volume Gd-doped water Cherenkov neutrino
detector proposed for the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory
(DUSEL). DAEdALUS opens new opportunities for DUSEL. It provides a
high-statistics, low-background alternative for CP violation searches which
matches the capability of the conventional long-baseline neutrino experiment,
LBNE. Because of the complementary designs, when DAEdALUS antineutrino data are
combined with LBNE neutrino data, the sensitivity of the CP-violation search
improves beyond any present proposals, including the proposal for Project X.
Also, the availability of an on-site neutrino beam opens opportunities for
additional physics, both for the presently planned DUSEL detectors and for new
experiments at a future 300 ft campus.
