We consider the problem of minimizing Euler's elastica energy for simple
closed curves confined to the unit disk. We approximate a simple closed curve
by the zero level set of a function with values +1 on the inside and -1 on the
outside of the curve. The outer container now becomes just the domain of the
phase field. Diffuse approximations of the elastica energy and the curve length
are well known. Implementing the topological constraint thus becomes the main
difficulty here. We propose a solution based on a diffuse approximation of the
winding number, present a proof that one can approximate a given sharp
interface using a sequence of phase fields, and show some numerical results
using finite elements based on subdivision surfaces.
