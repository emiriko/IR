We report an analysis of charmless hadronic decays of charged B mesons to the
final state K+ pi0 pi0, using a data sample of 470.9 +/- 2.8 million BBbar
events collected with the BaBar detector at the Upsilon(4S) resonance. We
observe an excess of signal events with a significance above 10 standard
deviations including systematic uncertainties and measure the branching
fraction to be BF(B+ -> K+ pi0 pi0) = (15.5 +/- 1.1 +/- 1.6) x 10^(-6), where
the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively.
