We study the problem of generating referring expressions modulo different
notions of expressive power. We define the notion of $\+L$-referring
expression, for a formal language $\+L$ equipped with a semantics in terms of
relational models. We show that the approach is independent of the particular
algorithm used to generate the referring expression by providing examples using
the frameworks of \cite{AKS08} and \cite{Krahmer2003}. We provide some new
complexity bounds, discuss the issue of the length of the generated
descriptions, and propose ways in which the two approaches can be combined.
