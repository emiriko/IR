We extend a new treatment proposed for two-nucleon (2N) and three-nucleon
(3N) bound states to 2N scattering. This technique takes momentum vectors as
variables, thus, avoiding partial wave decomposition, and handles spin
operators analytically. We apply the general operator structure of a
nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential to the NN T-matrix, which becomes a sum of six
terms, each term being scalar products of spin operators and momentum vectors
multiplied with scalar functions of vector momenta. Inserting this expansions
of the NN force and T-matrix into the Lippmann-Schwinger equation allows to
remove the spin dependence by taking traces and yields a set of six coupled
equations for the scalar functions found in the expansion of the T-matrix.
