We reexamine the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with enlarged gauge symmetry
SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X x P_LR in the presence of a brane-localized Higgs
sector. In contrast to the existing literature, we perform the Kaluza-Klein
(KK) decomposition within the mass basis, which avoids the truncation of the KK
towers. Expanding the low-energy spectrum as well as the gauge couplings in
powers of the Higgs vacuum expectation value, we obtain analytic formulas which
allow for a deep understanding of the model-specific protection mechanisms of
the T parameter and the left-handed Z-boson couplings. In particular, in the
latter case we explain which contributions escape protection and identify them
with the irreducible sources of P_LR symmetry breaking. We furthermore show
explicitly that no protection mechanism is present in the charged-current
sector confirming existing model-independent findings. The main focus of the
phenomenological part of our work is a detailed discussion of Higgs-boson
couplings and their impact on physics at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. For
the first time, a complete one-loop calculation of all relevant Higgs-boson
production and decay channels is presented, incorporating the effects stemming
from the extended electroweak gauge-boson and fermion sectors.
