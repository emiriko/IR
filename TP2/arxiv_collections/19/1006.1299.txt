A warm inflationary universe model in loop quantum cosmology is studied. In
general we discuss the condition of inflation in this framework. By using a
chaotic potential, $V(\phi)\propto \phi^2$, we develop a model where the
dissipation coefficient $\Gamma=\Gamma_0=$ constant. We use recent astronomical
observations for constraining the parameters appearing in our model.
