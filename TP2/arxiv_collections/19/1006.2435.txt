In the context of the so-called valon model, we calculate $\frac{\delta
g}{g}$ and show that although it is small and compatible with the measured
values, the gluon contribution to the spin of nucleon can be sizable. The
smallness of $\frac{\delta g}{g}$ in the measured kinematical region should not
be interpreted as $\delta g$ being small. In fact, $\delta g$ itself at small
x, and the first moment of the polarized gluon distribution in the nucleon,
$\Delta g(Q^2)$, are large
