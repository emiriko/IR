The dry frictional contact between two solid surfaces is well-known to obey
Coulomb friction laws. In particular, the static friction force resisting the
relative lateral (tangential) motion of solid surfaces, initially at rest, is
known to be proportional to the normal force and independent of the area of the
macroscopic surfaces in contact. Experimentally, the static friction force has
been observed to slightly depend on time. Such an aging phenomenon has been
accounted for either by the creep of the material or by the condensation of
water bridges at the microscopic contacts points. Studying a toy-model, we show
that the small uncontrolled temperature changes of the system can also lead to
a significant increase of the static friction force.
