Various aspects of coherent states of nonlinear $su(2)$ and $su(1,1)$
algebras are studied. It is shown that the nonlinear $su(1,1)$ Barut-Girardello
and Perelomov coherent states are related by a Laplace transform. We then
concentrate on the derivation and analysis of the statistical and geometrical
properties of these states. The Berry's phase for the nonlinear coherent states
is also derived.
