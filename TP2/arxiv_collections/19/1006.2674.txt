Two of the most challenging objects for optical interferometry in the middle
of the last century were the close components (FIN 332) of the wide visual
binary STF2375 (= WDS 18455+0530 = HIP 92027 = ADS 11640). Each component of
the wide pair was found to have subcomponents of approximately the same
magnitude, position angle and separation and, hence, were designated by the
tongue in cheek monikers "Tweedledum and Tweedledee" by the great visual
interferometrist William S. Finsen in 1953. They were later included in a list
of "Double Stars that Vex the Observer" by W.H. van den Bos (1958a). While
speckle interferometry has reaped a rich harvest investigating the close
inteferometric binaries of Finsen, the "Tweedles" have continued to both
fascinate and exasperate due to both the great similarity of the close pairs as
well as the inherent 180 degree ambiguity associated with interferometry.
Detailed analysis of all published observations of the system have revealed
several errors which are here corrected, allowing for determination of these
orbital elements which resolve the quadrant ambiguity. A unique software filter
was developed which allowed subarrays from archival ICCD speckle data from 1982
to be re-reduced. Those data, combined with new and unpublished observations
obtained in 2001-9 from NOAO 4m telescopes, the Mt. Wilson 100in telescope and
the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station 61in telescope as well as high quality
unresolved measures all allow for the correct orbits to be determined.
Co-planarity of the multiple system is also investigated.
