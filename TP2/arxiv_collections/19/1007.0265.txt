A key tool in the study of algebraic surfaces and their moduli is Brieskorn's
simultaneous resolution for families of algebraic surfaces with simple (du Val
or ADE) singularities. In this paper we show that a similar statement holds for
families of curves with at worst simple (ADE) singularities. For a family
$\mathscr X\to B$ of ADE curves, we give an explicit and natural resolution of
the rational map $B\to \bar M_g$. Moreover, we discuss a lifting of this map to
the moduli stack $ \bar {\mathcal M}_g$, i.e. a simultaneous semi-stable
reduction for the family $\mathscr X/B$. In particular, we note that in
contrast to what might be expected from the case of surfaces, the natural Weyl
cover of $B$ is not a sufficient base change for a lifting of the map $B\to
\bar M_g$ to $\bar {\mathcal M}_g$.
