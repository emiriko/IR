Using first-principles density-functional theory, we study the electronic
structure of multilayer graphene nanoribbons as a function of the ribbon width
and the external electric field, applied perpendicular to the ribbon layers. We
consider two types of edges (armchair and zigzag), each with two edge
alignments (referred to as alpha- and beta-alignments). We show that, as in
monolayer and bilayer armchair nanoribbons, multilayer armchair nanoribbons
exhibit three classes of energy gaps which decrease with increasing width.
Nonmagnetic multilayer zigzag nanoribbons have band structures that are
sensitive to the edge alignments and the number of layers, indicating different
magnetic properties and resulting energy gaps. We find that energy gaps can be
induced in ABC-stacked ribbons with a perpendicular external electric field
while in other stacking sequences, the gaps decrease or remain closed as the
external electric field increases.
