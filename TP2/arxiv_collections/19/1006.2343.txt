n this paper we study the effect of biasing on the power spectrum at large
scales. We show that even though non-linear biasing does introduce a white
noise contribution on large scales, the $P(k)\propto k^n$ behavior of the
matter power spectrum on large scales may still be visible and above the white
noise for about one decade. We show, that the Kaiser biasing scheme which leads
to linear bias of the correlation function on {\em large} scales, also
generates a linear bias of the {\rm power spectrum} on rather small scales.
This is a consequence of the divergence on small scales of the pure
Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum. However, biasing becomes k-dependent when we damp
the underlying power spectrum on small scales. We also discuss the effect of
biasing on the baryon acoustic oscillations.
