A natural and intrinsic characterization of the structure of the set
$\mathfrak{C}$ of positive unital maps is given, i.e. it is shown that
$\mathfrak{C}$ is isometrically isomorphic to the subset $\gD$ of bp-positive
density matrices endowed with the geometry given by the norm $\alpha$ dual to
the Grothendieck projective norm $\pi$, the structure of $\gD$ is determined by
the set of its exposed points, and finally a characterization of exposed points
of $\gD$ in terms of convex analysis is presented. This seems to be an answer
to an old open problem, characterization of the structure of the set of
positive maps, studied both in Quantum Information and Operator Algebras. Our
arguments are based on the concept of exposed points and links between tensor
products and mapping spaces. It should be emphasized that the concept of
exposed point depends strongly on the geometry, hence the role of the norm
$\alpha$ is crucial.
