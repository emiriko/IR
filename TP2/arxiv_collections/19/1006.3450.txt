A spin-glass transition occurs both in and out of the limit of validity of
mean-field theory on a diluted one dimensional chain of Ising spins where
exchange bonds occur with a probability decaying as the inverse power of the
distance. Varying the power in this long-range model corresponds, in a
one-to-one relationship, to change the dimension in spin-glass short-range
models. Using different finite size scaling methods evidence for a spin-glass
transition is found also for systems whose equivalent dimension is below the
upper critical dimension at zero magnetic field. The application of a new
method is discussed, that can be exported to systems in a magnetic field.
