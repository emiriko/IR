We consider a dynamic mean-field ferromagnetic model in the low-temperature
regime in the neighborhood of the zero magnetization state. We study the random
time it takes for the system to make a decision, i.e., to exit the neighborhood
of the unstable equilibrium and approach one of the two stable equilibrium
points. We prove a limit theorem for the distribution of this random time in
the thermodynamic limit.
