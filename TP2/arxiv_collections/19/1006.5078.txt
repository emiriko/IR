We propose a method for frequency stabilization of a resonant opto-mechanical
oscillator utilizing the different temperature and strain dependence of the
optical and mechanical modes. In particular, we show that the temperature of
the mechanical resonator can be stabilized to microKelvin level without the
need for an external temperature or frequency reference. The method is
promising for reaching the thermodynamically limited performance of
opto-mechanical oscillators, and even for lifting the thermodynamic limit.
