This article is the first one in a series of two dealing with the concept of
"resonant metalens" we recently introduced [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 203901
(2010)]. Here, we focus on the physics of a medium with finite dimensions
consisting on a square lattice of parallel conducting wires arranged on a
sub-wavelength scale. This medium supports electromagnetic fields that vary
much faster than the operating wavelength. We show that such modes are
dispersive due to the finiteness of the medium. Their dispersion relation is
established in a simple way, a link with designer plasmons is made, and the
canalization phenomenon is reinterpreted at the light of our model. We explain
how to take advantage of this dispersion in order to code sub-wavelength wave
fields in time. Finally, we show that the resonant nature of the medium ensures
an efficient coupling of these modes with free space propagating waves and,
thanks to the Purcell effect, with a source placed in the near field of the
medium.
