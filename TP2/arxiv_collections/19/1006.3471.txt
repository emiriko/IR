In contrast to SrFe2As2, where only the iron possesses a magnetic moment, in
EuFe2As2 an additional large, local magnetic moment is carried by Eu2+. Like
SrFe2As2, EuFe2As2 exhibits a spin-density wave transition at high
temperatures, but in addition the magnetic moments of the Eu2+ order at around
20 K. The interplay of pressure-induced superconductivity and the Eu2+ order
leads to a behavior which is reminiscent of re-entrant superconductivity as it
was observed, for example, in the ternary Chevrel phases or in the rare-earth
nickel borocarbides. Here, we study the delicate interplay of the ordering of
the Eu2+ moments and superconductivity in EuFe1.9Co0.1As2, where application of
external pressure makes it possible to sensitively tune the ratio of the
magnetic (T_C) and the superconducting (T_{c,onset}) critical temperatures. We
find that superconductivity disappears once T_C > T_{c,onset}.
