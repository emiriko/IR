We consider waveguide array in which defect channels with reduced refractive
index are spaced periodically and the light guiding is achieved due to Bragg
reflection. We show that tunneling between defects can be inhibited using
out-of-phase longitudinal modulation of refractive index exclusively in defect
channels. Tunneling inhibition is almost perfect for strongly localized modes
with propagation constants close to the gap center.
