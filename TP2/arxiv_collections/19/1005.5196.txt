A far-infrared system measures the full complex Faraday angle, rotation as
well as ellipticity, with an unprecedented accuracy of 10\,$\mu$rad/T. The
system operates on several far-infrared laser lines in the spectral range from
0.3 to 6 THz and produces results as a continuous function of temperature from
10 to 310K and applied fields between $\pm$ 8\,T. Materials successfully
measured include GaAs 2-DEG heterostructures, various high temperature
superconductors including Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$, Pr$_{2 -
x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_4$, and La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, and single crystals of the
topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$.
