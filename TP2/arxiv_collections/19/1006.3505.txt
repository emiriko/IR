The device for the Josephson flux qubit (DJFQ) can be considered as a solid
state artificial atom with multiple energy levels. When a large amplitude
harmonic excitation is applied to the system, transitions at the energy levels
avoided crossings produce visible changes in the qubit population over many
driven periods that are accompanied by a rich pattern of interference
phenomena. We present a Floquet treatment of the periodically time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation of the strongly driven qubit beyond the standard two
levels approach. For low amplitudes, the average probability of a given sign of
the persistent current qubit exhibits, as a function of the static flux
detuning and the driving amplitude, Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg interference
patterns that evolve into complex diamond-like patterns for large amplitudes.
In the case of highly coherent flux qubits we find that the higher order
diamonds can not be simply described relying on a two-level approximations. In
addition we propose a new spectroscopic method based on starting the system in
the first excited state instead of in the ground state, which can give further
information on the energy level spectrum and dynamics in the case of highly
coherent flux qubits. We compare our numerical results with recent experiments
that perform amplitude spectroscopy to probe the energy spectrum of the
artificial atom.
