We have used the Montage image mosaic engine to investigate the cost and
performance of processing images on the Amazon EC2 cloud, and to inform the
requirements that higher-level products impose on provenance management
technologies. We will present a detailed comparison of the performance of
Montage on the cloud and on the Abe high performance cluster at the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). Because Montage generates many
intermediate products, we have used it to understand the science requirements
that higher-level products impose on provenance management technologies. We
describe experiments with provenance management technologies such as the
"Provenance Aware Service Oriented Architecture" (PASOA).
