It is shown that neither the wave picture nor the ordinary particle picture
offers a satisfactory explanation of the double-slit experiment. The Physicists
who have been successful in formulating theories in the Newtonian Paradigm with
its corresponding ontology find it difficult to interpret Quantum Physics which
deals with particles that are not sensory perceptible. A different
interpretation of Quantum Physics based in a different ontology is presented in
what follows. According to the new interpretation Quantum particles have
different properties from those of Classical Newtonian particles. The
interference patterns are explained in terms of particles each of which passes
through both slits.
