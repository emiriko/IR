We report on the first spectroscopic search for quiescent degenerate binaries
in globular clusters. Our survey is based on a sample of short-period optical
variables which are likely optical counterparts of quiescent X-ray sources in
omega Centauri (NGC 5139) and NGC 6397. All of the studied candidates have
nearly sinusoidal light curves with amplitudes of 0.1--0.35~mag in $V$ and
periods of 0.1--1.3~days. This type of variability, most probably originating
from the ellipsoidal effect, has been observed in several X-ray novae when they
settled into quiescence after an outburst. We find that two of the surveyed
systems harbor dim components with masses in excess of one solar masss, making
them attractive targets for future investigations. We also suggest that there
are two subpopulations of blue stragglers in omega Centauri, differing in
mass-transfer history and/or helium content.
