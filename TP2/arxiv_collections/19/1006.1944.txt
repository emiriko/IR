We examine the behaviour of charged particles in homogeneous, constant and/or
oscillating magnetic fields in the non-relativistic approximation. A special
role of the geometric center of the particle trajectory is elucidated. In
quantum case it becomes a 'fuzzy point' with non-commuting coordinates, an
element of non-commutative geometry which enters into the traditional control
problems. We show that its application extends beyond the usually considered
time independent magnetic fields of the quantum Hall effect. Some simple cases
of magnetic control by oscillating fields lead to the stability maps differing
from the traditional Strutt diagram.
