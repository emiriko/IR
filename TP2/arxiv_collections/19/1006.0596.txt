This paper derives a general procedure for the numerical solution of the
Lindblad equations that govern the coherences arising from multicoloured light
interacting with a multilevel system. A systematic approach to finding the
conservative and dissipative terms is derived and applied to the laser cooling
of gallium. An improved numerical method is developed to solve the
time-dependent master equation and results are presented for transient cooling
processes. The method is significantly more robust, efficient and accurate than
the standard method and can be applied to a broad range of atomic and molecular
systems. Radiation pressure forces and the formation of dynamic dark-states are
studied in the gallium isotope 66Ga.
