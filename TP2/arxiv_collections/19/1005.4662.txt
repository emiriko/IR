Fluctuation relations establish rigorous identities for the nonequilibrium
averages of observables. Starting from a general transport master equation with
time-dependent rates, we employ the stochastic path integral approach to study
statistical fluctuations around such averages. We show how under nonequilibrium
conditions, rare realizations of transport observables are crucial and imply
massive fluctuations that may completely mask such identities. Quantitative
estimates for these fluctuations are provided. We illustrate our results on the
paradigmatic example of a mesoscopic RC circuit.
