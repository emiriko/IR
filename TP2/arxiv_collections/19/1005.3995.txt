The model of homogeneous semicoherent interphase boundary describes the
processes of absorption and thermoactivated migration of irradiation-produced
inequilibrium point defects at a semicoherent boundary between a heterophase
precipitate and a substitution solid solution. Within this model the kinetics
of evolution of the sizes of precipitates of constant chemical composition
under irradiation is investigated. The results obtained are compared to the
experimental data [I. Monnet et al., J. Nucl. Mater. 335 (2004) 311] for the
ferritic ODS steel EM10+MgO under electron irradiation.
