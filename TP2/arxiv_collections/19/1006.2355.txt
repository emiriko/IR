We have discovered first homologous series of iron pnictide oxide
superconductors (Fe2As2)(Can+1(Sc,Ti)nOy) [n = 3,4,5]. These compounds have
extremely thick blocking layers up to quintuple perovskite oxide layers
sandwiched by the Fe2As2 layers. These samples exhibited bulk superconductivity
with relatively high Tc up to 42 K. The relationship between Tc and the
iron-plane interlayer distance suggested that superconductivity due to the mono
Fe2As2 layer is substantially 40 K-class.
