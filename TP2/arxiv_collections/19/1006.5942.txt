This paper aims at VLSI realization for generation of a new face from textual
description. The FASY (FAce SYnthesis) System is a Face Database Retrieval and
new Face generation System that is under development. One of its main features
is the generation of the requested face when it is not found in the existing
database. The new face generation system works in three steps - searching
phase, assembling phase and tuning phase. In this paper the tuning phase using
hardware description language and its implementation in a Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) device is presented.
