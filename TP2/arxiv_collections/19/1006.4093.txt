In this paper we describe a dynamic external memory data structure that
supports range reporting queries in three dimensions in $O(\log_B^2 N +
\frac{k}{B})$ I/O operations, where $k$ is the number of points in the answer
and $B$ is the block size. This is the first dynamic data structure that
answers three-dimensional range reporting queries in $\log_B^{O(1)} N +
O(\frac{k}{B})$ I/Os.
