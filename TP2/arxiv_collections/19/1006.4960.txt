Rabi oscillations in the V_15 Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) embedded in the
surfactant DODA have been studied at different microwave powers. An intense
damping peak is observed when the Rabi frequency Omega_R falls in the vicinity
of the Larmor frequency of protons w_N, while the damping time t_R of
oscillations reaches values 10 times shorter than the phase coherence time t_2
measured at the same temperature. The experiments are interpreted by the N-spin
model showing that t_R is directly associated with the decoherence via
electronic/nuclear spin cross-relaxation in the rotating reference frame. It is
shown that this decoherence is accompanied with energy dissipation in the range
of the Rabi frequencies w_N - sigma_e < Omega_R < w_N, where sigma_e is the
mean super-hyperfine field (in frequency units) induced by protons at SMMs.
Weaker damping without dissipation takes place outside this dissipation window.
Simple local field estimations suggest that this rapid cross-relaxation in
resonant microwave field observed for the first time in SMMV_15 should take
place in other SMMs like Fe_8 and Mn_12 containing protons, too.
