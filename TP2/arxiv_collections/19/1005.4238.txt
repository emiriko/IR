The anomalous dimuon charge asymmetry reported by the D0 Collaboration may be
due to the tree-level exchange of some spin-0 particles that mediate CP
violation in B_s-\bar{B}_s meson mixing. We show that for a range of couplings
and masses, the heavy neutral states in a two Higgs doublet model can generate
a large charge asymmetry. This range is natural in "uplifted supersymmetry",
and may enhance the B^- -> tau nu and B_s -> mu^+ mu^- decay rates. However, we
point out that on general grounds the reported central value of the charge
asymmetry requires new physics not only in B_s-\bar{B}_s mixing but also in
\Delta B = 1 transitions or in B_d-\bar{B}_d mixing.
