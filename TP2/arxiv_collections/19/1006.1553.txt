In this paper, we derive the period-luminosity (P-L) relation for Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids based on mid-infrared AKARI observations.
AKARI's IRC sources were matched to the OGLE-III LMC Cepheid catalog. Together
with the available I band light curves from the OGLE-III catalog, potential
false matches were removed from the sample. This procedure excluded most of the
sources in the S7 and S11 bands: hence only the P-L relation in the N3 band was
derived in this paper. Random-phase corrections were included in deriving the
P-L relation for the single epoch AKARI data, even though the derived P-L
relation is consistent with the P-L relation without random-phase correction,
though there is a \sim 7 per-cent improvement in the dispersion of the P-L
relation. The final adopted N3 band P-L relation is N3 = -3.246 log(P) +
15.844, with a dispersion of 0.149.
