One of the major assumptions in the search for gravitational wave signatures
from massive and supermassive black hole binaries with LISA, is that these
systems will have circularized before entering the LISA bandwidth. Current
astrophysical simulations now suggest that systems could have a non-negligible
eccentricity in the LISA band, and an important level of eccentricity in the
Pulsar Timing regime. In this work, we use a set of source catalogues from
astrophysically motivated models of massive black hole binary formation and
assume a one year LISA mission lifetime. Depending on the model in question,
the initial eccentricities in the final year of the inspiral can be as high as
0.6 for high mass seeds and 0.8 for low mass seeds. We show that restricted
post-Newtonian circular templates are extremely inefficient in recovering
eccentric binaries, with median optimal signal to noise ratio recoveries of
approximately 10% for all models considered. This coupled with extremely large
errors in parameter recovery from individual Markov chain Monte Carlo's
demonstrate quite clearly that even to search for binaries with initial
eccentricities as low as $10^{-4}$, we will require eccentric templates for
LISA data analysis.
