Rate coefficients for inelastic Na+H collisions are calculated for all
transitions between the ten levels up to and including the ionic state
(ion-pair production), namely Na(3s,3p,4s,3d,4p,5s,4d,4f,5p)+H(1s) and Na+ +
H-. The calculations are based on recent full quantum scattering cross-section
calculations. The data are needed for non-LTE applications in cool
astrophysical environments, especially cool stellar atmospheres, and are
presented for a temperature range of 500-8000 K. From consideration of the
sensitivity of the cross-sections to input quantum chemical data and the
results of different methods for the scattering calculations, a measure of the
possible uncertainties in the rate coefficients is estimated.
