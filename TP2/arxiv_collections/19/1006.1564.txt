We report bulk-quality n-type SrTiO3 (n-SrTiO3) thin films fabricated by
pulsed laser deposition, with electron mobility as high as 6600 cm2 V-1 s-1 at
2 K and carrier density as low as 2.0 x 10^18cm-3 (~ 0.02 at. %), far exceeding
previous pulsed laser deposition films. This result stems from precise
strontium and oxygen vacancy defect chemistry management, providing a general
approach for defect control in complex oxide heteroepitaxy.
