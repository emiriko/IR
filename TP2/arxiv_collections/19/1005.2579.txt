Coherent hopping of excitation rely on quantum coherence over physically
extended states. In this work, we consider simple models to examine the effect
of symmetries of delocalized multi-excitation states on the dynamical
timescales, including hopping rates, radiative decay, and environmental
interactions. While the decoherence (pure dephasing) rate of an extended state
over N sites is comparable to that of a non-extended state, superradiance leads
to a factor of N enhancement in decay and absorption rates. In addition to
superradiance, we illustrate how the multi-excitonic states exhibit
`supertransfer' in the far-field regime: hopping from a symmetrized state over
N sites to a symmetrized state over M sites at a rate proportional to MN. We
argue that such symmetries could play an operational role in physical systems
based on the competition between symmetry-enhanced interactions and localized
inhomogeneities and environmental interactions that destroy symmetry. As an
example, we propose that supertransfer and coherent hopping play a role in
recent observations of anomolously long diffusion lengths in nano-engineered
assembly of light-harvesting complexes.
