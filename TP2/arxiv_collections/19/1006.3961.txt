Probably the most fundamental processes for biological systems is their
ability to create themselves through the use of cell division and cell
differentiation. In this work a simple physical model is proposed for
biological cell division. The model consists of a positive ionic gradient
across the cell membrane, and concentration of charge at the nodes of the
spindle and on the chromosomes. A simple calculation, based on Coulomb's Law,
shows that under such circumstances a chromosome will tend to break up to its
constituent chromatids and that the chromatids will be separated by a distance
that is an order of thirty percent of the distance between the spindle nodes.
Further repulsion between the nodes will tend to stretch the cell and
eventually break the cell membrane between the separated chromatids, leading to
cell division. The importance of this work is in continuing the understanding
of the electromagnetic basis of cell division and providing it with an
analytical model. A central implication of this and other studies is to give
theoretical support to the notion that cell division can be manipulated by
electromagnetic means. Requirements on the ingredients of more sophisticated
models for biological cell division will also discussed.
