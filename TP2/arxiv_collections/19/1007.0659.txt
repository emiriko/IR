The pair production of tau sneutrinos in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions and their
subsequent decays are studied in a framework of the supersymmetric extension of
the standard model. We present an analysis for the parameter space (BR vs.
mass) which could be explored at the future high energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders.
