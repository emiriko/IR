In this paper, the scheme of quantum computing based on Stark chirped rapid
adiabatic passage (SCRAP) technique [L. F. Wei et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100,
113601 (2008)] is extensively applied to implement the quantum-state
manipulations in the flux-biased Josephson phase qubits. The broken-parity
symmetries of bound states in flux-biased Josephson junctions are utilized to
conveniently generate the desirable Stark-shifts. Then, assisted by various
transition pulses universal quantum logic gates as well as arbitrary
quantum-state preparations could be implemented. Compared with the usual
PI-pulses operations widely used in the experiments, the adiabatic population
passage proposed here is insensitive the details of the applied pulses and thus
the desirable population transfers could be satisfyingly implemented. The
experimental feasibility of the proposal is also discussed.
