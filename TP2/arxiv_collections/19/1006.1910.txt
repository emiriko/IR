In this work, we have studied the chemical and magnetic interactions of Fe_n;
n <= 6, clusters with a divacancy site in a graphene sheet by ab-initio density
functional calculations. Our results show significant chemical interactions
between the cluster and graphene. As a result, a complex distribution of
magnetic moments appear on the distorted Fe clusters in presence of graphene
and results in a lower average magnetic moments compared to the free clusters.
The presence of cluster also prevents the formation of 5-8-5 ringed structure
known to exhibit in a graphene sheet having a divacancy defect. The clusters
induce electronic states primarily of d-character near the Fermi level.
