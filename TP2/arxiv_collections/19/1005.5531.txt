We {characterize the multipartite entanglement in a quantum system by the
quantity} which vanishes if only the quantum system may be decomposed into two
weakly entangled subsystems, unlike measures of multipartite entanglement
introduced before. We refer to this {quantity} as the minimal entanglement of
bipartite decompositions (MEBD). Big MEBD means that the system may not be
decomposed into two weakly entangled subsystems. MEBD allows one to define, for
instance, whether the given quantum system may be a candidate for a quantum
register, where the above decomposition is undesirable.
  A method of lower estimation of MEBD is represented. Examples of big MEBD in
spin-1/2 chains governed by the $H_{dz}$ Hamiltonian in the strong external
magnetic field are given.
