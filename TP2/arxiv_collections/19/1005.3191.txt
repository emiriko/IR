We search for isolated galaxies based on the automatic identification of
isolated sources from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) followed by a
visual inspection of their surroundings. We use the modified Karachentseva
criterion to compile a catalog of 3227 isolated galaxies (2MIG), which contains
6% of 2MASS Extended Sources Catalog (or 2MASX) sources brighter than Ks = 12
mag with angular diameters a_K > 30 arcsec. The catalog covers the entire sky
and has an effective depth of z = 0.02. The 2493 very isolated objects of the
catalog, which we include into the 2MVIG catalog, can be used as a reference
sample to investigate the effects of the environment on the structure and
evolution of galaxies located in regions with extremely low density of matter.
