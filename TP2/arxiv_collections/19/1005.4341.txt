We give a brief review of the Quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions and
its relation to fuzzy spaces. For a quantum Hall system, the lowest Landau
level dynamics is given by a one-dimensional matrix action. This can be used to
write down a bosonized noncommutative field theory describing the interactions
of higher dimensional nonrelativistic fermions with abelian or nonabelian gauge
fields in the lowest Landau level. This general approach is applied explicitly
to the case of QHE on ${\bf CP}^k$. It is shown that in the semiclassical limit
the effective action contains a bulk Chern-Simons type term whose anomaly is
exactly canceled by a boundary term given in terms of a chiral, gauged
Wess-Zumino-Witten action suitably generalized to higher dimensions.
