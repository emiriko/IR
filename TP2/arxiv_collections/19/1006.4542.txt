A web log or blog in short is a trendy way to share personal entries with
others through website. A typical blog may consist of texts, images, audios and
videos etc. Most of the blogs work as personal online diaries, while others may
focus on specific interest such as photographs (photoblog), art (artblog),
travel (tourblog), IT (techblog) etc. Another type of blogging called
microblogging is also very well known now-a-days which contains very short
posts. Like the developed countries, the users of blogs are gradually
increasing in the developing countries e.g. Bangladesh. Due to the nature of
open access to all users, some people misuse it to spread fake news to achieve
individual or political goals. Some of them also post vulgar materials that
make an embarrass situation for other bloggers. Even, sometimes it indulges the
reputation of the victim. The only way to overcome this problem is to bring all
the posts under supervision of the blog moderator. But it totally contradicts
with blogging concepts. In this paper, we have implemented an algorithm that
would help to prevent the offensive entries from being posted. These entries
would go through a supervision process to justify themselves as legal posts.
From the analysis of the result, we have shown that this approach can eliminate
the chaotic situations in blogosphere at a great extent. Our experiment shows
that about 90% of offensive posts can be detected and stopped from being
published using this approach.
