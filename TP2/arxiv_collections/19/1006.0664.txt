The B. and M. Shapiro conjecture stated that all solutions of the Schubert
Calculus problems associated with real points on the rational normal curve
should be real. For Grassmannians, it was proved by Mukhin, Tarasov and
Varchenko. For flag varieties, Sottile found a counterexample and suggested
that all solutions should be real under certain monotonicity conditions. In
this paper, we compute lower bounds on the number of real solutions for some
special cases of the B. and M. Shapiro conjecture for flag varieties, when
Sottile's monotonicity conditions are not satisfied.
