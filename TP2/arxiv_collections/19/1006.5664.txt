We propose to use a permutation symmetric sample of multi-level atoms to
simulate the properties of topologically ordered states. The Rydberg blockade
interaction is used to prepare states of the sample which are equivalent to
resonating valence bond states, Laughlin states, and string-net condensates and
to create and study the properties of their quasi-particle-like fundamental
excitations.
