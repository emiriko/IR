We introduce two entanglement conditions that take the form of inequalities
involving expectation values of operators. These conditions are sufficient
conditions for entanglement, that is if they are satisfied the state is
entangled, but if they are not, one can say nothing about the entanglement of
the state. These conditions are quite flexible, because the operators in them
are not specified, and they are particularly useful in detecting multipartite
entanglement. We explore the range of utility of these conditions by
considering a number of examples of entangled states, and seeing under what
conditions entanglement in them can be detected by the inequalities presented
here.
