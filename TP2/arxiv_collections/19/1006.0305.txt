A search for new isotopes using in-flight fission of a 345 MeV/nucleon 238U
beam has been carried out at the RI Beam Factory at the RIKEN Nishina Center.
Fission fragments were analyzed and identified by using the superconducting
in-flight separator BigRIPS. We observed 45 new neutron-rich isotopes: 71Mn,
73,74Fe, 76Co, 79Ni, 81,82Cu, 84,85Zn, 87Ga, 90Ge, 95Se, 98Br, 101Kr, 103Rb,
106,107Sr, 108,109Y, 111,112Zr, 114,115Nb, 115,116,117Mo, 119,120Tc,
121,122,123,124Ru, 123,124,125,126Rh, 127,128Pd, 133Cd, 138Sn, 140Sb, 143Te,
145I, 148Xe, and 152Ba.
