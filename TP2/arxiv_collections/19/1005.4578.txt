Models with a non-universal Z' exhibit in general flavor changing neutral
currents (FCNC) at tree-level. When the Z' couplings favor the third
generation, flavor changing transitions of the form Z'tc and Z'tu could be
large enough to be observable at the LHC. In this paper we explore this
possibility using the associated production of a single top-quark with the Z'
and find that integrated luminosities of a few hundred fb$^{-1}$ are necessary
to probe the interesting region of parameter space.
