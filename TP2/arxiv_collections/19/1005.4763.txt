Timing analysis of the INTEGRAL-IBIS and Swift-BAT light curves of the
Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT) IGR J16465-4507 has identified a period
of 30.32+/-0.02 days which we interpret as the orbital period of the binary
system. In addition 11 outbursts (9 of which are previously unpublished) have
been found between MJD 52652 to MJD 54764, all of which occur close to the
region of the orbit we regard as periastron. From the reported flux outbursts,
we found a dynamical range in the interval ~30-80. Although in this regard IGR
J16465-4507 cannot be considered a classical SFXT for which typical dinamical
ranges are >100, still our reported values are significantly greater than that
of classical persistent variable supergiant HMXBs (<20), supporting the idea
that IGRJ16465-4507 is an intermediate SFXT system, much like few other similar
cases reported in the literature.
