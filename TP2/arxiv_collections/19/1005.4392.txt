The response of the worldwide scientific community to the discovery in 2008
of superconductivity at Tc = 26 K in the Fe-based compound LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_x has
been very enthusiastic. In short order, other Fe-based superconductors with the
same or related crystal structures were discovered with Tc up to 56 K. Many
experiments were carried out and theories formulated to try to understand the
basic properties of these new materials and the mechanism for Tc. In this
selective critical review of the experimental literature, we distill some of
this extensive body of work, and discuss relationships between different types
of experiments on these materials with reference to theoretical concepts and
models. The experimental normal-state properties are emphasized, and within
these the electronic and magnetic properties because of the likelihood of an
electronic/magnetic mechanism for superconductivity in these materials.
