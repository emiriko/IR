The divergence of perturbative expansions for the vast majority of
macroscopic systems, which follows from Dyson's collapse argument, prevents
Feynman's diagrammatic technique from being directly used for controllable
studies of strongly interacting systems. We show how the problem of divergence
can be solved by replacing the original model with a convergent sequence of
successive approximations which have a convergent perturbative series. As a
prototypical model, we consider the zero-dimensional $\vert \psi \vert^4$
theory.
