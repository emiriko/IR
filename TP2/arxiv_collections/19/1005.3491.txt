Charged-particle tracking in the international Muon Ionisation Cooling
Experiment (MICE) will be performed using two solenoidal spectrometers, each
instrumented with a tracking detector based on 350 {\mu}m diameter
scintillating fibres. The design and construction of the trackers is described
along with the quality-assurance procedures, photon-detection system, readout
electronics, reconstruction and simulation software and the data-acquisition
system. Finally, the performance of the MICE tracker, determined using cosmic
rays, is presented.
