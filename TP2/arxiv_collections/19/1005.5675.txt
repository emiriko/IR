This is the second installment of the Financial Bubble Experiment. Here we
provide the digital fingerprint of an electronic document in which we identify
7 bubbles in 7 different global assets; for 4 of these assets, we present
windows of dates of the most likely ending time of each bubble. We will provide
that document of the original analysis on 1 November 2010.
