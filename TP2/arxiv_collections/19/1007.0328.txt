This thesis investigates the application of autonomic management to a
distributed storage system. Effects on performance and resource consumption
were measured in experiments, which were carried out in a local area test-bed.
The experiments were conducted with components of one specific distributed
storage system, but seek to be applicable to a wide range of such systems, in
particular those exposed to varying conditions. The perceived characteristics
of distributed storage systems depend on their configuration parameters and on
various dynamic conditions. For a given set of conditions, one specific
configuration may be better than another with respect to measures such as
resource consumption and performance. Here, configuration parameter values were
set dynamically and the results compared with a static configuration. It was
hypothesised that under non-changing conditions this would allow the system to
converge on a configuration that was more suitable than any that could be set a
priori. Furthermore, the system could react to a change in conditions by
adopting a more appropriate configuration. Autonomic management was applied to
the peer-to-peer (P2P) and data retrieval components of ASA, a distributed
storage system. The effects were measured experimentally for various workload
and churn patterns. The management policies and mechanisms were implemented
using a generic autonomic management framework developed during this work. The
experimental evaluations of autonomic management show promising results, and
suggest several future research topics. The findings of this thesis could be
exploited in building other distributed storage systems that focus on
harnessing storage on user workstations, since these are particularly likely to
be exposed to varying, unpredictable conditions.
