Flows involving liquid-coated grains are ubiquitous in nature (pollen
capture, avalanches) and industry (air filtration, smoke-particle
agglomeration, pharmaceutical mixing). In this work, three-body collisions
between liquid-coated spheres are investigated experimentally using a "Stokes'
cradle", which resembles the popular desktop toy known as the Newton's cradle.
Surprisingly, previous work indicates that every possible outcome was observed
in the wetted system except the traditional Newton's cradle (NC) outcome. Here,
we are able to experimentally achieve NC via guidance from a first-principles
model, which revealed that controlling the volume of the liquid bridge
connecting the two target particles is the key parameter in attaining the NC
outcome. By independently decreasing the volume of the liquid bridge, we not
only achieved NC but also uncovered several new findings. For example, in
contrast to previous work on two-body collisions, three-body experiments
provide direct evidence that the fluid resistance upon rebound cannot be
completely neglected due to presumed cavitation; this resistance also plays a
role in two-body systems yet cannot be isolated experimentally in such systems.
The herein micro-level description provides an essential foundation for
macro-level descriptions of wetted granular flows.
