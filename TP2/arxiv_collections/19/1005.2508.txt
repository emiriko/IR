We investigate dyonic giant magnons propagating on $\gamma$-deformed
$AdS_5\times S^5$ by Neumann-Rosochatius reduction method with a twisted
boundary condition. We compute finite-size effect of the dispersion relations
of dyonic giant magnons which generalizes the previously known case of the
giant magnons with one angular momentum found by Bykov and Frolov.
