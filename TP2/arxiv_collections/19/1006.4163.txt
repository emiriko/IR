J113924.74+164144.0 is an interesting galaxy at z = 0.0693, i.e. D_L ~ 305
Mpc, with tidal-tail-like extended optical features on both sides. There are
two neighbouring galaxies, a spiral galaxy J113922.85+164136.3 which has a
strikingly similar 'tidal' morphology, and a faint galaxy J113923.58+164129.9.
We report HI 21 cm observations of this field to search for signatures of
possible interaction. Narrow HI emission is detected from J113924.74+164144.0,
but J113922.85+164136.3 shows no detectable emission. The total HI mass
detected in J113924.74+164144.0 is 7.7 x 10^9 M_solar. The HI emission from the
galaxy is found to be extended and significantly offset from the optical
position of the galaxy. We interpret this as signature of possible interaction
with the neighbouring spiral galaxy. There is also a possible detection of HI
emission from another nearby galaxy J113952.31+164531.8 at z = 0.0680 at a
projected distance of 600 kpc, and with a total HI mass of 5.3 x 10^9 M_solar,
suggesting that all these galaxies form a loose group at z ~ 0.069.
