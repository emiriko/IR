W boson production is observed in $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV proton proton collisions
at RHIC-PHENIX experiment. The single longitudinal spin asymmetry
$A_L(\overrightarrow{p}p\rightarrow W^+X)$ is measured via decay positrons in
the mid rapidity region. The asymmetry $-0.83\pm0.31\pm(11%$ scale uncertainty)
is consistent with calculations from various polarized parton distribution
functions.
