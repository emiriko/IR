We derive a fluid theory for spin-1/2 particles starting from an extended
kinetic model based on a spin-projected density matrix formalism. The evolution
equation for the spin density is found to contain a pressure-like term. We give
an example where this term is important by looking at a linear mode previously
found in a spin kinetic model.
