ZnSe scintillating bolometers are good candidates for future Double Beta
Decay searches, because of the 82Se high Q-value and thanks to the possibility
of alpha background rejection on the basis of the scintillation signal. In this
paper we report the characteristics and the anomalies observed in an extensive
study of these devices. Among them, an unexpected high emission from alpha
particles, accompanied with an unusual pattern of the light vs. heat scatter
plot. The perspectives for the application of this kind of detectors to search
for the Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay of 82Se are presented.
