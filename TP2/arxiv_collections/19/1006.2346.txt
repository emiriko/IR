Magnetic fields play a critical role in the propagation of charged cosmic
rays. Particular field configurations supported by different astrophysical
objects may be observable in cosmic ray maps. We consider a simple
configuration, a constant azimuthal field in a disk-like object, that we
identify as a cosmic magnetic lens. Such configuration is typical in most
spiral galaxies, and we assume that it can also appear at smaller or larger
scales. We show that the magnetic lens deflects cosmic rays in a regular
geometrical pattern, very much like a gravitational lens deflects light but
with some interesting differences. In particular, the lens acts effectively
only in a definite region of the cosmic-ray spectrum, and it can be convergent
or divergent depending on the (clockwise or counterclockwise) direction of the
magnetic field and the (positive or negative) electric charge of the cosmic
ray. We find that the image of a point-like monochromatic source may be one,
two or four points depending on the relative position of source, observer and
center of the lens. For a perfect alignment and a lens in the orthogonal plane
the image becomes a ring. We also show that the presence of a lens could
introduce low-scale fluctuations and matter-antimatter asymmetries in the
fluxes from distant sources. The concept of cosmic magnetic lens that we
introduce here may be useful in the interpretation of possible patterns
observed in the cosmic ray flux at different energies.
