In this work we theoretically consider a variation of remarkable experiment
of the single photon interference at beam splitter. As photon trajectories
micro-detector we consider other photon (entangled with the first photon via
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect) in common with two identical simple two-level systems
(practically two atoms) placed respectively at two beam splitter outcomes. Any
two-level system is initially in ground state, but it can absorb one photon
when it turns out in excited state. In this way we obtain unambiguously quantum
entanglement between one photon and mentioned micro-detector of the photon
trajectories, i.e. Schrodinger cat effect. Later sub-systemic detection of the
photon by detection photo plate will point out effective absence of the
interference patterns, i.e. presence of the statistical mixture of two photon
trajectories. All this can be very important for the quantum mechanics
foundation since it clearly demonstrates that quantum superposition breaking,
i.e. collapse has not absolute character. We discuss a consistent model of the
collapse as spontaneous (non-dynamical) breaking (effective hiding) of the
unitary symmetry (that conserves superposition) of the quantum dynamics.
