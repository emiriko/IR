We show that the various intermediate states appearing in the process of
one-way computation at a given step of measurement are all equivalent modulo
local unitary transformations. This implies, in particular, that all those
intermediate states share the same entanglement irrespective of the measurement
outcomes, indicating that the process of one-way computation is essentially
unique with respect to local quantum operations.
