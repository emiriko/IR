We numerically investigate the Josephson transport through ferromagnetic
insulators (FIs) by taking into account its band structure. By use of the
recursive Green's function method, we found the formation of the pi junction in
the case of the fully spin-polarized FI (FPFI), e.g., La$_2$BaCuO$_5$.
Moreover, the 0-pi transition is induced by increasing the thickness of FPFI.
On the other hand, Josephson current through the Eu chalcogenides shows the pi
junction behavior in the case of the strong d-f hybridization between the
conduction d and the localized f electrons of Eu. Such FI-based Josephson
junctions may become a element in the architecture of future quantum
information devices.
