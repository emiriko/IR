The LHC measurements above SPS and Tevatron energies give the opportunity to
test predictions of non-extensive thermodynamical picture of hadronic
interaction to examine measured transverse momenta distributions for new
interaction energy range. We determined Tsallis model non-extensivity parameter
for the hadronization process before short-lived particles decayed and distort
the initial p_t distribution. We have shown that it follows exactly smooth rise
determined at lower energies below present LHC record. The shape of the q
parameter energy dependence is consistent with expectations and the evidence of
the asymptotic limit may be seen.
