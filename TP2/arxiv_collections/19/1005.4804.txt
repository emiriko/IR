Since the Aharonov-Bohm effect is the purely quantum effect that has no
analogues in classical physics, its persistence in the quasiclassical limit
seems to be hardly possible. Nevertheless, we show that the scattering
Aharonov-Bohm effect does persist in the quasiclassical limit owing to the
diffraction, i.e. the Fraunhofer diffraction in the case when space outside the
enclosed magnetic flux is Euclidean, and the Fresnel diffraction in the case
when the outer space is conical. Hence, the enclosed magnetic flux can serve as
a gate for the propagation of short-wavelength, almost classical, particles. In
the case of conical space, this quasiclassical effect which is in principle
detectable depends on the particle spin.
