Recently Abe (arXiv:cond-mat/1005.5110v1) claimed that the q-entropy of
nonextensive statistical mechanics cannot be generalized for the continuous
variables and therefore can be used only in the discrete case. In this letter,
we show that the discrete q-entropy can be generalized to continuous variables
exactly in the same manner as Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, contrary to the claim by
Abe, so that q-entropy can be used with discrete as well as continuous
variables.
