In this paper we investigate the relation between the maximal luminosity of
X-ray outburst and the orbital period in transient low mass X-ray binaries (or
soft X-ray transients) observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) in
the past decade. We find that the maximal luminosity (3-200 keV) in Eddington
unit generally increases with increasing orbital period, which does not show a
luminosity saturation but in general agrees with theoretical prediction. The
peak luminosities in ultra-compact binaries might be higher than those with
orbital period of 2-4 h, but more data are needed to make the claim. We also
find that there is no significant difference in the 3-200 keV outburst peak
luminosity between neutron star systems and black hole systems with orbital
periods above 4 h; however, there might be significant difference at smaller
orbital period where only neutron star systems are observed and radiatively
ineffcient accretion flow is expected to work at the low luminosities for black
hole accreters.
