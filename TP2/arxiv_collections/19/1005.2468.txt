Highly luminescent ZnO:Na nanocrystals of size ~2 nm were synthesized using a
improved sol-lyophilization process. The surface analysis such as survey scan,
core-level and valence band spectra of ZnO:Na nanocrystals were studied using
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to establish the presence of Na+ ions.
The observed increase in band gap from 3.30 (bulk) to 4.16 eV (nano), is
attributed to the quantum confinement of the motion of electron and holes in
all three directions. The photoluminescence and decay measurements have
complemented and supported our study to design an efficient and ultrafast
responsive optical sensing device.
