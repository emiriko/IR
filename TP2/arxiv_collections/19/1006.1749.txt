We consider switched systems on Banach and Hilbert spaces governed by
strongly continuous one-parameter semigroups of linear evolution operators. We
provide necessary and sufficient conditions for their global exponential
stability, uniform with respect to the switching signal, in terms of the
existence of a Lyapunov function common to all modes.
