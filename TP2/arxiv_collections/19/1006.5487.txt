We report on data obtained with the Chandra, XMM-Newton, Suzaku and Swift
X-ray observatories, following the 2006 outburst of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar
CXO J164710.2-455216. We find no evidence for the very large glitch and rapid
exponential decay as was reported previously for this source. We set a 3 sigma
upper limit on any fractional frequency increase at the time of the outburst of
Delta nu/nu < 1.5 x 10^{-5}. Our timing analysis, based on the longest time
baseline yet, yields a spin-down rate for the pulsar that implies a surface
dipolar magnetic field of ~9 x 10^{13} G, although this could be biased high by
possible recovery from an undetected glitch. We also present an analysis of the
source flux and spectral evolution, and find no evidence for long-term spectral
relaxation post-outburst as was previously reported.
