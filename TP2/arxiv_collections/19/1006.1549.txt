We present a basic high-level structures used for developing quantum
programming languages. The presented structures are commonly used in many
existing quantum programming languages and we use quantum pseudo-code based on
QCL quantum programming language to describe them. We also present the
implementation of introduced structures in GNU Octave language for scientific
computing. Procedures used in the implementation are available as a package
quantum-octave, providing a library of functions, which facilitates the
simulation of quantum computing. This package allows also to incorporate
high-level programming concepts into the simulation in GNU Octave and Matlab.
As such it connects features unique for high-level quantum programming
languages, with the full palette of efficient computational routines commonly
available in modern scientific computing systems. To present the major features
of the described package we provide the implementation of selected quantum
algorithms. We also show how quantum errors can be taken into account during
the simulation of quantum algorithms using quantum-octave package. This is
possible thanks to the ability to operate on density matrices.
