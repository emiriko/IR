We review recent efforts to detect small numbers of nuclear spins using
magnetic resonance force microscopy. Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM)
is a scanning probe technique that relies on the mechanical measurement of the
weak magnetic force between a microscopic magnet and the magnetic moments in a
sample. Spurred by the recent progress in fabricating ultrasensitive force
detectors, MRFM has rapidly improved its capability over the last decade. Today
it boasts a spin sensitivity that surpasses conventional, inductive nuclear
magnetic resonance detectors by about eight orders of magnitude. In this review
we touch on the origins of this technique and focus on its recent application
to nanoscale nuclear spin ensembles, in particular on the imaging of nanoscale
objects with a three-dimensional (3D) spatial resolution better than 10 nm. We
consider the experimental advances driving this work and highlight the
underlying physical principles and limitations of the method. Finally, we
discuss the challenges that must be met in order to advance the technique
towards single nuclear spin sensitivity -- and perhaps -- to 3D microscopy of
molecules with atomic resolution.
