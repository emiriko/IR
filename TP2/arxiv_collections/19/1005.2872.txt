Internal symmetries can be used to classify multiple solutions to the time
energy canonical commutation relation (TE-CCR). The dynamical behavior of
solutions to the TE-CCR posessing particular internal symmetries involving time
reversal differ significantly from solutions to the TE-CCR without those
particular symmetries, implying a connection between the internal symmetries of
a quantum system, its internal unitary dynamics, and the TE-CCR.
