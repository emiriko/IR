In this work we study the dynamics of the axisymmetric Bianchi IX
cosmological model with a term of quantum potential added. As it is well known
this class of Bianchi IX models are homogeneous and anisotropic with two scale
factors, $A(t)$ and $B(t)$, derived from the solution of Einstein's equation
for General Relativity. The model we use in this work has a cosmological
constant and the matter content is dust. To this model we add a
quantum-inspired potential that is intended to represent short-range effects
due to the general relativistic behavior of matter in small scales and play the
role of a repulsive force near the singularity. We find that this potential
restricts the dynamics of the model to positive values of $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ and
alters some qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the dynamics
studied previously by several authors. We make a complete analysis of the phase
space of the model finding critical points, periodic orbits, stable/unstable
manifolds using numerical techniques such as Poincar\'e section, numerical
continuation of orbits and numerical globalization of invariant manifolds. We
compare the classical and the quantum models. Our main result is the existence
of homoclinic crossings of the stable and unstable manifolds in the physically
meaningful region of the phase space (where both $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ are
positive), indicating chaotic escape to inflation and bouncing near the
singularity.
