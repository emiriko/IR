One dimensional intermittent maps with stretched exponential separation of
nearby trajectories are considered. When time goes infinity the standard
Lyapunov exponent is zero. We investigate the distribution of
$\lambda_{\alpha}= \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \ln \left| M'(x_i) \right|/t^{\alpha}$,
where $\alpha$ is determined by the nonlinearity of the map in the vicinity of
marginally unstable fixed points. The mean of $\lambda_{\alpha}$ is determined
by the infinite invariant density. Using semi analytical arguments we calculate
the infinite invariant density for the Pomeau-Manneville map, and with it
obtain excellent agreement between numerical simulation and theory. We show
that $\alpha \left< \lambda_{\alpha}\right>$ is equal to Krengel's entropy and
to the complexity calculated by the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm. This
generalized Pesin's identity shows that $\left< \lambda_{\alpha}\right>$ and
Krengel's entropy are the natural generalizations of usual Lyapunov exponent
and entropy for these systems.
