We propose a realizability interpretation of a system for quantifier free
arithmetic which is equivalent to the fragment of classical arithmetic without
"nested" quantifiers, called here EM1-arithmetic. We interpret classical proofs
as interactive learning strategies, namely as processes going through several
stages of knowledge and learning by interacting with the "environment" and with
each other. We give a categorical presentation of the interpretation through
the construction of two suitable monads.
