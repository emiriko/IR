We formulate particle creation phenomena in Bose--Einstein condensates in
terms of conserving gapless mean field theory for weakly interacting Bose
gases. The particle creation spectrum is calculated by rediagonalizing the
Bogoliubov--de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian in mean field theory. The conservation
implies that quasiparticle creation is accompanied by quantum backreaction to
the condensates. Particle creation in this mean field theory is found to be
equivalent to that in quantum field theory (QFT) in curved spacetime. An
expression is obtained for an effective metric affected by quantum
backreaction. The formula for the particle creation spectrum obtained in terms
of QFT in curved spacetime is shown to be the same as that given by
rediagonalizing the BdG Hamiltonian.
