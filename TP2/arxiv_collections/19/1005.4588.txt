We define an infinite series of translation coverings of Veech's double-n-gon
for odd n greater or equal to 5 which share the same Veech group. Additionally
we give an infinite series of translation coverings with constant Veech group
of a regular n-gon for even n greater or equal to 8. These families give rise
to explicit examples of infinite translation surfaces with lattice Veech group.
