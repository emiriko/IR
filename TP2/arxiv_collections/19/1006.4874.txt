We propose using a phonon pumping mechanism to transfer heat from a cold to a
hot body using a propagating modulation of the medium connecting the two
bodies. This phonon pump can cool nanomechanical systems without the need for
active feedback. We compute the lowest temperature that this refrigerator can
achieve.
