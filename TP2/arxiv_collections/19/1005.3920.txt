I study the sunspot area fluctuations over the epoch of 12 solar cycles
(12-23). Lately, I found three significant quasi-periodicities at 10, 17 and 23
solar rotations, but two longer periods could be treated as subharmonics of the
10-rotation period. Thus, I search this period during the low- and the
high-activity periods of each solar cycles. Because of the N-S asymmetry I
consider each solar hemisphere separately. The skewness of each fluctuation
probability distribution suggests that the positive and the negative
fluctuations could be are examined separately. To avoid the problem when a few
strong fluctuations could create an auto-correlation or a wavelet peak, I also
analyse the transformations of fluctuations for which the amplitudes at the
high- and the low-activity periods are almost the same. The auto-correlation
and the wavelet analyses show that the 10-rotation period is mainly detected
during the high-activity periods, but it also exists during a few low-activity
periods.
