More than twenty institutes join the FCAL Collaboration in study of design of
the very forward region of a detector for ILC and CLIC. Of particular
importance is an accurate luminosity measurement to the level of 10-3, a
requirement driven by the potential for precision physics at a future linear
collider. In this paper, the method for luminosity measurement, requirements on
luminometer and its integration in the forward region are presented. The impact
of several effects contributing to the systematic uncertainty of luminosity
measurement is given.
