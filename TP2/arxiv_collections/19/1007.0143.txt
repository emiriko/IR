Matrix interpretations generalize linear polynomial interpretations and have
been proved useful in the implementation of tools for automatically proving
termination of Term Rewriting Systems. In view of the successful use of
rational coefficients in polynomial interpretations, we have recently
generalized traditional matrix interpretations (using natural numbers in the
matrix entries) to incorporate real numbers. However, existing results which
formally prove that polynomials over the reals are more powerful than
polynomials over the naturals for proving termination of rewrite systems failed
to be extended to matrix interpretations. In this paper we get deeper into this
problem. We show that, under some conditions, it is possible to transform a
matrix interpretation over the rationals satisfying a set of symbolic
constraints into a matrix interpretation over the naturals (using bigger
matrices) which still satisfies the constraints.
