We introduce and investigate a family of entanglement-annihilating channels.
These channels are capable of destroying any quantum entanglement within the
system they act on. We show that they are not necessarily entanglement
breaking. In order to achieve this result we analyze the subset of locally
entanglement-annihilating channels. In this case, the same local noise applied
on each subsystem individually is less entanglement annihilating (with respect
to multi-partite entanglement) as the number of subsystems is increasing.
Therefore, the bipartite case provides restrictions on the set of local
entanglement-annihilating channels for the multipartite case. The introduced
concepts are illustrated on the family of single-qubit depolarizing channels.
