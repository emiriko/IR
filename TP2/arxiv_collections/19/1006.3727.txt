Among other things, studies of the formation and evolution of planetary
systems currently draw on two important observational resources: the precise
characterization available for planets that transit their parent stars and the
frequency and nature of systems with multiple planets. Thus far, the study of
transiting exoplanets has focused almost exclusively on systems with only one
planet, except for considering the influence of additional planets on the
transit light curve, mostly through transit timing variations (TTVs). This work
considers systems where multiple planets are seen to transit the same star and
concludes that such "multi-transiting" systems will be the most
information-rich planetary systems besides our own solar system. Five new
candidate multi-transiting systems from \emph{Kepler} have been announced in
Steffen et al. 2010, though these candidates have not yet been fully confirmed
as planets. In anticipation of the likely confirmation of multi-transiting
systems, we discuss the value of these systems in detail. For example, proper
interpretation of transit timing variations is significantly improved in
multi-transiting systems. The true mutual inclination, a valuable probe of
planetary formation, can also be well determined in certain systems, especially
through Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of each planet. In addition, such
systems may undergo predictable and observable mutual events, where one planet
crosses over the other, which allow for unique constraints on various physical
and orbital parameters, particularly the mutual inclination.
