The lecture summarises main results of my team over last five years in the
field of technical experiment design and interpretation of results of
experiments for cell bi-ology. I introduce the theoretical concept of the
experiment, based mainly on ideqas of stochastic systems theory, and confront
it with general ideas of systems theory. In the next part I introduce available
experiments and discuss their information con-tent. Namely, I show that light
microscopy may be designed to give resolution com-parable to that of electron
microscopy and that may be used for experiments using living cells. I show
avenues to objective analysis of cell behavior observation. I pro-pose new
microscope design, which shall combine advantages of all methods, and steps to
be taken to build a model of living cells with predictive power for practical
use
