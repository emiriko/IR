An EPR experiment with polarized entangled photons is performed to test the
Eberhard model. According to the Eberhard model, quantum correlations between
space-like separated events are due to a superluminal communication signal
propagating in a preferred frame. The coincidences between entangled photons
passing through two polarizers aligned along a East-West axis are measured as a
function of time during 21 sidereal days. No deviation from the predictions of
the Quantum Theory is observed. Tacking into account for the experimental
uncertainties, we infer that, if a preferred frame for superluminal signals
exists which moves at velocity \vec{v} with respect to the Earth, the modulus
of the velocity of quantum communications in this frame has to be greater than
v_{t}~0.6*10^4 c for v<0.1 c and for any arbitrary direction of \vec{v}.
