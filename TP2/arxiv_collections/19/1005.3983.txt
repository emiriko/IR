We present the latest advances of the multiscale approach to radiation damage
caused by irradiation of a tissue with energetic ions and report the most
recent advances in the calculations of complex DNA damage and the effects of
thermal spikes on biomolecules. The multiscale approach aims to quantify the
most important physical, chemical, and biological phenomena taking place during
and following irradiation with ions and provide a better means for
clinically-necessary calculations with adequate accuracy. We suggest a way of
quantifying the complex clustered damage, one of the most important features of
the radiation damage caused by ions. This method can be used for the
calculation of irreparable DNA damage. We include thermal spikes, predicted to
occur in tissue for a short time after ion's passage in the vicinity of the
ions' tracks in our previous work, into modeling of the thermal environment for
molecular dynamics analysis of ubiquitin and discuss the first results of these
simulations.
