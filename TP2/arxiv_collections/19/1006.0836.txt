Millimeter wave technology being an emerging area is still very undeveloped.
A substantial research needs to be done in this area as its applications are
numerous. In the present endeavor, a rectangular patch antenna is designed on
thick substrate and simulated using SONNET software, also a novel analysis
technique is developed for circular patch antenna for millimeter wave
frequency. The antenna is designed at 39 GHz on thick substrate and has been
analyzed and simulated.The results of the theoretical analysis are in good
agreement with the simulated results.
