We present a timing solution for the 598.89 Hz accreting millisecond pulsar,
IGR J00291+5934, using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data taken during the two
outbursts exhibited by the source on 2008 August and September. We estimate the
neutron star spin frequency and we refine the system orbital solution. To
achieve the highest possible accuracy in the measurement of the spin frequency
variation experienced by the source in-between the 2008 August outburst and the
last outburst exhibited in 2004, we re-analysed the latter considering the
whole data set available. We find that the source spins down during quiescence
at an average rate of {\nu}dot_{sd}=(-4.1 +/- 1.2)E-15 Hz/s. We discuss
possible scenarios that can account for the long-term neutron star spin-down in
terms of either magneto-dipole emission, emission of gravitational waves, and a
propeller effect. If interpreted in terms of magneto-dipole emission, the
measured spin down translates into an upper limit to the neutron star magnetic
field, B<=3E+08 G, while an upper limit to the average neutron star mass
quadrupole moment of Q<=2E+36 g cm^2 is set if the spin down is interpreted in
terms of the emission of gravitational waves.
