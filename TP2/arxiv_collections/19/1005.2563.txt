Within the framework of the HERM33ES key project, we are studying the star
forming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy M33,
exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of Herschel. We use PACS and
SPIRE maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study the
variation of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with galacto-centric
distance. Detailed SED modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxes
in elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance.
Simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dust
emissivity index, are fitted to the SEDs between 24 and 500 micron using also
MIPS/Spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions.
The far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the branched, knotted spiral
structure of M33. An underlying diffuse disk is seen in all SPIRE maps (250-500
micron). Two component fits to the SEDs agree better than isothermal models
with the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. The two
component model, with beta fixed at 1.5, best fits the global and the radial
SEDs. The cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warm
component is less than 0.3% for all the fits. The temperature of the warm
component is not well constrained and is found to be about 60K plus/minus 10K.
The temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24K in the
inner 2 kpc radius to 13K beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fitting
model. The gas-to-dust ratio for beta=1.5, averaged over the galaxy, is higher
than the solar value by a factor of 1.5 and is roughly in agreement with the
subsolar metallicity of M33.
