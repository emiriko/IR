We have measured the running coupling constant of SU(3) gauge theory coupled
to Nf=2 flavors of symmetric representation fermions, using the Schrodinger
functional scheme. Our lattice action is defined with hypercubic smeared links
which, along with the larger lattice sizes, bring us closer to the continuum
limit than in our previous study. We observe that the coupling runs more slowly
than predicted by asymptotic freedom, but we are unable to observe fixed point
behavior before encountering a first order transition to a strong coupling
phase. This indicates that the infrared fixed point found with the thin-link
action is a lattice artifact. The slow running of the gauge coupling permits an
accurate determination of the mass anomalous dimension for this theory, which
we observe to be small, gamma_m < 0.6, over the range of couplings we can
reach. We also study the bulk and finite-temperature phase transitions in the
strong coupling region.
