We present a solution to the problem of broadband decoupling of a coupled
homonuclear two-spin system. We describe a pulse sequence that creates an
effective field perpendicular to the coupling interaction with a magnitude
propotional to the chemical shift of the spins over a broad range of chemical
shifts. When the chemical shift difference as imprinted on the perpendicular
field is greater than the coupling between the spins, we get effective
decoupling. The pulse sequence may be useful in various NMR applications.
