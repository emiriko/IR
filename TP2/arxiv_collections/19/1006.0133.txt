We perform a detailed analysis of baryon asymmetry generation in the NuMSM
(an extension of the Standard Model by three singlet Majorana fermions with
masses below the Fermi scale). Fixing a number of parameters of the NuMSM by
the neutrino oscillation data, we determine the remaining domain of the
parameter space from the requirement of successful baryogenesis. We derive, in
particular, the constraints on the mass splitting of a pair of singlet
fermions, and on the strength of their coupling to ordinary leptons, essential
for searches of these particles in rare decays of mesons and in beam-dump
experiments with intensive proton beams.
