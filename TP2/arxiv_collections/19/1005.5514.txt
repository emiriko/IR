In this paper we deal with the notion of semantic loss in Peer Data
Management Systems (PDMS) queries. We define such a notion and we give a
mechanism that discovers semantic loss in a PDMS network. Next, we propose an
algorithm that addresses the problem of restoring such a loss. Further
evaluation of our proposed algorithm is an ongoing work
