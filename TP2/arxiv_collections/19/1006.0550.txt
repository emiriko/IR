Quantum escapes of two particles with Coulomb interactions from a confined
one-dimensional region to a semi-infinite lead are discussed by the probability
of particles remaining in the confined region, i.e. the survival probability,
in comparison with one or two free particles. For free-particle systems the
survival probability decays asymptotically in power as a function of time. On
the other hand, for two-particle systems with Coulomb interactions it shows an
exponential decay in time. A difference of escape behaviors between Bosons and
Fermions is considered as quantum effects of identical two particles such as
the Pauli exclusion principle. The exponential decay in the survival
probability of interacting two particles is also discussed in a viewpoint of
quantum chaos based on a distribution of energy level spacings.
