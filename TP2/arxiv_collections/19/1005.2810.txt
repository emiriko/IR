In the solid-state circuit QED system and based on the homodyne measurement
in dispersive regime, we demonstrate that a homodyne-current-based feedback can
create and stabilize highly entangled two-qubit states in the presence of
moderate noisy environment. Particularly, we present an extended analysis for
the current-based Markovian feedback, which leads to an improved
filtered-current-based feedback scheme. We show that this is essential for us
to achieve the desirable control effect in present system.
