A series of kinetic phenomena in metallic multilayers has been considered.
The kinetic properties of multilayers differ essentially from the properties of
both massive metals and thin films. One of the main reasons of that is the
influence of electron interaction of electrons with interfaces between layers.
From one hand, this interaction leads to the additional electron scattering and
conductivity of multilayer may be noticeably less than specific conductivities
of composing metals. From the other hand, the electron reflection from
interfaces in a strong magnetic field may results in considerable increasing of
conducting properties in consequence of the static skin effect. Due to changing
of electron trajectories after collisions with interfaces new types of periodic
motion in the magnetic field and therefore new size and resonance phenomena in
high frequency fields appear. In thin normal layers on the superconducting
substrate, changing of trajectories is due to Andreev reflection and resonance
effects, which do not exist in normal multilayers, films, and bulk
monocrystals, take place. In multilayers consisting of ferromagnetic and
nonmagnetic metals, the internal magnetic field in ferromagnetic layers must be
taken into account, if the Larmor radius in this field is comparable with the
layer thickness. Because of the mutual diffusion of metals, the kinetic
coefficients of multilayers are changed in time. The investigation of this
changing may be used for determination of diffusion coefficient for the bulk
and grain-boundary diffusion. The effects, which have been analyzed
theoretically in this review, can be used for the obtaining information on the
electron interaction with interfaces in conducting multilayers.
