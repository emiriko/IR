We derive exact matrix integral representations for different sums over
partitions. The characteristic feature of all obtained matrix models is the
presence of logarithmic (or, vice versa, exponential) terms in the potential.
Our derivation is based on the application of the higher Casimir operators. The
Toda lattice integrability of the basic sums over partitions can be easily
derived from the matrix model representation.
