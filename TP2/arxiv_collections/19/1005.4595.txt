Magnetic properties of CoMnGe thin films of different thicknesses (13, 34,
55, 83, 100 and 200 nm), grown by RF sputtering at 400{\deg}C on single crystal
sapphire substrates, were studied using vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and
conventional or micro-strip line (MS) ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). Their
behavior is described assuming a magnetic energy density showing twofold and
fourfold in-plane anisotropies with some misalignment between their principal
directions. For all the samples, the easy axis of the fourfold anisotropy is
parallel to the c-axis of the substrate while the direction of the twofold
anisotropy easy axis varies from sample to sample and seems to be strongly
influenced by the growth conditions. Its direction is most probably monitored
by the slight unavoidable angle of miscut the Al2O3 substrate. The twofold
in-plane anisotropy field is almost temperature independent, in contrast with
the fourfold field which is a decreasing function of the temperature. Finally,
we study the frequency dependence of the observed line-width of the resonant
mode and we conclude to a typical Gilbert damping constant of 0.0065 for the
55-nm-thick film.
