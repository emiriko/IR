In evolutionary dynamics, the probability that a mutation spreads through the
whole population, having arisen in a single individual, is known as the
fixation probability. In general, it is not possible to find the fixation
probability analytically given the mutant's fitness and the topological
constraints that govern the spread of the mutation, so one resorts to
simulations instead. Depending on the topology in use, a great number of
evolutionary steps may be needed in each of the simulation events, particularly
in those that end with the population containing mutants only. We introduce two
techniques to accelerate the determination of the fixation probability. The
first one skips all evolutionary steps in which the number of mutants does not
change and thereby reduces the number of steps per simulation event
considerably. This technique is computationally advantageous for some of the
so-called layered networks. The second technique, which is not restricted to
layered networks, consists of aborting any simulation event in which the number
of mutants has grown beyond a certain threshold value, and counting that event
as having led to a total spread of the mutation. For large populations, and
regardless of the network's topology, we demonstrate, both analytically and by
means of simulations, that using a threshold of about 100 mutants leads to an
estimate of the fixation probability that deviates in no significant way from
that obtained from the full-fledged simulations. We have observed speedups of
two orders of magnitude for layered networks with 10000 nodes.
