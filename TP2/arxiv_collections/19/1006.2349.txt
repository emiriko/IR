It is shown that, in the self-consistent quantum statistical Hartree-Fock
approximation, the number of electronic states localized on one nucleus is
finite. This result is obtained on the basis of the general electron-nuclear
model of matter and provides convergence of the atomic statistical sum and
finiteness of the "atom" size. In general approach the characteristic size of
the "atom" is a function of density and temperature. However, it is shown, that
in a wide range of thermodynamic parameters, for relatively low temperatures,
characteristic orbits and electron energy eigenvalues are independent of
density and temperature. In this case, the sizes of the orbits are of order of
the Bohr radius which is a minimal characteristic size in the system for
typical parameters of plasma with atomic states.
