Formal mathematics has so far not taken full advantage of ideas from
collaborative tools such as wikis and distributed version control systems
(DVCS). We argue that the field could profit from such tools, serving both
newcomers and experts alike. We describe a preliminary system for such
collaborative development based on the Git DVCS. We focus, initially, on the
Mizar system and its library of formalized mathematics.
