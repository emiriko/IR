Kinematic fitting is an important tool to improve the resolution in
high-energy physics experiments. At future e+e- colliders, photon radiation
parallel to the beam carrying away large amounts of energy and momentum will
become a challenge for kinematic fitting. A photon with longitudinal momentum
pz({\eta}) is introduced, which is parametrized such that {\eta} follows a
normal distribution. In the fit, {\eta} is treated as having a measured value
of zero, which corresponds to pz = 0. As a result, fits with constraints on
energy and momentum conservation converge well even in the presence of a highly
energetic photon, while the resolution of fits without such a photon is
retained. A fully simulated and reconstructed e+e- -> qqqq event sample at
sqrt(s) = 500 GeV is used to investigate the performance of this method under
realistic conditions, as expected at the International Linear Collider.
