We present a novel scheme to generate entanglement between two spatially
separated systems. The scheme makes use of spatial entanglement generated by a
single-particle quantum walk which is used to entangle two spatially separated,
not necessarily correlated, systems. This scheme can be used to entangle any
two systems which can interact with the spatial modes entangled during the
quantum walk evolution. A notable feature is that we can control the quantum
walk dynamics and its ability to localize leads to a substantial control and
improvement in the entanglement output.
