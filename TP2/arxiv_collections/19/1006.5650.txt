Rotating spiral and scroll waves (vortices) are investigated in the
FitzHugh-Nagumo model of excitable media. The focus is on a parameter region in
which there exists bistability between alternative stable vortices with
distinct periods. Response Functions are used to predict the filament tension
of the alternative scrolls and it is shown that the slow-period scroll has
negative filament tension, while the filament tension of the fast-period scroll
changes sign within a hysteresis loop. The predictions are confirmed by direct
simulations. Further investigations show that the slow-period scrolls display
features similar to delayed after-depolarisation (DAD) and tend to develop into
turbulence similar to Ventricular Fibrillation (VF). Scrolls with positive
filament tension collapse or stabilize, similar to monomorphic Ventricular
Tachycardia (VT). Perturbations, such as boundary interaction or shock
stimulus, can convert the vortex with negative filament tension into the vortex
with positive filament tension. This may correspond to transition from VF to VT
unrelated to pinning.
