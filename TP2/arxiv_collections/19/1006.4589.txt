The left-right twin Higgs(LRTH) model predicts the existence of three
additional Higgs bosons: one neutral Higgs $\phi^{0}$ and a pair of charged
Higgs bosons $\phi^{\pm}$. In this paper, we studied the production of a pair
of charged and neutral Higgs bosons associated with standard model gauge boson
$Z$ at the ILC, i.e., $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow Z\phi^{+}\phi^{-}$ and
$e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow Z\phi^{0}\phi^{0}$. We calculate the production rate and
present the distributions of the various observables, such as, the
distributions of the energy and the transverse momenta of final $Z$-boson and
charged Higgs boson $\phi^{-}$, the differential cross section of the invariant
mass of charged Higgs bosons pair, the distribution of the angle between
charged Higgs bosons pair and the production angle distributions of $Z$-boson
and charged Higgs boson $\phi^{-}$. Our numerical results show that, for the
process $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow Z\phi^{+}\phi^{-}$, the production rates are at
the level of $10^{-1} fb$ with reasonable parameter values. For the process of
$e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow Z\phi^{0}\phi^{0}$, we find that the production cross
section are smaller than $6\times 10^{-3} fb$ in most of parameter space.
However, the resonance production cross section can be significantly enhanced.
