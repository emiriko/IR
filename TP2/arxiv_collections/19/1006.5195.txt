The XPM-1.0 is the regular version of the XPM catalogue. In comparison with
XPM the astrometric catalogue of about 280 millions stars covering entire sky
from -90 to +90 degrees in declination and in the magnitude range 10^m<B<22^m
is something improved. The general procedure steps were followed as for XPM,
but some of them are now performed on a more sophisticated level. The XPM-1.0
catalogue contains star positions, proper motions, 2MASS and USNO photometry of
about 280 millions of the sources. We present some investigations of the
absolute proper motions of XPM-1.0 catalogue and also the important information
for the users of the catalogue. Unlike previous version, the XPM-1.0 contains
the proper motions over the whole sky without gaps. In the fields, which cover
the zone of avoidance or which contain less than of 25 galaxies a quasi
absolute calibration was performed. The proper motion errors are varying from 3
to 10 mas/yr, depending on a specific field. The zero-point of the absolute
proper motion frame (the absolute calibration) was specified with more than 1
million galaxies from 2MASS and USNO-A2.0. The mean formal error of absolute
calibration is less than 1 mas/yr.
