Stability and attractor property of free-floating axisymmetric magnetic
bubbles in high-conductivity plasmas is (tentatively, numerically)
demonstrated. The existence of compact non-singular axisymmetric magnetic
equilibria is proved. Being attractors, the solitary magnetic bubbles should
exist in nature.
