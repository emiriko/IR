A Holevo measure is used to discuss how much information about a given POVM
on system $a$ is present in another system $b$, and how this influences the
presence or absence of information about a different POVM on $a$ in a third
system $c$. The main goal is to extend information theorems for mutually
unbiased bases or general bases to arbitrary POVMs, and especially to
generalize "all-or-nothing" theorems about information located in tripartite
systems to the case of \emph{partial information}, in the form of quantitative
inequalities. Some of the inequalities can be viewed as entropic uncertainty
relations that apply in the presence of quantum side information, as in recent
work by Berta et al. [Nature Physics 6, 659 (2010)]. All of the results also
apply to quantum channels: e.g., if $\EC$ accurately transmits certain POVMs,
the complementary channel $\FC$ will necessarily be noisy for certain other
POVMs. While the inequalities are valid for mixed states of tripartite systems,
restricting to pure states leads to the basis-invariance of the difference
between the information about $a$ contained in $b$ and $c$.
