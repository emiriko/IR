We show that almost all the linear differential operators factors obtained in
the analysis of the n-particle contribution of the susceptibility of the Ising
model for $\, n \le 6$, are operators "associated with elliptic curves". Beyond
the simplest factors which are homomorphic to symmetric powers of the second
order operator associated with the complete elliptic integral E, the second and
third order differential operators can actually be interpreted as modular forms
of the elliptic curve of the Ising model. A last order-four globally nilpotent
operator is not reducible to this elliptic curve, modular forms scheme. It is
shown to actually correspond to a natural generalization of this elliptic
curve, modular forms scheme, with the emergence of a Calabi-Yau equation,
corresponding to a selected $_4F_3$ hypergeometric function which can also be
seen as a Hadamard product of the complete elliptic integral K, with a
remarkably simple algebraic pull-back, the corresponding Calabi-Yau
fourth-order differential operator having a symplectic differential Galois
group SP(4,C). The associated mirror maps and higher order Schwarzian ODEs has
an exact (isogenies) representation of the generators of the renormalization
group, extending the modular group SL(2,Z) to a GL(2, Z) symmetry group.
