We present a new C++ code for collisional N-body simulations of star
clusters. The code uses the Hermite fourth-order scheme with block time steps,
for advancing the particles in time, while the forces and neighboring particles
are computed using the GRAPE-6 board. Special treatment is used for close
encounters, binary and multiple sub-systems that either form dynamically or
exist in the initial configuration. The structure of the code is modular and
allows the appropriate treatment of more physical phenomena, such as stellar
and binary evolution, stellar collisions and evolution of close black-hole
binaries. Moreover, it can be easily modified so that the part of the code that
uses GRAPE-6, could be replaced by another module that uses other
accelerating-hardware like the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Appropriate
choice of the free parameters give a good accuracy and speed for simulations of
star clusters up to and beyond core collapse. Simulations of Plummer models
consisting of equal-mass stars reached core collapse at t~17 half-mass
relaxation times, which compares very well with existing results, while the
cumulative relative error in the energy remained below 0.001. Also, comparisons
with published results of other codes for the time of core collapse for
different initial conditions, show excellent agreement. Simulations of King
models with an initial mass-function, similar to those found in the literature,
reached core collapse at t~0.17, which is slightly smaller than the expected
result from previous works. Finally, the code accuracy becomes comparable and
even better than the accuracy of existing codes, when a number of close binary
systems is dynamically created in a simulation. This is due to the high
accuracy of the method that is used for close binary and multiple sub-systems.
