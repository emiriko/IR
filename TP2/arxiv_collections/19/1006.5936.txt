Measurements of the 2.7 K cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation now
provide the most stringent constraints on cosmological models. The power
spectra of the temperature anisotropies and the $E$-mode polarization of the
CMB are explained well by the inflationary paradigm. The next generation of CMB
experiments aim at providing the most direct evidence for inflation through the
detection of $B$-modes in the CMB polarization, presumed to have been caused by
gravitational waves generated during the inflationary epoch around $10^{-34}$s.
The $B$-mode polarization signals are very small ($\leq$10$^{-8}$K) compared
with the temperature anisotropies ($\sim 10^{-4}$K). Systematic effects in CMB
telescopes can cause leakage from temperature anisotropy into polarization.
Bolometric interferometry (BI) is a novel approach to measuring this small
signal with lower leakage. If BI can be made to work over wide bandwidth
($\sim20-30\%$) it can provide similar sensitivity to imagers. Subdividing the
frequency passband of a Fizeau interferometer would mitigate the problem of
`fringe smearing.' Furthermore, the approach should allow simultaneous
measurements in image space and visibility space. For subdividing the frequency
passsband (`sub-band splitting' henceforth), we write an expression for the
output from every baseline at every detector in the focal plane as a sum of
visibilities in different frequency sub-bands. For operating the interferometer
simultaneously as an imager, we write the output as two integrals over the sky
and the focal plane, with all the phase differences accounted for.}{The
sub-band splitting method described here is general and can be applied to
broad-band Fizeau interferometers across the electromagnetic spectrum.
Applications to CMB measurements and to long-baseline optical interferometry
are promising.
