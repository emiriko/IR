Even if never elucidated, the question of determinism is a standing question
along the history of human thinking. A physical system evolves in a
deterministic way if its future is completely determined once we have fixed
some present characteristics of it, i.e., its initial conditions. The problem
addressed in the present paper is to test determinism in the macroscopic
domain. By imposing a very plausible ``separability'' assumption, we prove that
determinism enters in contradiction with the recorded outcomes of a given
electrocardiogram. The interest of this result comes from the fact such a basic
idea as determinism has never been experimentally tested up to now in the
macroscopic domain, and as far as we know not even in the quantum domain.
