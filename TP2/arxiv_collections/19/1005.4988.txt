In this paper, we examine the validity of the generalized second law of
thermodynamics (GSLT) of the universe bounded by the event horizon in
brane-world gravity. Here we consider homogeneous and isotropic model of the
universe filled with perfect fluid in one case and in another case holographic
dark energy model of the universe has been considered. The conclusions are
presented point wise.
