Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies were performed on
two compounds (TlBiTe$_2$ and TlBiSe$_2$) from a recently proposed three
dimensional topological insulator family in Thallium-based III-V-VI$_2$ ternary
chalcogenides. For both materials, we show that the electronic band structures
are in broad agreement with the $ab$ $initio$ calculations; by surveying over
the entire surface Brillouin zone (BZ), we demonstrate that there is a single
Dirac cone reside at the center of BZ, indicating its topological
non-triviality. For TlBiSe$_2$, the observed Dirac point resides at the top of
the bulk valance band, making it a large gap ($\geq$200$meV$) topological
insulator; while for TlBiTe$_2$, we found there exist a negative indirect gap
between the bulk conduction band at $M$ point and the bulk valance band near
$\Gamma$, making it a semi-metal at proper doping. Interestingly, the unique
band structures of TlBiTe$_2$ we observed further suggest TlBiTe$_2$ may be a
candidate for topological superconductors.
