We propose a resonant microwave absorber based on a chiral metamaterial. We
show, with both numerical simulations and experimental measurements, that the
absorber works well for a very wide range of incident angles for different
polarizations. The proposed absorber has a compact size and the absorption is
close to one for a wide range of incident angles and it is a good candidate for
potential applications.
