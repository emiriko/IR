Cellular energy production depends on electron transfer (ET) between
proteins. In this theoretical study, we investigate the impact of structural
and conformational variations on the electronic coupling between the redox
proteins methylamine dehydrogenase and amicyanin from Paracoccus denitrificans.
We used molecular dynamics simulations to generate configurations over a
duration of 40ns (sampled at 100fs intervals) in conjunction with an ET pathway
analysis to estimate the ET coupling strength of each configuration. In the
wild type complex, we find that the most frequently occurring molecular
configurations afford superior electronic coupling due to the consistent
presence of a water molecule hydrogen-bonded between the donor and acceptor
sites. We attribute the persistence of this water bridge to a "molecular
breakwater" composed of several hydrophobic residues surrounding the acceptor
site. The breakwater supports the function of nearby solvent-organizing
residues by limiting the exchange of water molecules between the sterically
constrained ET region and the more turbulent surrounding bulk. When the
breakwater is affected by a mutation, bulk solvent molecules disrupt the water
bridge, resulting in reduced electronic coupling that is consistent with recent
experimental findings. Our analysis suggests that, in addition to enabling the
association and docking of the proteins, surface residues stabilize and control
interprotein solvent dynamics in a concerted way.
