We believe that to fully support adaptive distributed applications,
middleware must itself be adaptable, adaptive and policy-free. In this paper we
present a new language-independent adaptable and adaptive policy framework
suitable for integration in a wide variety of middleware systems. This
framework facilitates the construction of adaptive distributed applications.
The framework addresses adaptability through its ability to represent a wide
range of specific middleware policies. Adaptiveness is supported by a rich
contextual model, through which an application programmer may control precisely
how policies should be selected for any particular interaction with the
middleware. A contextual pattern mechanism facilitates the succinct expression
of both coarse- and fine-grain policy contexts. Policies may be specified and
altered dynamically, and may themselves take account of dynamic conditions. The
framework contains no hard-wired policies; instead, all policies can be
configured.
