Harmonically trapped ultra-cold atoms and helium-4 in nanopores provide new
experimental realizations of bosons in one dimension, motivating the search for
a more complete theoretical understanding of their low energy properties. Worm
algorithm path integral quantum Monte Carlo results for interacting bosons
restricted to the one dimensional continuum are compared to the finite
temperature and system size predictions of Luttinger liquid theory. For large
system sizes at low temperature, excellent agreement is obtained after
including the leading irrelevant interactions in the Hamiltonian which are
determined explicitly.
