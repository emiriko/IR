The formalism of Fantappie-Arcidiacono Projective General Relativity - also
known as De Sitter Relativity - has recently been revised in order to make
possible cosmological models with expansion, similarly to ordinary Fridman
cosmology formulated within the context of General Relativity. In this article,
several consequences of interest in the current cosmological debate are
examined and discussed in a semiquantitative manner. Specifically:
re-examination of the Supernova Project results using this new formalism, with
a new estimate of the cosmological parameters; the ordinary matter to dark
matter densities ratio; the existence of a new fundamental constant having the
dimensions of an acceleration and its relation with dark matter.
