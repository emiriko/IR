Hybrid quantum systems made of cold atoms near nanostructured surfaces are
expected to open up new opportunities for the construction of quantum sensors
and for quantum information. For the design of such tailored quantum systems
the interaction of alkali atoms with dielectric and metallic surfaces is
crucial and required to be understood in detail. Here, we present real-time
measurements of the adsorption and desorption of Rubidium atoms on gold
nanofilms. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) are excited at the gold surface and
detected in a phase sensitive way. From the temporal change of the SPP phase
the Rubidium coverage of the gold film is deduced with a sensitivity of better
than 0.3 % of a monolayer. By comparing the experimental data with a Langmuir
type adsorption model we obtain the thermal desorption rate and the sticking
probability. In addition, also laser-induced desorption is observed and
quantified.
