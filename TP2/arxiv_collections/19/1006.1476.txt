An innovatory interaction region has been recently conceived and realized on
the Frascati DA{\Phi}NE lepton collider. The concept of tight focusing and
small crossing angle adopted until now to achieve high luminosity in multibunch
collisions has evolved towards enhanced beam focusing at the interaction point
with large horizontal crossing angle, thanks to a new compensation mechanism
for the beam-beam resonances. The novel configuration has been tested with a
small detector without solenoidal field yielding a remarkable improvement in
terms of peak as well as integrated luminosity. The high luminosity interaction
region has now been modified to host a large detector with a strong solenoidal
field which significantly perturbs the beam optics introducing new design
challenges in terms of interaction region optics design, beam transverse
coupling control and beam stay clear requirements
