I present results for the two-loop soft anomalous dimensions for associated
production of a single top quark with a W boson or a charged Higgs boson. The
calculation uses expressions for the massive cusp anomalous dimension, which
are presented in different forms, and it allows soft-gluon resummation at
next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) accuracy. From the NNLL resummed cross
section I derive approximate NNLO cross sections for bg -> tW- and bg -> tH- at
LHC energies of 7, 10, and 14 TeV.
