This is an introduction to theories where the Higgs is a composite
Nambu-Goldstone boson of a new strongly-interacting dynamics not much above the
weak scale. A general discussion is presented based on the pattern of global
symmetries at low energy, and the analogy with the QCD pion is analyzed. The
last part of the lectures shows how a composite Higgs can emerge as the
hologram of a 5-dimensional gauge field.
