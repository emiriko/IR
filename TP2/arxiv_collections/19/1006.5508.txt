In this paper we consider the contribution of the anomalous magnetic moments
of protons and neutrons to the nuclear charge density. We show that the
spin-orbit contribution to the mean-square charge radius, which has been
neglected in recent nuclear calculations, can be important in light halonuclei.
We estimate the size of the effect in helium, lithium, and beryllium nuclei. It
is found that the spin-orbit contribution represents a ~2% correction to the
charge density at the center of the Be-7 nucleus. We derive a simple expression
for the correction to the mean-square charge radius due to the spin-orbit term
and find that in light halonuclei it may be larger than the Darwin-Foldy term
and comparable to finite size corrections. A comparison of experimental and
theoretical mean-square radii including the spin-orbit contribution is
presented.
