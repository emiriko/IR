An accident is unexpected, unusual, unintended and identifiable external
event which occurs at any place and at any time. The major concern faced by the
government and traffic officials is over speeding at limited speed zones like
hospitals, schools or residential places leading to causalities and more deaths
on the roads. Hence the speed of the vehicles is to be regulated and confined
to the limits as prescribed by the traffic regulations. In this paper we
propose a solution in the form of providing E-speed governor fitted with a
wireless communication system consisting of a Rx which receives the information
regarding the speed regulation for their zones. The TX will be made highly
intelligent and decide when receiver should be made active to regulate the
speed and unwarranted honking from the vehicles which can be deactivated in the
silent zones.
