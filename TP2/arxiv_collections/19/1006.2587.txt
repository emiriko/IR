Interest in pupil-remapping interferometry, in which a single telescope pupil
is fragmented and recombined using fiber optic technologies, has been growing
among a number of groups. As a logical extrapolation from several highly
successful aperture masking programs underway worldwide, pupil remapping offers
the advantage of spatial filtering (with single-mode fibers) and in principle
can avoid the penalty of low throughput inherent to an aperture mask. However
in practice, pupil remapping presents a number of difficult technological
challenges including injection into the fibers, pathlength matching of the
device, and stability and reproducibility of the results. Here we present new
approaches based on recently-available photonic technologies in which coherent
three-dimensional waveguide structures can be sculpted into bulk substrate.
These advances allow us to miniaturize the photonic processing into a single,
robust, thermally stable element; ideal for demanding observatory or spacecraft
environments. Ultimately, a wide range of optical functionality could be
routinely fabricated into such structures, including beam combiners and
dispersive or wavelength selective elements, bringing us closer to the vision
of an interferometer on a chip.
