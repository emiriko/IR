Motivated by recent proposals on strain-engineering of graphene electronic
circuits we calculate conductivity, shot-noise and the density of states in
periodically deformed graphene. We provide the solution to the
Dirac-Kronig-Penney model, which describes the phase-coherent transport in
clean monolayer samples with an one-dimensional modulation of the strain and
the electrostatic potentials. We compare the exact results to a qualitative
band-structure analysis. We find that periodic strains induce large pseudo-gaps
and suppress charge transport in the direction of strain modulation. The
strain-induced minima in the gate-voltage dependence of the conductivity
characterize the quality of graphene superstructures. The effect is especially
strong if the variation of inter-atomic distance exceeds the value a^2/l, where
a is the lattice spacing of free graphene and l is the period of the
superlattice. A similar effect induced by a periodic electrostatic potential is
weakened due to Klein tunnelling.
