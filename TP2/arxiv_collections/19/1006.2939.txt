We study the radiative pion decay of $\pi ^{+} \to e^{+}\nu_{e}\gamma$ in the
chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and light front quark model (LFQM). The
vector and axial-vector hadronic form factors ($F_{V,A}$) for the
$\pi\to\gamma$ transition are evaluated in the whole allowed momentum transfer.
In terms of these momentum dependent form factors, we calculate the decay
branching ratio and compare our results with the experimental data and other
theoretical predictions in the literature. We also constrain the possible size
of the tensor interaction in the LFQM.
