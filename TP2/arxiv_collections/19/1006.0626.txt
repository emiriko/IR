I consider the problem of self-oscillatory systems undergoing a homogeneous
Hopf bifurcation when they are submitted to an external forcing that is
periodic in time, at a frequency close to the system's natural frequency (1:1
resonance), and whose amplitude is slowly modulated in space. Starting from a
general, unspecified model and making use of standard multiple scales analysis,
I show that the close-to-threshold dynamics of such systems is universally
governed by a generalized, complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation. The nature
of the generalization depends on the strength and of other features of forcing:
(i) For generic, sufficiently weak forcings the CGL equation contains an extra,
inhomogeneous term proportional to the complex amplitude of forcing, as in the
usual 1:1 resonance with spatially uniform forcing; (ii) For stronger
perturbations, whose amplitude sign alternates across the system, the CGL
equation contains a term proportional to the complex conjugate of the
oscillations envelope, like in the classical 2:1 resonance, responsible for the
emergence of phase bistability and of phase bistable patterns in the system.
Finally I show that case (ii) is retrieved from case (i) in the appropriate
limit so that the latter can be regarded as the generic model for the
close-to-threshold dynamics of the type of systems considered here. The kind of
forcing studied in this work thus represents an alternative to the classical
parametric forcing at twice the natural frequency of oscillations and opens the
way to new forms of pattern formation control in self-oscillatory systems, what
is especially relevant in the case of systems that are quite insensitive to
parametric forcing, such as lasers and other nonlinear optical cavities.
