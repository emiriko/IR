We report a series of complex (dusty) plasma experiments, aimed at the study
of the detailed time evolution of the re-crystallisation process following a
rapid quench of a two dimensional dust liquid. The experiments were accompanied
by large-scale (million particle) molecular dynamics simulations, assuming
Yukawa type inter-particle interaction. Both experiment and simulation show a
$\propto t^\alpha$ (power law) dependence of the linear crystallite domain size
as measured by the bond-order correlation length, translational correlation
length, dislocation (defect) density, and a direct size measurement algorithm.
The results show two stages of order formation: on short time-scales individual
particle motion dominates; this is a fast process characterized by
$\alpha=0.93\pm0.1$. At longer time-scales, small crystallites undergo
collective rearrangement, merging into bigger ones, resulting in a smaller
exponent $\alpha=0.38\pm0.06$.
