We prove some invariance principles for processes which generalize FARIMA
processes, when the innovations are in the domain of attraction of a
nonGaussian stable distribution. The limiting processes are extensions of the
fractional L\'evy processes. The technique used is interesting in itself; it
extends an older idea of splitting a sample into a central part and an extreme
one, analyzing each part with different techniques, and then combining the
results. This technique seems to have the potential to be useful in other
problems in the domain of nonGaussian stable distributions.
