The masses of the $D_s(0^\pm)$ mesons are investigated from a view-point of
ordinary light-heavy system in the framework of the Gaussian sum rules, which
are worked out by means of the Laplacian transformation to the usual Borel sum
rules. Using the standard input of QCD non-perturbative parameters, the
corresponding mass spectra and couplings of the currents to the $D_s(0^\pm)$
mesons are obtained. Our results are $m_{D_s(0^-)}=1.968\pm0.016\pm0.003$ GeV
and $m_{D_s(0^+)}=2.320\pm0.014\pm0.003$ GeV, which are in accordance well with
the experimental data, 1.969 GeV and 2.317 GeV.
