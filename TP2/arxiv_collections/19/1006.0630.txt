Measurements of single electron tunneling through a quantum dot using a
quantum point contact as charge detector have been performed for very long time
traces with very large event counts. This large statistical basis is used for a
detailed examination of the counting statistics for varying symmetry of the
quantum dot system. From the measured statistics we extract high order
cumulants describing the distribution. Oscillations of the high order cumulants
are observed when varying the symmetry. We compare this behavior to the
observed oscillation in time dependence and show that the variation of both
system variables lead to the same kind of oscillating response.
