In the Standard Model the hypercharges of quarks and leptons are not
determined by the gauge group $SU(3)_{\rm c} \times SU(2)_{\rm L} \times
U(1)_{\rm Y}$ alone. We show that, if we choose the semidirect product group
$[SU(3)_{\rm c} \times SU(2)_{\rm L}] \rtimes U(1)_{\rm Y}$ as its gauge group,
the hyperchages are settled to be $n/6 \mod {\mathbb{Z}}\;(n = 0,1,3,4) $. In
addition, the conditions for gauge-anomaly cancellation give strong
constraints. As a result, the ratios of the hypercharges are uniquely
determined and the gravitational anomaly is automatically canceled. The
standard charge assignment to quarks and leptons can be properly reproduced.
For exotic matter fields their hypercharges are also discussed.
