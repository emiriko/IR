Electromechanical resonators are a key element in radio-frequency
telecommunications devices and thus new resonator concepts from nanotechnology
can readily find important industrial opportunities. In this paper, we report
the successful experimental realization of AM, FM and digital demodulation with
suspended single wall carbon nanotube resonators in the field effect transistor
configuration. The crucial role played by the mechanical resonance in
demodulation is clearly demonstrated. The FM technique is shown to lead to the
suppression of unwanted background signals and the reduction of noise for a
better detection of the mechanical motion of nanotubes. The digital data
transfer rate of standard cell phone technology is within the reach of our
devices.
