We present a preliminary analysis of the small-scale structure found in new
70-520 micron continuum maps of the Rosette molecular cloud (RMC), obtained
with the SPIRE and PACS instruments of the Herschel Space Observatory. We find
473 clumps within the RMC using a new structure identification algorithm, with
sizes up to ~1.0 pc in diameter. A comparison with recent Spitzer maps reveals
that 371 clumps are "starless" (without an associated young stellar object),
while 102 are "protostellar." Using the respective values of dust temperature,
we determine the clumps have masses (M_C) over the range -0.75 <= log
(M_C/M_sun) <= 2.50. Linear fits to the high-mass tails of the resulting clump
mass spectra (CMS) have slopes that are consistent with those found for
high-mass clumps identified in CO emission by other groups.
