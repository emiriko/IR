We study an SU(3)^2 axigluon model introduced by Frampton, Shu, and Wang to
explain the recent Fermilab Tevatron observation of a significant positive
enhancement in the top quark forward-backward asymmetry relative to standard
model predictions. First, we demonstrate that data on neutral B_d-meson mixing
excludes the region of model parameter space where the top asymmetry is
predicted to be the largest. Keeping the gauge couplings below the critical
value that would lead to fermion condensation imposes further limits at large
axigluon mass, while precision electroweak constraints on the model are
relatively mild. Furthermore, by considering an extension to an SU(3)^3 color
group, we demonstrate that embedding the model in an extra-dimensional
framework can only dilute the axigluon effect on the forward-backward
asymmetry. We conclude that axigluon models are unlikely to be the source of
the observed top quark asymmetry.
