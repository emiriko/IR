In this paper we have analyzed the temporal and spectral behavior of 52 Fast
Rise and Exponential Decay (FRED) pulses in 48 long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) observed by the CGRO/BATSE, using a pulse model with two shape
parameters and the Band model with three shape parameters, respectively. It is
found that these FRED pulses are distinguished both temporally and spectrally
from those in long-lag pulses. Different from these long-lag pulses only one
parameter pair indicates an evident correlation among the five parameters,
which suggests that at least $\sim$4 parameters are needed to model burst
temporal and spectral behavior. In addition, our studies reveal that these FRED
pulses have correlated properties: (i) long-duration pulses have harder spectra
and are less luminous than short-duration pulses; (ii) the more asymmetric the
pulses are the steeper the evolutionary curves of the peak energy ($E_{p}$) in
the $\nu f_{\nu}$ spectrum within pulse decay phase are. Our statistical
results give some constrains on the current GRB models.
