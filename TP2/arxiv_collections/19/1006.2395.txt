We investigate the instabilities of the Mott-insulating phase of the weakly
disordered Bose-Hubbard model within a renormalization group analysis of the
replica field theory obtained by a strong-coupling expansion around the atomic
limit. We identify a new order parameter and associated correlation length
scale that is capable of capturing the transition from a state with zero
compressibility, the Mott insulator, to one in which the compressibility is
finite, the Bose glass. The order parameter is the relative variance of the
disorder-induced mass distribution. In the Mott insulator, the relative
variance renormalizes to zero, whereas it diverges in the Bose glass. The
divergence of the relative variance signals the breakdown of self-averaging.
The length scale governing the breakdown of self-averaging is the distance
between rare regions. This length scale is finite in the Bose glass but
diverges at the transition to the Mott insulator with an exponent of $\nu=1/D$
for incommensurate fillings. Likewise, the compressibility vanishes with an
exponent of $\gamma=4/D-1$ at the transition. At commensurate fillings, the
transition is controlled by a different fixed point at which both the disorder
and interaction vertices are relevant.
