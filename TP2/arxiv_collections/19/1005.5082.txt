In this short report, we discuss how coordinate-wise descent algorithms can
be used to solve minimum variance portfolio (MVP) problems in which the
portfolio weights are constrained by $l_{q}$ norms, where $1\leq q \leq 2$. A
portfolio which weights are regularised by such norms is called a sparse
portfolio (Brodie et al.), since these constraints facilitate sparsity (zero
components) of the weight vector. We first consider a case when the portfolio
weights are regularised by a weighted $l_{1}$ and squared $l_{2}$ norm. Then
two benchmark data sets (Fama and French 48 industries and 100 size and BM
ratio portfolios) are used to examine performances of the sparse portfolios.
When the sample size is not relatively large to the number of assets, sparse
portfolios tend to have lower out-of-sample portfolio variances, turnover
rates, active assets, short-sale positions, but higher Sharpe ratios than the
unregularised MVP. We then show some possible extensions; particularly we
derive an efficient algorithm for solving an MVP problem in which assets are
allowed to be chosen grouply.
