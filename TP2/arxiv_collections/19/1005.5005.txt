We study how the property of asymptotic helicity conservation (HCns),
expected for any 2-to-2 process in the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM), is
realized in the processes $gg \to \gamma\gamma,\gamma Z,ZZ,W^+W^-$, at the
1loop electroweak order and very high energies. The violation of this property
for the same process in the standard model (SM), is also shown. This
strengthens the claim that HCns is specific to the renormalizable SUSY model,
and not generally valid in SM. HCns strongly reduces the number of
non-vanishing 2-to-2 amplitudes at asymptotic energies in MSSM. Consequences at
LHC and higher energy colliders are identified.
