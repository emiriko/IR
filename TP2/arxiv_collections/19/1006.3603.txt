We report on a systematic study of a number of structurally identical but
chemically distinct transition metal oxides in order to determine how the
material-specific properties such as the composition and the strain affect the
properties at the interface of heterostructures. Our study considers a series
of structures containing two layers of ferromagnetic SrRuO3, with
antiferromagnetic insulating manganites sandwiched in between. The results
demonstrate how to control the strength and relative orientation of interfacial
ferromagnetism in correlated electron materials by means of valence state
variation and substrate-induced strain, respectively.
