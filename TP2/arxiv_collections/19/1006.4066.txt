In this paper, we propose finite temperature Dirac equation, which can
describe the quantum systems in an arbitrary temperature for a relativistic
particle of spin-1/2. When the temperature T=0, it become Dirac equation. With
the equation, we can study the relativistic quantum systems in an arbitrary
temperature.
