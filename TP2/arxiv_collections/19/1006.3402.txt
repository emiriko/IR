In this talk recent simulation results on the single high energy electron
reconstruction with the Beam Calorimeter for the ILD detector are presented.
Guinea Pig is used to generate the e+e- pair background and GEANT4 for the
simulation of electron showers in the calorimeter. An algorithm was developed
for the sHEe reconstruction on top of the large e+e- background. The efficiency
of the sHEe reconstruction is estimated for the nominal and SB-2009 ILC beam
parameters.
