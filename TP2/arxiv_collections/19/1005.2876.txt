Gravitational Wave (GW) burst detection algorithms typically rely on the
hypothesis that the burst signal is "locally stationary", that is it changes
slowly with frequency. Under this assumption, the signal can be decomposed into
a small number of wavelets with constant frequency. This justifies the use of a
family of sine-Gaussian templates in the Omega pipeline, one of the algorithms
used in LIGO-Virgo burst searches. However there are plausible scenarios where
the burst frequency evolves rapidly, such as in the merger phase of a binary
black hole and/or neutron star coalescence. In those cases, the local
stationarity of sine-Gaussians induces performance losses, due to the mismatch
between the template and the actual signal. We propose an extension of the
Omega pipeline based on chirplet-like templates. Chirplets incorporate an
additional parameter, the chirp rate, to control the frequency variation. In
this paper, we show that the Omega pipeline can easily be extended to include a
chirplet template bank. We illustrate the method on a simulated data set, with
a family of phenomenological binary black-hole coalescence waveforms embedded
into Gaussian LIGO/Virgo-like noise. Chirplet-like templates result in an
enhancement of the measured signal-to-noise ratio.
