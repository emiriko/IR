Using one-dimensional thermochemical/photochemical kinetics and transport
models, we examine the chemistry of nitrogen-bearing species in the Jovian
troposphere in an attempt to explain the low observational upper limit for HCN.
We track the dominant mechanisms for interconversion of N2-NH3 and HCN-NH3 in
the deep, hightemperature troposphere and predict the rate-limiting step for
the quenching of HCN at cooler tropospheric altitudes. Consistent with other
investigations that were based solely on time-scale arguments, our models
suggest that transport-induced quenching of thermochemically derived HCN leads
to very small predicted mole fractions of hydrogen cyanide in Jupiter's upper
troposphere. By the same token, photochemical production of HCN is ineffective
in Jupiter's troposphere: CH4-NH3 coupling is inhibited by the physical
separation of the CH4 photolysis region in the upper stratosphere from the NH3
photolysis and condensation region in the troposphere, and C2H2-NH3 coupling is
inhibited by the low tropospheric abundance of C2H2. The upper limits from
infrared and submillimeter observations can be used to place constraints on the
production of HCN and other species from lightning and thundershock sources.
