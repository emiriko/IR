By microalloying of Gd atoms with 4f electrons into CuZrAl or MgCuY glassy
alloys, they display a variety of puzzling behaviors such as the characteristic
of Kondo effect. The ground states of the Gd-alloyed systems are determined to
have non-Fermi-liquid characteristics which derive from the strong structural
disorder. The Kondo effect in these glassy alloys is attributed to the strong
structural disorder. The coexistence of the Kondo effect and strong structural
disorder has implications for the understanding the origin of the puzzling
non-Fermi-liquid behavior.
