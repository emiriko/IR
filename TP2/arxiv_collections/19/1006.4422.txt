We study the nonequilibrium aging dynamics in a system of quasi-hard spheres
at large density by means of computer simulations. We find that, after a sudden
quench to large density, the relaxation time initially increases exponentially
with the age of the system. After a surprisingly large crossover time, the
system enters the asymptotic aging regime characterized by a linear increase of
the relaxation time with age. In this aging regime, single particle motion is
strongly non-Fickian, with a mean-squared displacement increasing
subdiffusively, associated to broad, non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of
particle displacements. We find that the system ages through temporally
intermittent relaxation events, and a detailed finite size analysis of these
collective dynamic fluctuations reveals that these events are not spanning the
entire system, but remain spatially localized.
