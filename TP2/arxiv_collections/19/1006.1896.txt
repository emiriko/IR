We obtain the general formula for the optimal rate at which singlets can be
distilled from any given noisy and arbitrarily correlated entanglement
resource, by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Our
formula, obtained by employing the quantum information spectrum method, reduces
to that derived by Devetak and Winter, in the special case of an i.i.d.
resource. The proofs rely on a one-shot version of the so-called "hashing
bound," which in turn provides bounds on the one-shot distillable entanglement
under general LOCC.
