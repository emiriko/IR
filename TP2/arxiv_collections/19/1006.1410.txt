This work studies the following question: can plays in a Muller game be
stopped after a finite number of moves and a winner be declared. A criterion to
do this is sound if Player 0 wins an infinite-duration Muller game if and only
if she wins the finite-duration version. A sound criterion is presented that
stops a play after at most 3^n moves, where n is the size of the arena. This
improves the bound (n!+1)^n obtained by McNaughton and the bound n!+1 derived
from a reduction to parity games.
