Software digital rights management is a pressing need for the software
development industry which remains, as no practical solutions have been
acclamaimed succesful by the industry. We introduce a novel software-protection
method, fully implemented with today's technologies, that provides traitor
tracing and license enforcement and requires no additional hardware nor
inter-connectivity.
  Our work benefits from the use of secure triggers, a cryptographic primitive
that is secure assuming the existence of an ind-cpa secure block cipher. Using
our framework, developers may insert license checks and fingerprints, and
obfuscate the code using secure triggers. As a result, this rises the cost that
software analysis tools have detect and modify protection mechanisms. Thus
rising the complexity of cracking this system.
