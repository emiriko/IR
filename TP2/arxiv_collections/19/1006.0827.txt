An exact solution is obtained for a model of itinerant electrons coupled to
ice-rule variables on the tetrahedron Husimi cactus, an analogue of the Bethe
lattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra. It reveals a quantum critical point with
the emergence of non-Fermi-liquid behavior in melting of the "charge ice"
insulator. The electronic structure is compared with the numerical results for
the pyrochlore-lattice model to elucidate the physics of electron systems
interacting with the tetrahedron ice rule.
