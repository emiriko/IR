We study the transport properties of ultrathin disordered nanowires in the
neighborhood of the superconductor-metal quantum phase transition. To this end
we combine numerical calculations with analytical strong-disorder
renormalization group results. The quantum critical conductivity at zero
temperature diverges logarithmically as a function of frequency. In the
metallic phase, it obeys activated scaling associated with an
infinite-randomness quantum critical point. We extend the scaling theory to
higher dimensions and discuss implications for experiments.
