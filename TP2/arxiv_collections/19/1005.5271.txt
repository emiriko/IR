Several steps are missing in the current high-speed race towards the holistic
support of citizen needs in the domain of eGovernment. This paper is focused on
how to provide support for the citizen profile. This profile, in a wide sense,
includes personal information as well documents in possession of the citizen.
This also involves the provision of those mechanisms required to publish,
access and submit the convenient information to a Public Administration in due
curse of a transactional services provided with the last one. Main features of
the system are related to interoperability and possibilities for its inclusion
in a cost effective manner in already developed platforms. To make that
possible, this approach will take full advantage of semantic technologies and
the RESTful paradigm to design the entire system. The paper presents the
overall system with some notes on the deployment of the solution for its
further reuse in similar contexts.
