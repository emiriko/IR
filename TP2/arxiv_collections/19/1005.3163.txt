In this thesis a rendering system and an accompanying tool chain for Virtual
Texturing is presented. Our tools allow to automatically retexture existing
geometry in order to apply unique texturing on each face. Furthermore we
investigate several techniques that try to minimize visual artifacts in the
case that only a small amount of pages can be streamed per frame. We analyze
the influence of different heuristics that are responsible for the page
selection. Alongside these results we present a measurement method to allow the
comparison of our heuristics.
