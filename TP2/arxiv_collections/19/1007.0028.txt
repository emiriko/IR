We report spectropolarimetry of 30 radio-selected broad absorption line (BAL)
quasars with the Keck Observatory, 25 from the sample of Becker et al. (2000).
Both high and low-ionization BAL quasars are represented, with redshifts
ranging from 0.5 to 2.5. The spectropolarimetric properties of radio-selected
BAL quasars are very similar to those of radio-quiet BAL quasars: a sizeable
fraction (20%) show large continuum polarization (2-10%) usually rising toward
short wavelengths, emission lines are typically less polarized than the
continuum, and absorption line troughs often show large polarization jumps.
There are no significant correlations between polarization properties and radio
properties, including those indicative of system orientation, suggesting that
BAL quasars are not simply normal quasars seen from an edge-on perspective.
