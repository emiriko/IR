We report the anisotropic changes in the electronic structure of a Kondo
semiconductor CeOs$_2$Al$_{10}$ across an anomalous antiferromagnetic ordering
temperature ($T_0$) of 29 K, using optical conductivity spectra. The spectra
along the $a$- and $c$-axes indicate that a $c$-$f$ hybridization gap emerges
from a higher temperature continuously across $T_0$. Along the b-axis, on the
other hand, a different energy gap with a peak at 20 meV appears below 39 K,
which is higher temperature than $T_0$, because of structural distortion. The
onset of the energy gap becomes visible below $T_0$. Our observation reveals
that the electronic structure as well as the energy gap opening along the
b-axis due to the structural distortion induces antiferromagnetic ordering
below $T_0$.
