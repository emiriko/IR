The growth of cooperatively rearranging regions was invoked long ago by Adam
and Gibbs to explain the slowing down of glass-forming liquids. The lack of
knowledge about the nature of the growing order, though, complicates the
definition of an appropriate correlation function. One option is the
point-to-set correlation function, which measures the spatial span of the
influence of amorphous boundary conditions on a confined system. By using a
swap Monte Carlo algorithm we measure the equilibration time of a liquid
droplet bounded by amorphous boundary conditions in a model glass-former at low
temperature, and we show that the cavity relaxation time increases with the
size of the droplet, saturating to the bulk value when the droplet outgrows the
point-to-set correlation length. This fact supports the idea that the
point-to-set correlation length is the natural size of the cooperatively
rearranging regions. On the other hand, the cavity relaxation time computed by
a standard, nonswap dynamics, has the opposite behavior, showing a very steep
increase when the cavity size is decreased. We try to reconcile this difference
by discussing the possible hybridization between MCT and activated processes,
and by introducing a new kind of amorphous boundary conditions, inspired by the
concept of frozen external state as an alternative to the commonly used frozen
external configuration.
