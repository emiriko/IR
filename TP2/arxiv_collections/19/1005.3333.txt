The nonlinear diffusion in multicomponent liquids under chemical reactions
influence has been studied. The theory is applied to the analysis of mass
transfer in a solution of acetone-benzene. It has been shown, that the creation
of molecular complexes should be taken into account for the explanation of the
experimental data on concentration dependence of diffusion coefficients. The
matrix of mutual diffusivities has been found and effective parameters of the
system have been computed.
