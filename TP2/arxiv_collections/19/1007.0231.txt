This paper concerns the concentration of Dirichlet eigenfunctions of the
Laplacian on a compact two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with strictly
geodesically concave boundary. We link three inequalities which bound the
concentration in different ways. We also prove one of these inequalities, which
bounds the L^p norms of the restrictions of eigenfunctions to broken geodesics.
