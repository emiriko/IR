[abridged] We investigate the afterglow properties and large-scale
environments of several short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with
sub-arcsecond optical afterglow positions but no bright coincident host
galaxies. The purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility
of significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model.
Five such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical
afterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are
systematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst
densities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by dz~0.5-1),
or to lower energies, although in the standard GRB model the smaller gamma-ray
fluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale
environments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying
hosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near
each burst. In 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence
(P(<dR)~0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of dR~10",
while somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with
faint galaxies at separations of ~2". By measuring redshifts for the brighter
galaxies in three cases (z=0.111, 0.473, 0.403) we find physical offsets of
~30-75 kpc, while for the faint hosts the assumption of z>1 leads to offsets of
~15 kpc. Alternatively, the limits at the burst positions (>26 mag) can be
explained by typical short GRB host galaxies (L~0.1-1 L*) at z>2. Thus, two
possibilities exist: (i) ~1/4 of short GRBs explode ~50 kpc or ~15 kpc from the
centers of z~0.3 or z>1 galaxies, respectively, and have fainter afterglows due
to the resulting lower densities; or (ii) ~1/4 of short GRBs occur at z>2 and
have fainter afterglows due to their higher redshifts.
