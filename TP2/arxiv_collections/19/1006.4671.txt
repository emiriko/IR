We study the orbital stability and instability of single-spike bound states
of semiclassical nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations with critical exponent,
linear and nonlinear optical lattices (OLs). These equations may model
two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in linear and nonlinear OLs. When
linear OLs are switched off, we derive the asymptotic expansion formulas and
obtain necessary conditions for the orbital stability and instability of
single-spike bound states, respectively. When linear OLs are turned on, we
consider three different conditions of linear and nonlinear OLs to develop
mathematical theorems which are most general on the orbital stability problem.
