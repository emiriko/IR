We present results from the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) and the Axion
Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX), together with a brief review on prospects on
Axion searches with a variety of experimental techniques. CAST has explored
masses up to 0.64 eV setting the most stringent limit on the axion-photon
coupling, apart for the micro-eV region where ADMX is the most competitive
experiment. CAST is aiming at surpassing the 1eV WMAP upper limit and possibly
revisiting the operation in vacuum with extra sensitive X-ray detectors, while
ADMX, using improved extra sensitive SQUID amplifiers will explore the micro-eV
mass range.
