In this paper, we shall present a new equation of motion with Quantum effect
in spacetime. To do so, we propose a classical-quantum duality. We also
generalize the Schordinger equation to the spacetime and obtain a relativistic
wave equation. This will lead a generalization of Einstein's formula $E=m_0c^2$
in the spacetime. In general, we have $E=m_0c^2 + \frac{\hbar^2}{12m_0}R$ in a
spacetime.
