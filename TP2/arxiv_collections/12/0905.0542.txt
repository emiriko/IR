The infrared (IR) reflectivity spectra of orthorhombic manganese perovskites
PrMnO$_3$ and CaMnO$_3$ are studied in the frequency range of optical phonon
modes at temperatures varying from 300 to 4 K. The IR phonon spectra of these
two materials are analyzed by a fitting procedure based on a Lorentz model, and
assigned to definite vibrational modes of $Pnma$ structures by comparison with
the results of lattice dynamical calculations. The calculations have been
performed in the framework of a shell model using short range
Born-Mayer-Buckingham and long range Coulomb potentials, whose parameters have
been optimized in order that the calculated Raman and IR active phonon
frequencies, and lattice parameters match with their experimental values. We
find a close correspondence between the values of the IR phonon frequencies of
PrMnO$_3$ and CaMnO$_3$, which shows that the substitution of the Pr$^{3+}$
ions with Ca$^{2+}$ results in a reduction of the frequency of medium- and
high-energy IR phonons, and an increase of the frequency of those of
low-energy. Nevertheless, the experimentally obtained IR phonon amplitudes of
the two materials appear to be unrelated. A comparative study of the
vibrational patterns of these modes reveals that most of them correspond to
complex atomic vibrations significantly different from PrMnO$_3$ to CaMnO$_3$
which cannot be assigned only to a given type of vibration (external, bending,
or stretching modes). In particular, these results confirm that the structure
of CaMnO$_3$ is quite far from the ideal (cubic) perovskite structure.
