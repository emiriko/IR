We describe a mechanism that produces an exponentially small $\mu$--term on
the world--volumes of D5 branes wrapping a deformed and fibered $A_3$
singularity. The small $\mu$ arises due to brane instanton effects which can be
calculated after a geometric transition at one of the nodes of the singularity.
