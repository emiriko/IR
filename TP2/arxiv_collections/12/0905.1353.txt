A short review of recent results in long-baseline optical interferometry
pertaining to fundamental stellar parameters and the future possibilities this
area over the next decade. Included are discussions of accurate stellar masses,
links between asteroseismology and interferometry, precise radii and effective
temperatures, limb darkening and convection, stellar rotation, and high angular
resolution imaging.
