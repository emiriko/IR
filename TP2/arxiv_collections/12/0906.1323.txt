We propose a simplified model of outflow/jet driven by the Blandford-Payne
(BP) process from advection dominated accretion flows (ADAF) and derive the
expressions of the BP power and disk luminosity based on the conservation laws
of mass, angular momentum and energy. We fit the 2--10 keV luminosity and
kinetic power of 15 active galactic nucleus (AGNs) of sub-Eddington luminosity.
It is found that there exists an anti-correlation between the accretion rate
and the advection parameter, which could be used to explain the correlation
between Eddington-scaled kinetic power and bolometric luminosity of the 15
samples. In addition, the Ledlow-Owen relation for FR I/II dichotomy is
re-expressed in a parameter space consisting of logarithm of dimensionless
accretion rate versus that of the BH mass. It turns out that the FR I/II
dichotomy is determined mainly by the dimensionless accretion rate, being
insensitive to the BH mass. And the dividing accretion rate is less than the
critical accretion rate for ADAFs, suggesting that FR I sources are all in the
ADAF state.
