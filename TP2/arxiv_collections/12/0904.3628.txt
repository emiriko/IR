We report a direct observation of the microscopic origin of the bipolar
resistive switching behavior in nanoscale titanium oxide films. Through a
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, an analytical TEM technique
using energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy and an in situ x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the oxygen ions piled up at
top interface by an oxidation-reduction reaction between the titanium oxide
layer and the top Al metal electrode. We also found that the drift of oxygen
ions during the on/off switching induced the bipolar resistive switching in the
titanium oxide thin films.
