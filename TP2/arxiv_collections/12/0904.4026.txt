In this paper we present a model exhibiting a new type of continuous-time
quantum walk (as a quantum mechanical transport process) on networks, which is
described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian possessing a real spectrum. We call it
pseudo-Hermitian continuous-time quantum walk. We introduce a method to obtain
the probability distribution of walk on any vertex and then study a specific
system. We observe that the probability distribution on certain vertices
increases compared to that of the Hermitian case. This formalism makes the
transport process faster and can be useful for search algorithms.
