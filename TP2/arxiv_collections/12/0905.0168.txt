Using the framework of soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we factorize
and calculate $e^+e^-$ angularity distributions, including perturbative
resummation and the incorporation of a universal model for the nonperturbative
soft function. Angularities $\tau_a$ are a class of event shapes varying in
their sensitivity to the substructure of jets in the final state, controlled by
a continuous parameter $a<2$. We calculate the jet and soft functions in
factorized angularity distributions for all $a<1$ to first order in the strong
coupling $\alpha_s$ and resum large logarithms to next-to-leading logarithmic
(NLL) accuracy. We employ a universal model for the nonperturbative soft
function with a gap parameter which cancels the renormalon ambiguity in the
partonic soft function.
