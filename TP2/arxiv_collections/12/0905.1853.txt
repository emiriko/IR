Two-dimensional kinematics of the central region of M 83 (NGC 5236) were
obtained through three-dimensional NIR spectroscopy with Gemini South
telescope. The spatial region covered by the integral field unit (~5" x 13" or
~90 x 240 pc), was centered approximately at the center of the bulge isophotes
and oriented SE-NW. The Pa_beta emission at half arcsecond resolution clearly
reveals spider-like diagrams around three centers, indicating the presence of
extended masses, which we describe in terms of Satoh distributions. One of the
mass concentrations is identified as the optical nucleus (ON), another as the
center of the bulge isophotes, similar to the CO kinematical center (KC), and
the third as a condensation hidden at optical wavelengths (HN), coincident with
the largest lobe in 10 micron emission. We run numerical simulations that take
into account ON, KC and HN and four more clusters, representing the star
forming arc at the SW of the optical nucleus. We show that ON, KC and HN suffer
strong evaporation and merge in 10-50 Myr. The star-forming arc is scattered in
less than one orbital period, also falling into the center. Simulations also
show that tidal-striping boosts the external shell of the condensations to
their escape velocity. This fact might lead to an overestimation of the mass of
the condensations in kinematical observations with spatial resolution smaller
than the condensations' apparent sizes. Additionally the existence of two ILR
resonances embracing the chain of HII regions, claimed by different authors,
might not exist due to the similarity of the masses of the different components
and the fast dynamical evolution of M83 central 300 pc.
