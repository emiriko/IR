We present a theoretical model for the thermal X-ray emission and cooling of
isolated pulsars, assuming that pulsars are solid quark stars. We calculate the
heat capacity for such a quark star, and the results show that the residual
thermal energy cannot sustain the observed thermal X-ray luminosities seen in
typical isolated X-ray pulsars. We conclude that other heating mechanisms must
be in operation if the pulsars are in fact solid quark stars. Two possible
heating mechanisms are explored. Firstly, for pulsars with little
magnetospheric activities, accretion from the interstellar medium or from the
material in the associated supernova remnants may power the observed thermal
emission. In the propeller regime, a disk-accretion rate ${\dot M}\sim$1% of
the Eddington rate with an accretion onto the stellar surface at a rate of
$\sim 0.1% {\dot M}$ could explain the observed emission luminosities of the
dim isolated neutron stars and the central compact objects. Secondly, for
pulsars with significant magnetospheric activities, the pulsar spindown
luminosities may have been as the sources of the thermal energy via reversing
plasma current flows. A phenomenological study between pulsar bolometric X-ray
luminosities and the spin energy loss rates presents the probable existence of
a 1/2-law or a linear law, i.e. $L_{\rm bol}^{\infty}\propto\dot{E}^{1/2}$ or
$L_{\rm bol}^{\infty}\propto\dot{E}$. This result together with the thermal
properties of solid quark stars allow us to calculate the thermal evolution of
such stars. Thermal evolution curves, or cooling curves, are calculated and
compared with the `temperature-age' data obtained from 17 active X-ray pulsars.
It is shown that the bolometric X-ray observations of these sources are
consistent with the solid quark star pulsar model.
