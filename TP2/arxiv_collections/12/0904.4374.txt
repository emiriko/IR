In this work the single server model with counteraction is considered. We
extend the classic fluid model using results from the theory of conflict
controlled processes. Our new model describes conflict processes in neworks.
For this model were defined two players - an attacker and a defender. Dynamic
of the system depends on strategies of these players. There are formulated
conditions that guarantee possibility of winning of one player. This fact
proved by the main theorem. Theoretical results were illustrated on the
experimental computational modeling.
