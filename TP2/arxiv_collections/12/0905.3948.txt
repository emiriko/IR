Joyce has shown that the fundamental quandle of a classical knot can be
derived from consideration of the fundamental group and the peripheral
structure of the knot, and also that the group and much of the peripheral
structure can be recovered from the quandle. We generalize these results to
arbitrary dimensions, and also to virtual and welded knots and arcs.
