We discuss multiloop MHV amplitudes in the N=4 SYM theory in terms of
effective gravity in the momentum space with IR regulator branes as degrees of
freedom. Kinematical invariants of external particles yield the moduli spaces
of complex or Kahler structures which are the playgrounds for the
Kodaira-Spencer(KS) or Kahler type gravity. We suggest fermionic representation
of the loop MHV amplitudes in the N=4 SYM theory assuming the identification of
the IR regulator branes with KS fermions in the B model and Lagrangian branes
in A model. The two-easy mass box diagram is related to the correlator of
fermionic currents on the spectral curve in B model or hyperbolic volume in the
A model and it plays the role of a building block in the whole picture. The
BDS-like anzatz has the interpretation as the semiclassical limit of a
fermionic correlator. It is argued that fermionic representation implies a kind
of integrability on the moduli spaces. We conjecture the interpretation of the
reggeon degrees of freedom in terms of the open strings stretched between the
IR regulator branes.
