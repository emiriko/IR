X-Ray diffraction, ac susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements
were performed in order to investigate the effect of Ag substitution for Pr in
the polycrystalline Pr$_{1-x}$Ag$_x$MnO$_3$ (0.0$\leq$x$\leq$0.25) manganites.
The XRD results show that the samples crystallize in the O'-orthorhombic
structure with a cooperative Jahn-Teller deformation. We give evidence that the
Ag$^{+}$ is not substituted at the Pr$^{3+}$ site in the PrMnO$_{3}$ structure.
The increase of $T_{C}$ up to 130 K is suggested to be due to further oxidation
of manganite grains by the oxygen released from the metallic silver at high
temperatures. No metal-insulator transition was observed in the samples.
