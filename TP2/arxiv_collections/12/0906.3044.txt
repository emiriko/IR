We present a short review on the electric and magnetic black strings in 5D
spacetime with one compact dimension. Linear static perturbations of these
objects indicate presence of the threshold unstable mode. Analysis of the mode
shows that the electric black string is less stable than a neutral one. The
situation is opposite for the magnetic black string.
