Light scattering detection in the near field, a rapidly expanding family of
scattering techniques, has recently proved to be an appropriate procedure for
performing dynamic measurements. Here we report an innovative algorithm, based
on the evaluation of the Exposure Time Dependent Spectrum (ETDS), which makes
it possible to measure the fast dynamics of a colloidal suspension with the aid
of a simple near field scattering apparatus and a CCD camera. Our algorithm
consists in acquiring static spectra in the near field at different exposure
times, so that the measured decay times are limited only by the exposure time
of the camera and not by its frame rate. The experimental set-up is based on a
modified microscope, where the light scattered in the near field is collected
by a commercial objective, but (unlike in standard microscopes) the light
source is a He-Ne laser which increases the instrument sensitivity. The
apparatus and the algorithm have been validated by considering model systems of
standard spherical nano-particle.
