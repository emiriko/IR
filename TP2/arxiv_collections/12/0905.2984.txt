We present a method for enhancing the cross-correlation of gravitational wave
signals eventually present in data streams containing otherwise uncorrelated
noise. Such method makes use of the wavelet decomposition to cast the
cross-correlation time series in time-frequency space. Then an entropy
criterion is applied to identify the best time frequency resolution, i.e. the
resolution allowing to concentrate the signal in the smallest number of wavelet
coefficients. By keeping only the coefficients above a certain threshold, it is
possible to reconstruct a cross-correlation time series where the effect of
common signal is stronger. We tested our method against signals injected over
two data streams of uncorrelated white noise.
