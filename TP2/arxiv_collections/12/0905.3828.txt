The quantum theory of ur objects postulates that all existing physical
objects and their properties are constructed from fundamental objects called ur
objects being described by an element of a two dimensional complex Hilbert
space. This approach is based on the assumption that quantum theory represents
a theory being constitutive for human knowledge. Physical objects are
characterized by the information one can gain from them being contained in the
quantum state they are described by. Since every Hilbert space can be
represented as a tensor product of two dimensional Hilbert spaces, one is led
to the ur objects. According to this approach relativistic quantum fields and
thus the existence of a Minkowski space-time are the consequence of an
iteration of a quantization of binary alternatives. In the original formulation
there was only obtained a description of quantum fields on a flat Minkowski
space-time. In this work there is made the attempt to incorporate general
relativity and to describe the gravitational field within this approach. Thus
the existence of a (3+1)-dimensional space-time in the sense of general
relativity is assumed to be a consequence of quantum theory interpreted in an
abstract sense.
