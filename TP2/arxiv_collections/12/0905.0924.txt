We use N-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of globular clusters
(GCs) in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Our models adopt a cosmologically
motivated scenario in which the dSph is approximated by a static NFW halo with
a triaxial shape. We apply our models to five GCs spanning three orders of
magnitude in stellar density and two in mass, chosen to represent the
properties exhibited by the five GCs of the Fornax dSph. We show that only the
object representing Fornax's least dense GC (F1) can be fully disrupted by
Fornax's internal tidal field--the four denser clusters survive even if their
orbits decay to the centre of Fornax. For a large set of orbits and projection
angles we examine the spatial and velocity distribution of stellar debris
deposited during the complete disruption of an F1-like GC. Our simulations show
that such debris appears as shells, isolated clumps and elongated
over-densities at low surface brightness (>26 mag/arcsec^2), reminiscent of
substructure observed in several MW dSphs. Such features arise from the
triaxiality of the galaxy potential and do not dissolve in time. The kinematics
of the debris depends strongly on the progenitor's orbit. Debris associated
with box and resonant orbits does not display stream motions and may appear
"colder"/"hotter" than the dSph's field population if the viewing angle is
perpendicular/parallel to progenitor's orbital plane. In contrast, debris
associated with loop orbits shows a rotational velocity that may be detectable
out to few kpc from the galaxy centre. Chemical tagging that can distinguish GC
debris from field stars may reveal whether the merger of GCs contributed to the
formation of multiple stellar components observed in dSphs.
