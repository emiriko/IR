Results of a systematic investigation of the vapour-liquid equilibria (VLE)
of 30 individual two-centre Lennard-Jones plus pointquadrupole model fluids
(2CLJQ) are reported over a range of reduced quadrupolar momentum $0 \le Q^{*2}
\le 4$ and of reduced elongation $0 \le L^* \le 0.8$. Temperatures investigated
are from about 55 % to about 95 % of the critical temperature of each fluid.
Uniformly the $NpT$+Test Particle Method based on molecular dynamics
simulations is used for the generation of vapour pressures, saturated
densities, and saturated enthalpies. Critical temperatures $T^*_{\rm c}$ and
densities $\rho^*_{\rm c}$ are obtained from Guggenheim's equations. Empirical
correlations for critical data $T^*_{\rm c}$ and $\rho^*_{\rm c}$ as well as
for saturated densities $\rho'^*$, $\rho''^*$, and vapour pressures
$p^*_{\sigma}$ are developed as global functions of the model parameters. In
most cases they describe the simulation data within their statistical
uncertainties. Critical pressures and acentric factors of the 2CLJQ fluid can
be calculated from present correlations. The present simulations are a sound
basis for adjustments of the model parameters $Q^{*2}$, $L^*$, $\sigma$, and
$\epsilon$ to experimental VLE data of real fluids.
