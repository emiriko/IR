We show that all Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions (MQS) based on
phase-covariant quantum cloning are characterized by an anomalous high
resilence to the de-coherence processes. The analysis supports the results of
recent MQS experiments and leads to conceive a useful conjecture regarding the
realization of complex decoherence - free structures for quantum information,
such as the quantum computer.
