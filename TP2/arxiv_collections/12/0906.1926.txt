The result of the 3-year neutrino magnetic moment measurement at the Kalinin
Nuclear Power Plant with the GEMMA spectrometer is presented.
Antineutrino-electron scattering is investigated. A high-purity germanium
detector of 1.5 kg placed at a distance of 13.9 m from the 3 GW(th) reactor
core is used in the spectrometer. The antineutrino flux is 2.7E13 1/scm/s. The
differential method is used to extract (nu-e) electromagnetic scattering
events. The scattered electron spectra taken in 5184+6798 and 1853+1021 hours
for the reactor ON and OFF periods are compared. The upper limit for the
neutrino magnetic moment < 3.2E-11 Bohr magneton at 90% CL is derived from the
data processing.
