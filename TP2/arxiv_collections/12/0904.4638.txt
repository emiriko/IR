The near proportionality between HI and dark matter in outer galactic disks
prompted us to run N-body simulations of galactic disks in which the observed
gas content is supplemented by a dark gas component representing between zero
and five times the visible gas content. While adding baryons in the disk of
galaxies may solve some issues, it poses the problem of disk stability. We show
that the global stability is ensured if the ISM is multiphased, composed of two
partially coupled phases, a visible warm gas phase and a weakly collisionless
cold dark phase corresponding to a fraction of the unseen baryons. The phases
are subject to stellar and UV background heating and gas cooling, and their
transformation into each other is studied as a function of the coupling
strength. This new model, which still possesses a dark matter halo, fits the
rotation curves as well as the classical CDM halos, but is the only one to
explain the existence of an open and contrasting spiral structure, as observed
in the outer HI disks
