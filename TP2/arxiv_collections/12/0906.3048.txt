We calculate the circularly polarized Stokes V profile for emission lines,
formed in hot-star winds threaded with a weak radial magnetic field. For
simplicity, the field is treated as a split monopole under the assumptions that
it has been radially combed by the wind, and rotation is not playing a central
role. Invoking the weak-field approximation, we find that the V profile has a
characteristic ``heartbeat'' shape exhibiting multiple sign inversions, which
might be mistaken for noise in the absence of theoretical guidance. We also
conclude that there is a tendency for the V profile to integrate to zero on
each side of the line separately.
