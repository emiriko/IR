A number of DR-bar renormalization constants in softly broken SUSY-QCD are
evaluated to three-loop level: the wave function renormalization constants for
quarks, squarks, gluons, gluinos, ghosts, and epsilon-scalars, and the
renormalization constants for the quark and gluino mass as well as for all
cubic vertices. The latter allow us to derive the corresponding beta functions
through three loops, all of which we find to be identical to the expression for
the gauge beta function obtained by Jack, Jones, and North [Jack:1996vg] (see
also Ref. [Pickering:2001aq]). This explicitely demonstrates the consistency of
DRED with SUSY and gauge invariance, an important pre-requisite for precision
calculations in supersymmetric theories.
