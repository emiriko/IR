A new family of exact solutions of the Einstein field equations for static
and axially simmetric spacetimes is presented. All the metric functions of the
solutions are explicitly computed and the obtained expressions are simply
written in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates. The solutions describe an
infinite family of static axially symmetric thin annular dust disks. The disk
are of infinite extension but with an inner annular edge. The energy densities
of the disks are everywhere positive functions of the radial coordinate, equals
to zero at the inner edge of the disk, having a maximun at a finite value of
the radius and then vanishing at infinity. The disks have finite mass and their
energy-momentum tensor agrees with all the energy conditions.
