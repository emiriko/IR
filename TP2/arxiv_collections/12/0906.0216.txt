We searched for evidence of line emission around 4keV from the northwestern
rim of the supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622 using Suzaku XIS data. Several
papers have reported the detection of an emission line around 4.1keV from this
region of the sky. This line would arise from K-band fluorescence by Sc, the
immediate decay product of 44Ti. We performed spectral analysis for the entire
portion of the NW rim of the remnant within the XIS field of view, as well as
various regions corresponding to regions of published claims of line emission.
We found no line emission around 4.1keV anywhere, and are able to set a
restrictive upper limit to the X-ray flux: 1.1x10^-6 s^-1 cm^-2 for the entire
field. For every region, our flux upper limit falls below that of the
previously claimed detection. Therefore, we conclude that, to date, no definite
X-ray line feature from Sc-K emission has been detected in the NW rim of RX
J0852.0-4622. Our negative-detection supports the recent claim that RX
J0852-4622 is neither young (1700--4000 yr) nor nearby(~750 pc).
