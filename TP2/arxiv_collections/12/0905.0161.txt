The probability that a generic real, complex or quaternionic two-qubit state
is separable can be considered to be the sum of three contributions. One is
from those states that are absolutely separable, that is those (which can not
be entangled by unitary transformations) for which the maximal concurrence over
spectral orbits (C_{max}) is zero. The other two contributions are from the
states for which C_{max} in [0,1/2], and for which C_{max} in [1/2,1]. We have
previously (arXiv:0805.0267) found exact formulas for the absolutely separable
contributions in terms of the Hilbert-Schmidt metric over the quantum states,
and here advance hypotheses as to the exact contributions for C_{max} in
[1/2,1]. A crucial element in understanding the other two contributions is the
nature of the ratio (R) of the C_{max}-parameterized separability function for
the complex states to the square of the comparable function for the real
states--both such functions having clearly displayed jump discontinuities at
C_{max}=1/2. For C_{max} in [0,1/2], R appears to be of the form 1+ k C_{max},
except near C_{max}=1/2, while for C_{max} in [1/2,1], it seems to be a
constant (thus according to the Dyson-index pattern of random matrix theory).
Related phenomena also occur for the minimally-degenerate two-qubit states and
the qubit-qutrit states. Our results have immediate application to the
computation of separability probabilities in terms of other metrics, such as
the Bures (minimal monotone) metric. The paper begins with continuous
embeddings of the separability probability question in terms of four metrics of
interest, using "generalized Peres-Horodecki conditions".
