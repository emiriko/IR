We introduce a non-interacting boson model to investigate topological
structure of complex networks in the present paper. By exactly solving this
model, we show that it provides a powerful analytical tool in uncovering the
important properties of real-world networks. We find that the ground state
degeneracy of this model is equal to the number of connected components in the
network and the square of coefficients in the expansion of ground state gives
the averaged time for a random walker spending at each node in the infinite
time limit. Furthermore, the first excited state appears always on its largest
connected component. To show usefulness of this approach in practice, we carry
on also numerical simulations on some concrete complex networks. Our results
are completely consistent with the previous conclusions derived by graph theory
methods.
