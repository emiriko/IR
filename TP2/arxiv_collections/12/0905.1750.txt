The quantum constraint equations for a relativistic three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator are shown to find concise expression in terms of Lorentz
covariant ladder operators. These ladder operators consist of two conjugate
4-vectors that are each constrained to generate three linearly independent
combinations of ladder operator components for raising and lowering the
eigenstates of the oscillator. Correspondence to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
for the harmonic oscillator in the non-relativistic limit is demonstrated.
