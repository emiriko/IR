The mathematical shaping in the study of water quality has become a branch of
environmental engineering. The comprehension and effective application of
mathematical models in studying environmental phenomena keep up with the
results in the domain of mathematics and the development of specialized
software as well. Integrated software programs simulate and predict extreme
events, propose solutions, analyzing and processing data in due time. This
paper presents a browsing through some mathematical categories of processing
the statistical data, examples and their analysis concerning the degree of
water pollution downstream the river Danube.
