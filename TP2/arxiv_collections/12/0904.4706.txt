The susceptibility of the transformed information to the filed and system
parameters is investigated for the Kane solid state computer. It has been
shown, that the field polarization and the initial state of the system play the
central roles on the abrupt and gradual quench of the purity and the fidelity.
If the field and the initial state are in different polarizations, then the
purity and the fidelity decrease abruptly, while for the common polarization
the decay is gradual and smooth. For some class of initial states one can send
the information without any loss. Therefore, by controlling on the devices one
can increase the time of safe communication, reduce the amount of exchange
information between the state and its environment and minimize the purity
decrease rate.
