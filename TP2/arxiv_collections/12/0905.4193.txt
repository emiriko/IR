This paper gives answers to questions formulated as open in the paper "On
State Observability in Deterministic Finite Automata" by A. Mateescu and Gh.
Paun. Specifically, it demonstrates that for all k >= 2, the families of
regular languages acceptable by deterministic finite automata with no more than
k semi-observable states, denoted by Tk, are anti-AFL's, and that the family T1
differs in the closure property under Kleene +.
