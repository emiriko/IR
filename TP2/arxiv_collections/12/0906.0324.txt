Ferroelectric properties in magnetic fields of varying magnitude and
direction have been investigated for a triangular-lattice helimagnet
CuFe1-xGaxO2 (x=0.035). The magnetoelectric phase diagrams were deduced for
magnetic fields along [001], [110], and [1-10] direction, and the in-plane
magnetic field was found to induce the rearrangement of six possible
multiferroic domains. Upon every 60-degree rotation of in-plane magnetic field
around the c-axis, unique 120-degree flop of electric polarization occurs as a
result of the switch of helical magnetic q-vector. The chirality of spin helix
is always conserved upon the q-flop. The possible origin is discussed in the
light of the stable structure of multiferroic domain wall.
