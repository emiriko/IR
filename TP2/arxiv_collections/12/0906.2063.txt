Various chips for the silicon sensors measurements are described. These chips
are based on 0.35 um and 0.18um CMOS technology. Several analog chips together
with self-trigger /derandomizer one allow to measure silicon sensors designed
for different purposes. Tracking systems, calorimeters, particle charge
measurement system and other application sensors can be investigated by the
integrated circuit readout with laser or radioactive sources. Also electrical
parameters of silicon sensors can be studied by such test setup.
