As well-known, the concept "hypercyclic" in operator theory is the same as
the concept "transitive" in dynamical system. Now the class of hypercyclic
operators is well studied. Following the idea of research in hypercyclic
operators, we consider classes of operators with some kinds of chaotic
properties in this article.
  First of all, the closures of the sets of all Li-Yorke chaotic operators or
distributionally chaotic operators are discussed. We give a spectral
description of them and prove that the two closures coincide with each other.
Moreover, both the set of all Li-Yorke chaotic operators and the set of all
distributionally chaotic operators have nonempty interiors which coincide with
each other as well. The article also includes the containing relation between
the closure of the set of all hypercyclic operators and the closure of the set
of all distributionally chaotic operators. Finally, we get connectedness of the
sets considered above.
