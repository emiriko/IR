Autocorrelation analyses of the optical continua of 57 of the 59 MACHO
quasars reveal structure at proper time lags of 544 +- 5.2 days with a standard
deviation of 77 light days. Interpreted in the context of reverberation from
elliptical outflow winds as proposed by Elvis (2000) [1], this implies an
approximate characteristic size scale for winds in the MACHO quasars of 544 +-
5.2 light days. The internal structure variable of these reflecting outflow
surfaces is found to be 11.87 degrees +- 0.40 degrees with a standard deviation
of 2.03 degrees.
