The paper proposes an analysis on some existent ontologies, in order to point
out ways to resolve semantic heterogeneity in information systems. Authors are
highlighting the tasks in a Knowledge Acquisiton System and identifying aspects
related to the addition of new information to an intelligent system. A solution
is proposed, as a combination of ontology reasoning services and natural
languages generation. A multi-agent system will be conceived with an extractor
agent, a reasoner agent and a competence management agent.
