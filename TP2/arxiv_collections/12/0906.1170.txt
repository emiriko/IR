We show that the category of Lie triple systems is equivalent to the category
of Lie algebras graded by Z/(2Z) such that the odd component generates the
algbera and the second graded cohomology group coefficients in any trivial
module is zero. As a corollary we obtain an analogous result for symmetric
spaces and Lie groups.
