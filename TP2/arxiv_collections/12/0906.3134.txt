The rates of axion emission by nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung are calculated
with the inclusion of the full momentum contribution from a nuclear one pion
exchange (OPE) potential. The contributions of the neutron-neutron (nn),
proton-proton (pp) and neutron-proton (np) processes in both the nondegenerate
and degenerate limits are explicitly given. We find that the finite momentum
corrections to the emissivities are quantitatively significant for the
non-degenerate regime and temperature-dependent, and should affect the existing
axion mass bounds. The trend of these nuclear effects is to diminish the
emissivities.
