In this paper we study rational real algebraic knots in $\R P^3$. We show
that two real algebraic knots of degree $\leq5$ are rigidly isotopic if and
only if their degrees and encomplexed writhes are equal. We also show that any
irreducible smooth knot which admits a plane projection with less than or equal
to four crossings has a rational parametrization of degree $\leq 6$.
Furthermore an explicit construction of rational knots of a given degree with
arbitrary encomplexed writhe (subject to natural restrictions) is presented.
