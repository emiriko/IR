The kinetics for the assembly of viral proteins into a population of capsids
can be measured in vitro with size exclusion chromatography or dynamic light
scattering, but extracting mechanistic information from these studies is
challenging. For example, it is not straightforward to determine the critical
nucleus size or the elongation time (the time required for a nucleated partial
capsid to grow completion). We show that, for two theoretical models of capsid
assembly, the critical nucleus size can be determined from the concentration
dependence of the assembly reaction half-life and the elongation time is
revealed by the length of the lag phase. Furthermore, we find that the system
becomes kinetically trapped when nucleation becomes fast compared to
elongation. Implications of this constraint for determining elongation
mechanisms from experimental assembly data are discussed.
