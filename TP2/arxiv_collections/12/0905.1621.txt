We consider the dynamics of a four-form field $\tilde {w} $, treating it as a
distinct physical degree of freedom, independent of the metric. The equations
of motion are derived from an action which, besides having the standard
Hilbert-Einstein term and the matter part, consists of a new action for $\tilde
{w} $. The evolution of $\tilde {w} $ in a flat FRW universe is studied, and it
is shown that the parameters of the theory admit solutions wherein it is
possible to have an equation of state $p_\phi \approx -\epsilon_\phi $, so that
it leads to an accelerating universe. We also put forward electromagnetic as
well as gravitational `Chern-Simons' like terms that arise naturally in 4D,
entailing a modified Einstein-Maxwell equation and an enlarged system of
Einstein equation involving a Cotton tensor. We demonstrate that the
scalar-density associated with $\tilde {w} $ can be employed to construct a
generalized exterior derivative that converts a p-form density to a (p+1)-form
density of identical weight.
