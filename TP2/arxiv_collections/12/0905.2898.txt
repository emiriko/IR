We present first preliminary results from AKARI/FIS pointed observations of
post-AGB stars and planetary nebulae (PNe). A first analysis of the radial
(azimuthally averaged) profile of the observed sources shows no evidence for
excess emission due to the presence of circumstellar dust. No (detached)
circumstellar faint dust-shells are seen in the image maps. Also, we present
here first results of aperture flux photometry at wavelengths of 65, 90, 140
and 160 micron. Results are compared with IRAS flux densities as well as the
beta release of the FIS Bright Source Catalog. Finally, spectral energy
distributions are given, by way of an example, for two individual targets in
our sample.
