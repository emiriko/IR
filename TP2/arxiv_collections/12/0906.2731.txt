In this paper, we present new progress on the study of the symmetric
extension criterion for separability. First, we show that a perturbation of
order O(1/N) is sufficient and, in general, necessary to destroy the
entanglement of any state admitting an N Bose symmetric extension. On the other
hand, the minimum amount of local noise necessary to induce separability on
states arising from N Bose symmetric extensions with Positive Partial Transpose
(PPT) decreases at least as fast as O(1/N^2). From these results, we derive
upper bounds on the time and space complexity of the weak membership problem of
separability when attacked via algorithms that search for PPT symmetric
extensions. Finally, we show how to estimate the error we incur when we
approximate the set of separable states by the set of (PPT) N -extendable
quantum states in order to compute the maximum average fidelity in pure state
estimation problems, the maximal output purity of quantum channels, and the
geometric measure of entanglement.
