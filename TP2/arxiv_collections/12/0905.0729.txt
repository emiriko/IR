We propose a new algorithm for generating pseudorandom (pseudo-generic)
numbers of conformal measures of a continuous map T acting on a compact space X
and for a Holder continuous potential F. In particular, we show that this
algorithm provides good approximations to generic points for hyperbolic
rational functions of degree two and the potential -h log|T'|, where h denotes
the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set of T .
