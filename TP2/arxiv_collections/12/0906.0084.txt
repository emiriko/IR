Pulsars inside binary systems can accrete matter that arrives up to the
pulsar surface provided that its period is long enough. During the accretion
process, matter has to be accelerated to the rotational velocity of the pulsar
magnetosphere at the distance where the balance between the pressure of matter
and the magnetic field is achieved. At this distance, a very turbulent and
magnetized region is formed in which hadrons can be accelerated to relativistic
energies. These hadrons can interact with the very strong radiation field
coming from the hot polar cap on the neutron star surface created by the
in-falling matter. We calculate the neutrino event rates produced in an km$^2$
detector that can be expected from accreting millisecond and classical X-ray
pulsars at a typical distance within our own Galaxy.
