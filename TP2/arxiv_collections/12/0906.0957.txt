We study the problem of selecting between different mechanisms of
supersymmetry breaking in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model using
current data. We evaluate the Bayesian evidence of four supersymmetry breaking
scenarios: mSUGRA, mGMSB, mAMSB and moduli mediation. The results show a strong
dependence on the dark matter assumption. Using the inferred cosmological relic
density as an upper bound, minimal anomaly mediation is at least moderately
favoured over the CMSSM. Our fits also indicate that evidence for a positive
sign of the mu parameter is moderate at best. We present constraints on the
anomaly and gauge mediated parameter spaces and some previously unexplored
aspects of the dark matter phenomenology of the moduli mediation scenario. We
use sparticle searches, indirect observables and dark matter observables in the
global fit and quantify robustness with respect to prior choice. We quantify
how much information is contained within each constraint.
