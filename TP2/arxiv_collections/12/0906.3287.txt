We identify robust statistical patterns in the frequency and severity of
violent attacks by terrorist organizations as they grow and age. Using
group-level static and dynamic analyses of terrorist events worldwide from
1968-2008 and a simulation model of organizational dynamics, we show that the
production of violent events tends to accelerate with increasing size and
experience. This coupling of frequency, experience and size arises from a
fundamental positive feedback loop in which attacks lead to growth which leads
to increased production of new attacks. In contrast, event severity is
independent of both size and experience. Thus larger, more experienced
organizations are more deadly because they attack more frequently, not because
their attacks are more deadly, and large events are equally likely to come from
large and small organizations. These results hold across political ideologies
and time, suggesting that the frequency and severity of terrorism may be
constrained by fundamental processes.
