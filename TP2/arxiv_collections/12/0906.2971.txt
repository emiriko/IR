A strong inhomogeneous static electric field is used to spatially disperse a
rotationally cold supersonic beam of 2,6-difluoroiodobenzene molecules
according to their rotational quantum state. The molecules in the lowest lying
rotational states are selected and used as targets for 3-dimensional alignment
and orientation. The alignment is induced in the adiabatic regime with an
elliptically polarized, intense laser pulse and the orientation is induced by
the combined action of the laser pulse and a weak static electric field. We
show that the degree of 3-dimensional alignment and orientation is strongly
enhanced when rotationally state-selected molecules, rather than molecules in
the original molecular beam, are used as targets.
