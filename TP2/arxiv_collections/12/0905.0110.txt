We report on the calculation of the full next-to-leading order QCD
corrections to the production of top anti-top bottom anti-bottom (ttbb) final
states at the LHC, which deliver a serious background contribution to the
production of a Higgs boson (decaying into a bottom anti-bottom pair) in
association with a top anti-top pair. While the corrections significantly
reduce the unphysical scale dependence of the leading-order cross section, our
results predict an enhancement of the ttbb production cross section by a
K-factor of about 1.8.
