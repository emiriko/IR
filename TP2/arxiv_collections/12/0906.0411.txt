I describe a novel dark matter candidate in which the dark matter is composed
of macroscopically large "nuggets" of ordinary quarks and antiquarks in a
colour-superconducting phase. The physical properties of these objects are
described entirely by QCD and the principles of condensed matter physics. An
understanding of these properties allows for predictions of their interactions
with the ordinary visible matter of the galaxy and leads to several testable
consequences of the model. The spectrum arising from these interactions is
entirely fixed by quite general predictions about the structure of dense quark
matter and allows for no tuning of parameters. In this talk I present the
results of a detailed Thomas-Fermi calculation which demonstrates the
plausibility that the annihilation of galactic matter incident on a dark matter
nugget may be responsible for both the galactic 511 keV line and a broad MeV
scale continuum present in the galactic spectrum measured by COMPTEL.
