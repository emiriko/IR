We study thermodynamics of black holes in the deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz
gravity with coupling constant $\lambda$.
  For $\lambda=1$, the black hole behaves the
  Reissner-Norstr\"om black hole. Hence, this is different from the
Schwarzschild black hole of Einstein gravity. A connection to the generalized
uncertainty principle is explored to understand the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz black
holes.
