This paper presents the realization of a wireless Gigabit Ethernet
communication system operating in the 60 GHz band. The system architecture uses
a single carrier modulation. A differential encoded binary phase shift keying
modulation and a differential demodulation scheme are adopted for the
intermediate frequency blocks. The baseband blocks use Reed- Solomon RS (255,
239) coding and decoding for channel forward error correction (FEC). First
results of bit error rate (BER) measurements at 875 Mbps, without channel
coding, are presented for different antennas.
