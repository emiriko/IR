The article focuses on the issue of the two definitions of charge, mainly the
gauge charge and the effective charge of fundamental particles. Most textbooks
on classical electromagnetism and quantum field theory only works with the
gauge charges while the concept of the induced charge remains unattended. In
this article it has been shown that for intrinsically charged particles both of
the charges remain the same but there can be situations where an electrically
neutral particle picks up some electrical charge from its plasma surrounding.
The physical origin and the scope of application of the induced charge concept
has been briefly discussed in the article.
