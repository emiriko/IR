The catalog from the first high resolution U-band image of the Hubble Ultra
Deep Field, taken with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 through the F300W
filter, is presented. We detect 96 U-band objects and compare and combine this
catalog with a Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) B-selected
catalog that provides B, V, i, and z photometry, spectral types, and
photometric redshifts. We have also obtained Far-Ultraviolet (FUV, 1614 \AA)
data with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys Solar Blind Channel (ACS/SBC)
and with Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). We detected 31 sources with
ACS/SBC, 28 with GALEX/FUV, and 45 with GALEX/NUV. The methods of observations,
image processing, object identification, catalog preparation, and catalog
matching are presented.
