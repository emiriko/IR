Using a Fermi liquid approach, we provide a comprehensive treatment of the
current and current noise through a quantum dot whose low-energy behaviour
corresponds to an SU($N$) Kondo model, focusing on the case N=4 relevant to
carbon nanotube dots. We show that for general $N$, one needs to consider the
effects of higher-order Fermi liquid corrections even to describe low-voltage
current and noise. We also show that the noise exhibits complex behaviour due
to the interplay between coherent shot noise, and noise arising from
interaction-induced scattering events. We treat various imperfections relevant
to experiments, such as the effects of asymmetric dot-lead couplings.
