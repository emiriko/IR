Over the last two decades, the HERA collider has provided a large amount of
new information about QCD dynamics at high energy. While the most appreciated
are the measurements of the proton structure functions in a wide range of
parton momentum x and virtuality Q^2, it is hard to believe that some of the
observations at HERA which do not fit the simple picture of DGLAP dynamics
would not get amplified at the LHC, possibly rendering certain approaches to
searches beyond the Standard Model inadequate.
