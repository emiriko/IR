Stephen Hawking's discovery of black hole evaporation had the remarkable
consequence that information is destroyed by a black hole, which can only be
accommodated by modifying the laws of quantum mechanics. Different attempts to
evade the information loss paradox were subsequently suggested, apparently
without a satisfactory resolution of the paradox. On the other hand, the
attempting to include non-unitarity into quantum mechanics might lead to laws
predicting observable consequences such as nonlocality or violation of
energy-momentum conservation; but it may be possibly to circumvent these
obstacles. Recent developments seem to require a different view on quantum
gravity and suggest that ideas about locality in physics and Hawking's
semi-classical approximation are misleading. An accurate description may show
unitary evolution and no information loss after all.
