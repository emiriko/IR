The production of single photons in low energy (~1 GeV) neutrino scattering
off nucleons is analyzed in the Standard Model. At very low energies, E(nu) <<
1 GeV, a simple description of the chiral lagrangian involving baryons and
arbitrary SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge fields is developed. Extrapolation of the
process into the ~1-2 GeV region is treated in a simple phenomenological model.
Coherent enhancements in compound nuclei are studied. The relevance of single
photon events as a background to experimental searches for nu(mu) --> nu(e) is
discussed. In particular, single photons are a plausible explanation for excess
events observed by the MiniBooNE experiment.
