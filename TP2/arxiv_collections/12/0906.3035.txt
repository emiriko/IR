We present a scheme for the fast generation of entangled photons from a
single quantum dot coupled to a planar photonic crystal that support two
orthogonally polarized cavity modes. We discuss ``within generation'' and
``across generation'' of entangled photons when both biexciton to exciton, and
exciton to ground state transitions, are coupled through cavity modes. In the
across generation, the photon entanglement is restored through a time delay
between the photons. The two photon concurrence, which is a measure of
entanglement, is greater than 0.7 and 0.8 using experimentally achievable
parameters in across generation and within generation, respectively. We also
show that the entanglement can be distilled in both cases using a simple
spectral filter.
