In order to evaluate $g_0$, the interaction strength of a pair of $^{52}$Cr
atoms with total spin S=0, a specially designed s-wave scattering of the pair
has been studied theoretically. Both the incident atom and the target atom
trapped by a harmonic potential are polarized previously but in reverse
directions. Due to spin-flip, the outgoing atom may have spin component $\mu$
ranging from -3 to 3. The outgoing channels are classified by $\mu$. The effect
of $g_{0}$ on the scattering amplitudes of each of these $\mu-$channels has
been predicted.
