We study several cosmological models with Bianchi VI_0&III symmetries under
the self-similar approach. We find new solutions for the "classical" perfect
fluid model as well as for the vacuum model although they are really
restrictive for the equation of state. We also study a perfect fluid model with
time-varying constants, $G$ and $\Lambda.$ As in other models studied we find
that the behaviour of $G$ and $\Lambda$ are related. If $G$ behaves as a
growing time function then $\Lambda$ is a positive decreasing time function but
if $G$ is decreasing then $\Lambda_{0}$ is negative. We end by studying a
massive cosmic string model, putting special emphasis on calculating the
numerical values of the equations of state. We show that there is no SS
solution for a string model with time-varying constants.
