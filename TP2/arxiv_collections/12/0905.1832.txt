Half-life estimates for neutrinoless double beta decay depend on particle
physics models for lepton flavor violation, as well as on nuclear physics
models for the structure and transitions of candidate nuclei. Different models
considered in the literature can be contrasted - via prospective data - with a
"standard" scenario characterized by light Majorana neutrino exchange and by
the quasiparticle random phase approximation, for which the theoretical
covariance matrix has been recently estimated. We show that, assuming future
half-life data in four promising nuclei (Ge-76, Se-82, Te-130, and Xe-136), the
standard scenario can be distinguished from a few nonstandard physics models,
while being compatible with alternative state-of-the-art nuclear calculations
(at 95% C.L.). Future signals in different nuclei may thus help to discriminate
at least some decay mechanisms, without being spoiled by current nuclear
uncertainties. Prospects for possible improvements are also discussed.
