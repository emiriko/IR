We introduce a field theoretic formalism enabling the direct study of
dislocation and interstitial dynamics. Explicit expressions for the energies of
such defects are given. We provide links to earlier numerical, discrete
elastic, time dependent Ginzburg Landau, and other approaches sought by
numerous authors for the problem of defect dynamics. The formalism introduced
in this article may be extended to address many other systems. Apart from their
heavily studied role in dislocation mediated crystal melting, defect dynamics
recently gained much interest due to their viable role in various electronic
and other systems of current interest. These systems include, yet are not
limited to, stripe phases of Quantum Hall liquids, theories addressing the
melting of stripe phases in various doped oxides (including the high
temperature cuprate superconductors, the nickelates, and manganates), defects
in supersolids, as well as colloidal crystals.
