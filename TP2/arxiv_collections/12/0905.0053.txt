Firstly, we calculate quantitatively decrease of entropy by the known
formulas in the ordering phenomena and nucleation of thermodynamics of
microstructure. They show again that a necessary condition of decrease of
entropy in isolated system is existence of internal interactions. Further,
sufficient and necessary condition of decrease of entropy is also discussed
quantitatively. Then some possible decreases of entropy are researched. A
complete symmetrical structure on change of entropy is obtained. The analysis
for many experiments and theories shows that the second law of the
thermodynamics should be developed.
