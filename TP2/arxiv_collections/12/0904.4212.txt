Coincidences between charged particles emitted in the $\beta$-decay of
$^{11}$Li were observed using highly segmented detectors. The breakup channels
involving three particles were studied in full kinematics allowing for the
reconstruction of the excitation energy of the $^{11}$Be states participating
in the decay. In particular, the contribution of a previously unobserved state
at 16.3 MeV in $^{11}$Be has been identified selecting the $\alpha$ +
$^7$He$\to\alpha$ + $^6$He+n channel. The angular correlations between the
$\alpha$ particle and the center of mass of the $^6$He+n system favors spin and
parity assignment of 3/2$^-$ for this state as well as for the previously known
state at 18 MeV.
