In this paper we study asymptotic behavior of regular subsets in a free group
F of finite rank, compare their sizes at infinity, and develop techniques to
compute the probabilities of sets relative to distributions on F that come
naturally from no-return random walks on the Cayley graph of F. We apply these
techniques to study cosets, double cosets, and Schreier representatives of
finitely generated subgroups of F and also to analyze relative sizes of regular
prefixed-closed subsets in F.
