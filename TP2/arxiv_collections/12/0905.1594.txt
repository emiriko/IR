The number of researchers, articles, journals, conferences, funding
opportunities, and other such scholarly resources continues to grow every year
and at an increasing rate. Many services have emerged to support scholars in
navigating particular aspects of this resource-rich environment. Some
commercial publishers provide recommender and alert services for the articles
and journals in their digital libraries. Similarly, numerous noncommercial
social bookmarking services have emerged for citation sharing. While these
services do provide some support, they lack an understanding of the various
problem-solving scenarios that researchers face daily. Example scenarios, to
name a few, include when a scholar is in search of an article related to
another article of interest, when a scholar is in search of a potential
collaborator for a funding opportunity, when a scholar is in search of an
optimal venue to which to submit their article, and when a scholar, in the role
of an editor, is in search of referees to review an article. All of these
example scenarios can be represented as a problem in information filtering by
means of context-sensitive recommendation. This article presents an overview of
a context-sensitive recommender system to support the scholarly communication
process that is based on the standards and technology set forth by the Semantic
Web initiative.
