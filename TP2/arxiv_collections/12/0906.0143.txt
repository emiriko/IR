In this article we report the release of a new program for calculating the
emissivity of atomic transitions. The program, which can be obtained with its
documentation from our website www.scienceware.net, passed various rigorous
tests and was used by the author to generate theoretical data and analyze
observational data. It is particularly useful for investigating atomic
transition lines in astronomical context as the program is capable of
generating a huge amount of theoretical data and comparing it to observational
list of lines. A number of atomic transition algorithms and analytical
techniques are implemented within the program and can be very useful in various
situations. The program can be described as fast and efficient. Moreover, it
requires modest computational resources.
