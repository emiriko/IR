A Bianchi type-I cosmological model in the presence of a magnetic flux along
a cosmic string is investigated. A nonlinear spinor field is used to simulate
the cosmological cloud of strings. It is shown that the spinor field simulation
offer the possibility to solve the system of Einstein's equation without any
additional assumptions. It is shown that the present model is nonsingular at
the end of the evolution and does not allow the anisotropic Universe to turn
into an isotropic one.
