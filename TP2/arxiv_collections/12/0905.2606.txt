Spin-disorder resistivity of Fe and Ni and its temperature dependence are
analyzed using noncollinear density functional calculations within the
supercell method. Different models of thermal spin disorder are considered,
including the mean-field approximation and the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg
model. Spin-disorder resistivity is found to depend weakly on magnetic
short-range order. If the local moments are kept frozen at their
zero-temperature values, very good agreement with experiment is obtained for
Fe, but for Ni the resistivity at elevated temperatures is significantly
overestimated. Agreement with experiment for Fe is improved if the local
moments are iterated to self-consistency. The overestimation of the resistivity
for paramagnetic Ni is attributed to the reduction of the local moments down to
0.35 Bohr magnetons. Overall, the results suggest that low-energy spin
fluctuations in Fe and Ni are better viewed as classical rotations of local
moments rather than quantized spin fluctuations that would require an (S+1)/S
correction.
