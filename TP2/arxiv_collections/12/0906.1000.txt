We study the Desargues maps $\phi:\ZZ^N\to\PP^M$, which generate lattices
whose points are collinear with all their nearest (in positive directions)
neighbours. The multidimensional compatibility of the map is equivalent to the
Desargues theorem and its higher-dimensional generalizations. The nonlinear
counterpart of the map is the non-commutative (in general) Hirota--Miwa system.
In the commutative case of the complex field we apply the nonlocal
$\bar\partial$-dressing method to construct Desargues maps and the
corresponding solutions of the equation. In particular, we identify the
Fredholm determinant of the integral equation inverting the nonlocal
$\bar\partial$-dressing problem with the $\tau$-function. Finally, we establish
equivalence between the Desargues maps and quadrilateral lattices provided we
take into consideration also their Laplace transforms.
