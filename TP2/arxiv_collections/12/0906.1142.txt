The generation of relativistic attosecond electron bunches is observed in
three-dimensional, relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of the interaction
of intense laser light with droplets. The electron bunches are emitted under
certain angles which depend on the ratios of droplet radius to wavelength and
plasma frequency to laser frequency. The mechanism behind the multi-MeV
attosecond electron bunch generation is investigated using Mie theory. It is
shown that the angular distribution and the high electron energies are due to a
parameter-sensitive, time-dependent local field enhancement at the droplet
surface.
