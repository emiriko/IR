In this paper we analyse Belief Propagation over a Gaussian model in a
dynamic environment. Recently, this has been proposed as a method to average
local measurement values by a distributed protocol ("Consensus Propagation",
Moallemi & Van Roy, 2006), where the average is available for read-out at every
single node. In the case that the underlying network is constant but the values
to be averaged fluctuate ("dynamic data"), convergence and accuracy are
determined by the spectral properties of an associated Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius
operator. For Gaussian models on Erdos-Renyi graphs, numerical computation
points to a spectral gap remaining in the large-size limit, implying
exceptionally good scalability. In a model where the underlying network also
fluctuates ("dynamic network"), averaging is more effective than in the dynamic
data case. Altogether, this implies very good performance of these methods in
very large systems, and opens a new field of statistical physics of large (and
dynamic) information systems.
