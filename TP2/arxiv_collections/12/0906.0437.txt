We analyze robust stability, in an input-output sense, of switched stable
systems. The primary goal (and contribution) of this paper is to design
switching strategies to guarantee that input-output stable systems remain so
under switching. We propose two types of {\em supervisors}: dwell-time and
hysteresis based. While our results are stated as tools of analysis they serve
a clear purpose in design: to improve performance. In that respect, we
illustrate the utility of our findings by concisely addressing a problem of
observer design for Lur'e-type systems; in particular, we design a hybrid
observer that ensures ``fast'' convergence with ``low'' overshoots. As a second
application of our main results we use hybrid control in the context of
synchronization of chaotic oscillators with the goal of reducing control
effort; an originality of the hybrid control in this context with respect to
other contributions in the area is that it exploits the structure and chaotic
behavior (boundedness of solutions) of Lorenz oscillators.
