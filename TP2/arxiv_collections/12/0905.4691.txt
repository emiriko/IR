Risk-limiting post-election audits limit the chance of certifying an
electoral outcome if the outcome is not what a full hand count would show.
Building on previous work, we report on pilot risk-limiting audits in four
elections during 2008 in three California counties: one during the February
2008 Primary Election in Marin County and three during the November 2008
General Elections in Marin, Santa Cruz and Yolo Counties. We explain what makes
an audit risk-limiting and how existing and proposed laws fall short. We
discuss the differences among our four pilot audits. We identify challenges to
practical, efficient risk-limiting audits and conclude that current approaches
are too complex to be used routinely on a large scale. One important logistical
bottleneck is the difficulty of exporting data from commercial election
management systems in a format amenable to audit calculations. Finally, we
propose a bare-bones risk-limiting audit that is less efficient than these
pilot audits, but avoids many practical problems.
