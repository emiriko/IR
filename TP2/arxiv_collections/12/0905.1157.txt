We developed techniques for employing holographic screens under white light,
first exhibited to the public in 1989 (3) (4) which demonstrated the
possibility of enlarging holograms already in 1990 (5). Fig. 1 shows how we
encode views in a first step. The plane of the figure is horizontal, and a thin
vertical slit is necessary to project each different view of the scene at a
different sequential wavelength value. Decoding happens because the projected
views are naturally angularly redistributed by the holographic screen (6).
