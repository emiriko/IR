We present evidence that the very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray
emission coincident with the supernova remnant IC 443 is extended. IC 443
contains one of the best-studied sites of supernova remnant/molecular cloud
interaction and the pulsar wind nebula CXOU J061705.3+222127, both of which are
important targets for VHE observations. VERITAS observed IC 443 for 37.9 hours
during 2007 and detected emission above 300 GeV with an excess of 247 events,
resulting in a significance of 8.3 standard deviations (sigma) before trials
and 7.5 sigma after trials in a point-source search. The emission is centered
at 06 16 51 +22 30 11 (J2000) +- 0.03_stat +- 0.08_sys degrees, with an
intrinsic extension of 0.16 +- 0.03_stat +- 0.04_sys degrees. The VHE spectrum
is well fit by a power law (dN/dE = N_0 * (E/TeV)^-Gamma) with a photon index
of 2.99 +- 0.38_stat +- 0.3_sys and an integral flux above 300 GeV of (4.63 +-
0.90_stat +- 0.93_sys) * 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1. These results are discussed in the
context of existing models for gamma-ray production in IC 443.
