Recently, observations by PAMELA, the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope, and
other cosmic ray experiments have generated a great deal of interest in dark
matter (DM) particles which annihilate at a high rate to leptons. In this
letter, we explore the possibility of using large volume neutrino telescopes,
such as IceCube, to constrain such models; specifically we consider signals due
to DM annihilation in the inner Milky Way. We find that,
  if Dark Matter annihilations are responsible for the signals observed by
PAMELA and FGST, then IceCube (in conjunction with the planned low threshold
extension, DeepCore) should detect or exclude the corresponding neutrino signal
from the inner Milky Way with a few years of observation.
