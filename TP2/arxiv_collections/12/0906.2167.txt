We investigate a gas of wet granular particles, covered by a thin liquid
film. The dynamic evolution is governed by two-particle interactions, which are
mainly due to interfacial forces in contrast to dry granular gases. When two
wet grains collide, a capillary bridge is formed and stays intact up to a
certain distance of withdrawal when the bridge ruptures, dissipating a fixed
amount of energy. A freely cooling system is shown to undergo a nonequillibrium
dynamic phase transition from a state with mainly single particles and fast
cooling to a state with growing aggregates, such that bridge rupture becomes a
rare event and cooling is slow. In the early stage of cluster growth,
aggregation is a self-similar process with a fractal dimension of the
aggregates approximately equal to D_f ~ 2. At later times, a percolating
cluster is observed which ultimately absorbs all the particles. The final
cluster is compact on large length scales, but fractal with D_f ~ 2 on small
length scales.
