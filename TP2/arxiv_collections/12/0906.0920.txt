A classical membrane model is developed for a dynamic wormhole. Its throat
expands hyperbolically with an acceleration proportional to the surface energy
density $\sigma$. The model leads to a negative bulk viscosity coefficient
$\zeta = - 1/6 \pi$ on the throat, expressing the instability against
perturbations (expansions or contractions).
