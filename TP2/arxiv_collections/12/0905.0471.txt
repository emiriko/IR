Condensation and sublimation of water vapors (and CO2, CH4, N2O vapors also)
in the Earth atmosphere must be accompanied by emission of latent heats on
characteristic frequencies marked in absorption spectra. Calculated wave
lengths completely explain all peaks observed for these gases in the near IR.
Established phenomena require further investigations, re-estimation of
atmospheric heat balances and so on. Investigation of analogical peaks in
atmospheres of other planets can be used for analyses of their structures.
