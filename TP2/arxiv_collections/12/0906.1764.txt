We study particle states of quantum Hall ferromagnet from the viewpoint of
the incompressible fluid description. It is shown that phase space of
Chern-Simons matrix theory which is an effective theory for the incompressible
fluid is equivalent to moduli space of vortex theory. According to this
correspondence, elementary excitations in vortex theory are identified as
particle states in quantum Hall ferromagnet, and thus we propose that a pure
electron state is absent from the strong coupling region but only a composite
particle state is present.
