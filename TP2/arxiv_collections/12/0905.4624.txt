We present near-infrared (1 - 2.5 micron) spectroscopic and photometric
results of Nova V2615 Ophiuchi which was discovered in outburst in 2007 March.
Our observations span a period of ~ 80 days starting from 2007 March 28 when
the nova was at its maximum light. The evolution of the spectra are shown from
the initial P-Cygni phase to an emission-line phase and finally to a dust
formation stage. The characteristics of the JHK spectra are very similar to
those observed in a nova outburst occurring on a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. We
analyse an observed line at 2.088 micron and suggest it could be due to FeII
excited by Lyman alpha fluorescence. The highlight of the observations is the
detection of the first overtone bands of carbon monoxide (CO) in the 2.29 -
2.40 micron region. The CO bands are modeled to estimate the temperature and
mass of the emitting CO gas and also to place limits on the 12C/13C ratio. The
CO bands are recorded over several epochs thereby allowing a rare opportunity
to study its evolution from a phase of constant strength through a stage when
the CO is destroyed fairly rapidly. We compare the observed timescales involved
in the evolution of the CO emission and find a good agreement with model
predictions that investigate the chemistry in a nova outflow during the early
stages.
