The paper investigates cold molecules formation in the photoassociation of
two cold atoms by a strong laser pulse applied at short interatomic distances,
which lead to a molecular dynamics taking place in the light-induced
(adiabatic) potentials. A two electronic states model in the cesium dimer is
used to analyse the effects of this strong coupling regime and to show specific
results: i) acceleration of the ground state population to the inner zone due
to a non-impulsive regime of coupling at short and intermediate interatomic
distances; ii) formation of cold molecules in strongly bound levels of the
ground state, where the population at the end of the pulse is much bigger than
the population photoassociated in bound levels of the excited state; iii) the
final momentum distribution of the ground state wavepacket keeping the
signatures of the maxima in the initial wavefunction continuum. It is shown
that the topology of the light-induced potentials plays an important role in
dynamics.
