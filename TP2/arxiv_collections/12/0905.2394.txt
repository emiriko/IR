We study the minimal SUGRA phenomenology in the case of an alternative seesaw
mechanism for generating neutrino masses. Changes in the neutrino sector lead
to a modification of the supersymmetric particle spectrum and the sneutrino
naturally arises as the lightest supersymmetric particle. The obtained
sneutrino has a relic density within the WMAP range and is compatible with
present nuclear recoil bounds.
