We present two ready-to-use numerical algorithms to evaluate convex-roof
extensions of arbitrary pure-state entanglement monotones. Their implementation
leaves the user merely with the task of calculating derivatives of the
respective pure-state measure. We provide numerical tests of the algorithms and
demonstrate their good convergence properties. We further employ them in order
to investigate the entanglement in particular few-spins systems at finite
temperature. Namely, we consider ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange-coupled
spin-1/2 rings subject to an inhomogeneous in-plane field geometry obeying full
rotational symmetry around the axis perpendicular to the ring through its
center. We demonstrate that highly entangled states can be obtained in these
systems at sufficiently low temperatures and by tuning the strength of a
magnetic field configuration to an optimal value which is identified
numerically.
