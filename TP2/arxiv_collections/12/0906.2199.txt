We have analysed 1455 fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars of the Galactic field,
using the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data. The sample covers 75% of the
sky and contains objects in the close neighbourhood of the Sun, within 4 kpc
distance. Unlike in the previous analysis of the close field RRab, we see a
clear manifestation of the Oosterhoff groups on the period - amplitude diagram.
The relation for Oosterhoff I type variables becomes strongly flattened at
large V amplitudes, which was not observed for globular cluster RR Lyrae. We
calculate photometric metallicities using two available methods: one of Jurcsik
& Kovacs (1996) and the other of Sandage (2004). We find significant
discrepancies between results from both methods. Comparison with spectroscopic
metallicities undoubtedly favors the method of Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996). In
addition, we notice that RRab of Oosterhoff II type might follow a different
metallicity-period-phase relation than Oosterhoff I type variables. The spatial
distribution of Galactic field RRab does not show any metallicity gradients
with distance from the Galactic Center in either of the Oosterhoff groups.
However, both the older, metal poor Oosterhoff II variables and the metal rich
Oosterhoff I RRab become more concentrated to the Galactic plane with
increasing metal content.
