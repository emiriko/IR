In the field of optimal transport theory, an optimal map is known to be a
gradient map of a potential function satisfying cost-convexity. In this paper,
the Jacobian determinant of a gradient map is shown to be log-concave with
respect to a convex combination of the potential functions when the underlying
manifold is the sphere and the cost function is the distance squared. The proof
uses the non-negative cross-curvature property of the sphere recently
established by Kim and McCann, and Figalli and Rifford. As an application to
statistics, a new family of probability densities on the sphere is defined in
terms of cost-convex functions. The log-concave property of the likelihood
function follows from the inequality.
