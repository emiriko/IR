We study the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in a quark-gluon core model
framework, which can be viewed as an extension of the Isgur-Karl model of
baryons. Using this picture we derive nucleon electromagnetic dipole form
factors at low Q^2 and the deviation from the dipole form at high Q^2, that are
consistent with the existing experimental data.
