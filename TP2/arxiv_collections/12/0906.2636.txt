Photon plus jet production has been studied by the D0 experiment in Run II of
the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at a centre of mass energy of sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV.
Measurements of the inclusive photon, inclusive photon plus jet, photon plus
heavy flavour jet cross sections and double parton interactions in photon plus
three jet events are presented. They are based on integrated luminosities
between 0.4 fb$^-1 and 1.0 fb^-1. The results are compared to perturbative QCD
calculations in various approximations.
