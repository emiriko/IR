The cosmic ray data of PAMELA/ATIC may be explained by dark matter decay with
a decay rate $\tau_{DM}^{-1}\sim 10^{-26}{sec}^{-1} \sim 10^{-45}{eV}$, an
energy scale which could not be understood within the framework of the standard
model or its simple supersymmetric extension. We propose anomaly induced dark
matter decay to exponentially suppress the decay rate, and apply to a
supersymmetric extension of the Ma's inert Higgs model of the radiative seesaw
mechanism for neutrino masses. In this model the lightest right-handed neutrino
$\psi_N$ and the lightest neutralino $\chi$ can fill the observed necessary
dark matter relic, and we find that $\psi_N$ can decay into $\chi$ through
anomaly with a right order of decay rate, emitting only leptons. All the
emitted poistrons are right-handed.
