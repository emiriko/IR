In this paper we study deformation, failure and breakage of visco-elastic
thin films of aging laponite suspension under tensile deformation field.
Aqueous suspension of laponite is known to undergo waiting time dependent
evolution of its micro-structure, also known as aging, which is accompanied by
an increase in the elastic modulus and relaxation time. In the velocity
controlled tensile deformation experiments, we observed that the dependence of
force and dissipated energy on velocity and initial thickness of the film is
intermediate to a Newtonian fluid and a yield stress fluid. For a fixed waiting
time, strain at break and dissipated energy increased with velocity, but
decreased with initial thickness. With increase in age, strain at break and
dissipated energy showed a decrease suggesting enhanced brittle behavior with
increase in waiting time, which may be caused by restricted relaxation modes
due to aging. In a force controlled mode, decrease in strain at failure at
higher age also suggested enhanced brittleness with increase in waiting time.
Remarkably, the constant force tensile deformation data up to the point of
failure showed experimental time- aging time superposition that gave an
independent estimation of relaxation time and elastic modulus dependence on
age.
