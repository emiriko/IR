The generalized Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule is evaluated for the
contribution of single pion production on the deuteron by explicit integration
up to an energy of 1.5 GeV for both coherent and incoherent production. As
elementary $\gamma^* N\to\pi N$ amplitude the MAID2003 model has been used. For
incoherent production final state interaction is included in the final $NN$ and
$\pi N$ subsystems. The resulting contribution to the generalized transverse
GDH sum rule is considerably smaller than the negative contribution from the
disintegration channel $d(e,e')np$ which dominates the sum rule at low $Q^2$.
