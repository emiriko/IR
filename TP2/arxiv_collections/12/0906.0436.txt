It is shown that three of the four Brans solutions of classes I--IV admit
wormhole geometry. Two-way traversable wormholes in the Brans-Dicke theory are
allowed not only for the negative values of the coupling parameter w (w<-2), as
concluded earlier, but also for arbitrary positive values of w (w<infinity). It
also follows that the scalar field f plays the role of exotic matter violating
the weak energy condition.
