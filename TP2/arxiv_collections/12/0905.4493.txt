The spin-flip rate that couples dark and bright excitons in self-assembled
quantum dots is obtained from time-resolved spontaneous emission measurements
in a modified local density of optical states. Employing this technique, we can
separate effects due to non-radiative recombination and unambiguously record
the spin-flip rate. The dependence of the spin-flip rate on emission energy is
compared in detail to a recent model from the literature, where the spin flip
is due to the combined action of short-range exchange interaction and acoustic
phonons. We furthermore observe a surprising enhancement of the spin-flip rate
close to a semiconductor-air interface, which illustrates the important role of
interfaces for quantum dot based nanophotonic structures. Our work is an
important step towards a full understanding of the complex dynamics of quantum
dots in nanophotonic structures, such as photonic crystals, and dark excitons
are potentially useful for long-lived coherent storage applications.
