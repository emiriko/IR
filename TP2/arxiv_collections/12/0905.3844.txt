We analyze the effect of plasma screening on nuclear reaction rates in dense
matter composed of atomic nuclei of one or two types. We perform semiclassical
calculations of the Coulomb barrier penetrability taking into account a radial
mean field potential of plasma ions. The mean field potential is extracted from
the results of extensive Monte Carlo calculations of radial pair distribution
functions of ions in binary ionic mixtures. We calculate the reaction rates in
a wide range of plasma parameters and approximate these rates by an analytical
expression that is expected to be applicable for multicomponent ions mixtures.
Also, we analyze Gamow-peak energies of reacting ions in various nuclear
burning regimes. For illustration, we study nuclear burning in C-O mixtures.
