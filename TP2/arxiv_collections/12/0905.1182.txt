This paper theoretically discusses the photon emission spectra of a
superconducting pn-junction. On the basis of the second order perturbation
theory for electron-photon interaction, we show that the recombination of a
Cooper with two p-type carriers causes drastic enhancement of the luminescence
intensity. The calculated results of photon emission spectra explain
characteristic features of observed signal in an recent experiment. Our results
indicate high functionalities of superconducting light-emitting devices.
