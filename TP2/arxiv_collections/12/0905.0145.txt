We present far-ultraviolet photometry obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 0513-40 in the globular cluster NGC
1851. Our observations reveal a clear, roughly sinusoidal periodic signal with
$P \simeq 17$ min and amplitude 3%-10%. The signal appears fully coherent and
can be modelled as a simple reprocessing effect associated with the changing
projected area presented by the irradiated face of a white dwarf donor star in
the system. All of these properties suggest that the signal we have detected is
orbital in nature, thus confirming 4U 0513-40 as an ultracompact X-ray binary
(UCXB). All four confirmed UCXBs in globular clusters have orbital periods
below 30 minutes, whereas almost all UCXBs in the Galactic field have orbital
periods longer than this. This suggests that the dynamical formation processes
dominate UCXB production in clusters, producing a different orbital period
distribution than observed among field UCXBs. Based on the likely system
parameters, we show that 4U 0513-40 should be a strong gravitational wave
source and may be detectable by LISA over the course of a multi-year mission.
