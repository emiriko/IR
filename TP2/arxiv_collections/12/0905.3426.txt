In future high-cadence microlensing surveys, planets can be detected through
a new channel of an independent event produced by the planet itself. The two
populations of planets to be detected through this channel are wide-separation
planets and free-floating planets. Although they appear as similar short
time-scale events, the two populations of planets are widely different in
nature and thus distinguishing them is important. In this paper, we investigate
the lensing properties of events produced by planets with moderately wide
separations from host stars. We find that the lensing behavior of these events
is well described by the Chang-Refsdal lensing and the shear caused by the
primary not only produces a caustic but also makes the magnification contour
elongated along the primary-planet axis. The elongated magnification contour
implies that the light curves of these planetary events are generally
asymmetric and thus the asymmetry can be used to distinguish the events from
those produced by free-floating planets. The asymmetry can be noticed from the
overall shape of the light curve and thus can hardly be missed unlike the very
short-duration central perturbation caused by the caustic. In addition, the
asymmetry occurs regardless of the event magnification and thus the bound
nature of the planet can be identified for majority of these events. The close
approximation of the lensing light curve to that of the Chang-Refsdal lensing
implies that the analysis of the light curve yields only the information about
the projected separation between the host star and the planet.
