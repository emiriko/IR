We systematically investigate the mass spectra of
$\{Q\bar{s}\}\{\bar{Q}^{(')}s\}$ molecular states in the framework of QCD sum
rules. The interpolating currents representing the molecular states are
proposed. Technically, contributions of the operators up to dimension six are
included in operator product expansion (OPE). The masses for molecular states
with various $\{Q\bar{s}\}\{\bar{Q}^{(')}s\}$ configurations are presented. The
result $4.36\pm0.08 GeV$ for the $D_{s}^{*}\bar{D}_{s0}^{*}$ molecular state is
consistent with the mass $4350^{+4.6}_{-5.1}\pm0.7 MeV$ of the newly observed
$X(4350)$, which could support $X(4350)$ interpreted as a
$D_{s}^{*}\bar{D}_{s0}^{*}$ molecular state.
