Let S be a closed surface of genus g >= 2 and z in S a marked point. We prove
that the subgroup of the mapping class group Map(S,z) corresponding to the
fundamental group pi_1(S,z) of the closed surface does not lift to the group of
diffeomorphisms of S fixing z. As a corollary, we show that the Atiyah-Kodaira
surface bundles admit no invariant flat connection, and obtain another proof of
Morita's non-lifting theorem.
