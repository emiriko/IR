We present a relativistic calculation of the saturation properties of nuclear
matter which contains the correlation energy. Pion loops are incorporated on
top of a relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) approach based on a chiral theory. It
includes the effect of nucleon structure through its response to the background
chiral invariant scalar field. All the parameters which enter the RHF
calculation are fixed or strongly constrained by hadron phenomenology or
lattice data. The new input for the correlation energy is the Landau-Migdal
parameter g? governing the short-range part of the spin-isospin interaction. We
find that the inclusion of the correlation energy improves the description of
the saturation properties of nuclear matter.
