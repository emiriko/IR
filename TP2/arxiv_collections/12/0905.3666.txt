The photoconductance properties of photosystem I (PSI) covalently bound to
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are measured. We demonstrate that the PSI forms active
electronic junctions with the CNTs enabling control of the CNTs
photoconductance by the PSI. In order to electrically contact the photoactive
proteins, a cysteine mutant is generated at one end of the PSI by genetic
engineering. The CNTs are covalently bound to this reactive group using
carbodiimide chemistry. We detect an enhanced photoconductance signal of the
hybrid material at photon wavelengths resonant to the absorption maxima of the
PSI compared to nonresonant wavelengths. The measurements prove that it is
feasible to integrate photosynthetic proteins into optoelectronic circuits at
the nanoscale.
