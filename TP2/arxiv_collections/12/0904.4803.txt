If the main use of colour measurement is the metrology, it is now possible to
find industrial control applications which uses this information. Using colour
in process control leads to specific problems where human perception has to be
replaced by colour sensors. This paper relies on the fuzzy representation of
colours that can be taken into account by fuzzy controllers. If smart sensors
already include intelligent functionalities like signal processing, or
configuration, only few of them include functionalities to elaborate the fuzzy
representation of measurements. In this paper, we develop a solution where the
numeric processing is performed locally by the sensor, and where fuzzy
processing is exported towards another computing resource by means of the CAN
network. This paper presents the concept and the application to a smart fuzzy
spectrometer.
