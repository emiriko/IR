Recently there has been paid much attention to phenomena caused by local
anharmonic vibrations of the guest ions encapsulated in polyhedral cages of
materials such as pyrochlore oxides, filled skutterdites and clathrates. We
theoretically investigate the optical conductivity solely due to these
so-called rattling phonons in a one-dimensional anharmonic potential model. The
dipole interaction of the guest ions with electric fields induces excitations
expressed as transitions among vibrational states with non-equally spaced
energies, resulting in a natural line broadening and a shift of the peak
frequency as anharmonic effects. In the case of a single well potential, a
softening of the peak frequency and an asymmetric narrowing of the line width
with decreasing temperature are understood as a shift of the spectral weight to
lower level transitions. On the other hand, the case of a double minima
potential leads to a multi-splitting of a spectral peak in the conductivity
spectrum with decreasing temperature.
