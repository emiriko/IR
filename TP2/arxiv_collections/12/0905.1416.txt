We study the ensemble optical variability of 276 FSRQs and 86 BL Lacs in the
Palomar-QUEST Survey with the goal of searching for common fluctuation
properties, examining the range of behavior across the sample, and
characterizing the appearance of blazars in such a survey so that future work
can more easily identify such objects. The survey, which covers 15,000 square
degrees multiple times over 3.5 years, allows for the first ensemble blazar
study of this scale. Variability amplitude distributions are shown for the FSRQ
and BL Lac samples for numerous time lags, and also studied through structure
function analyses. Individual blazars show a wide range of variability
amplitudes, timescales, and duty cycles. Of the best sampled objects, 35% are
seen to vary by more than 0.4 magnitudes; for these, the fraction of
measurements contributing to the high amplitude variability ranges constantly
from about 5% to 80%. Blazar variability has some similarities to that of type
I quasars but includes larger amplitude fluctuations on all timescales. FSRQ
variability amplitudes are particularly similar to those of QSOs on timescales
of several months, suggesting significant contributions from the accretion disk
to the variable flux at these timescales. Optical variability amplitudes are
correlated with the maximum apparent velocities of the radio jet for the subset
of FSRQs with MOJAVE VLBA measurements, implying that the optically variable
flux's strength is typically related to that of the radio emission. We also
study CRATES radio-selected FSRQ candidates, which show similar variability
characteristics to known FSRQs; this suggests a high purity for the CRATES
sample.
