A search for single top quark production is performed in the full ep data
sample collected by the H1 experiment at HERA, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 474 pb^-1. Decays of top quarks into a b quark and a W boson with
subsequent leptonic or hadronic decay of the W are investigated. A multivariate
analysis is performed to discriminate top quark production from Standard Model
background processes. An upper limit on the top quark production cross section
via flavour changing neutral current processes sigma (ep -> etX) < 0.25 pb is
established at 95% CL. Limits on the anomalous coupling kappa_{tu gamma} are
derived.
