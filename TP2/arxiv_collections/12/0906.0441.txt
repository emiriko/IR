We study the Deffuant et al. model for continuous--opinion dynamics under the
influence of noise. In the original version of this model, individuals meet in
random pairwise encounters after which they compromise or not depending of a
confidence parameter. Free will is introduced in the form of noisy
perturbations: individuals are given the opportunity to change their opinion,
with a given probability, to a randomly selected opinion inside the whole
opinion space. We derive the master equation of this process. One of the main
effects of noise is to induce an order-disorder transition. In the disordered
state the opinion distribution tends to be uniform, while for the ordered state
a set of well defined opinion groups are formed, although with some opinion
spread inside them. Using a linear stability analysis we can derive approximate
conditions for the transition between opinion groups and the disordered state.
The master equation analysis is compared with direct Monte-Carlo simulations.
We find that the master equation and the Monte-Carlo simulations do not always
agree due to finite-size induced fluctuations that we analyze in some detail.
