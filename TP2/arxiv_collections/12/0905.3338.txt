We evaluate the place of Eta Carinae amongst the class of luminous blue
variables (LBVs) and show that the LBV phenomenon is not restricted to
extremely luminous objects like Eta Car, but extends luminosities as low as
log(L/Lsun) = 5.4 - corresponding to initial masses ~25 Msun, and final masses
as low as ~10-15 Msun. We present a census of S Doradus variability, and
discuss basic LBV properties, their mass-loss behaviour, and whether at maximum
light they form pseudo-photospheres. We argue that those objects that exhibit
giant Eta Car-type eruptions are most likely related to the more common type of
S Doradus variability. Alternative atmospheric models as well as
sub-photospheric models for the instability are presented, but the true nature
of the LBV phenomenon remains as yet elusive. We end with a discussion on the
evolutionary status of LBVs - highlighting recent indications that some LBVs
may be in a direct pre-supernova state, in contradiction to the standard
paradigm for massive star evolution.
