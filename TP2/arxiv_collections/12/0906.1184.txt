Polarization that is produced by coherent scattering can be modified by
magnetic fields via the Hanle effect. According to standard theory the Hanle
effect should only be operating in the Doppler core of spectral lines but not
in the wings. In contrast, our observations of the scattering polarization in
the Ca {\sc i} 4227 \AA line reveals the existence of spatial variations of the
scattering polarization throughout the far line wings. This raises the question
whether the observed spatial variations in wing polarization have a magnetic or
non-magnetic origin. A magnetic origin may be possible if elastic collisions
are able to cause sufficient frequency redistribution to make the Hanle effect
effective in the wings without causing excessive collisional depolarization, as
suggested by recent theories for partial frequency redistribution with coherent
scattering in magnetic fields. To model the wing polarization we apply an
extended version of the technique based on the "last scattering approximation".
This model is highly successful in reproducing the observed Stokes $Q/I$
polarization (linear polarization parallel to the nearest solar limb),
including the location of the wing polarization maxima and the minima around
the Doppler core, but it fails to reproduce the observed spatial variations of
the wing polarization in terms of magnetic field effects with frequency
redistribution. This null result points in the direction of a non-magnetic
origin in terms of local inhomogeneities (varying collisional depolarization,
radiation-field anisotropies, and deviations from a plane-parallel atmospheric
stratification).
