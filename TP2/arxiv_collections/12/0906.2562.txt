For the first time, the morphology and dynamics of spin avalanches in
Mn12-Acetate crystals using magneto-optical imaging has been explored. We
observe an inhomogeneous relaxation of the magnetization, the spins reversing
first at one edge of the crystal and a few milliseconds later at the other end.
Our data fit well with the theory of magnetic deflagration, demonstrating that
very slow deflagration rates can be obtained, which makes new types of
experiments possible.
