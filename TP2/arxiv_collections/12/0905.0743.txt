High-resolution hard X-ray photoemission measurements have been performed to
clarify the electronic structure originating from the strong correlation
between electrons in bulk Ce 3$d$ core-level spectra of
CeNi$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Ge$_2$ (0 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 1). In the Ce 3$d_{5/2}$
core-level spectra, the variation of satellite structures ($f^2$ peaks) shows
that the hybridization strength between Ce 4$f$- and conduction electrons
gradually increases with Co concentration in good agreement with the results of
Ce 3$d-4f$ and 4$d-4f$ resonant photoemission spectroscopies. Particularly, in
Ce 3$d_{3/2}$ core-level spectra, the multiplet structures of $f^1$ peaks
systematically change with the degeneracy of $f$-states which originates from
crystalline electric field effects.
