We present the results of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations
of the interacting system Arp86 in both neutral atomic hydrogen, HI, and in
radio continuum at 240, 606 and 1394 MHz. In addition to HI emission from the
two dominant galaxies, NGC7752 and NGC7753, these observations show a complex
distribution of HI tails and bridges due to tidal interactions. The regions of
highest column density appear related to the recent sites of intense star
formation. HI column densities $\sim1-$1.5 $\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ have been
detected in the tidal bridge which is bright in Spitzer image as well. We also
detect HI emission from the galaxy 2MASX J23470758+2926531, which is shown to
be a part of this system. We discuss the possibility that this could be a tidal
dwarf galaxy. The radio continuum observations show evidence of a non-thermal
bridge between NGC7752 and NGC7753, and a radio source in the nuclear region of
NGC7753 consistent with it having a LINER nucleus.
