Power grids are prone to failure. Time series of reliability measures such as
total power loss or energy not supplied can give significant account of the
underlying dynamical behavior of these systems, specially when the resulting
probability distributions present remarkable features such as an algebraic
tail, for example. In this paper, seven years (from 2002 to 2008) of Europe's
transport of electricity network failure events have been analyzed and the best
fit for this empirical data probability distribution is presented. With the
actual span of available data and although there exists a moderate support for
the power law model, the relatively small amount of events contained in the
function's tail suggests that other causal factors might be significantly
ruling the system's dynamics.
