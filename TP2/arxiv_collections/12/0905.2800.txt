We identify the dual geometry of the hadron phase of dense nuclear matter and
investigate the confinement/deconfinement phase transition. We suggest that the
low temperature phase of the RN black hole with the full backreaction of the
bulk gauge field is described by the zero mass limit of the RN black hole with
hard wall. We calculated the density dependence of critical temperature and
found that the phase diagram closes. We also study the density dependence of
the rho meson mass.
