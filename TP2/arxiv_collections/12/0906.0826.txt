We present a scheme for asymmetric quantum information splitting, where a
sender distributes asymmetrically a qubit to distant agents in a network. The
asymmetric distribution leads to that the agents have different powers to
reconstruct the sender's qubit. In other words, the authorities of the agents
for getting the quantum secret are hierarchized. The scheme does not need the
agents to get together and make nonlocal operations. Our scheme can also be
modified to implement controlled teleportation against uncooperation of part of
supervisors.
