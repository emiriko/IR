We consider the two-point function of nucleon current in nuclear matter and
write a QCD sum rule to analyse the residue of the nucleon pole as a function
of nuclear density. The nucleon self-energy needed for the sum rule is taken as
input from calculations using phenomenological NN potential. Our result shows a
decrease in the residue with increasing nuclear density, as is known to be the
case with similar quantities.
