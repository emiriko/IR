The ordering of charges on half-filled hypercubic lattices is investigated
numerically, where electroneutrality is ensured by background charges. This
system is equivalent to the $s = 1/2$ Ising lattice model with
antiferromagnetic $1/r$ interaction. The temperature dependences of specific
heat, mean staggered occupation, and of a generalized susceptibility indicate
continuous order-disorder phase transitions at finite temperatures in two- and
three-dimensional systems. In contrast, the susceptibility of the
one-dimensional system exhibits singular behavior at vanishing temperature. For
the two- and three-dimensional cases, the critical exponents are obtained by
means of a finite-size scaling analysis. Their values are consistent with those
of the Ising model with short-range interaction, and they imply that the
studied model cannot belong to any other known universality class. Samples of
up to 1400, $112^2$, and $22^3$ sites are considered for dimensions 1 to 3,
respectively.
