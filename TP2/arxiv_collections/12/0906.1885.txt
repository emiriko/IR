A beam splitter is one of the most important devices in an optics laboratory
because of its handiness and versatility; equivalent devices are found in
various quantum systems to couple two subsystems or to interfere them. While it
is normal that two independent input fields are superposed at the beam splitter
to give correlated outputs, identical Gaussian states interfere there to
produce totally independent output fields. We prove that Gaussian states with
same the variance are the only states which bring about factorizable output
fields.
