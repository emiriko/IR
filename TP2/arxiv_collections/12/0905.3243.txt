Primordial Black Holes evaporate due to Hawking radiation. We find that the
evaporation time of primordial black holes increase when accretion of radiation
is included.Thus depending on accretion efficiency more and more number of
primordial black holes are existing today, which strengthens the idea that the
primordial black holes are the proper candidate for dark matter.
