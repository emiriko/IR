We propose an exact method which combines the resolution search and branch &
bound algorithms for solving the 0?1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem. This
algorithm is able to prove large?scale strong correlated instances. The optimal
values of the 10 constraint, 500 variable instances of the OR-Library are
exposed. These values were previously unknown.
