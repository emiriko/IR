We report on a short XMM-Newton observation of the gravitationally-lensed,
luminous infrared galaxy IRAS F10214+4724 at z=2.3. A faint X-ray source is
detected at 4 sigma. The observed 0.5-2 keV (1.7-6.6 keV in the rest-frame)
flux is 1.3e-15 erg/s/cm2 and the spectral slope in the rest-frame 1-10 keV
band is Gamma~2. These results agree with those obtained from the Chandra X-ray
Observatory, given the large uncertainties in both measurements. While possible
evidence for excess emission above 5 keV is seen, we suspect this excess might
be either spurious or not related to the infrared galaxy.
