We consider a Josephson junction with an arbitrary transmission coefficient
$\mathcal{D}$ between a singlet and a triplet superconductor with the latter
order parameter characterized by a d-vector of the form
($k_x\hat{y}-k_y\hat{x}$). Various quantities such as the tunnelling current,
spin accumulation, and spin current are calculated via the quasiclassical
Green's functions. We also present a symmetry argument on the existence of
these quantities and their dependencies on the phase difference across the
junction. A physical picture is also given in terms of the Andreev states near
the junction.
