Shear viscosity of the gluon plasma in SU(3) YM theory is calculated
nonperturbatively, within the stochastic vacuum model. The result for the ratio
of the shear viscosity to the entropy density, proportional to the squared
chromo-magnetic gluon condensate and the fifth power of the correlation length
of the chromo-magnetic vacuum, falls off with the increase of temperature. At
temperatures larger than the deconfinement critical temperature by a factor of
2, this fall-off is determined by the sixth power of the temperature-dependent
strong-coupling constant and yields an asymptotic approach to the conjectured
lower bound of 1/(4\pi), achievable in {\cal N}=4 SYM theory. As a by-product
of the calculation, we find a particular form of the two-point correlation
function of gluonic field strengths, which is the only one consistent with the
Lorentzian shape of the shear-viscosity spectral function.
