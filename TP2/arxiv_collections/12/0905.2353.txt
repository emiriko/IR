We present a compact sample holder equipped with electromagnets and high
frequency transmission lines; the sample holder is intended for combined x-ray
magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and ferromagnetic resonance measurements
(FMR). Time-resolved measurements of resonant x-ray detected FMR during forced
precession are enabled by use of a rf excitation that is phase-locked to the
storage ring bunch clock. Several applications of the combined XMCD + FMR
technique are presented, demonstrating the flexibility of the experimental
design.
