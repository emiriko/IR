Magneto-transport measurements on electrons confined to a 57 nm-wide, GaAs
quantum well reveal that the correlated electron states at low Landau level
fillings ($\nu$) display a remarkable dependence on the symmetry of the
electron charge distribution. At a density of $1.93 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$,
a developing fractional quantum Hall state is observed at the even-denominator
filling $\nu = 1/4$ when the distribution is symmetric, but it quickly vanishes
when the distribution is made asymmetric. At lower densities, as we make the
charge distribution asymmetric, we observe a rapid strengthening of the
insulating phases that surround the $\nu = 1/5$ fractional quantum Hall state.
