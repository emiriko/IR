We present a comprehensive collection of ultracold three-body collisions
properties near overlapping Feshbach resonances. Our results incorporate
variations of all scattering lengths and demonstrate novel collisional
behavior, such as atom-molecule interference effects. Taking advantage of the
unique ways in which these collisions reflect Efimov physics, new pathways to
control atomic and molecular losses open up. Further, we show that overlapping
resonances can greatly improve the chances of observing multiple Efimov
features in an ultracold quantum gas for nearly any system.
