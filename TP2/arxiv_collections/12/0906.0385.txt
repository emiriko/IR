We suggest the point of view that the Schubert classes of the affine
Grassmannian of a simple algebraic group should be considered as Schur-positive
symmetric functions. In particular, we give a geometric explanation of the
Schur positivity of k-Schur functions (at t = 1). We also put this in the
context of the theory of combinatorial Hopf algebras.
