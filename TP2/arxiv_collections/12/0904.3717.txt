We extract directly (for the first time) the charmed (C=1) and bottom (B=-1)
heavy-baryons (spin 1/2 and 3/2) mass-splittings due to SU(3) breaking using
double ratios of QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) in full QCD, which are less
sensitive to the exact value and definition of the heavy quark mass, to the
perturbative radiative corrections and to the QCD continuum contributions than
the simple ratios commonly used for determining the heavy baryon masses.
Noticing that most of the mass-splittings are mainly controlled by the ratio
kappa= <\bar ss>/<\bar dd> of the condensate, we extract this ratio, by
allowing 1 sigma deviation from the observed masses of the Xi_{c,b} and of the
Omega_c. We obtain: kappa=0.74(3), which improves the existing estimates:
\kappa=0.70(10) from light hadrons. Using this value, we deduce
M_{Omega_b}=6078.5(27.4) MeV which agrees with the recent CDF data but
disagrees by 2.4 sigma with the one from D0. Predictions of the Xi'_Q and of
the spectra of spin 3/2 baryons containing one or two strange quark are given
in Table 2. Predictions of the hyperfine splittings Omega*_Q- Omega_Q and
Xi*_Q-Xi_Q are also given in Table 3. Starting for a general choice of the
interpolating currents for the spin 1/2 baryons, our analysis favours the
optimal value of the mixing angle b= (-1/5 -- 0) found from light and
non-strange heavy baryons.
