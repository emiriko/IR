Thermodynamic and dynamical properties of systems with long range pairwise
interactions (LRI) which decay as 1/r^{d+\sigma} at large distances r in $d$
dimensions are reviewed in these Notes. Two broad classes of such systems are
identified: (a) systems with a slow decay of the interactions, termed "strong"
LRI, where the energy is super-extensive. These systems are characterized by
unusual properties such as inequivalence of ensembles, negative specific heat,
slow decay of correlations and ergodicity breaking. And (b) systems with faster
decay of the interaction potential where the energy is additive, thus resulting
in less dramatic effects. These interaction affect the thermodynamic behavior
of systems near phase transitions, where long range correlations are naturally
present. Long range correlations are often present in systems driven out of
equilibrium when the dynamics involves conserved quantities. Steady state
properties of driven systems are considered within the framework outlined
above.
