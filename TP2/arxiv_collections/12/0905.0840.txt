We present a theoretical model and respective numerical simulation of
cascaded four-wave mixing of femtosecond pulses in bulk chi(3) media,
evidencing the importance of two-dimensional interaction geometries in the
efficient generation of frequency-converted beams, and in agreement with the
experimental results in terms spectral and spatial distribution and efficiency,
demonstrating compression without the need of complex amplitude or phase
control.
