We propose and analyze a setup to achieve strong coupling between a single
trapped atom and a mechanical oscillator. The interaction between the motion of
the atom and the mechanical oscillator is mediated by a quantized light field
in a laser driven high-finesse cavity. In particular, we show that high
fidelity transfer of quantum states between the atom and the mechanical
oscillator is in reach for existing or near future experimental parameters. Our
setup provides the basic toolbox for coherent manipulation, preparation and
measurement of micro- and nanomechanical oscillators via the tools of atomic
physics.
