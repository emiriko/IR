The coefficient space is a kind of resolution of singularities of the
universal flat deformation space for a given Galois representation of some
local field. It parameterizes (in some sense) the finite flat models for the
Galois representation. The aim of this note is to determine the image of the
coefficient space in the universal deformation space.
