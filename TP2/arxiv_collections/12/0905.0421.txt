We propose and study a modified version of the Olami-Feder-Christiensen model
of seismicity, that includes a mechanism of structural relaxation. We obtain
realistic features of seismicity that are not obtained with the original
version, mainly: aftershocks that obey the Omori law and cluster spatially
around the slip surface of the main shock, and averaged frictional properties
qualitatively similar to those observed in rock friction, in particular the
velocity weakening effect.
