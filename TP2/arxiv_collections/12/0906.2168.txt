We show that coherent control of the steady-state long-distance entanglement
between pairs of cavity-atom systems in an array of lossy and driven coupled
resonators is possible. The cavities are doped with atoms and are connected
through wave guides, other cavities or fibers depending on the implementation.
We find that the steady-state entanglement can be coherently controlled through
the tuning of the phase difference between the driving fields. It can also be
surprisingly high in spite of the pumps being classical fields. For some
implementations where the connecting element can be a fiber, long-distance
steady state quantum correlations can be established. Furthermore, the maximal
of entanglement for any pair is achieved when their corresponding direct
coupling is much smaller than their individual couplings to the third party.
This effect is reminiscent of the establishment of coherence between otherwise
uncoupled atomic levels using classical coherent fields. We suggest a method to
measure this entanglement by analyzing the correlations of the emitted photons
from the array and also analyze the above results for a range of values of the
system parameters, different network geometries and possible implementation
technologies.
