In this paper the massive neutrinos model arising due to the Snyder
noncommutative geometry, proposed recently by the author is partially
developed. By straightforward calculation it is shown that the masses of the
chiral left- and right-handed Weyl fields treated as parameters fixed by
experiments, lead to the consistent physical picture of the noncommutative
geometry, and consequently yield renormalization of an energy of a relativistic
particle and exact integrability within the proposed model. This feature of the
model in itself both defines and emphasizes its significance and possible
usefulness for both theory as well as phenomenology for high energy physics and
astrophysics.
