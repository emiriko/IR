In ferromagnets, charge currents can excite magnons via the spin-orbit
coupling. We develop a novel and general scattering theory of charge current
induced macrospin magnetization torques in normal metal$|$ferromagnet$|$normal
metal layers. We apply the formalism to a dirty GaAs$|$(Ga,Mn)As$|$GaAs system.
By computing the charge current induced magnetization torques and solving the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find magnetization switching for current
densities as low as $ 5\times 10^{6}$~A/cm$^2$. Our results are in agreement
with a recent experimental observation of charge-current induced magnetization
switching in (Ga,Mn)As.
