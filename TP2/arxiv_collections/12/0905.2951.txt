We investigated the effect of on-site Coulomb interactions on the structural
and magnetic ground state of the fullerene C$_{20}$ based on
density-functional-theory calculations within the local density approximation
plus on-site Coulomb corrections (LDA+$U$). The total energies of the high
symmetry ($I_{h}$) and distorted ($D_{3d}$) structures of C$_{20}$ were
calculated for different spin configurations. The ground state configurations
were found to depend on the forms of exchange-correlation potentials and the
on-site Coulomb interaction parameter $U$, reflecting the subtle nature of the
competition between Jahn-Teller distortion and magnetic instability in
fullerene C$_{20}$. While the non-magnetic state of the distorted $D_{3d}$
structure is robust for small $U$, a magnetic ground state of the undistorted
$I_{h}$ structure emerges for $U$ larger than 4 eV when the LDA
exchange-correlation potential is employed.
