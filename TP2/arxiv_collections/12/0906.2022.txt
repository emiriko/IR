The appearance of a natural dark matter candidate, the neutralino, is among
the principal successes of minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) and its descendents.
In lieu of a suitable ultraviolet completion, however, theories of
gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking such as mSUGRA suffer from arbitrary
degrees of flavor violation. Though theories of gauge-mediated supersymmetry
breaking are free from such prohibitive flavor violation, they typically lack
natural neutralino dark matter candidates. Yet this conventional dichotomy
breaks down when the hidden sector is strongly coupled; in models of
gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, the neutralino may be the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP) if the fields of the hidden sector possess large
anomalous dimensions. In fact, general models of so-called "sequestered" gauge
mediation possess the full richness of neutralino dark matter found in mSUGRA
without corresponding flavor problems. Here we explore generalized models of
sequestered gauge mediation and the rich variety of neutralino dark matter they
exhibit.
