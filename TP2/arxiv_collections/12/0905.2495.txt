A simple non-interferometric "quantum interrogation" method is proposed which
uses evanescent wave sensing with frustrated total internal reflection on a
surface. The simple method has the advantage over the original interferometric
Elitzur-Vaidman method of being able to detect objects that are neither black
nor non-diffracting and that are such that they cannot be introduced into an
arm of an interferometer for whatever reason (e.g. its size, sensitivity,
etc.). The method is intrinsically of high efficiency.
