We describe the effects of disorder on the critical temperature of s-wave
superfluids from the BCS to the BEC regime, with direct application to
ultracold Fermi atoms. In the BCS regime the pair breaking and phase coherence
temperature scales are essentially the same allowing strong correlations
between the amplitude and phase of the order parameter. As non-pair breaking
disorder is introduced the largely overlapping Cooper pairs conspire to
maintain phase coherence such that the critical temperature remains essentially
unchanged. However, in the BEC regime the pair breaking and phase coherence
temperature scales are very different such that non-pair breaking disorder can
affect dramatically phase coherence, and thus the critical temperature, without
the requirement of breaking tightly-bound fermion pairs simultaneously.
Finally, we find that the superfluid is more robust against weak disorder in
the intermediate region between the two regimes.
