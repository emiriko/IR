The T-odd leptons predicted by the littlest $Higgs$ model with T-parity can
be pair produced via the subprocesses $gg\to \ell^{+}_{H}\ell^{-}_{H}$,
$q\bar{q}\to \ell^{+}_{H}\ell^{-}_{H}$, $\gamma\gamma\to
\ell^{+}_{H}\ell^{-}_{H}$ and $ VV \to \ell^{+}_{H}\ell^{-}_{H}$ ($V$=$W$ or
$Z$) at the $CERN$ Large Hadron Collider $(LHC)$. We estimate the hadronic
production cross sections for all of these processes and give a simply
phenomenology analysis. We find that the cross sections for most of the above
processes are very small. However, the value of the cross section for the
$Drell-Yan$ process $q\bar{q}\to \ell^{+}_{H}\ell^{-}_{H}$ can reach $270fb$.
