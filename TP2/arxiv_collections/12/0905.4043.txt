QJT is considered as a regularization of QFT, where the fields are replaced
by finite $p$-jets. The regularized phase space is infinite-dimensional,
because not all histories are determined by initial conditions. Gauge
symmetries are not fully preserved by the regularization, and gauge anomalies
arise. These anomalies are of a new type, not present in QFT. They generically
diverge when the regulator is removed, but can be made finite with a particular
choice of field content, provided that spacetime has at most four dimensions.
The field content appears to include unphysical fields that violate the
spin-statistics theorem.
