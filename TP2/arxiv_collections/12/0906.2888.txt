A Chebyshev expansion is a series in the basis of Chebyshev polynomials of
the first kind. When such a series solves a linear differential equation, its
coefficients satisfy a linear recurrence equation. We interpret this equation
as the numerator of a fraction of linear recurrence operators. This
interpretation lets us give a simple view of previous algorithms, analyze their
complexity, and design a faster one for large orders.
