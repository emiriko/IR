Structural, electrical and magnetic measurements of 115 single crystals of
PrIn$_5$ are reported. It has a tetragonal structure and has slightly lower
cell volume than its isomorphic counter part CeCoIn_5. The resistivity
saturates for T\geq 10K. Analysis of the resistivity for 10K<T< 60K indicates a
regular fermi liquid behavior. It does not exhibit superconductivity down to
T\sim 1K. The magnetic susceptibility analysis yielded the moment to be
4.00\mu_B indicating that the magnetism of PrCoIn_5 is dominated by Pr^{3+}
free ions with some admixture of the magnetic moment of the Co sublattice. The
paramagnetic Curie temperature \theta \sim-40K. At low temperatures the
susceptibility follows a broad maximum around T_N \sim 14.5K, and increases as
the temperature is lowered. The disappearance of superconductivity for T>1K is
attributed to chemical pressure effects and magnetic pair breaking.
