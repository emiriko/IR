Preliminary results on the measurement of four selected properties of the top
quark are presented. The relative fraction of $t\bar{t}$ production through
gluon fusion has been measured in the $t\bar{t}$ dilepton decay channel by the
CDF Collaboration as $F_{gg}=0.53^{+0.36}_{-0.38}$. Using an integrated
luminosity of 2.7 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the CDF II detector, we also
determine the $t\bar{t}$ differential cross section with respect to values up
to $\sim$1 TeV of the $t\bar{t}$ invariant mass. We present a model-independent
measurement of the helicity of $W$ bosons produced in top quark decays, using
an integrated luminosity of up to 2.7 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the D0 detector,
and find the fraction of longitudinal $W$ bosons $f_0=0.49\pm0.14$, and the
fraction of right-handed $W$ bosons $f_+=0.11\pm0.08$. Finally, we measure the
parton level forward-backward asymmetry of pair produced top quarks using an
integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the CDF II detector, and
find $A_{FB}=0.19\pm0.07$. All results are consistent with the predictions of
the standard model.
