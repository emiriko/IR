In the framework of the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the internal
dynamics of a gravitating system s embedded in a larger one S is affected by
the external background field E of S even if it is constant and uniform, thus
implying a violation of the Strong Equivalence Principle: it is the so-called
External Field Effect (EFE). In the case of the solar system, E would be
A_cen\approx 10^-10 m s^-2 because of its motion through the Milky Way: it is
orders of magnitude smaller than the main Newtonian monopole terms for the
planets. We address here the following questions in a purely phenomenological
manner: are the Sun's planets affected by an EFE as large as 10^-10 m s^-2? Can
it be assumed that its effect is negligible for them because of its relatively
small size? Does $\bds E$ induce vanishing net orbital effects because of its
constancy over typical solar system's planetary orbital periods? It turns out
that a constant and uniform acceleration, treated perturbatively, does induce
non-vanishing long-period orbital effects on the longitude of the pericenter of
a test particle. In the case of the inner planets of the solar system and with
E\approx 10^-10 m s^-2, they are 4-6 orders of magnitude larger than the
present-day upper bounds on the non-standard perihelion precessions recently
obtained with by E.V. Pitjeva with the EPM ephemerides in the Solar System
Barycentric frame. The upper limits on the components of E are E_x <= 1 x
10^-15 m s^-2, E_y <= 2 x 10^-16 m s^-2, E_z <= 3 x 10^-14 m s^-2. This result
is in agreement with the violation of the Strong Equivalence Principle by MOND.
