In arXiv:0810.2076 we presented a conjecture generalizing the Cauchy formula
for Macdonald polynomials. This conjecture encodes the mixed Hodge polynomials
of the representation varieties of Riemann surfaces with semi-simple conjugacy
classes at the punctures. We proved several results which support this
conjecture. Here we announce new results which are consequences of those of
arXiv:0810.2076.
