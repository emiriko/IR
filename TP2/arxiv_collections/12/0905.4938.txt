We have experimentally demonstrated a high level of control of the mode
populations of guided atom lasers (GALs) by showing that the entropy per
particle of an optically GAL, and the one of the trapped Bose Einstein
condensate (BEC) from which it has been produced are the same. The BEC is
prepared in a crossed beam optical dipole trap. We have achieved isentropic
outcoupling for both magnetic and optical schemes. We can prepare GAL in a
nearly pure monomode regime (85 % in the ground state). Furthermore, optical
outcoupling enables the production of spinor guided atom lasers and opens the
possibility to tailor their polarization.
