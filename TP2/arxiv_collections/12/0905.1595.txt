We show that the long known puzzling branching ratios of open-charm decays in
electron-positron annihilation can be reasonably described with a simple form
factor, which strongly suppresses open channels far above threshold.
Application to the electron-positron annihilation into J/psi+pion+pion data on
the X(4260) enhancement recently reported by the BABAR Collaboration
[arxiv:0808.1543] allows a good fit with a simple nonresonant cusp structure
around the D(*)(s)+Dbar(*)(s) threshold. Moreover, we argue that a closer look
at the data reveals an oscillatory pattern, which we model as an interference
effect between a fast - OZI-allowed - and a slow - OZI-forbidden -
J/psi+f(0)(980) mode. Other candidates for similar nonresonant enhancements are
discussed.
