We present a compilation of galaxies in the NGC 1023 Group, an accumulation
of late-type galaxies at a distance of 10 Mpc. Members at high and intermediate
luminosities were identified from their spectroscopic velocities. Members at
low luminosities were identified from their morphologies on wide-field CCD
images. The faint-end slope is in the range -1.27 < alpha < -1.12. There is
evidence for two dwarf galaxy populations: one in the halo of NGC 1023 that is
dominated by dwarf elliptical galaxies, and one in the infall region
surrounding NGC 1023 that contains mainly dwarf irregular galaxies. Similar
distinctive populations are observed in the Local Group.
