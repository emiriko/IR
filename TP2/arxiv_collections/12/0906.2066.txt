We present a method to calculate pion electro-production amplitudes in a
coupled-channel framework incorporating quasi-bound quark-model states. The
method offers a clear prescription how to extract the resonant part of the
amplitudes, even in the presence of different decay channels and a strong
mixing of neighbouring resonances. The method is applied to the calculation of
the M1- and the S1- amplitudes in the P11 partial wave in a simple chiral quark
model. A good agreement with the observed M1- amplitude is found with a
significant contribution from the pion cloud. The same effect is also prominent
in the S1- amplitude but a rather uncertain data prevent us to draw a
definitive conclusion.
