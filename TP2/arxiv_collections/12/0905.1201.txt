At hadron colliders, the production of heavy new particles is associated with
additional quarks and gluons with significant transeverse momentum. The
additional jets complicates the reconstruction of new particle masses. Taking
gluino pair production and decay at the Large Hadron Collider as an example, we
develop a novel technique to reduce these effects, and to reconstruct a clear
kinematical endpoint for the gluino decay products.
