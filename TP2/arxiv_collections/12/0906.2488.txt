We prove a connection between Schmidt-rank and weight of quadratic forms.
This provides a new tool for the classification of graph states based on
entanglement. Our main tool arises from a reformulation of previously known
results concerning the weight of quadratic forms in terms of graph states
properties. As a byproduct, we obtain a straightforward characterization of the
weight of functions associated with pivot-minor of bipartite graphs.
