We use N-body simulations to survey the response of embedded star clusters to
the dispersal of their parent molecular cloud. The final stages of the clusters
can be divided into three classes: the cluster (i) is destroyed, (ii) has a
loose structure, and (iii) has a compact core. We are interested in three of
the governing parameters of the parent cloud: (i) the mass, (ii) the size, and
(iii) the dispersing rate. It is known that the final stage of the cluster is
well correlated with the star formation efficiency (SFE) for systems with the
same cluster and cloud profile. We deem that the SFE alone is not enough to
address systems with clouds of different sizes. Our result shows that the
initial cluster-cloud mass ratio at a certain Lagrangian radius, and the
initial kinetic energy are better indicators for the survivability of embedded
clusters.
