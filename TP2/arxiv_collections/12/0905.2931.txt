We report a 1.036 GHz gated Geiger mode InGaAs avalanche photodiode with a
detection dead time of just 1.93 ns. This is demonstrated by full recovery of
the detection efficiency two gate cycles after a detection event, as well as a
measured maximum detection rate of 497 MHz. As an application, we measure the
second order correlation function $g^{(2)}$ of the emission from a diode laser
with a single detector which works reliably at high speed owing to the
extremely short dead time of the detector. The device is ideal for high bit
rate fiber wavelength quantum key distribution and photonic quantum computing.
