We present an analytic strong-coupling approach to the phase diagram and
elementary excitations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model describing a
superfluid-insulator transition of polaritons in an array of coupled QED
cavities. In the Mott phase, we find four modes corresponding to particle/hole
excitations with lower and upper polaritons, respectively. Simple formulas are
derived for the dispersion relation and spectral weights within a
strong-coupling random-phase approximation (RPA). The phase boundary is
calculated beyond RPA by including the leading correction due to quantum
fluctuations.
