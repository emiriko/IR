In this work we study the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues in
one-dimensional open sets. The method of proof is rather elementary, based on
the Dirichlet lattice points problem, which enable us to consider sets with
infinite measure. Also, we derive some estimates for the the spectral counting
function of the Laplace operator on unbounded two-dimensional domains.
