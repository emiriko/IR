We have searched for close and faint companions around T Tauri stars in the
Chamaeleon star forming region. Two epochs of direct imaging data were taken
with the VLT Adaptive Optics instrument NaCo in February 2006 and March 2007 in
Ks band for the classical T Tauri star CT Cha together with a Hipparcos binary
for astrometric calibration. Moreover a J band image was taken in March 2007 to
get color information. We found CT Cha to have a very faint companion (Ks{0} =
14.6 mag) of ~ 2.67" separation corresponding to ~ 440 AU. We show that CT Cha
A and the faint object form a common proper motion pair and that the companion
is not a non-moving background object (with 4 sigma significance).
