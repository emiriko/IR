Based on the Zimm-Bragg model we study cooperative helix-coil transition
driven by a finite-speed change of temperature. There is an asymmetry between
the coil-to-helix and helix-to-coil transition: the latter is displayed already
for finite speeds, and takes shorter time than the former. This hysteresis
effect has been observed experimentally, and it is explained here via
quantifying system's stability in the vicinity of the critical temperature. A
finite-speed cooling induces a non-equilibrium helical phase with the
correlation length larger than in equilibrium. In this phase the characteristic
length of the coiled domain and the non-equilibrium specific heat can display
an anomalous response to temperature changes. Several pertinent experimental
results on the kinetics helical biopolymers are discussed in detail.
