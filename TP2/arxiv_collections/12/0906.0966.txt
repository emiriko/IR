We investigate the spectral properties of one-dimensional multilayer
structures for the two polarizations TE and TM. We give a physical explanation
for the large spatial transmission band that can be obtained with this kind of
system, and the correlated super resolution effect. We also suggest a designing
approach to build 1D metal-dielectric multilayer structures that have super
resolution.
