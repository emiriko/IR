The discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in the pnictides, materials
with a Fermi surface determined by several bands, highlights the need to
understand how superconductivity arises in multiband systems. In this effort,
using symmetry considerations and mean-field approximations, we discuss how
strong hybridization among orbitals may lead to both intra and interband
pairing, and we present calculations of the spectral functions to guide the
experimental search for this kind of state.
