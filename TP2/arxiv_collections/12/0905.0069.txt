We propose a method to determine the isoscalar \bar K N scattering length on
the lattice. Our method represents the generalization of L\"uscher's approach
in the presence of inelastic channels (complex scattering length). In addition,
the proposed approach allows one to find the position of the S-matrix pole
corresponding the the Lambda(1405) resonance.
