We propose a functional integral representation for Archimedean L-factors
given by products of Gamma-functions. The corresponding functional integral
arises in the description of type A equivariant topological linear sigma model
on a disk. The functional integral representation provides in particular an
interpretation of the Gamma-function as an equivariant symplectic volume of an
infinite-dimensional space of holomorphic maps of the disk to C. This should be
considered as a mirror-dual to the classical Euler integral representation of
the Gamma-function. We give an analogous functional integral representation of
q-deformed Gamma-functions using a three-dimensional equivariant topological
linear sigma model on a handlebody. In general, upon proper ultra-violent
completion, the topological sigma model considered on a particular class of
three-dimensional spaces with a compact Kahler target space provides a quantum
field theory description of a K-theory version of Gromov-Witten invariants.
