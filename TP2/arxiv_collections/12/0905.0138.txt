We report the basal-plane critical current and superfluid density of
magnetically aligned NdFeAsO$_{0.86}$F$_{0.14}$ powder. This sample has
individual crystallite grains permanently oriented with their c axis along the
external field. Magnetic irreversibilities at high field suggest strong flux
pinning of basal-plane critical currents, with monotonic field dependence and
no evidence of the "fishtail" effect. The small particles provide a sensitive
indicator of \textit{dc} flux penetration, and allow analysis of the
temperature dependence of $ab-$plane London penetration depth
$\lambda_{ab,\mathrm{L}}$, which is quadratic at low $T$. This feature may not
necessarily be due to the nodes in the gap, but may be rather a sign of a
strong pair-breaking. A quantitative determination of the absolute magnitude of
$\lambda_{ab,\mathrm{L}}$ is hindered by the need for accurate knowledge of the
particle size distribution.
