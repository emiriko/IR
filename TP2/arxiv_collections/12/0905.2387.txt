Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that rocksalt MgN is a
magnetic material at the verge of half-metallicity, with an electronic
structure robust against strong correlations and spin-orbit interaction.
Furthermore the calculated heat of formation describes the compound as
metastable and suggests that it can be fabricated by tuning the relative Mg and
N abundance during growth. Intriguingly the equilibrium lattice constant is
close to that of MgO, so that MgN is likely to form as an inclusion during the
fabrication of N-doped MgO. We then speculate that the MgO/MgN system may
represent a unique materials platform for magnetic tunnel junctions not
incorporating any transition metals.
