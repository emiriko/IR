A matrix balanced version of the Recursive Centered T Matrix Algorithm
(RCTMA) applicable to systems possessing resonant inter-particle couplings is
presented. Possible domains of application include systems containing
interacting localized plasmon resonances, surface resonances, and photonic jet
phenomena. This method is of particular interest when considering modifications
to complex systems. The numerical accuracy of this technique is demonstrated in
a study of particles with strongly interacting localized plasmon resonances.
