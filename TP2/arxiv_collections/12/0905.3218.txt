The direct and indirect relationship between the British physicist originally
from Austria, Sir Hermann Bondi, and Venezuelan physics are presented. Special
emphasis is made of his more remarkable human qualities, nobility and
humbleness, besides his important contribution to General Relativity and to the
European science agencies. Self--declared as a staunch disciple of Popperian
philosophy, Bondi defended the "hard and dirty" physics against the "inmaculate
and beauty" physics. Attention is focused on two cornerstones of Bondi's work,
followed thoroughly by Luis Herrera and disciples in Venezuela.
