We discuss a new way to develop the exactly solvable model of the QCD
critical endpoint by matching the deconfinement phase transition line for the
system of quark-gluon bags with the line of their vanishing surface tension
coefficient. In contrast to all previous findings in such models the deconfined
phase is defined not by an essential singularity of the isobaric partition
function, but by its simple pole. As a result we find out that the first order
deconfinement phase transition which is defined by a discontinuity of the first
derivative of system pressure is generated by a discontinuity of the derivative
of surface tension coefficient.
