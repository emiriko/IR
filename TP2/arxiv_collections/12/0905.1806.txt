The TrES-2 system harbors one planet which was discovered with the transit
technique. In this work we investigate the dynamical behavior of possible
additional, lower-mass planets. We identify the regions where such planets can
move on stable orbits and show how they depend on the initial eccentricity and
inclination. We find, that there are stable regions inside and outside the
orbit of TrES-2b where additional, smaller planets can move. We also show that
those planets can have a large orbital inclination which makes a detection with
the transit technique very difficult.
