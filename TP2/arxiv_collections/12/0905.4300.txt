Analysis of high spatial resolution VLA images shows that the free-free
emission from NGC7538 IRS1 is dominated by a collimated ionized wind. We have
re-analyzed high angular resolution VLA archive data from 6 cm to 7 mm, and
measured separately the flux density from the compact bipolar core and the
extended (1.5" - 3") lobes. We find that the flux density of the core is
proportional to the frequency to the power of alpha, with alpha being about
0.7. The frequency dependence of the total flux density is slightly steeper
with alpha = 0.8. A massive optically thick hypercompact core with a steep
density gradient can explain this frequency dependence, but it cannot explain
the extremely broad recombination line velocities observed in this source.
Neither can it explain why the core is bipolar rather than spherical, nor the
observed decrease of 4% in the flux density in less than 10 years. An ionized
wind modulated by accretion is expected to vary, because the accretion flow
from the surrounding cloud will vary over time. BIMA and CARMA continuum
observations at 3 mm show that the free-free emission still dominates at 3 mm.
HCO+ J = 1 - 0 observations combined with FCRAO single dish data show a clear
inverse P Cygni profile towards IRS1. These observations confirm that IRS1 is
heavily accreting with an accretion rate of about 2 times 10(-4) solar masses
per year.
