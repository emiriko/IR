We analyse new results of Chandra and Suzaku which found a flux of hard X-ray
emission from the compact region around Sgr A$^\ast$ (r ~ 100 pc). We suppose
that this emission is generated by accretion processes onto the central
supermassive blackhole when an unbounded part of captured stars obtains an
additional momentum. As a result a flux of subrelativistic protons is generated
near the Galactic center which heats the background plasma up to temperatures
about 6-10 keV and produces by inverse bremsstrahlung a flux of non-thermal
X-ray emission in the energy range above 10 keV.
