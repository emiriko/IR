We prove that the Eynard-Orantin symplectic invariants of the curve xy-y^2=1
are the orbifold Euler characteristics of the moduli spaces of genus g curves.
We do this by associating to the Eynard-Orantin invariants of xy-y^2=1 a
problem of enumerating covers of the two-sphere branched over three points.
This viewpoint produces new recursion relations---string and dilaton
equations---between the quasi-polynomials that enumerate such covers.
