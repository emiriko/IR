We investigate electron correlation effects in stoichiometric Titanium
Nitride (TiN) using a combination of electronic structure and many-body
calculations. In a first step, the Nth-order muffin tin orbital technique is
used to obtain parameters for the low-energy Hamiltonian in the Ti-d(t2g)-band
manifold. The Coulomb-interaction U and the Hund's rule exchange parameter J
are estimated using a constrained Local-Density-Approximation calculation.
Finally, the many-body problem is solved within the framework of the
Variational Cluster Approach. Comparison of our calculations with different
spectroscopy results stresses the importance of electronic correlation in this
material. In particular, our results naturally explain a suppression of the TiN
density of states at the Fermi level (pseudogap) in terms of the proximity to a
Mott metal-insulator transition.
