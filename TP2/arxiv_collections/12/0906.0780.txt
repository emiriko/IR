In this contribution we describe the role of several two-component integrable
systems in the classical problem of shallow water waves. The starting point in
our derivation is the Euler equation for an incompressible fluid, the equation
of mass conservation, the simplest bottom and surface conditions and the
constant vorticity condition. The approximate model equations are generated by
introduction of suitable scalings and by truncating asymptotic expansions of
the quantities to appropriate order. The so obtained equations can be related
to three different integrable systems: a two component generalization of the
Camassa-Holm equation, the Zakharov-Ito system and the Kaup-Boussinesq system.
  The significance of the results is the inclusion of vorticity, an important
feature of water waves that has been given increasing attention during the last
decade. The presented investigation shows how -- up to a certain order -- the
model equations relate to the shear flow upon which the wave resides. In
particular, it shows exactly how the constant vorticity affects the equations.
