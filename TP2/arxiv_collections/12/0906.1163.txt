We report on a continuous variable analogue of the triplet two-qubit Bell
states. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a remarkable similarity
of two-mode continuous variable entangled states with triplet Bell states with
respect to their correlation patterns. Borrowing from the two qubit language,
we call these correlations triplet-like.
