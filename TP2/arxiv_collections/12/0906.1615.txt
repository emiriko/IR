A well-known potential dark matter signature is emission of GeV - TeV
neutrinos from annihilation of neutralinos gravitationally bound to massive
objects. We present results from recent searches for high energy neutrino
emission from the Sun with AMANDA, in all cases revealing no significant
excess. We show limits on both neutralino-induced muon flux from the Sun and
neutralino-nucleon cross section, comparing them with recent IceCube results.
Particularly, our limits on spin-dependent cross section are much better than
those obtained in direct detection experiments, allowing AMANDA and other
neutrino telescopes to search a complementary portion of MSSM parameter space.
