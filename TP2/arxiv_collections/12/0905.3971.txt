The purpose of this reanalysis of the WMAP uncalibrated time ordered data
(TOD) was two fold. The first was to reassess the reliability of the detection
of the anisotropies in the official WMAP sky maps of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). The second was to assess the performance of a proposed
criterion in avoiding systematic error in detecting a signal of interest. The
criterion was implemented by testing the null hypothesis that the uncalibrated
TOD was consistent with no anisotropies when WMAP's hourly calibration
parameters were allowed to vary. It was shown independently for all 20 WMAP
channels that sky maps with no anisotropies were a better fit to the TOD than
those from the official analysis. The recently launched Planck satellite should
help sort out this perplexing result.
