I describe recent signature-based searches for anomalous physics processes
using up to 2.9/fb of data from the CDF or D0 detectors at the Fermilab
Tevatron. While each search conveys its sensitivity by interpreting a null
result in terms of one or more specific exotic models, the searches are
designed to be broadly sensitive to many models.
