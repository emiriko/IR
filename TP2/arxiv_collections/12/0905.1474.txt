We revisit the occurrence condition of optically thick winds reported by Kato
(1985) and Kato and Hachisu (1989) who examined mathematically nova envelope
solutions with an old opacity and found that optically thick winds are
accelerated only in massive white dwarfs (WDs) of >~ 0.9 Mo. With the OPAL
opacity we find that the optically thick wind occurs for >~ 0.6 Mo WDs and that
the occurrence of winds depends not only on the WD mass but also on the
ignition mass. When the ignition mass is larger than a critical value, winds
are suppressed by a density-inversion layer. Such a static solution can be
realized in WDs of mass ~0.6-0.7 Mo. We propose that sequences consisting only
of static solutions correspond to slow evolutions in symbiotic novae like PU
Vul because PU Vul shows no indication of strong winds in a long-lasted flat
peak followed by a very slow decline in its light curve.
