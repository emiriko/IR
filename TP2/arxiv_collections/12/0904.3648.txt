The unconventional technologies, currently applied at a certain category of
materials, difficult to be processed through usual techniques, have undergone
during the last 60 years all the stages, since their discovery to their use on
a large scale. They are based on elementary mechanisms which run the processing
through classic methods, yet, they use in addition the interconnections of
these methods. This leads to a plus in performance by increasing the outcomes
precision, reducing the processing time, increasing the quality of the finite
product, etc. This performance can be much increased by using the computer and
a software product in assisting the human operator in the processing by an
unconventional method such as; the electric or electro-chemical erosion, the
complex electric-electro-chemical erosion, the processing by a laser fascicle
and so on. The present work presents such an application based on a data base
combining the previous experimental results, which proposes a method of
optimization of the outcomes.
