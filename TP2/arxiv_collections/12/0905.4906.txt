The paper starts from the observation on the complexity of the manipulation
of fuzzy processes that increases very rapidly with the extents of the
processes representation. Therefore, a productive approach is to divide the
problem into smaller parts, treated separately and then the results combined.
Some algebraic results obtained by the authors are presented.
