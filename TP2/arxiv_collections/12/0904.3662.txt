Cosmological simulations are the key tool for investigating the different
processes involved in the formation of the universe from small initial density
perturbations to galaxies and clusters of galaxies observed today. The
identification and analysis of bound objects, halos, is one of the most
important steps in drawing useful physical information from simulations. In the
advent of larger and larger simulations, a reliable and parallel halo finder,
able to cope with the ever-increasing data files, is a must. In this work we
present the freely available MPI parallel halo finder AHF. We provide a
description of the algorithm and the strategy followed to handle large
simulation data. We also describe the parameters a user may choose in order to
influence the process of halo finding, as well as pointing out which parameters
are crucial to ensure untainted results from the parallel approach.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of AHF to scale to high resolution
simulations.
