It is well documented that a model for the underlying asset price process
that seeks to capture the behaviour of the market prices of vanilla options
needs to exhibit both diffusion and jump features. In this paper we assume that
the asset price process $S$ is Markov with cadlag paths and propose a scheme
for computing the law of the realized variance of the log returns accrued while
the asset was trading in a prespecified corridor. We thus obtain an algorithm
for pricing and hedging volatility derivatives and derivatives on the
corridor-realized variance in such a market. The class of models under
consideration is large, as it encompasses jump-diffusion and Levy processes. We
prove the weak convergence of the scheme and describe in detail the
implementation of the algorithm in the characteristic cases where $S$ is a CEV
process (continuous trajectories), a variance gamma process (jumps with
independent increments) or an infinite activity jump-diffusion (discontinuous
trajectories with dependent increments).
