During thunderstorms on 2008 September 20, a simultaneous detection of gamma
rays and electrons was made at a mountain observatory in Japan located 2770 m
above sea level. Both emissions, lasting 90 seconds, were associated with
thunderclouds rather than lightning. The photon spectrum, extending to 10 MeV,
can be interpreted as consisting of bremsstrahlung gamma rays arriving from a
source which is 60 - 130 m in distance at 90% confidence level. The observed
electrons are likely to be dominated by a primary population escaping from an
acceleration region in the clouds.
