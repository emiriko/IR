We generalise the analysis in [arXiv:0904.1744] to superspace, and explicitly
prove that for any embedding of surface operators in a general, twisted N=2
pure abelian theory on an arbitrary four-manifold, the parameters transform
naturally under the SL(2,Z) duality of the theory. However, for
nontrivially-embedded surface operators, exact S-duality holds if and only if
the "quantum" parameter effectively vanishes, while the overall SL(2,Z) duality
holds up to a c-number at most, regardless. Nevertheless, this observation sets
the stage for a physical proof of a remarkable mathematical result by
Kronheimer and Mrowka--that expresses a "ramified" analog of the Donaldson
invariants solely in terms of the ordinary Donaldson invariants--which, will
appear, among other things, in forthcoming work. As a prelude to that, the
effective interaction on the corresponding u-plane will be computed. In
addition, the dependence on second Stiefel-Whitney classes and the appearance
of a Spin^c structure in the associated low-energy Seiberg-Witten theory with
surface operators, will also be demonstrated. In the process, we will stumble
upon an interesting phase factor that is otherwise absent in the "unramified"
case.
