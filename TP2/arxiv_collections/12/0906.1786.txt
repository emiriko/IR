We present thermal observations of 44 Jovian Trojan asteroids with diameters
(D) ranging from 5 to 24 km. All objects were observed at a wavelength of 24
microns with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Measurements of the thermal emission
and of scattered optical light, mostly from the University of Hawaii 2.2-meter
telescope, together allow us to constrain the diameter and geometric albedo of
each body. We find that the median R-band albedo of these small Jovian Trojans
is about 0.12, much higher than that of "large" Trojans with D > 57 km (0.04).
Also the range of albedos among the small Trojans is wider. We attribute the
Trojan albedos to an evolutionary effect: the small Trojans are more likely to
be collisional fragments and so their surfaces would be younger. A younger
surface means less cumulative exposure to the space environment, which suggests
that their surfaces would not be as dark as those of the large, primordial
Trojans. In support of this hypothesis is a statistically significant
correlation of higher albedo with smaller diameter in our sample alone and in a
sample that includes the larger Trojans.
