We experimentally demonstrate an optical controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate with
arbitrary single inputs based on a 4-photon 6-qubit cluster state entangled
both in polarization and spatial modes. We first generate the 6-qubit state,
and then by performing single-qubit measurements the CNOT gate is applied to
arbitrary single input qubits. To characterize the performance of the gate, we
estimate its quantum process fidelity and prove its entangling capability. The
results show that the gate cannot be reproduced by local operations and
classical communication. Our experiment shows that cluster states are promising
candidates for efficient optical quantum computation.
