Estimation of division and death rates of lymphocytes in different conditions
is vital for quantitative understanding of the immune system. Deuterium, in the
form of deuterated glucose or heavy water, can be used to measure rates of
proliferation and death of lymphocytes in vivo. Inferring these rates from
labeling and delabeling curves has been subject to considerable debate with
different groups suggesting different mathematical models for that purpose. We
show that the three models that are most commonly used are in fact
mathematically identical and differ only in their interpretation of the
estimated parameters. By extending these previous models, we here propose a
more mechanistic approach for the analysis of data from deuterium labeling
experiments. We construct a model of "kinetic heterogeneity" in which the total
cell population consists of many sub-populations with different rates of cell
turnover. In this model, for a given distribution of the rates of turnover, the
predicted fraction of labeled DNA accumulated and lost can be calculated. Our
model reproduces several previously made experimental observations, such as a
negative correlation between the length of the labeling period and the rate at
which labeled DNA is lost after label cessation. We demonstrate the reliability
of the new explicit kinetic heterogeneity model by applying it to artificially
generated datasets, and illustrate its usefulness by fitting experimental data.
In contrast to previous models, the explicit kinetic heterogeneity model 1)
provides a mechanistic way of interpreting labeling data; 2) allows for a
non-exponential loss of labeled cells during delabeling, and 3) can be used to
describe data with variable labeling length.
