We explicate conditions under which, the two magnon state becomes highly
entangled and is useful for several quantum communication protocols. This
state, which is experimentally realizable in quantum dots using Heisenberg
exchange interaction, is found to be suitable for carrying out deterministic
teleportation of an arbitrary two qubit composite system. Further, conditions
for which the channel capacity reaches "Holevo bound", allowing maximal amount
of classical information to be encoded, are derived. Later, an explicit
protocol for the splitting and sharing of a two qubit entangled state among two
parties, using this state as an entangled resource, is demonstrated.
