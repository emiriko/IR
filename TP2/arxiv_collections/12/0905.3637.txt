We present evidence for Milky-Way-like, low-excitation molecular gas
reservoirs in near-IR selected massive galaxies at z~1.5, based on IRAM Plateau
de Bure Interferometer CO[3-2] and NRAO Very Large Array CO[1-0] line
observations for two galaxies that had been previously detected in CO[2-1]
emission. The CO[3-2] flux of BzK-21000 at z=1.522 is comparable within the
errors to its CO[2-1] flux, implying that the CO[3-2] transition is
significantly sub-thermally excited. The combined CO[1-0] observations of the
two sources result in a detection at the 3 sigma level that is consistent with
a higher CO[1-0] luminosity than that of CO[2-1]. Contrary to what is observed
in submillimeter galaxies and QSOs, in which the CO transitions are thermally
excited up to J>=3, these galaxies have low-excitation molecular gas, similar
to that in the Milky Way and local spirals. This is the first time that such
conditions have been observed at high redshift. A Large Velocity Gradient
analysis suggests that molecular clouds with density and kinetic temperature
comparable to local spirals can reproduce our observations. The similarity in
the CO excitation properties suggests that a high, Milky-Way-like, CO to H_2
conversion factor could be appropriate for these systems. If such
low-excitation properties are representative of ordinary galaxies at high
redshift, centimeter telescopes such as the Expanded Very Large Array and the
longest wavelength Atacama Large Millimeter Array bands will be the best tools
for studying the molecular gas content in these systems through the
observations of CO emission lines.
