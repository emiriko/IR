We briefly discuss the history of X-ray polarimetry for astronomical
applications including a guide to the appropriate statistics. We also provide
an introduction to some of the new techniques discussed in more detail
elsewhere in these proceedings. We conclude our discussion with our concerns
over adequate ground calibration, especially with respect to unpolarized beams,
and at the system level.
