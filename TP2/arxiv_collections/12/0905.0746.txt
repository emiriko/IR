In this study, we determined the chiral direction of the quantum-Hall (QH)
edge states in graphene by adopting simple two-terminal conductance
measurements while grounding different edge positions of the sample. The edge
state with a smaller filling factor is found to more strongly interact with the
electric contacts. This simple method can be conveniently used to investigate
the chirality of the QH edge state with zero filling factor in graphene, which
is important to understand the symmetry breaking sequence in high magnetic
fields ($\gtrsim$25 T).
