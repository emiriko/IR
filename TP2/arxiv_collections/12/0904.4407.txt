We study the impact of explicit chiral symmetry breaking of lattice Wilson
fermions on mesonic correlators in the epsilon-regime using Wilson chiral
perturbation theory. We generalize the epsilon-expansion of continuum chiral
perturbation theory to nonzero lattice spacing a and distinguish various
regimes. It turnes out that lattice corrections are highly suppressed, as long
as quark masses are of the order a\Lambda^2_QCD. The lattice spacing effects
become more pronounced for smaller quark masses and may lead to non-trivial
corrections of the continuum results at next-to-leading order. We compute these
corrections for standard current and density correlation functions. A fit to
lattice data shows that these corrections are small, as expected.
