Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation and the Green-Kubo formalism were
used to calculate self-diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and thermal
conductivity for 38 different dipolar two-center Lennard-Jones fluids along the
bubble line and in the homogeneous liquid. It was systematically investigated
how anisotropy, i.e. elongation, and dipole momentum influence the transport
properties. The reduced elongation L* was varied from 0 to 1 and the reduced
squared dipole momentum was varied depending on the elongation as follows: for
spherical fluids (L*=0) from $\mu*2=0 to 20, for L*=0.2 from mu*2=0 to 16, and
for L*=0.4 and above from mu*2=0 to 12. This represents the entire range in
which parameters for real fluids are expected. The statistical uncertainty of
the reported data varies with transport property, for self-diffusion
coefficient data the error bars are typically lower than 3 %, for shear
viscosity and thermal conductivity they are about 8 and 12 %, respectively.
