Implicit particle-in-cell codes offer advantages over their explicit
counterparts in that they suffer weaker stability constraints on the need to
resolve the higher frequency modes of the system. This feature may prove
particularly valuable for modeling the interaction of high-intensity laser
pulses with overcritical plasmas, in the case where the electrostatic modes in
the denser regions are of negligible influence on the physical processes under
study. To this goal, we have developed the new two-dimensional electromagnetic
code ELIXIRS (standing for ELectromagnetic Implicit X-dimensional Iterative
Relativistic Solver) based on the relativistic extension of the so-called
Direct Implicit Method [D. Hewett and A. B. Langdon, J. Comp. Phys.
\textbf{72}, 121(1987)]. Dissipation-free propagation of light waves into
vacuum is achieved by an adjustable-damping electromagnetic solver. In the
high-density case where the Debye length is not resolved, satisfactory energy
conservation is ensured by the use of high-order weight factors. In this paper,
we first present an original derivation of the electromagnetic direct implicit
method within a Newton iterative scheme. Its linear properties are then
investigated through numerically solving the relation dispersions obtained for
both light and plasma waves, accounting for finite space and time steps.
Finally, our code is successfully benchmarked against explicit particle-in-cell
simulations for two kinds of physical problems: plasma expansion into vacuum
and relativistic laser-plasma interaction. In both cases, we will demonstrate
the robustness of the implicit solver for crude discretizations, as well as the
gains in efficiency which can be realized over standard explicit simulations.
