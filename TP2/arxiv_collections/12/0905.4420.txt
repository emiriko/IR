In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 100}, 120501 (2008)], Avron {\em et
al.} discuss a time reordering scheme to achieve efficient "across-generation"
of entangled photon pairs in a semiconductor quantum dot with a suppressed
biexciton binding energy. They demonstrate that the scheme can be implemented
using time delay between the generated photons. In this Comment, we derive an
exact expression for the concurrence of the time delayed photons, and show that
the predicted values by Avron {\em et al.} are not achievable, which stems from
an approximation used in their approximate theoretical analysis.
