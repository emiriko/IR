We investigate the storage of light in an atomic sample with a lambda-type
coupling scheme driven by optical fields at variable two-photon detuning. In
the presence of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), light is stored
and retrieved from the sample by dynamically varying the group velocity. It is
found that for any two-photon detuning of the input light pulse within the EIT
transparency window, the carrier frequency of the retrieved light pulse matches
the two-photon resonance frequency with the atomic ground state transition and
the control field. This effect which is not based on spectral filtering is
investigated both theoretically and experimentally. It can be used for
high-speed precision measurements of the two-photon resonance as employed e.g.
in optical magnetometry.
