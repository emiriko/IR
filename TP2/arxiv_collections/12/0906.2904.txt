The general idea that optical radiation may cool matter was put forward by
Pringsheim already in 1929. Doppler cooling of dilute atomic gases is an
extremely successful application of this concept, and more recently anti-Stokes
cooling in multilevel systems has been explored, culminating in the optical
refrigeration of solids. Collisional redistribution of radiation is a proposed
different cooling mechanism that involves atomic two-level systems, though
experimental investigations in gases with moderate density have so far not
reached the cooling regime.
  Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of an atomic gas based on
collisional redistribution of radiation, using rubidium atoms subject to 230
bar of argon buffer gas pressure. The frequent collisions in the ultradense gas
transiently shift a far red detuned laser beam into resonance, while
spontaneous decay occurs close to the unperturbed atomic resonance frequency.
During each excitation cycle, a kinetic energy of order of the thermal energy
k_B T is extracted from the dense atomic sample. In a proof of principle
experiment with a thermally non-isolated sample, we experimentally demonstrate
relative cooling by 66 K. The cooled gas has a density of more than 10 orders
of magnitude above the typical values in Doppler cooling experiments, and the
cooling power reaches 87 mW. Future prospects of the demonstrated effect
include studies of supercooling beyond the homogeneous nucleation temperature
and optical chillers.
