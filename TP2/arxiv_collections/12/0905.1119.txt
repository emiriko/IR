Everything in the Universe is assumed to be compromised of pure reversible
quantum Toffoli gates, including empty space itself. Empty space can be
configured into photon or matter gates simply by swapping logic input
information with these entities through the phenomenon of quantum mechanical
entanglement between photons and empty space Toffoli gates. The essential
difference between empty space, photons and matter gates are the logic input
values of their respective Toffoli gates. Empty space is characterized by an
inability for the logic inputs to influence the internal logic state of its
Toffoli gates since the control lines are set to logic 0. Photons and matter
are characterized by Toffoli gates where the control lines are set to logic 1
enabling their logic inputs to control their internal logic states allowing for
their interaction according to the laws of physics associated with reality.
Photons swapping logic input information with empty space results in the
propagation of light. Photons facilitating the swapping of information between
matter and empty space gates leads to the laws of motion including relativity.
This model enables the derivation of many physical laws from purely quantum
mechanical considerations including the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the
Lorentz transformations of special relativity, and the relationship between
relativistic energy and mass. The model provides a possible explanation for
many physical phenomena including dark matter, anti-matter, and an inflationary
Universe.
