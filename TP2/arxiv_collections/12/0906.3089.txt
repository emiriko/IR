Discrete geometric estimators aim at estimating geometric characteristics of
a shape with only its digitization as input data. Such an estimator is
multigrid convergent when its estimates tend toward the geometric
characteristics of the shape as the digitization step h tends toward 0. This
paper studies the multigrid convergence of tangent estimators based on maximal
digital straight segment recognition. We show that such estimators are
multigrid convergent for some family of convex shapes and that their speed of
convergence is on average O(h^(2/3)). Experiments confirm this result and
suggest that the bound is tight.
