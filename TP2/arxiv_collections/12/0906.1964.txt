The addition of tunnel barriers to open chaotic systems, as well as
representing more general physical systems, leads to much richer semiclassical
dynamics. In particular, we present here a complete semiclassical treatment for
these systems, in the regime where Ehrenfest time effects are negligible and
for times shorter than the Heisenberg time. To start we explore the trajectory
structures which contribute to the survival probability, and find results that
are also in agreement with random matrix theory. Then we progress to the
treatment of the probability current density and are able to show, using
recursion relation arguments, that the continuity equation connecting the
current density to the survival probability is satisfied to all orders in the
semiclassical approximation. Following on, we also consider a correlation
function of the scattering matrix, for which we have to treat a new set of
possible trajectory diagrams. By simplifying the contributions of these
diagrams, we show that the results obtained here are consistent with known
properties of the scattering matrix. The correlation function can be trivially
connected to the ac and dc conductances, quantities of particular interest for
which finally we present a semiclassical expansion.
