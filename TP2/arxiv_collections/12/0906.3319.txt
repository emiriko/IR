Background: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(CA-MRSA), a novel strain of MRSA, has recently emerged and rapidly spread in
the community. Invasion into the hospital setting with replacement of the
hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) has also been documented. Co-colonization with
both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA would have important clinical implications given
differences in antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and the potential for
exchange of genetic information.
  Methods: A deterministic mathematical model was developed to characterize the
transmission dynamics of HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA in the hospital setting and to
quantify the emergence of co-colonization with both strains.
  Results: The model analysis shows that the state of co-colonization becomes
endemic over time and that there is no competitive exclusion of either strain.
Increasing the length of stay or rate of hospital entry among patients
colonized with CA-MRSA leads to a rapid increase in the co-colonized state.
Compared to MRSA decolonization strategy, improving hand hygiene compliance has
the greatest impact on decreasing the prevalence of HA-MRSA, CA-MRSA and the
co-colonized state.
  Conclusions: The model predicts that with the expanding community reservoir
of CA-MRSA, the majority of hospitalized patients will become colonized with
both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA.
