We consider a holographic description of the inflationary multiverse,
according to which the wave function of the universe is interpreted as the
generating functional for a lower dimensional Euclidean theory. We analyze a
simple model where transitions between inflationary vacua occur through bubble
nucleation, and the inflating part of spacetime consists of de Sitter regions
separated by thin bubble walls. In this model, we present some evidence that
the dual theory is conformally invariant in the UV.
