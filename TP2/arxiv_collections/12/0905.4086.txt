A search for supersymmetric partners of quarks is performed in the topology
of multijet events accompanied by at least one tau lepton decaying hadronically
and large missing transverse energy. Approximately 1 fb-1 of ppbar collision
data from the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV
recorded by the D0 detector is analyzed. Results are combined with the
previously published D0 inclusive search for squarks and gluinos. No evidence
of physics beyond the standard model is found and lower limits on the squark
mass up to 410 GeV are derived in the framework of minimal supergravity with
tan(beta)=15, A_0=-2m_0 and mu<0, in the region where decays to tau leptons
dominate. Gaugino masses m_1/2 are excluded up to 172 GeV.
