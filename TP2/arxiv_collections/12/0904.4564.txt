We propose schemes to prepare atomic entangled states in a bi-mode cavity via
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and fractional stimulated Raman
adiabatic passage (f-STIRAP) tech- niques. According to the simulation results,
our schemes keep the cavity modes almost unexcited and the atomic excited
states are nearly unpopulated during the whole process. The simulation also
shows that the error probability is very small.
