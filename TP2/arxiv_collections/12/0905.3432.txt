The # component model was proposed to improve the practice of parallel
programming. This paper introduces a type system for # programming systems,
aiming to lift the abstraction and safety of programming for parallel computing
architectures by introducing a notion of abstract component based on universal
and existential bounded quantification. Issues about the implementation of such
type system in HPE, a # programming system, are also discussed.
