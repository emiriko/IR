Simulation of chemical activity of corrugated graphene within density
functional theory predicts an enhancement of its chemical activity if the ratio
of height of the corrugation (ripple) to its radius is larger than 0.07.
Further growth of the curvature of the ripples results in appearance of midgap
states which leads to an additional strong increase of chemisororption energy.
These results open a way for tunable functionalization of graphene, namely,
depending of curvature of the ripples one can provide both homogeneous (for
small curvatures) and spot-like (for large curvatures) functionalization.
