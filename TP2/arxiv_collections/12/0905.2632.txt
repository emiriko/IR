The polarized proton beams at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at
Brookhaven National Laboratory provide a unique environment to observe hard
scattering between gluons and quarks. The PHENIX experiment has recorded
collisions at $\sqrt(s_{NN})=$200 GeV and 62.4 GeV to yield data which are
complementary to those measured by deep inelastic scattering experiments.
Polarized proton-proton collisions can directly probe the polarized gluon and
anti-quark distributions as the collisions couple the color charges of the
participants. The PHENIX detector is well suited to measure many final-state
particles sensitive to the proton's spin structure. We will give a brief
overview of the PHENIX Spin Program and we will report results, status and
outlook of the many probes accessible to the PHENIX experiment which will be
incorporated into future global analyses of world data on polarized hard
scattering.
