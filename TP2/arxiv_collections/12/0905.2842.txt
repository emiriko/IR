A new generation of oscillation experiments optimized to measure theta(13) is
ready to start. Performances, complementarity and competition of these
accelerator and reactor experiments will be shortly illustrated. The capability
of measuring theta(13) with other neutrino sources, like solar, atmospheric,
supernovae neutrinos or neutrinos from a tritium source will be discussed too.
