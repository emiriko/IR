It has been conjectured that transport in integrable one-dimensional (1D)
systems is necessarily ballistic. The large diffusive response seen
experimentally in nearly ideal realizations of the S=1/2 1D Heisenberg model is
therefore puzzling and has not been explained so far. Here, we show that,
contrary to common belief, diffusion is universally present in interacting 1D
systems subject to a periodic lattice potential. We present a parameter-free
formula for the spin-lattice relaxation rate which is in excellent agreement
with experiment. Furthermore, we calculate the current decay directly in the
thermodynamic limit using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group
algorithm and show that an anomalously large time scale exists even at high
temperatures.
