The effect of the nucleon recoil for antikaon-deuteron scattering is
investigated in the framework of effective field theory. In particular, we
concentrate on the calculation of the nucleon recoil effect for the
double-scattering process. It is shown that the leading correction to the
static term that emerges at order xi^{1/2} with xi=M_K/m_N vanishes due to a
complete cancellation of individually large contributions. The resulting recoil
effect in this process is found to be of order of 10-15% as compared to the
static term. We also briefly discuss the application of the method in the
calculations of the multiple-scattering diagrams.
