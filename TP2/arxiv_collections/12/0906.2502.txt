We investigate salt crystallization in porous media that can lead to their
disintegration. For sodium sulfate we show for the first time experimentally
that when anhydrous crystals are wetted with water, there is very rapid growth
of the hydrated form of sulfate in clusters that nucleate on anhydrous salt
micro crystals. The molar volume of the hydrated crystals being four times
bigger, the growth of these clusters can generate stresses in excess of the
tensile strength of the stone and lead therefore to damage.
