We study the puzzling vector meson X(2175) in a multichannel generalisation
of the Resonance-Spectrum-Expansion model. Besides the usual P-wave
pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar, pseudoscalar-vector, and vector-vector channels that
couple to mesons with vector quantum numbers, we also include the important
S-wave vector-scalar, pseudoscalar-axialvector and vector-axialvector channels,
including the observed $\phi$(1020)$f_0$(980) decay mode. The strong coupling
to nearby S-wave channels originates dynamically generated poles, two of which
come out close to the energy region of the X(2175), viz. at (2.037-i0.170) GeV
and (2.382-i0.20) GeV. Further improvements are proposed.
