We present a resonant approach to enhance 1550nm emission efficiency of
amorphous silicon sub-oxide doped with Er3+ (a-SiOx<Er>) layers with silicon
nanoclusters (Si-NC). Two distinct techniques were combined to provide a
structure that allowed increasing approximately 12x the 1550nm emission. First,
layers of SiO2 were obtained by conventional wet oxidation and a-SiOx<Er>
matrix was deposited by reactive RF co-sputtering. Secondly, an extra pump
channel (4I15/2 to 4I9/2) of Er3+ was created due to Si-NC formation on the
same a-SiOx<Er> matrix via a hard annealing at 1150 C. The SiO2 and the
a-SiOx<Er> thicknesses were designed to support resonances near the pumping
wavelength (~500nm), near the Si-NC emission (~800nm) and near the a-SiOx<Er>
emission (~1550nm) enhancing the optical pumping process.
