Composite metamaterials(CMMs) combining a subwavelength metallic hole array
(i.e. one-layer fishnet structure) and an array of split-ring resonators(SRRs)
on the same board are fabricated with gold films on silicon wafer. Transmission
measurements of the CMMs in the terahertz range have been performed. Dual-band
magnetic resonances, namely, a LC resonance at 4.40 THz and an additional
magnetic resonance at 8.64 THz originating from the antiparallel current in
wire pairs in the CMMs are observed when the electrical field polarization of
the incident light is parallel to the gap of the component SRR. The numerical
simulations agree well with the experimental results and further clarify the
nature of the dual-band magnetic resonances.
