We investigate dynamical coupling timescales of a neutron star's superfluid
core, taking into account the interactions of quantized neutron vortices with
quantized flux lines of the proton superconductor in addition to the previously
considered scattering of the charged components against the spontaneous
magnetization of the neutron vortex line. We compare the cases where vortex
motion is constrained in different ways by the array of magnetic flux tubes
associated with superconducting protons. This includes absolute pinning to and
creep across a uniform array of flux lines. The effect of a toroidal
arrangement of flux lines is also considered. The inclusion of a uniform array
of flux tubes in the neutron star core significantly decreases the timescale of
coupling between the neutron and proton fluid constituents in all cases. For
the toroidal component, creep response similar to that of the inner crust
superfluid is possible.
