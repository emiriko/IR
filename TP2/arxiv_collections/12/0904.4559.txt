The single glitch observed in PSR B1821-24, a millisecond pulsar in M28, is
unusual on two counts. First, the magnitude of this glitch is at least an order
of magnitude smaller ($\Delta \nu / \nu \sim 10^{-11}$) than the smallest
glitch observed to date. Secondly, all other glitching pulsars have strong
magnetic fields with $B \gsim 10^{11} G$ and are young, whereas PSR B1821-24 is
an old recycled pulsar with a field strength of $2.25\times10^9 G$. We have
suggested earlier that some of the recycled pulsars could actually be strange
quark stars. In this work we argue that the crustal properties of such a {\em
strange} pulsar are just right to give rise to a glitch of this magnitude,
explaining the scarcity of larger glitches in millisecond pulsars.
