A strongly coupled plasma of quark and gluon quasiparticles at temperatures
from $ 1.1 T_c$ to $3 T_c$ is studied by path integral Monte Carlo simulations.
This method extends previous classical nonrelativistic simulations based on a
color Coulomb interaction to the quantum regime. We present the equation of
state and find good agreement with lattice results. Further, pair distribution
functions and color correlation functions are computed indicating strong
correlations and liquid-like behavior.
