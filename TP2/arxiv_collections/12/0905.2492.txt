In high energy collisions saturation and multiple collisions are most easily
accounted for in transverse coordinate space, while analyses in momentum space
have been more suitable for calculating properties of exclusive final states.
In this talk I describe an extension of Mueller's dipole cascade model, which
attempts to combine the good features of both these descriptions. Besides
saturation it also includes effects of correlations and fluctuations, which
have been difficult to account for in previous approaches. The model reproduces
successfully total, elastic, and diffractive cross sections in pp collisions
and DIS, and a description of final states will be ready soon.
