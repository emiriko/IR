Recently a renormalizable model of gravity has been proposed, which might be
a UV completion of General Relativity (GR) or its infra-red modification,
probably with a strongly coupled scalar mode. Although the generic vacuum of
the theory is anti-de Sitter one, particular limits of the theory allow for the
Minkowski vacuum. In this limit (though without consideration of the strongly
coupled scalar field) post-Newtonian coefficients of spherically symmetric
solutions coincide with those of the General Relativity. Thus the deviations
from the convenient GR should be tested beyond the post-Newtonian corrections,
that is for a system with strong gravity at astrophysical scales. In this
letter we consider potentially observable properties of black holes in the
deformed Horava-Lifshitz gravity with Minkowski vacuum: the gravitational
lensing and quasinormal modes. We have showed that the bending angle is
seemingly smaller in the considered Horava-Lifshitz gravity than in GR. The
quasinormal modes of black holes are longer lived and have larger real
oscillation frequency in the Horava-Lifshitz gravity than in GR. These
corrections should be observable in the near future experiments on lensing and
by gravitational antennas, helping to constrain parameters of the
Horava-Lifshitz gravity or to discard it.
