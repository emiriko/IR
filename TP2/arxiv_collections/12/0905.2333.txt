In the early 1990s, Garsia and Haiman conjectured that the dimension of the
Garsia-Haiman module is n!, and they showed that the resolution of this
conjecture implies the Macdonald Positivity Conjecture. Haiman proved these
conjectures in 2001 using algebraic geometry, but the question remains to find
an explicit basis for the module which would give a simple proof of the
dimension. Using the theory of Orbit Harmonics developed by Garsia and Haiman,
we present a "kicking basis" for Garsia-Haiman modules indexed by a partition
with at most two columns.
