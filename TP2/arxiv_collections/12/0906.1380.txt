This paper provides a realization of all classical and most exceptional
finite groups of Lie type as Galois groups over function fields over F_q and
derives explicit additive polynomials for the extensions. Our unified approach
is based on results of Matzat which give bounds for Galois groups of Frobenius
modules and uses the structure and representation theory of the corresponding
connected linear algebraic groups.
