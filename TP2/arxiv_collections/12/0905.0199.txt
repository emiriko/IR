In this paper, we use a weighted isoperimetric inequality to give a lower
bound on the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a bounded domain
inside a Euclidean cone. Our bound is sharp, in that only sectors realize it.
This result generalizes a lower bound of Payne and Weinberger in two
dimensions.
