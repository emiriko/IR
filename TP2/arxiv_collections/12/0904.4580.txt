We have studied the spin structure of circular four-electron quantum rings
using tunable confinement potentials. The calculations were done using the
exact diagonalization method. Our results indicate that ringlike systems can
have oscillatory flips between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic behaviour as
a function of the magnetic field. Furthermore, at constant external magnetic
fields there were seen similar oscillatory changes between ferromagnetism and
antiferromagnetism when the system parameters were changed. Ackording to our
results, the magnetism of quantum rings could be tuned by system parameters.We
