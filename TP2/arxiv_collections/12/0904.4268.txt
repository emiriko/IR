We argue that topological vector currents may be the source of many phenomena
in neutron stars: kicks, jets, toroidal fields and magnetic helicity.
Topological vector currents exist because of the P-symmetry violation of the
weak interaction. Kicks and helicity are both objects that transform as
pseudovectors and thus require P-symmetry violation to manifest themselves.
This symmetry argument is supported numerically; topological currents provide
transfer enough momentum to describe even the largest of kicks and can generate
large toroidal fields that create helicity. An observational signature of
currents is a faint left circular polarization in the X-rays in the wake of the
neutron star that may require high precision polarimetry to see.
