By analyzing the strength of a photon-fermion coupling using basic scattering
processes we calculate the effect of a velocity anisotropy on the critical
number of fermions at which mass is dynamically generated in planar QED. This
gives a quantitative criterion which can be used to locate a quantum critical
point at which fermions are gapped and confined out of the physical spectrum in
a phase diagram of various condensed matter systems. We also discuss the
mechanism of relativity restoration within the symmetric, quantum-critical
phase of the theory.
