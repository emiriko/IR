We present muon spin relaxation (muSR) measurements on a large YBa2Cu3O6.6
single crystal in which two kinds of unusual magnetic order have been detected
in the pseudogap region by neutron scattering. A comparison is made to
measurements on smaller, higher quality YBa2Cu3Oy single crystals. One type of
magnetic order is observed in all samples, but does not evolve significantly
with hole doping. A second type of unusual magnetic order is observed only in
the YBa2Cu3O6.6 single crystal. This magnetism has an ordered magnetic moment
that is quantitatively consistent with the neutron experiments, but is confined
to just a small volume of the sample (~ 3%). Our findings do not support
theories that ascribe the pseudogap to a state characterized by loop-current
order, but instead indicate that dilute impurity phases are the source of the
unusual magnetic orders in YBa2Cu3Oy.
