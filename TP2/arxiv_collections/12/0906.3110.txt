The influence of solar cycle and activity phenomena on the two climatic
variabilities such as the rainfall and the surface temperature of the Indian
subcontinent are critically examined. It is concluded from this study that the
sun indeed strongly influences both of these climatic variabilities and the
sun's influence simply cannot be ignored.
