We identify coronal holes using a histogram-based intensity thresholding
technique and compare their properties to fast solar wind streams at three
different points in the heliosphere. The thresholding technique was tested on
EUV and X-ray images obtained using instruments onboard STEREO, SOHO and
Hinode. The full-disk images were transformed into Lambert equal-area
projection maps and partitioned into a series of overlapping sub-images from
which local histograms were extracted. The histograms were used to determine
the threshold for the low intensity regions, which were then classified as
coronal holes or filaments using magnetograms from the SOHO/MDI. For all three
instruments, the local thresholding algorithm was found to successfully
determine coronal hole boundaries in a consistent manner. Coronal hole
properties extracted using the segmentation algorithm were then compared with
in situ measurements of the solar wind at 1 AU from ACE and STEREO. Our results
indicate that flux tubes rooted in coronal holes expand super-radially within 1
AU and that larger (smaller) coronal holes result in longer (shorter) duration
high-speed solar wind streams.
