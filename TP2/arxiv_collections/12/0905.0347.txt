We present a case study for the semiclassical calculation of the oscillations
in the particle and kinetic-energy densities for the two-dimensional circular
billiard. For this system, we can give a complete classification of all closed
periodic and non-periodic orbits. We discuss their bifurcations under variation
of the starting point r and derive analytical expressions for their properties
such as actions, stability determinants, momentum mismatches and Morse indices.
We present semiclassical calculations of the spatial density oscillations using
a recently developed closed-orbit theory [Roccia J and Brack M 2008 Phys. Rev.
Lett. 100 200408], employing standard uniform approximations from perturbation
and bifurcation theory, and test the convergence of the closed-orbit sum.
