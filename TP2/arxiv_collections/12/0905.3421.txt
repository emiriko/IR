We present calculations of contact potential surface patch effects that
simplify previous treatments. It is shown that, because of the linearity of
Laplace's equation, the presence of patch potentials does not affect an
electrostatic calibration (of force and/or distance) of a two-plate Casimir
measurement apparatus. Using models that include long-range variations in the
contact potential across the plate surfaces, a number of experimental
observations can be reproduced and explained. For these models, numerical
calculations show that if a voltage is applied between the plates which
minimizes the force, a residual electrostatic force persists, and that the
minimizing potential varies with distance. The residual force can be described
by a fit to a simple two-parameter function involving the minimizing potential
and its variation with distance. We show the origin of this residual force by
use of a simple parallel capacitor model. Finally, the implications of a
residual force that varies in a manner different from 1/d on the accuracy of
previous Casimir measurements is discussed.
