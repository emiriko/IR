We investigate the bounds on the mass of the lightest neutralino from rare
meson decays within the MSSM with and without minimal flavor violation. We
present explicit formulae for the two-body decays of mesons into light
neutralinos and perform the first complete calculation of the loop-induced
decays of kaons to pions and light neutralinos and B mesons to kaons and light
neutralinos. We find that the supersymmetric branching ratios are strongly
suppressed within the MSSM with minimal flavor violation, and that no bounds on
the neutralino mass can be inferred from experimental data, i.e. a massless
neutralino is allowed. The branching ratios for kaon and B meson decays into
light neutralinos may, however, be enhanced when one allows for non-minimal
flavor violation. We find new constraints on the MSSM parameter space for such
scenarios and discuss prospects for future kaon and B meson experiments.
Finally, we comment on the search for light neutralinos in monojet signatures
at the Tevatron and at the LHC.
