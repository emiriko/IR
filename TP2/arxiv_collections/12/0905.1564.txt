We discuss the equilibrium of a single collective variable characterizing a
finite set of coupled, noisy, bistable systems as the noise strength, the size
and the coupling parameter are varied. We identify distinct regions in
parameter space. The results obtained in prior works in the asymptotic infinite
size limit are significantly different from the finite size results. A
procedure to construct approximate 1-dimensional Langevin equation is adopted.
This equation provides a useful tool to understand the collective behavior even
in the presence of an external driving force.
