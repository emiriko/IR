We investigate theoretically subwavelength imaging by acoustic metamaterial
slabs immersed in the liquid matrix. A near-field subwavelength image formed by
evanescent waves is achieved by a designed metamaterial slab with negative mass
density and positive modulus. A subwavelength real image is achieved by a
designed metamaterial slab with simultaneously negative mass density and
modulus. These results are expected to shed some lights on designing novel
devices of acoustic metamaterials.
