In this paper, we are first interested in the compressible Navier-Stokes
equations with densitydependent viscosities in bounded domains with
on-homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. We study the wellposedness of such models
with non-constant coefficients in non-stationary and stationary cases. We apply
the last result in thin domains context, justifying the compressible Reynolds
equations.
