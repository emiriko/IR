The theory of algebraic-geometric codes has been developed in the beginning
of the 80's after a paper of V.D. Goppa. Given a smooth projective algebraic
curve X over a finite field, there are two different constructions of
error-correcting codes. The first one, called "functional", uses some rational
functions on X and the second one, called "differential", involves some
rational 1-forms on this curve. Hundreds of papers are devoted to the study of
such codes.
  In addition, a generalization of the functional construction for algebraic
varieties of arbitrary dimension is given by Y. Manin in an article of 1984. A
few papers about such codes has been published, but nothing has been done
concerning a generalization of the differential construction to the
higher-dimensional case.
  In this thesis, we propose a differential construction of codes on algebraic
surfaces. Afterwards, we study the properties of these codes and particularly
their relations with functional codes. A pretty surprising fact is that a main
difference with the case of curves appears. Indeed, if in the case of curves, a
differential code is always the orthogonal of a functional one, this assertion
generally fails for surfaces. Last observation motivates the study of codes
which are the orthogonal of some functional code on a surface. Therefore, we
prove that, under some condition on the surface, these codes can be realized as
sums of differential codes. Moreover, we show that some answers to some open
problems "a la Bertini" could give very interesting informations on the
parameters of these codes.
