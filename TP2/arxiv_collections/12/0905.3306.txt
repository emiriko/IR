The application of the hyperspherical harmonic approach to the case of the
N-d scattering problem below deuteron breakup threshold is described. The
nuclear Hamiltonian includes two- and three-nucleon interactions, in particular
the Argonne v_{18}, the N3LO-Idaho, and the V_{low k} two-nucleon, and the
Urbana IX and N2LO three-nucleon interactions. Some of these models are local,
some are non-local. Also electromagnetic effects are included. Accurate
calculations for many scattering observables at various center-of-mass energies
are performed and the results are compared with the available experimental
data. Furthermore, a \chi^2 analysis of some of the Hamiltonian models has been
performed to compare their capability to describe the scattering process.
