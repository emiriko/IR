A semiclassical mechanism which suppresses the weak anisotropies of an
inhomogeneous cosmological model is developed. In particular, a wave function
of this Universe having a meaningful probabilistic interpretation is obtained
that is in agreement with the Copenhagen School. It describes the evolution of
the anisotropies with respect to the isotropic scale factor which is regarded
as a semiclassical variable playing an observer-like role. Near the
cosmological singularity the solution spreads over all values of the
anisotropies while, when the Universe expands sufficiently, the closed
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model appears to be the favorite state.
