This is a revised form of the previous paper in which we study cones of
positive maps of B(H) into itself. We add the result that the dual cone of a
symmetric mapping cone is itself a symmetric mapping cone.
  As applications we obtain characterizations of linear functionals with strong
positivity conditions with respect to a class of mapping cones called symmetric
mapping cones. Applications are given to separable and PPT-states.
