Inclusive electron-proton and electron-deuteron inelastic cross sections have
been measured at Jefferson Lab (JLab) in the resonance region, at large Bjorken
x, up to 0.92, and four-momentum transfer squared Q2 up to 7.5 GeV2 in the
experiment E00-116. These measurements are used to extend to larger x and Q2
precision, quantitative, studies of the phenomenon of quark-hadron duality. Our
analysis confirms, both globally and locally, the apparent violation of
quark-hadron duality previously observed at a Q2 of 3.5 GeV2 when resonance
data are compared to structure function data created from CTEQ6M and MRST2004
parton distribution functions (PDFs). More importantly, our new data show that
this discrepancy saturates by Q2 ~ 4 Gev2, becoming Q2 independent. This
suggests only small violations of Q2 evolution by contributions from the
higher-twist terms in the resonance region which is confirmed by our
comparisons to ALEKHIN and ALLM97.We conclude that the unconstrained strength
of the CTEQ6M and MRST2004 PDFs at large x is the major source of the
disagreement between data and these parameterizations in the kinematic regime
we study and that, in view of quark-hadron duality, properly averaged resonance
region data could be used in global QCD fits to reduce PDF uncertainties at
large x.
