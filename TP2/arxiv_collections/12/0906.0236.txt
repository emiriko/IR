The spatial and temporal noise properties of diffuse radiation is
investigated in the context of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), although
generic formulae that enable application to any other forms of incoherent light
of a prescribed energy spectrum are also provided. It is shown that the
variance of fluctuations in the density and flux consists of two parts. First
is a term from the spontaneous emission coefficient which is the contribution
from a random gas of classical particles representing the corpuscular (photon)
nature of light. Second is a term from the stimulated emission coefficient
which leads to a `wave noise', or more precisely the noise arising from the
superposition of many plane waves of arbitrary phase - the normal modes of the
radiation. The origin of this second term has never been elucidated before. We
discussed one application. In the spatially homogeneous post-inflationary
epochs when the universe was reheated to GUT temperatures, the thermal CMB
density fluctuations on the horizon scale is of order the WMAP measured value
of 10$^{-5}$. Beyond (larger than) the horizon, the power spectrum of
perturbations could moreover assume the observed form of $P(k) \sim k$ if
thermal diffusion to equilibrium does not merely involve classical particles,
but also non-localized wave components. The outcome of our study clearly
demonstrates that such components do indeed exist.
