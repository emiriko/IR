Thermally excited phonon spectra of 2D Yukawa solids and liquids in the
presence of an external magnetic field are studied using computer simulations.
Special attention is paid to the variation of wave spectra in terms of several
key parameters, such as the strength of coupling, the screening parameter, and
the intensity of the magnetic field. In addition, comparisons are made with
several analytical theories, including random-phase approximation,
quasi-localized charge approximation, and harmonic approximation, and the
validity of those theories is discussed in the present context.
