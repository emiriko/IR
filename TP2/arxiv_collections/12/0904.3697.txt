Here, a comprehensive theory of the couplings between a nanocavity and
exciton complexes in a quantum dot is developed, which successfully predicts
the spectral triplet in the strong coupling regime that has been observed in
several experiments but is unexpected according to conventional cavity quantum
electrodynamics. The quantum anti-Zeno effect is found to play an essential
role in the appearance of the central peak in the triplet under a
low-excitation regime. The effect of hyperfine interactions is also discussed,
which results in the cavity-mediated mixing of bright and dark exciton states.
These results provide significant insights into solid-state cavity quantum
electrodynamics.
