An alternative derivation of the first-order relativistic contribution to
perihelic precession is presented. Orbital motion in the Schwarzschild geometry
is considered in the Keplerian limit, and the orbit equation is derived for
approximately elliptical motion. The method of solution makes use of coordinate
transformations and the correspondence principle, rather than the standard
perturbative approach. The form of the resulting orbit equation is similar to
that derived from Newtonian mechanics and includes first-order corrections to
Kepler's orbits due to general relativity. The associated relativistic
contribution to perihelic precession agrees with established first-order
results. The reduced radius for the circular orbit is in agreement to
first-order with that calculated from the Schwarzschild effective potential.
The method of solution is understandable by undergraduate students.
