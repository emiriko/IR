We develop a method that can constrain any local exchange-correlation
potential to preserve ba-sic exact conditions. Using the method of Lagrange
multipliers, we calculate for each set of given Kohn-Sham orbitals, a
constraint-preserving potential which is closest to the given
exchange-correlation potential. The method is applicable to both the
time-dependent (TD) and independent cases. The exact conditions that are
enforced for the time-independent case are: Galilean covariance, zero net force
and torque, and Levy-Perdew virial theorem. For the TD case we enforce
translational covariance, zero net force, the Levy-Perdew virial theorem and
energy balance. We test our method on the exchange Krieger-Li-Iafrate (xKLI)
approximate-optimized effective potential (AOEP), for both cases. For the
time-independent case, we calculated the ground state properties of some
hydrogen chains and small sodium clusters, for some constrained xKLI potentials
and Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange. The results indicate that enforcing the exact
conditions is not important for these cases. On the other hand, in the case,
constraining both energy balance and zero net force yields improved results
relative to TDHF calculations. We explored the electron dynamics in small
sodium clusters driven by CW laser pulses. For each laser pulse we compared
calculations from TD constrained xKLI, TD partially constrained xKLI and TDHF.
We found that electron dynamics like elec-tron ionization and moment of inertia
dynamics for the constrained xKLI are most similar to the TDHF results. Also,
energy conservation is better by at least an order of magnitude with respect to
the unconstrained xKLI. We also discuss the problems that arise in satisfying
constraints in the TD case with a non CW driving force.
