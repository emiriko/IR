The Hodge-de Rham Laplacean is an extension to forms of the wave equation. A
frame is a quartuple of 1-forms. The Hodge-de Rham Laplacean is modified to
model it on the frame itself (not on the standard frame $dx$). This modified
Laplacean is invariant. The basic equation is: The modified Laplacean operating
on the frame is equal to a source term times the frame. Kaniel and Itin (Il
Nuovo Cimento vol 113B,N3,1998) analyzed the equation for steady state and
spherically symmetric frame (General Relativity). They computed a closed
solution for which the derived metric is Rosen's. This closed solution is
intrinsically different than Schwarzschild solution. Yet it passes the three
classical experimental tests to the same accuracy. The same basic equation
is,also, the alternative to Schroedinger equation, where the source term is the
electromagnetic potential. The same quantization as in Schroedinger equation is
attained. The suggested system is hyperbolic, in contrast to the time dependent
Schroedinger equation which is parabolic. For time dependent frames the
equation is quite complicated. Thus, the linearized equation is explicitly
solved .
