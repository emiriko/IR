We develop the continuum mechanics of quantum many-body systems in the linear
response regime. The basic variable of the theory is the displacement field,
for which we derive a closed equation of motion under the assumption that the
time-dependent wave function in a locally co-moving reference frame can be
described as a geometric deformation of the ground-state wave function. We show
that this equation of motion is exact for systems consisting of a single
particle, and for all systems at sufficiently high frequency, and that it leads
to an excitation spectrum that has the correct integrated strength. The theory
is illustrated by simple model applications to one- and two-electron systems.
