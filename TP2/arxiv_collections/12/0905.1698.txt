We explore the prospects of using the hyperfine transition of 3He+ as a probe
of the intergalactic medium. The emission signal from ionized regions during
reionization is expected to be anti-correlated with 21cm maps. The predicted
emission signal from Lyman-alpha blobs at lower redshifts is detectable with
future radio observatories.
