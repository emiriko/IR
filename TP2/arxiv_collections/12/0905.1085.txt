With photon-number resolving detectors, we show compression of interference
fringes with increasing photon numbers for a Fabry-Perot interferometer. This
feature provides a higher precision in determining the position of the
interference maxima compared to a classical detection strategy. We also
theoretically show supersensitivity if N-photon states are sent into the
interferometer and a photon-number resolving measurement is performed.
