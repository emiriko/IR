The tunneling spectra of the electron-doped cuprate Pr_2-xCe_xCuO4 as a
function of doping and temperature is reported. We find that the
superconducting gap, delta, shows a BCS-like temperature dependence even for
extremely low carrier concentrations (studied here for the first time).
Moreover, delta follows the doping dependence of Tc, in strong contrast with
tunneling studies of hole-doped cuprates. From our results we conclude that
there is a single superconducting energy scale in the electron-doped cuprates.
