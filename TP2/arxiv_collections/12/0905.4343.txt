We have studied multiply charged Arq+ ion induced potential sputtering of a
unique system comprising of coexisting Silicon and Silicon oxide surfaces. Such
surfaces are produced by oblique angle oxygen ion bombardment on Si(100), where
ripple structures are formed and one side of each ripple gets more oxidized. It
is observed that higher the potential energy of Arq+ ion, higher the sputtering
yield of the non conducting (oxide) side of the ripple as compared to the
semiconducting side. The results are explained in terms of Coulomb explosion
model where potential sputtering depends on the conductivity of the ion impact
sites.
