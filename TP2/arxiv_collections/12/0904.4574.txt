We consider scenarios with large flavour violating entries in the squark mass
matrices focusing on the mixing between second and third generation squarks.
These entries govern both, flavour violating low energy observables on the one
hand and squark and gluino decays on the other hand. We first discuss the
constraints on the parameter space due to the recent data on B mesons from the
B factories and Tevatron. We then consider flavour violating squark and gluino
decays and show that they can still be typically of order 10% despite the
stringent constraints from low energy data. Finally we briefly comment on the
impact for searches and parameter determinations at future collider experiments
such as the upcoming LHC or a future International Linear Collider.
