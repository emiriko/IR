A short overview of studies of strong coupling problems in hadron physics is
presented. The Schwinger-Dyson/Bethe-Salpeter approach in the continuum allows
the perturbative regime to be connected to the world of strong coupling that
controls confinement and chiral dynamics that in turn determines the properties
of light hadrons with just one scale, {\it viz.} $\Lambda_{QCD}$, and with the
addition of current masses the properties of heavy flavours too.
