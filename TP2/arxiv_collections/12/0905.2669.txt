The effect of ultralow-frequency or static magnetic and electric fields on
biological processes is of huge interest for researchers due to the resonant
change of the intensity of biochemical reactions although the energy in such
fields is small. A simplified model to study the effect of the weak magnetic
and electrical fields on fluctuation of the random ionic currents in blood and
to solve the $k_BT$ problem in magnetobiology is suggested. The analytic
expression for the kinetic energy of the molecules dissolved in certain liquid
media is obtained. The values of the magnetic field leading to resonant effects
in capillaries are estimated. The numerical estimates showed that the resonant
values of the energy of molecular in the capillaries and aorta are different:
under identical conditions a molecule of the aorta gets $10^{-9}$ times less
energy than the molecules in blood capillaries. So the capillaries are very
sensitive to the resonant effect, with an approach to the resonant value of the
magnetic field strength, the average energy of the molecule localized in the
capillary is increased by several orders of magnitude as compared to its
thermal energy, this value of the energy is sufficient for the deterioration of
the chemical bonds.
