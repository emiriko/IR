Massive black holes are ubiquitous, occurring at the centres of all massive
galaxies and possibly many low mass ones. They are no ornament which just
happens to be there, but play a role vital to the growth and structure of the
host galaxy. How they do this has come to be known as cosmic feedback and how
it works, indeed how black holes work, is the subject of this paper.
