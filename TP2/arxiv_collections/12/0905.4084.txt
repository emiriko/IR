We demonstrate the possibility to build a thermoelectric engine using a one
dimensional gas of molecules with unequal masses and hard-point interaction.
Most importantly, we show that the efficiency of this engine is determined by a
new parameter YT which is different from the well known figure of merit ZT.
Even though the efficiency of this particular model is low, our results shed
new light on the problem and open the possibility to build efficient
thermoelectric engines.
