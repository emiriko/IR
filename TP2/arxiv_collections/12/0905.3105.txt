We establish uniqueness of ground states $u(x) \geq 0$ for the $L^2$-critical
boson star equation $\sqrt{-\Delta} u - (|x|^{-1} \ast |u|^2) u = -u$ in
$\R^3$. The proof blends variational arguments with the harmonic extension to
the halfspace $\R^4_+$. Apart from uniqueness, we also show radiality of ground
states (up to translations) and the nondegeneracy of the linearization. Our
results provide an indispensable basis for the blowup analysis of the
time-dependent $L^2$-critical boson star equation. The uniqueness proof can be
generalized to different fractional Laplacians $(-\Delta)^s$ and space
dimensions.
