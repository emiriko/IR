In this manuscript, a unified approach to hadron physics from holographic
point of view is described. After introduction of a general setup for
meson-nucleon system based on the bottom-up approach of QCD (AdS/QCD), as an
illustration, we specifically examine meson-nucleon couplings. This is an
example of the notion we call "holographic unification" in hadron physics.
