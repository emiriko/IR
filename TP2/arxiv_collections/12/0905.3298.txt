We propose a way to remove black hole singularities by using a particular
nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian that has been recently used in various
astrophysics and cosmological frameworks. In particular, we adapt the
cosmological analysis discussed in a previous work to the black hole physics.
Such analysis will be improved by applying the Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to
the black hole case. At the end, fixed the radius of the star, the final
density depends only on the introduced quintessential density term
$\rho_{\gamma}$ and on the mass.
