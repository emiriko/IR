We report studies of in-situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) and electronic
properties on the single crystalline of Fe1.05Te compound under high pressure.
The results demonstrated that the sample undergoes a pressure-induced lattice
collapse in tetragonal phase (cT) at 4 GPa at room temperature. The cT phase in
turn transfers to monoclinic (M) phase with increasing pressure to 14 GPa. The
resistance measurements under pressures show that the onset temperature of
structural phase transition (TSTR) decreases upon transformation from the
tetragonal (T) to the cT phase and turns up at the 4 GPa where is the boundary
pressure of T-cT phase. The onset of antiferromagnetic transition (TAF) shows
little change up to 0.8 GPa by magnetization measurements. In the domain of M
phase, the sample behaves like semiconductor at low temperature. No
superconductivity is observed under the pressure investigated.
