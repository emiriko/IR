We present a schematic model of the \hat{sl(2,R})} Kugo-Ojima physical state
condition of gauged S-duality using modular forms of the Ramanujan \Delta
function type. The properties of the solutions with spontaneously broken gauged
S-duality with their dimensionality of space-time and the gauge symmetries of
low energy theory are studied.
