We provide an overview of a canonical formalism that describes mixed
quantum-classical systems in terms of statistical ensembles on configuration
space, and discuss applications to measurement theory. It is shown that the
formalism allows a general description of the measurement of a quantum system
by a classical apparatus without running into inconsistencies. An example of
classical and quantum particles interacting gravitationally is also given.
