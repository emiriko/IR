The recent experimental conductance measurements taken on magnetic impurities
on metallic surfaces, using scanning tunneling microscopy technique and
suggesting occurrence of inelastic scattering processes, are theoretically
addressed. We argue that the observed conductance signatures are caused by
transitions between the spin states which have opened due to e.g. exchange
coupling between the local spins and the tunneling electrons, and are directly
interpretable in terms of inelastic transitions energies. Feasible measurements
using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy that would enable new
information about the excitation spectrum of the local spins are discussed.
