We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model in which neutrinos are
Dirac particles and their tiny masses are explained without requiring tiny
Yukawa couplings. A second Higgs doublet with a tiny vacuum expectation value
provides neutrino masses while simultaneously improving the naturalness of the
model by allowing a heavier Standard Model-like Higgs boson consistent with
electroweak precision data. The model predicts a mu to e gamma rate potentially
detectable in the current round of experiments, as well as distinctive
signatures in the production and decay of the charged Higgs H+ of the second
doublet which can be tested at future colliders. Neutrinoless double beta decay
is absent.
