Recently the BaBar Collaboration published new data on the cross section for
the annihilation e+e- -> phi pi0, obtained using the initial state radiation
technique at a center of mass energy of 10.6 GeV. Such a process represents an
interesting test bed for the quark model. Indeed, since the phi-pi0 production
via e+e- annihilation proceeds through a mechanism which violates the
Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule, the corresponding cross section could be characterized
by contributions from non-qqbar bound states, like hybrids or tetraquarks. The
phi-pi0 cross section is analyzed in connection with other data coming from
different processes, that involve the same mesons, using a method which
implements the analyticity in the phi-pi0 transition form factor by means of a
dispersion relation procedure.
