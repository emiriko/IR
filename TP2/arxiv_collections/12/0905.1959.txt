The properties of matter at ultra-high densities, low temperatures, and with
a significant asymmetry between protons and neutrons can be studied exclusively
through astrophysical observations of neutron stars. We show that measurements
of the masses and radii of neutron stars can lead to tight constraints on the
pressure of matter at three fiducial densities, from 1.85 to 7.4 times the
density of nuclear saturation, in a manner that is largely model-independent
and that captures the key characteristics of the equation of state. We
demonstrate that observations with 10% uncertainties of at least three neutron
stars can lead to measurements of the pressure at these fiducial densities with
an accuracy of 0.11 dex or ~ 30%. Observations of three neutron stars with 5%
uncertainties are sufficient to distinguish at a better than 3-sigma confidence
level between currently proposed equations of state. In the electromagnetic
spectrum, such accurate measurements will become possible for weakly-magnetic
neutron stars during thermonuclear flashes and in quiescence with future
missions such as the International X-ray Observatory (IXO).
