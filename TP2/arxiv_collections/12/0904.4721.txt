We present a detailed description of our void finding algorithm which is an
extension of the prescription by Hoyle and Vogeley (2002). We include a
discussion of the reproducibility and robustness of the algorithm as well as
the statistical significance of the detected voids. We apply our void finder to
the Data Release 5 (DR5) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and identify
232 cosmological voids. A void catalog which contains the most salient
properties of the detected voids is created. We present a statistical analysis
of the distribution of the size, shape and orientation of our identified
cosmological voids. We also investigate possible trends with redshift for 0.04
< z < 0.16. We compare our results to those from an identical analysis of a
mock catalog based on the LambdaCDM model and find reasonable agreement.
However, some statistically significant differences in the overall orientation
of cosmological voids are present and will have to be reconciled by further
refinement of the simulations.
