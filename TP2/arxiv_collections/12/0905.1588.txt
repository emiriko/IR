Most theories of homogeneous nucleation are based on a Fokker-Planck-like
description of the behavior of the mass of clusters. Here we will show that
these approaches are incomplete for a large class of nucleating systems, as
they assume the effective dynamics of the clusters to be Markovian, i.e.,
memoryless. We characterize these non-Markovian dynamics and show how this
influences the dynamics of clusters during nucleation. Our results are
validated by simulations of a three-dimensional Ising model with locally
conserved magnetization.
