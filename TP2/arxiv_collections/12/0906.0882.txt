The X(3872) is universally accepted to be an exotic hadron. In this letter we
assume that the X(3872) is a D0 \bar D0* molecule, as claimed by many authors,
and attempt an estimate of its prompt production cross section at Tevatron. A
comparison with CDF data allows to draw some qualitative conclusions about this
statement.
