A large class of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states can be classified
according to their pattern of zeros, which describes the way ideal ground state
wave functions go to zero as various clusters of electrons are brought
together. In this paper we generalize this approach to classify multilayer FQH
states. Such a classification leads to the construction of a class of
non-Abelian multilayer FQH states that are closely related to $\hat{g}_k$
parafermion conformal field theories, where $\hat{g}_k$ is an affine simple Lie
algebra. We discuss the possibility of some of the simplest of these
non-Abelian states occuring in experiments on bilayer FQH systems at $\nu =
2/3$, 4/5, 4/7, etc.
