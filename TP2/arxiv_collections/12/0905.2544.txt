Whether a dwarf spheroidal galaxy is in equilibrium or being tidally
disrupted by the Milky Way is an important question for the study of its dark
matter content and distribution. This question is investigated using 328 recent
observations from the dwarf spheroidal Leo I. For Leo I, tidal disruption is
detected, at least for stars sufficiently far from the center, but the effect
appears to be quite modest. Statistical tools include isotonic and split point
estimators, asymptotic theory, and resampling methods.
