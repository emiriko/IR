We study the classical and quantum phase transitions of Sp(4) spin systems on
three dimensional stacked square and triangular lattices. We present general
Ginzburg-Landau field theories for various types of Sp(4) spin orders with
different ground state manifolds such as CP(3), S^7/Z_2, Grassmann manifold
G_{2,5}, G_{2,6} and so on, based on which the nature of the classical phase
transitions are studied, and a global phase diagram is presented. The classical
phase transitions close to quantum phase transitions toward spin liquid states
are also discussed based on renormalization group (RG) flow. Our results can be
directly applied to the simplest Sp(4) and SU(4) Heisenberg models which can be
realized using spin-3/2 atoms and Alkaline earth atoms trapped in optical
lattice.
