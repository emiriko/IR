After describing Bhabha's early life at Bombay, now Mumbai, we discuss his
research career at Cambridge, where he made many distinguished contributions to
positron physics, cosmic rays and the meson theory. These include theory of
positron-electron scattering (Bhabha scattering), Bhabha-Heitler theory of
cosmic ray showers and prediction of heavier electrons (ie. muons). Later in
his life, after 1945, Bhabha worked in India at Bangalore and Mumbai. In India
Bhabha laid foundations of modern nuclear science and technology. He emerged as
a successful institution builder founding Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research at Mumbai and the Laboratories of Atomic Energy Establishment at
Trombay, now renamed as Bhabha Atomic Research Center.
