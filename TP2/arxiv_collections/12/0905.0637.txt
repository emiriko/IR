Sokoloski et al (2008) have recently reported evidence that the recurrent
nova RS Ophiuchi produced a pair of highly collimated radio jets within days of
its 2006 outburst. This suggests that an accretion disc must be present during
the outburst. However in the standard picture of recurrent novae as
thermonuclear events, any such disc must be expelled from the white dwarf
vicinity, as the nuclear energy yield greatly exceeds its binding energy. We
suggest instead that the outbursts of RS Oph are thermal--viscous instabilities
in a disc irradiated by the central accreting white dwarf. The distinctive
feature of RS Oph is the very large size of its accretion disc. Given this, it
fits naturally into a consistent picture of systems with unstable accretion
discs. This picture explains the presence and speed of the jets, the brightness
and duration of the outburst, and its rise time and linear decay, as well as
the faintness of the quiescence. By contrast, the hitherto standard picture of
recurrent thermonuclear explosions has a number of severe difficulties. These
include the presence of jets, the faintness of quiescence, and the fact the the
accretion disc must be unstable unless it is far smaller than any reasonable
estimate.
