I show how recent progress in real space renormalization group methods can be
used to define a generalized notion of holography inspired by holographic
dualities in quantum gravity. The generalization is based upon organizing
information in a quantum state in terms of scale and defining a higher
dimensional geometry from this structure. While states with a finite
correlation length typically give simple geometries, the state at a quantum
critical point gives a discrete version of anti de Sitter space. Some finite
temperature quantum states include black hole-like objects. The gross features
of equal time correlation functions are also reproduced in this geometric
framework. The relationship between this framework and better understood
versions of holography is discussed.
