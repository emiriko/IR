We discuss effects of reflective scattering for heavy nuclei collisions and
the deconfined matter formation at the LHC and asymptotical energies.
Reflective scattering in hadron collisions leads to decreasing matter density
with energy beyond the LHC energies. Limiting form of energy dependence of
hadron density is obtained.
