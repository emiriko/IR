We claim that looking at probability distributions of \emph{finite time}
largest Lyapunov exponents, and more precisely studying their large deviation
properties, yields an extremely powerful technique to get quantitative
estimates of polynomial decay rates of time correlations and Poincar\'e
recurrences in the -quite delicate- case of dynamical systems with weak chaotic
properties.
