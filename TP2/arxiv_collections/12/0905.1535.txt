We describe high-Tc superconductivity in layered materials within a BCS
theory as a BEC of massless-like Cooper pairons satisfying a linear dispersion
relation, and propagating within quasi-2D layers of finite width defined by the
charge distribution about the CuO_2 planes. We obtain a closed formula for the
critical temperature, Tc, that depends on the layer width, the binding energy
of Cooper's pairs, and the average in-plane penetration depth. This formula
reasonably reproduces empirical values of superconducting transition
temperatures for several different cuprate materials near the optimal doping
regime, as well as for YBCO films with different doping degrees.
