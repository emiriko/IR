In this paper we study the generation of primordial perturbation with a
modified dispersion relation in various cosmological evolutions. We stress that
the formation of the power spectrum is strongly dependent on the background.
Working in a bounce model with a matter-like contracting phase, we obtain a red
tilt spectrum due to the modified dispersion relation.
