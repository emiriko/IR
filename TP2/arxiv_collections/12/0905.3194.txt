BaFe2As2 exhibits properties characteristic of the parent compounds of the
newly discovered iron (Fe)-based high-TC superconductors. By combining the real
space imaging of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) with
momentum space quantitative Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) we have
identified the surface plane of cleaved BaFe2As2 crystals as the As terminated
Fe-As layer - the plane where superconductivity occurs. LEED and STM/S data on
the BaFe2As2(001) surface indicate an ordered arsenic (As) - terminated
metallic surface without reconstruction or lattice distortion. It is surprising
that the STM images the different Fe-As orbitals associated with the
orthorhombic structure, not the As atoms in the surface plane.
