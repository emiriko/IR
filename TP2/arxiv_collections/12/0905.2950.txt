We present a linear program that is capable of determining whether a set of
correlations can be captured by a local realistic model. If the correlations
can be described by such a model, the linear program outputs a joint
probability distribution that produces the given correlations. If the
correlations cannot be described under the assumption of local realism, the
program outputs a Bell inequality violated by the correlations.
