We study the Fourier transform of the local density of states (LDOS) in
graphene in the presence of a single impurity at high magnetic field. We find
that the most pronounced features occur for energies of the STM tip matching
the Landau level energies. The Fourier transform of the LDOS shows regions of
high intensity centered around the center and the corners of the Brillouin zone
(BZ). The radial intensity dependence of these features is determined by the
form of the wavefunctions of the electrons in the quantum Hall regime.
Moreover, some of these regions break rotational symmetry, and their angular
dependence is determined by the chirality of the graphene electrons. For the
zeroth Landau level, the ratio between the features at the corners and center
of the BZ depends on the nature of the disorder: it goes to zero for potential
disorder, and is finite for hopping disorder. We believe that a comparison
between our analysis and experiments will help understand the form of the
quasiparticle wavefunction, as well as the nature of disorder in graphene.
