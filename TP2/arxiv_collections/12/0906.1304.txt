We present a method for efficient spectral readout of mechanical resonator
arrays in dissipative environments. Magnetomotive drive and detection is used
to drive double clamped resonators in the nonlinear regime. Resonators with
almost identical resonance frequencies can be tracked individually by sweeping
the drive power. Measurements are performed at room temperature and atmospheric
pressure. These conditions enable application in high throughput resonant
sensor arrays.
