Recently a concise expression for the subleading infrared singularity of
dimensional-regularized gauge theories has been proposed. For conformal
theories, such relation involves a universal eikonal contribution plus a
non-eikonal contribution, related to the subleading term in the anomalous
dimension of twist two operators with large spin. In this note we make use of
the AdS/CFT correspondence in order to check such conjecture at strong coupling
for the case of N=4 SYM.
