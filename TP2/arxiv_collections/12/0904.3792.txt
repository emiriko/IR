A tracking detector is proposed for lepton flavor violation experiments ($\mu
\to e$ conversion, $\mu \to e + \gamma$, $\mu \to 3e $) consisting of identical
chambers which can be reconfigured to meet the requirements for all three
experiments. A pattern recognition and track reconstruction procedure based on
the Kalman filter technique is presented for this detector.
  The pattern recognition proceeds in two stages. At the first stage only hit
straw tube center coordinates, without drift time information, are used to
reduce the background to a manageable level. At the second stage the drift time
information is incorporated and a deterministic annealing filter is applied to
reach the final level of background suppression. The final track momentum
reconstruction is provided by a combinatorial drop filter which is effective in
hit-to-track assignment.
  The momentum resolution of the tracker in measuring monochromatic leptons is
found to be $\sigma_{p}$ = 0.17 and 0.26 MeV for the $\mu \to e$ conversion and
$\mu^+ \to e^+ + \gamma$ processes, respectively. The tracker reconstruction
resolution for the total scalar lepton momentum is $\sigma_{p} = $ 0.33 MeV for
the $\mu \to 3e$ process. The obtained tracker resolutions allow an increase in
sensitivity to the branching ratios for these processes by a few orders of
magnitude over current experimental limits.
