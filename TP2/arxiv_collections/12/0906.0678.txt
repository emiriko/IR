A continuous-time Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio selection problem is
studied in a market with one stock, one bond, and proportional transaction
costs. This is a singular stochastic control problem,inherently in a finite
time horizon. With a series of transformations, the problem is turned into a
so-called double obstacle problem, a well studied problem in physics and
partial differential equation literature, featuring two time-varying free
boundaries. The two boundaries, which define the buy, sell, and no-trade
regions, are proved to be smooth in time. This in turn characterizes the
optimal strategy, via a Skorokhod problem, as one that tries to keep a certain
adjusted bond-stock position within the no-trade region. Several features of
the optimal strategy are revealed that are remarkably different from its
no-transaction-cost counterpart. It is shown that there exists a critical
length in time, which is dependent on the stock excess return as well as the
transaction fees but independent of the investment target and the stock
volatility, so that an expected terminal return may not be achievable if the
planning horizon is shorter than that critical length (while in the absence of
transaction costs any expected return can be reached in an arbitrary period of
time). It is further demonstrated that anyone following the optimal strategy
should not buy the stock beyond the point when the time to maturity is shorter
than the aforementioned critical length. Moreover, the investor would be less
likely to buy the stock and more likely to sell the stock when the maturity
date is getting closer. These features, while consistent with the widely
accepted investment wisdom, suggest that the planning horizon is an integral
part of the investment opportunities.
