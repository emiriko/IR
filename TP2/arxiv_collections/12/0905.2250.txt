We present a generalized discontinuous Galerkin method for a multicomponent
compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes system of equations. The system presented
has a functional viscosity nu which depends on the pressure p=p(rho,mu_i) of
the flow, with the density rho and the local concentration mu_i. High order
Runge-Kutta time discretization techniques are employed, and different methods
of dealing with arbitrary coupled boundary conditions are discussed. Analysis
of the energy consistency of the scheme is performed in addition to inspection
of the relative error of the solution compared to exact analytic test cases.
Finally several examples, comparisons, generalizations and physical
applications are presented.
