This is the third in a series of papers which give an explicit description of
the reconstruction algebra as a quiver with relations; these algebras arise
naturally as geometric generalizations of preprojective algebras of extended
Dynkin quivers. This paper deals with dihedral groups G=D_{n,q} which have rank
2 special CM modules. We show that such reconstruction algebras are described
by combining a preprojective algebra of extended type D with some
reconstruction algebra of type A.
