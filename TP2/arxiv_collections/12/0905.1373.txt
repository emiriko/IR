The ANTARES (Astronomy with a Neutrino Telescope and Abyss environmental
RESearch) Collaboration constructed and deployed the world's largest
operational underwater neutrino telescope, optimised for the detection of
Cherenkov light produced by neutrino-induced muons. The detector has an
effective area of about 0.1 square km and it is a first step towards a
kilometric scale detector. The detector consists of a three-dimensional array
of 884 photomultiplier tubes, arranged in 12 lines anchored at a depth of 2475
m in the Mediterranean Sea, 40 km offshore from Toulon (France). An additional
instrumented line is used for environmental monitoring and for neutrino
acoustic detection R&D. ANTARES is taking data with its full twelve line
configuration since May 2008 and had been also doing so for more than a year
before a five and ten line setups. First results obtained with the 5 line setup
are presented.
