Effects of electromagnetic interactions of colliding bunches in the Tevatron
had a variety of manifestations in beam dynamics presenting vast opportunities
for development of simulation models and tools. In this paper the computer code
for simulation of weak-strong beam-beam effects in hadron colliders is
described. We report the collider operational experience relevant to beam-beam
interactions, explain major effects limiting the collider performance and
compare results of observations and measurements with simulations.
