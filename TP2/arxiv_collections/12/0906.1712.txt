We showed that if the non-thermal emission from the Galactic center in the
range 14-40 keV is due to inverse bremsstrahlung emission of subrelativistic
protons, their interactions with hot and cold fractions of the interstellar
medium are equally important. Our estimation show that about 30% of the total
non-thermal flux from the GC in the range 14-40 keV is generated in regions of
cold gas while the rest is produced by proton interaction with hot plasma. From
the spatial distribution of 6.7 keV iron line we concluded the spatial
distribution of hot plasma is strongly non-uniform that should be taken into
account in analysis of protons propagation in the GC. From the Suzaku data we
got independent estimates for the diffusion coefficient of subrelativistic
protons in the GC, which was in the range $ 10^{26} - 10^{27}$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$
