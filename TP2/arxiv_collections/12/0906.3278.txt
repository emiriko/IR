We explore the possibility that the dynamics of the universe can be
reproduced choosing appropriately the initial global topology of the Universe.
In this work we start with two concentric spherical three-dimensional branes
S^3, with radius a_1<a_2 immersed in a five-dimensional space-time. The novel
feature of this model is that in the interior brane there exist only spin-zero
fundamental fields (scalar fields), while in the exterior one there exist only
spin-one fundamental interactions. As usual, the bulk of the universe is
dominated by gravitational interactions. In this model, like in the Ekpyrotic
one, the Big Bang is consequence of the collision of the branes and causes the
existence of the particles predicted by the standard model in the exterior
brane (our universe). The scalar fields on the interior brane interact with the
spin-one fields on the exterior one only through gravitation, they induce the
effect of Scalar Field Dark Matter with an ultra-light mass on the exterior
one. We discuss two different regimes where the energy density and the brane
tension are compared, with the aim to obtain the observed dynamics of the
universe after the collision of the branes.
