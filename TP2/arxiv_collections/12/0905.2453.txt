Gravitational lensing calculation using a direct inverse ray-shooting
approach is a computationally expensive way to determine magnification maps,
caustic patterns, and light-curves (e.g. as a function of source profile and
size). However, as an easily parallelisable calculation, gravitational
ray-shooting can be accelerated using programmable graphics processing units
(GPUs). We present our implementation of inverse ray-shooting for the NVIDIA
G80 generation of graphics processors using the NVIDIA Compute Unified Device
Architecture (CUDA) software development kit. We also extend our code to
multiple-GPU systems, including a 4-GPU NVIDIA S1070 Tesla unit. We achieve
sustained processing performance of 182 Gflop/s on a single GPU, and 1.28
Tflop/s using the Tesla unit. We demonstrate that billion-lens microlensing
simulations can be run on a single computer with a Tesla unit in timescales of
order a day without the use of a hierarchical tree code.
