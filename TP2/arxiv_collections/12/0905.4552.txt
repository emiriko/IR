In this paper, linear first order expansion of deceleration parameter
$q(z)=q_0+q_1(1-a)$ ($M_1$), constant jerk $j=j_0$ ($M_2$) and third order
expansion of luminosity distance ($M_3$) are confronted with cosmic
observations: SCP 307 SN Ia, BAO and observational Hubble data (OHD).
Likelihood is implemented to find the best fit model parameters. All these
models give the same prediction of the evolution of the universe which is
undergoing accelerated expansion currently and experiences a transition from
decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion. But, the transition redshift
depends on the concrete parameterized form of the model assumed. $M_1$ and
$M_2$ give value of transition redshift about $z_t\sim 0.6$. $M_3$ gives a
larger one, say $z_t\sim 1$. The $\chi^2/dof$ implies almost the same goodness
of the models. But, for its badness of evolution of deceleration parameter at
high redshift $z>1$, $M_3$ can not be reliable. $M_1$ and $M_2$ are compatible
with $\Lambda$CDM model at the $2\sigma$ and $1\sigma$ confidence levels
respectively. $M_3$ is not compatible with $\Lambda$CDM model at $2\sigma$
confidence level. From $M_1$ and $M_2$ models, one can conclude that the cosmic
data favor a cosmological model having $j_0<-1$.
