Fine pressure ($P$) and magnetic field ($H$) tuning on the ferromagnetic
superconductor URhGe are reported in order to clarify the interplay between the
mass enhancement, low field superconductivity (SC) and field reentrant
superconductivity (RSC) by electrical resistivity measurements. With increasing
$P$, the transition temperature and the upper critical field of the low field
SC decrease slightly, while the RSC dome drastically shifts to higher fields
and shrinks. The spin reorientation field $H_{\rm R}$ also increases. At a
pressure $P\sim 1.8$ GPa, the RSC has collapsed while the low field SC persists
and may disappear only above 4 GPa. Via careful $(P, H)$ studies of the
inelastic $T^2$ resistivity term, it is demonstrated that this drastic change
is directly related with the $P$ dependence of the effective mass which
determines the critical field of the low field SC and RSC on the basis of
triplet SC without Pauli limiting field.
