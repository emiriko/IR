We analyzed the Subaru/Suprime-Cam images of 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3B and
detected no fewer than 154 mini-comets. We applied synchrone-syndyne analysis,
modified for rocket effect analysis, to the mini-fragment spatial distribution.
We found that most of these mini-comets were ejected from fragment B by an
outburst occurring around 1 April 2006. The ratio of the rocket force to solar
gravity was 7 to 23 times larger than that exerted on fragment B. No
significant color variation was found. We examined the surface brightness
profiles of all detected fragments and estimated the sizes of 154 fragments. We
found that the radius of these mini-fragments was in the 5- to 108-m range
(equivalent size of Tunguska impactor). The power-law index of the differential
size distribution was q = -3.34 +/- 0.05. Based on this size distribution, we
found that about 1-10% of the mass of fragment B was lost in the April 2006
outbursts. Modeling the cometary fragment dynamics revealed that it is likely
that mini-fragments smaller than ~10-20 m could be depleted in water ice and
become inactive, implying that decameter-sized comet fragments could survive
against melting and remain as near-Earth objects. We attempted to detect the
dust trail, which was clearly found in infrared wavelengths by Spitzer. No
brightness enhancement brighter than 30.0 mag arcsec^-2 (3sigma) was detected
in the orbit of fragment B.
