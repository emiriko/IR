Using a variational approximation we study discrete solitons of a nonlinear
Schroedinger lattice with a cubic-quintic nonlinearity. Using an ansatz with
six parameters we are able to approximate bifurcations of asymmetric solutions
connecting site-centered and bond-centered solutions and resulting in the
exchange of their stability. We show that the numerically exact and variational
approximations are quite close for solitons of small powers.
