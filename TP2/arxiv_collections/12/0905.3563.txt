In the non-relativistic theory of gravitation recently proposed by Horava,
the Hamiltonian constraint is not a local equation satisfied at each spatial
point but an equation integrated over a whole space. The global Hamiltonian
constraint is less restrictive than its local version, and allows a richer set
of solutions than in general relativity. We show that a component which behaves
like pressureless dust emerges as an "integration constant" of dynamical
equations and momentum constraint equations. Consequently, classical solutions
to the infrared limit of Horava-Lifshitz gravity can mimic general relativity
plus cold dark matter.
