The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory is investigated from a
philosophical point of view. It is justified the opinion that the philosophical
attitude the Copenhagen interpretation is based on is in principle inevitable
for a real comprehension of quantum theory. This attitude is mainly related to
epistemological arguments. However, the measurement problem often seems not to
be treated clearly enough within the interpretation. By referring to the
property of the necessity to use macroscopic measurement instruments obeying
classical concepts it is made the attempt to solve the measurement problem.
According to this consideration the indeterministic character of quantum theory
seems to have its origin in a lack of knowledge and thus it appears in a
similar but more principle way than in statistical mechanics. It is emphasized
the ontological character of the uncertainty relation and the related non
locality of quantum theory suggesting that the existence of a position space is
not as fundamental as the assumptions of general quantum theory.
