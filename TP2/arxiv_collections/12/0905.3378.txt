The emerging Web of Data utilizes the web infrastructure to represent and
interrelate data. The foundational standards of the Web of Data include the
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF).
URIs are used to identify resources and RDF is used to relate resources. While
RDF has been posited as a logic language designed specifically for knowledge
representation and reasoning, it is more generally useful if it can
conveniently support other models of computing. In order to realize the Web of
Data as a general-purpose medium for storing and processing the world's data,
it is necessary to separate RDF from its logic language legacy and frame it
simply as a data model. Moreover, there is significant advantage in seeing the
Semantic Web as a particular interpretation of the Web of Data that is focused
specifically on knowledge representation and reasoning. By doing so, other
interpretations of the Web of Data are exposed that realize RDF in different
capacities and in support of different computing models.
