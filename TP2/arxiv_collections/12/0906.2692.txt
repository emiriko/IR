Twelve turnout rates of French national elections by municipality have shown
statistical regularities, neither depend on the nature of the election, nor on
the national turnout level. Three quantitative predictions about voter turnout
at the French 2009 European election were made in arXiv:0905.4578. Here, we
give the results of these three predictions. Each one is confirmed by real
measures.
