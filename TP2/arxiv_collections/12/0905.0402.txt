In this paper we study the effects of isospin breaking in the dynamical
generation of the X(3872) state. We also calculate the ratio of the branching
fractions of the $X$ decaying into $J/\psi$ with two and three pions, which has
been measured experimentally to be close to unity. Together with the X(3872),
of positive C-parity, we predict the existence of a negative C-parity state and
we comment on which decay channel is more promising to observe this state.
