Quantum and collisional effects on the unstable spectrum of a relativistic
electron beam-plasma system are investigated through a two-fluids model.
Application is made to the near target center interaction of the relativistic
electron beam in the Fast Ignition Scenario. Partial degeneracy effects are
found negligible while the most influential factors are the beam temperature
and the electron-ion collision frequency of the plasma. The introduction of the
latter triggers some oblique unstable modes of much larger wave length than the
collisionless ones. Transition from the collisionless regime to the resistive
one is thus documented and found discontinuous.
