We introduce an adaptive regularization approach. In contrast to conventional
Tikhonov regularization, which specifies a fixed regularization operator, we
estimate it simultaneously with parameters. From a Bayesian perspective we
estimate the prior distribution on parameters assuming that it is close to some
given model distribution. We constrain the prior distribution to be a
Gauss-Markov random field (GMRF), which allows us to solve for the prior
distribution analytically and provides a fast optimization algorithm. We apply
our approach to non-rigid image registration to estimate the spatial
transformation between two images. Our evaluation shows that the adaptive
regularization approach significantly outperforms standard variational methods.
