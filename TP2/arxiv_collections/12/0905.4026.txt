In a well-known paper arXiv:gr-qc/0003100 V.C. de Andrade, L. C. T. Guillen
and J.G. Pereira defined a conserved gauge current, however they stated that:
`` This is, we believe the farthest one can go in the direction of a tensorial
definition for the energy and momentum of the gravitational field. The lack of
local Lorentz covariance can be considered as the teleparallel manifestation of
the pseudotensor character of the gravitational energy-momentum density in
general relativity....''. Well, we believe that they stopped just less than an
inch before giving such a tensorial definition, and furthermore that the
resulting energy-momentum tensor has zero trace and can be made symmetric, and
together with the energy-momentum tensor of material fields it obeys a natural
conservation equation for teleparallel manifolds. Some important consequences
are obtained specially in the last section concerning the possibility of
explaining the acceleration of the universe expansion without any need of a
cosmological constant.
