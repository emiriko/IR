The phenomenon of real-space condensation is encountered in a variety of
situations such as aggregation and fragmentation processes, granular
clustering, phase separation, traffic and networks. Unlike traditional
Bose-Einstein condensation in the momentum space, a condensate in these systems
forms in real space, e.g., upon increasing the density beyond a critical value
a macroscopically large mass/cluster may form at a single site on a lattice. In
this brief review, I discuss some recent developments in understanding the
physical and mathematical mechanism behind this real-space condensation in a
class of simple stochastic mass transport models.
