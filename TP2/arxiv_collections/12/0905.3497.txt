This paper is the fourth in a series devoted to identifying and explaining
the properties of strongly correlating liquids, i.e., liquids where virial and
potential energy correlate better than 90% in their thermal equilibrium
fluctuations in the NVT ensemble. For such liquids we here introduce the
concept of "isomorphic" curves in the state diagram. A number of thermodynamic,
static, and dynamic isomorph invariants are identified. These include the
excess entropy, the isochoric specific heat, reduced-unit static and dynamic
correlation functions, as well as reduced-unit transport coefficients. The
dynamic invariants apply for both Newtonian and Brownian dynamics. It is shown
that after a jump between isomorphic state points the system is instantaneously
in thermal equilibrium; consequences of this for generic aging experiments are
discussed. Selected isomorph predictions are validated by computer simulations
of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture, which is a strongly
correlating liquid. The final section of the paper relates the isomorph concept
to phenomenological melting rules, Rosenfeld's excess entropy scaling, Young
and Andersen's approximate scaling principle, and the two-order parameter maps
of Debenedetti and coworkers. This section also shows how the existence of
isomorphs implies an "isomorph filter" for theories for the non-Arrhenius
temperature dependence of viscous liquids' relaxation time, as well as explains
isochronal superposition for strongly correlating viscous liquids.
