Quantum information theory establishes the ultimate limits on communication
and cryptography in terms of channel capacities for various types of
information. The private capacity is particularly important because it
quantifies achievable rates of quantum key distribution. We study the power of
quantum channels with limited private capacity, focusing on channels that
dephase in random bases. These display extensive nonadditivity of private
capacity: a channel with 2 log d input qubits has a private capacity less than
2, but when used together with a second channel with zero private capacity the
joint capacity jumps to (1/2)log d. In contrast to earlier work which found
nonadditivity vanishing as a fraction of input size or conditional on unproven
mathematical assumptions, this provides a natural setting manifesting
nonadditivity of privacy of the strongest possible sort.
