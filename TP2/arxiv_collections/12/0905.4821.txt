The durations of 388 gamma-ray bursts, detected by the Swift satellite, are
studied statistically in order to search for their subgroups. Then the results
are compared with the results obtained earlier from the BATSE database. The
standard chi^2 test is used. Similarly to the BATSE database, the short and
long subgroups are well detected also in the Swift data. Also the intermediate
subgroup is seen in the Swift database. The whole sample of 388 GRBs gives a
support for three subgroups.
