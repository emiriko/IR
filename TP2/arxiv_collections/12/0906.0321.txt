The direct treatment of the Faddeev equation for the three-boson system in 3
dimensions is generalized to nucleons. The one Faddeev equation for identical
bosons is replaced by a strictly finite set of coupled equations for scalar
functions which depend only on 3 variables. The spin-momentum dependence
occurring as scalar products in 2N and 3N forces accompanied by scalar
functions is supplemented by a corresponding expansion of the Faddeev
amplitudes. After removing the spin degrees of freedom by suitable operations
only scalar expressions depending on momenta remain. The corresponding steps
are performed for the deuteron leading to two coupled equations.
