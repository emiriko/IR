In this paper we argue that when gauge invariance is taken into
consideration, there is no consistent geometric framework of Finsler class that
can accommodate Randers type spaces. In this context, an alternative
non-Finslerian framework for Randers spacetimes compatible with gauge
invariance is introduced.
