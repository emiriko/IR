We show in this paper that the Z(3) flavor symmetry, which can successfully
produce the tri-bimaximal mixing and flavor pattern of neutrino sector, has a
possible explanation in the framework of gauge symmetry by constructing a
wavefunction of flavor state particles with the help of the Wilson loop. In
this implementation of Z(3) flavor symmetry, we suggest that the flavor charge
in weak interaction can be interpreted as a topological charge. Its possible
implications and generalizations to the quark sector are also discussed.
