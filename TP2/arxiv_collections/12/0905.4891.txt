Event shape data from e+e- annihilation into hadrons collected by the JADE
experiment between sqrt(s)=14 and 44 GeV are used to determine the strong
coupling alpha_S. QCD predictionscomplete to next-to-next-to-leading order
(NLLO), alternatively combined with next-to-leading-log-approximation (NLLA)
are used. The stability of the NNLO and NNLO+NLLA results with respect to
variations of the renormalisation scale is improved compared to previous
results obtained with next-to-leading-order (NLO) or NLO+NLLA predictions. The
energy dependence of alpha_S agrees with the QCD prediction of asymptotic
freedom and excludes absence of running with 99% confidence level.
