We consider in a simple and general way elastic waves in isotropic and
anisotropic media, their polarization, speeds, reflection from interfaces with
mode conversion, and surface waves. Reflection of quasi transverse waves in
anisotropic media from a free surface is shown to be characterized by three
critical angles.
