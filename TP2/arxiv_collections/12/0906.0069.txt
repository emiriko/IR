The discoveries of superconductivity in heavily boron-doped diamond, silicon
and silicon carbide renewed the interest in the ground states of charge-carrier
doped wide-gap semiconductors. Recently, aluminium doping in silicon carbide
successfully yielded a metallic phase from which at high aluminium
concentrations superconductivity emerges. Here, we present a specific-heat
study on superconducting aluminium-doped silicon carbide. We observe a clear
jump anomaly at the superconducting transition temperature 1.5 K indicating
that aluminium-doped silicon carbide is a bulk superconductor. An analysis of
the jump anomaly suggests BCS-like phonon-mediated superconductivity in this
system.
