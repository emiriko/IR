We show how to apply Lyapunov control design to the problem of entanglement
creation between two atoms in distant cavities connected by optical fibers. The
Lyapunov control design is optimal in the sense that the distance from the
target state decreases monotonically and exponentially, and the concurrence
increases accordingly. This method is far more robust than simple geometric
schemes.
