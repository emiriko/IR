Cramer's Transactional Interpretation (TI) is applied to the "Quantum Liar
Experiment" (QLE). It is shown how some apparently paradoxical features can be
explained naturally, albeit nonlocally (since TI is an explicitly nonlocal
interpretation, at least from the vantage point of ordinary spacetime). At the
same time, it is proposed that in order to preserve the elegance and economy of
the interpretation, it may be necessary to consider offer and confirmation
waves as propagating in a "higher space" of possibilities.
