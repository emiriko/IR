Polaritons in semiconductor microcavities are hybrid quasiparticles
consisting of a superposition of photons and excitons. Due to the photon
component, polaritons are characterized by a quantum coherence length in the
several micron range. Owing to their exciton content, they display sizeable
interactions, both mutual and with other electronic degrees of freedom. These
unique features have produced striking matter wave phenomena, such as
Bose-Einstein condensation, or parametric processes able to generate quantum
entangled polariton states. Recently, several paradigms for spatial confinement
of polaritons in semiconductor devices have been established. This opens the
way to quantum devices in which polaritons can be used as a vector of quantum
information. An essential element of each quantum device is the quantum state
control. Here we demonstrate control of the wave function of confined
polaritons, by means of tailored resonant optical excitation. By tuning the
energy and momentum of the laser, we achieve precise control of the momentum
pattern of the polariton wave function. A theoretical model supports
unambiguously our observations.
