FeSex (x = 0.80, 0.84, 0.88, 0.92) thin films were prepared on SrTiO3(001)
(STO), (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3(001) (LSAT), and LaAlO3(001) (LAO) substrates by pulsed
laser deposition method. All thin films show single-phase and c-axis oriented
epitaxial growth, and are superconducting. Among them, the FeSe0.88 thin films
show Tc, onset of 11.8 K and Tc, 0 of 3.4 K. The upper critical magnetic field
is estimated to be 14.0 T.
