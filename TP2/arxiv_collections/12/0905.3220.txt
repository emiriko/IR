We propose a novel implementation of spontaneous parity breaking in
supersymmetric left-right symmetric model, avoiding some of the problems
encountered in previous studies. This implementation includes a bitriplet and a
singlet, in addition to the bidoublets which extend the Higgs sector of the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The supersymmetric vacua of this
theory are shown to lead generically to spontaneous violation of parity, while
preserving R parity. The model is shown to reproduce the see-saw relation for
vacuum expectation values, $v_L v_R \approx m_{EW}^2$ relating the new mass
scales $v_L$, $v_R$ to the electroweak scale $m_{EW}$, just as in the
non-supersymmetric version. The scale $v_R$ determines the mass scale of heavy
majorana neutrinos, which gets related to the obeserved neutrino masses through
type II see-saw relation.
