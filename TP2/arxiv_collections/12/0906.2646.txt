Quantum criticality in Yb(Rh0.97Co0.03)2Si2 is investigated by means of
resistivity and magnetoresistance. The partial substitution of Co leads to a
stabilization of the magnetism as expected according to the application of
chemical pressure for Yb systems. However, the signature of the Kondo-breakdown
remains at the same position in the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram
compared to stoichiometric YbRh2Si2. As a consequence, the Kondo-breakdown is
situated within the antiferromagnetic phase. These results fit well within the
global phase diagram under chemical pressure [1].
