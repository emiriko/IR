In this paper we first discuss the analysis regarding the role of Lorentz
symmetry in the perturbative non-gravitational anomalies for a family of
fermions, which has been recently performed in arXiv:0809.0184. The theory is
assumed to be translational invariant, power-counting renormalizable and based
on a local action, but is allowed to have general Lorentz violating operators,
including those that break CPT. The main result is that Lorentz symmetry does
not participate in the clash of symmetries that leads to the anomalies.
Moreover, here we provide a simple "semiclassical" argument that shortly
illustrates the origin of this fact.
