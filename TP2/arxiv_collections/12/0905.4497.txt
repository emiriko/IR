This paper proposes a new way to do event generation and analysis in searches
for new physics at the LHC. An abstract notation is used to describe the new
particles on a level which better corresponds to detector resolution of LHC
experiments. In this way the SUSY discovery space can be decomposed into a
small number of eigenmodes each with only a few parameters, which allows to
investigate the SUSY parameter space in a model-independent way. By focusing on
the experimental observables for each process investigated the Bottom-Up
Approach allows to systematically study the boarders of the experimental
efficiencies and thus to extend the sensitivity for new physics.
