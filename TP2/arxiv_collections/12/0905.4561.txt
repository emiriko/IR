We theoretically examine the spin-transfer torque in the presence of
spin-orbit interaction (SOI) at impurities in a ferromagnetic metal on the
basis of linear response theory. We obtained, in addition to the usual
spin-transfer torque, a new contributioin $\sim {\bm j}_{\rm
SH}^{\phantom{\dagger}} \cdot \nabla {\bm n}$ in the first order in SOI, where
${\bm j}_{\rm SH}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ is the spin Hall current driven by an
external electric field. This is a reaction to inverse spin Hall effect driven
by spin motive force in a ferromagnet.
