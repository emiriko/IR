Observational evidences of nonzero neutrino masses and the existence of dark
matter request physics beyond standard model. A model with extra scalars and
leptonic vector-like fermions is introduced. By imposing a Z_2 symmetry, the
neutrino masses as well as anomalous muon magnetic moment can be generated via
one-loop effects at TeV-scale. An effort of explaining dark matter, Lithium
problem, and leptogenesis is presented. This scenario can be tested at LHC
and/or future experiments.
