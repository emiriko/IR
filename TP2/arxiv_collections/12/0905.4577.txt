Experimental and theoretical progress concerning the rare decay \pi^0 \to
e^+e^- is briefly reviewed. It includes the latest data from KTeV and a new
model independent estimate of the decay branching which show the deviation
between experiment and theory at the level of $3.3\sigma$. The predictions for
\eta and \eta' decays into lepton pair are presented. We also comment on the
impact on the pion rare decay estimate of the BABAR collaboration on the pion
transition form factor at large momentum transfer.
