We show that broadband biphoton wavepackets produced via Spontaneous
Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) in crystals with linearly aperiodic poling
can be easily compressed in time using the effect of group-velocity dispersion
in optical fibres. This result could foster important developments in quantum
metrology and lithography.
