We investigate neutrino oscillations from core-collapse supernovae that
produce magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) explosions. By calculating numerically the
flavor conversion of neutrinos in the highly non-spherical envelope, we study
how the explosion anisotropy has impacts on the emergent neutrino spectra
through the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect. In the case of the inverted
mass hierarchy with a relatively large theta_(13), we show that survival
probabilities of electron type neutrinos and antineutrinos seen from the
rotational axis of the MHD supernovae (i.e., polar direction), can be
significantly different from those along the equatorial direction. The event
numbers of electron type antineutrinos observed from the polar direction are
predicted to show steepest decrease, reflecting the passage of the
magneto-driven shock to the so-called high-resonance regions. Furthermore we
point out that such a shock effect, depending on the original neutrino spectra,
appears also for the low-resonance regions, which leads to a noticeable
decrease in the electron type neutrino signals. This reflects a unique nature
of the magnetic explosion featuring a very early shock-arrival to the resonance
regions, which is in sharp contrast to the neutrino-driven delayed supernova
models. Our results suggest that the two features in the electron type
antineutrinos and neutrinos signals, if visible to the Super-Kamiokande for a
Galactic supernova, could mark an observational signature of the magnetically
driven explosions, presumably linked to the formation of magnetars and/or
long-duration gamma-ray bursts.
