Radio emission has been implemented in the simulation software AIRES by M. A.
DuVernois, B. Cai and D. Kleckner to perform a full Monte Carlo simulation of
the radio emission of cosmic ray extensive air shower. Different sets of
showers have been simulated. We present here the detendency of the radio
electric field with different parameters (primary energy, radial distance,
arrival direction, etc). We stress the effect of the polarization and the
arrival direction, which should have a fundamental effect on the interpretation
of experimental data.
