We propose a generalisation of the Cameron-Erdos conjecture for sum-free sets
to arbitrary non-translation invariant linear equations over Z in three or more
variables and, using well-known methods from graph theory, prove a weak form of
the conjecture for a class of equations where the structure of the maximum-size
sets avoiding solutions to the equation has been previously obtained.
