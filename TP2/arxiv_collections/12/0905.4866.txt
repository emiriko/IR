IGR J18483-0311 was discovered with INTEGRAL in 2003 and later classified as
a supergiant fast X-ray transient. It was observed in outburst many times, but
its quiescent state is still poorly known. Here we present the results of
XMM-Newton, Swift, and Chandra observations of IGRJ18483-0311. These data
improved the X-ray position of the source, and provided new information on the
timing and spectral properties of IGR J18483-0311 in quiescence. We report the
detection of pulsations in the quiescent X-ray emission of this source, and
give for the first time a measurement of the spin-period derivative of this
source. In IGRJ18483-0311 the measured spin-period derivative of
-(1.3+-0.3)x10^(-9) s/s likely results from light travel time effects in the
binary. We compare the most recent observational results of IGRJ18483-0311 and
SAXJ1818.6-1703, the two supergiant fast X-ray transients for which a similar
orbital period has been measured.
