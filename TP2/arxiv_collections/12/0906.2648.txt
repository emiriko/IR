The dominant production process for heavy charged Higgs bosons at the LHC is
the associated production with heavy quarks. We have calculated the
next-to-leading-order supersymmetric QCD corrections to charged-Higgs
production through the parton processes $q\bar{q},gg \to tbH^{\pm}$ and present
results for total cross sections and differential distributions. The QCD
corrections reduce the renormalization and factorization scale dependence and
thus stabilize the theoretical predictions. We present a comparison of the
next-to-leading-order results for the inclusive cross section with a
calculation based on bottom--gluon fusion $gb \to tH^{\pm}$ and discuss the
impact of the next-to-leading-order corrections on charged-Higgs searches at
the LHC.
