Based on the Chetaev theorem on stable dynamical trajectories in the presence
of dissipative forces, we obtain the generalized condition for stability of
Hamilton systems in the form of the Schrodinger equation. It is shown that the
energy of dissipative forces, which generate the Chetaev generalized condition
of stability, coincides exactly with the Bohm "quantum" potential. Within the
framework of Bohmian quantum mechanics supplemented by the generalized Chetaev
theorem and on the basis of the principle of least action for dissipative
forces, we show that the squared amplitude of a wave function in the
Schrodinger equation is equivalent semantically and syntactically to the
probability density function for the number of particle trajectories, relative
to which the velocity and the position of the particle are not hidden
parameters. The conditions for the correctness of the Bohm-Chetaev
interpretation of quantum mechanics are discussed.
