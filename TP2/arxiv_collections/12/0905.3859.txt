In this paper I assess the adequacy of no-conspiracy conditions employed in
the usual derivations of the Bell inequality in the context of EPR
correlations. First, I look at the EPR correlations from a purely
phenomenological point of view and claim that common cause explanations of
these cannot be ruled out. I argue that an appropriate common cause explanation
requires that no-conspiracy conditions are re-interpreted as mere common
cause-measurement independence conditions. In the right circumstances then,
violations of measurement independence need not entail any kind of conspiracy
(nor backwards in time causation). To the contrary, if measurement operations
in the EPR context are taken to be causally relevant in a specific way to the
experiment outcomes, their explicit causal role provides the grounds for a
common cause explanation of the corresponding correlations.
