Recent efforts have applied quantum tomography techniques to the calibration
and characterization of complex quantum detectors using minimal assumptions. In
this work we provide detail and insight concerning the formalism, the
experimental and theoretical challenges and the scope of these tomographical
tools. Our focus is on the detection of photons with avalanche photodiodes and
photon number resolving detectors and our approach is to fully characterize the
quantum operators describing these detectors with a minimal set of well
specified assumptions. The formalism is completely general and can be applied
to a wide range of detectors
