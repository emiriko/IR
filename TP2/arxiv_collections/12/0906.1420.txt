We derive the analytical solutions of the bound timelike geodesic orbits in
Kerr spacetime. The analytical solutions are expressed in terms of the elliptic
integrals using Mino time $\lambda$ as the independent variable. Mino time
decouples the radial and polar motion of a particle and hence leads to forms
more useful to estimate three fundamental frequencies, radial, polar and
azimuthal motion, for the bound timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetime. This
paper gives the first derivation of the analytical expressions of the
fundamental frequencies. This paper also gives the first derivation of the
analytical expressions of all coordinates for the bound timelike geodesics
using Mino time. These analytical expressions should be useful not only to
investigate physical properties of Kerr geodesics but more importantly to
applications related to the estimation of gravitational waves from the extreme
mass ratio inspirals.
