On the basis of the so-called supersymmetric yukawaon model, it is
investigated what form of the superpotential W can lead to the observed charged
lepton mass spectrum. A simple form of W can speculate reasonable values of
K(\mu)=(m_e +m_\mu + m_\tau)/(\sqrt{m_e} + \sqrt{m_\mu} + \sqrt{m_\tau})^2 and
\kappa(\mu)=\sqrt{m_e m_\mu m_\tau}/ (\sqrt{m_e} + \sqrt{m_\mu}+
\sqrt{m_\tau})^3 at an energy scale \mu=\Lambda.
