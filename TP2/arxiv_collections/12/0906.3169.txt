We study correlated two-level quantum dots, coupled in effective 1-channel
fashion to metallic leads; with electron interactions including on-level and
inter-level Coulomb repulsions, as well as the inter-orbital Hund's rule
exchange favoring the spin-1 state in the relevant sector of the free dot. For
arbitrary dot occupancy, the underlying phases, quantum phase transitions
(QPTs), thermodynamics, single-particle dynamics and electronic transport
properties are considered; and direct comparison is made to conductance
experiments on lateral quantum dots. Two distinct phases arise generically, one
characterised by a normal Fermi liquid fixed point (FP), the other by an
underscreened (USC) spin-1 FP. Associated QPTs, which occur in general in a
mixed valent regime of non-integral dot charge, are found to consist of
continuous lines of Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions, separated by first order
level-crossing transitions at high symmetry points. A `Friedel-Luttinger sum
rule' is derived and, together with a deduced generalization of Luttinger's
theorem to the USC phase (a singular Fermi liquid), is used to obtain a general
result for the T=0 zero-bias conductance, expressed solely in terms of the dot
occupancy and applicable to both phases. Relatedly, dynamical signatures of the
QPT show two broad classes of behavior, corresponding to the collapse of either
a Kondo resonance, or antiresonance, as the transition is approached from the
Fermi liquid phase; the latter behavior being apparent in experimental
differential conductance maps. The problem is studied using the numerical
renormalization group method, combined with analytical arguments.
