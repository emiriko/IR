This paper presents a new method to recover the relative pose between two
images, using three points and the vertical direction information. The vertical
direction can be determined in two ways: 1- using direct physical measurement
like IMU (inertial measurement unit), 2- using vertical vanishing point. This
knowledge of the vertical direction solves 2 unknowns among the 3 parameters of
the relative rotation, so that only 3 homologous points are requested to
position a couple of images. Rewriting the coplanarity equations leads to a
simpler solution. The remaining unknowns resolution is performed by an
algebraic method using Grobner bases. The elements necessary to build a
specific algebraic solver are given in this paper, allowing for a real-time
implementation. The results on real and synthetic data show the efficiency of
this method.
