ANTARES is a neutrino telescope under the Mediterranean Sea, in a site 40 km
off the French coast at a depth of 2475 m. It is an array of 12 lines equipped
with 884 photomultipliers. The detection mechanism relies on the observation of
the Cherenkov light emitted by charged leptons produced by neutrinos
interacting in the water and ground surrounding the detector. First studies of
the detector performances and preliminary results on reconstruction of
atmospheric muons and neutrinos are presented, with the expected sensitivity
for a diffuse flux of high energy neutrinos.
