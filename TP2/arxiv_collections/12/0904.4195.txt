Geometries with horizons offer insights into relationships between general
relativity and quantum physics. Quantum mechanics constrains relationships
between kinematic parameters and the coordinates describing the dynamics.
Example quantum behaviors on space-times with dynamic horizons will be
demonstrated, with an emphasis on examining co-gravitating quantum systems.
Finally, the large scale causal structure of a multi-fluid cosmology that can
describe dynamic coherent aspects of the universe as a whole will be presented.
