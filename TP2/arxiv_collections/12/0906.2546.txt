Recently a set of functional equations defining the anomalous dimensions of
arbitrary local single trace operators in planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory has been conjectured. These functional equations take the form of a
Y-system defined on a special shaped domain. This Y-system can be equivalently
reformulated as a T-system defined on a "T-shaped fat hook". The elements of
the T-system satisfy discrete Hirota equations. In the present paper the
discrete Hirota equations for AdS/CFT are solved by means of a chain of
Backlund transformations and as a result TT-, TQ-, and QQ-relations are
obtained for AdS/CFT.
