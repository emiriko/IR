We have fabricated the Fe(Se, Te) superconducting wire by a special process
based on a powder-in-tube method. The pure Fe tube plays the role of not only
the sheath but also the raw material for synthesizing the superconducting
phases. We succeeded in observing zero resistivity current on the
current-voltage measurements for the Fe(Se, Te) wire. Introduction of the
pinning centers and fabricating a multi-core wire will enhance the critical
current density for the next step.
