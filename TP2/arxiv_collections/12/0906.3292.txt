Near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy is obtained for a heterogeneous
sample of nearby white dwarfs with possible excess flux as identified primarily
in the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Among the sample of 43 stars are a number of
white dwarfs that are either metal-rich, magnetic, or binary suspects. With a
few notable exceptions in four (or possibly five) distinct categories, the
newly obtained JHK photometric data fail to corroborate the putative excesses,
with K_IRTF - K_2MASS = +0.31 mag. Where available, GALEX photometric data are
used to better constrain the overall spectral energy distribution of the white
dwarfs, enabling any excess near-infrared flux to stand out more readily
against the expected stellar photosphere.
  With superior data, a near-infrared photometric excess is confirmed at three
metal-rich white dwarfs and ruled out at nine others. Several new binaries are
confirmed or suggested; five white dwarf - red dwarf pairs and five double
degenerates. Four apparently single magnetic white dwarfs -- two DA and two DQp
-- display modest to strong near-infrared excess (relative to non-magnetic
models), which may be better described as two effective temperatures owing to a
redistribution of energy in highly magnetic or peculiar atmospheres.
