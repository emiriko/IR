We present a detailed comparison between simulations and seeing-free
observations that takes into account the crucial influence of instrumental
image degradation. We use images of quiet Sun granulation taken in the blue,
green and red continuum bands of the Broadband Filter Imager of the Solar
Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard Hinode. The images are deconvolved with Point
Spread Functions (PSF) that account for non-ideal contributions due to
instrumental stray-light and imperfections. In addition, synthetic intensity
images are degraded with the corresponding PSFs. ... Removing the influence of
the PSF unveils much broader intensity distributions with a secondary component
that is otherwise only visible as an asymmetry between the darker and brighter
than average part of the distribution. The contrast values increase to (26.7
+/- 1.3) %, (19.4 +/- 1.4) %, and (16.6 +/- 0.7) % for blue, green, and red
continuum, respectively. The power spectral density of the images exhibits a
pronounced peak at spatial scales characteristic for the granulation pattern
and a steep decrease towards smaller scales. The observational findings like
the absolute values and centre-to-limb variation of the intensity contrast,
intensity histograms, and power spectral density are well matched with
corresponding synthetic observables from three-dimensional radiation
(magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations. We conclude that the intensity contrast of
the solar continuum intensity is higher than usually derived from ground-based
observations and is well reproduced by modern radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic
models. Properly accounting for image degradation effects is of crucial
importance for comparisons between observations and numerical models.
