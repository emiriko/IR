The Calabi-Yau property of cocommutative Hopf algebras is discussed by using
the homological integral, a recently introduced tool for studying infinite
dimensional AS-Gorenstein Hopf algebras. It is shown that the skew-group
algebra of a universal enveloping algebra of a finite dimensional Lie algebra
$\g$ with a finite subgroup $G$ of automorphisms of $\g$ is Calabi-Yau if and
only if the universal enveloping algebra itself is Calabi-Yau and $G$ is a
subgroup of the special linear group $SL(\g)$. The Noetherian cocommutative
Calabi-Yau Hopf algebras of dimension not larger than 3 are described. The
Calabi-Yau property of Sridharan enveloping algebras of finite dimensional Lie
algebras is also discussed. We obtain some equivalent conditions for a
Sridharan enveloping algebra to be Calabi-Yau, and then partly answer a
question proposed by Berger. We list all the nonisomorphic 3-dimensional
Calabi-Yau Sridharan enveloping algebras.
