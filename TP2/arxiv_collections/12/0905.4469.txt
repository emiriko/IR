We introduce a previously unknown spin-related transport phenomenon,
consisting in a transformation (swapping) of spin currents, in which the spin
direction and the direction of flow are interchanged. Swapping is due to the
spin-orbit interaction in scattering. It originates from the correlation
between the spin rotation and the scattering angle. This effect is more robust
than the skew scattering, since it exists already in the first Born
approximation. Swapping may lead to the spin accumulation with spin
polarization perpendicular to the surface, unlike what happens in the spin Hall
effect.
