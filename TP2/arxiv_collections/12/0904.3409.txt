Detection of a gamma-ray source above 300 GeV is reported, confirming the
unidentified source MGRO J1908+06, discovered by the Milagro collaboration at a
median energy of 20 TeV. The source was observed during 27 h as part of the
extension of the H.E.S.S. Galactic plane survey to longitudes >30degr. HESS
J1908+063 is detected at a significance level of 10.9 s with an integral flux
above 1 TeV of (3.76+-0.29stat+-0.75sys)x10^-12 ph cm^-2 s^-1, and a spectral
photon index Gamma = 2.10+-0.07stat+-0.2sys. The positions and fluxes of HESS
1908+063 and MGRO J1908+06 are in good agreement. Possible counterparts at
other wavelengths and the origin of the gamma-ray emission are discussed. The
nearby unidentified GeV source, GRO J1908+0556 (GeV) which also remains
unidentified and the new Fermi pulsar 0FGL J1907.5+0617, may be connected to
the TeV source.
