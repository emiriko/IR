We present modeling research work of the winds and circumstellar environments
of prototypical hot and cool massive stars using advanced radiative transfer
(RT) calculations. This research aims at unraveling the detailed physics of
various mass-loss mechanisms of luminous stars in the upper H-R diagram. Very
recent 3-D RT calculations, combined with hydrodynamic simulations, show that
radiatively-driven winds of OB supergiants are structured due to large-scale
density- and velocity-fields caused by rotating bright spots. The mass-loss
rates computed from matching DACs in HD 64760 (B Ib) do not reveal appreciable
changes from the rates of smooth wind models. Intermediate yellow supergiants
(such as Rho Cas, F-G Ia0), on the other hand, show prominent spectroscopic
signatures of strongly increased mass-loss rates during episodic outbursts.
Long-term spectroscopic monitoring of hypergiants near the Yellow Evolutionary
Void reveals that their mass-loss rates and wind-structure are dominated by
photospheric eruptions and large-amplitude pulsations that impart mechanical
momentum to the circumstellar environment by propagating shock waves. In
massive red supergiants, however, clear evidence for mechanical wave
propagation from the sub-photospheric convection zones is lacking. Recent
spatially resolved HST-STIS observations inside Betelgeuse's (M Iab) very
extended chromosphere and dust envelope show evidence of warm chromospheric gas
far beyond the dust condensation radius of RT models. Models for these
long-term spectroscopic observations demonstrate that the chromospheric
pulsations are not spherically symmetric. The STIS observations point to the
importance of mechanical wave propagation for heating and sustaining
chromospheric conditions in the extended winds of red supergiants.
