We present new constraints on cosmic variations of Newton's gravitational
constant by making use of the latest CMB data from WMAP, BOOMERANG, CBI and
ACBAR experiments and independent constraints coming from Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis. We found that current CMB data provide constraints at the 10%
level, that can be improved to 3% by including BBN data. We show that future
data expected from the Planck satellite could constrain G at the 1.5% level
while an ultimate, cosmic variance limited, CMB experiment could reach a
precision of about 0.4%, competitive with current laboratory measurements.
