We study attractive fermions in an optical lattice superimposed by a trapping
potential, such that fermions may form bosonic molecules. We map the model onto
nonlinear field equations depending on the Nambu-Gor'kov propagator. The
resulting field equations where solved numerically by a relaxation technique
that allowed us to calculate the inhomogeneous densities of fermions and
condensed molecules at zero temperature. When the interactions between fermions
are strong there is a competition between unbound fermions and bound molecules
leading to an unexpected reduction of the non-homogeneous density of fermions
at the center of the trap.
