The normal-state charge transport is studied systematically in high-quality
single crystals of BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ ($0 \leq x \leq 0.71$). By
substituting isovalent P for As, the spin-density-wave (SDW) state is
suppressed and the dome-shaped superconducting phase ($T_c \lesssim 31$ K)
appears. Near the SDW end point ($x\approx0.3$), we observe striking linear
temperature ($T$) dependence of resistivity in a wide $T$-range, and remarkable
low-$T$ enhancement of Hall coefficient magnitude from the carrier number
estimates. We also find that the magnetoresistance apparently violates the
Kohler's rule and is well scaled by the Hall angle $\Theta_H$ as
$\Delta\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xx} \propto \tan^2\Theta_H$. These non-Fermi liquid
transport anomalies cannot be attributed to the simple multiband effects. These
results capture universal features of correlated electron systems in the
presence of strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations.
