We extend the classical Landau theory for rotating nuclei and show that the
backbending in 162Yb, that comes about as a result of the two-quasiparticle
alignment, is identified with the second order phase transition. We found that
the backbending in 156Dy, caused by the instability of $\gamma$-vibrations in
the rotating frame, corresponds to the first order phase transition.
