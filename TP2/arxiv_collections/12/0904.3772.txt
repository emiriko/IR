For any number field K, it is unknown which finite groups appear as Galois
groups of extensions L/K such that L is a maximal subfield of a division
algebra with center K (a K-division algebra). For K=Q, the answer is described
by the long standing Q-admissibility conjecture.
  We extend a theorem of Neukirch on embedding problems with local constraints
in order to determine for every number field K, what finite solvable groups G
appear as Galois groups of tame maximal subfields of K-division algebras,
generalizing Liedahl's theorem for metacyclic G and Sonn's solution of the
Q-admissibility conjecture for solvable groups.
