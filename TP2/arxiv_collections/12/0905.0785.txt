A light scalar WIMP is studied in view of the recent results of the DAMA
collaboration. In a scenario where both the WIMP's annihilation and its elastic
scattering on nuclei occur dominantly through Higgs exchange, a one-to-one
relation between the WIMP's relic density and its spin-independent direct
detection rate is established. The ratio of the relevant cross sections depends
only on the dark matter mass if the range allowed by the DAMA results (m < 10
GeV) is considered. We show that if such a light scalar WIMP possesses a direct
detection rate compatible with DAMA, it naturally obtains a relic abundance in
agreement with WMAP. Indirect detection both with gammas from the Galactic
centre and neutrinos from the Sun opens possibilities to test this light dark
matter scenario.
