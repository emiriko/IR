Differential cross sections and photon-beam asymmetries for the gamma p -> K+
Lambda(1520) reaction have been measured with linearly polarized photon beams
at energies from the threshold to 2.4 GeV at 0.6<cos(theta)<1. A new bump
structure was found at W=2.11 GeV in the cross sections. The bump is not well
reproduced by theoretical calculations introducing a nucleon resonance with
J<=3/2. This result suggests that the bump might be produced by a nucleon
resonance possibly with J>=5/2 or by a new reaction process, for example an
interference effect with the phi photoproduction having a similar bump
structure in the cross sections.
