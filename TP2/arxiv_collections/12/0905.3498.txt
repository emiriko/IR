Laser beams can be made to form bright and dark intensity helices of light.
Such helices have a pitch length on the order of a wavelength and may have
applications in lithography and the manipulation of particles through optical
forces. The formation of bright helices is more strongly constrained by optical
resolution limits than that of dark helices, corresponding scaling laws are
derived and their relevance for photo-lithography pointed out. It is shown how
to arrange dark helices on a grid in massively parallel fashion in order to
create handed materials using photo-lithographic techniques.
