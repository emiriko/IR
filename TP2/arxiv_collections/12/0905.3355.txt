By means of QCD simulations on the lattice, we compute the coupling of the
heavy-light mesons to a soft pion in the static heavy quark limit. The gauge
field configurations used in this calculations include the effect of N_f=2
dynamical Wilson quarks, while for the static quark propagator we use its
improved form (so called HYP). On the basis of our results we obtain that the
coupling g=0.44 +/- 0.03 (+0.07/-0.00), where the second error is flat (not
gaussian).
