It is argued that a dedicated effort to increase the reflectivity of the
surface of our planet by means of, for example, metallic plates would induce an
increase in the global albedo which would counteract in part the present
global-warming process of the Earth. This could alleviate the urgency of
reducing the CO2 emissions. The City of Zaragoza (Spain) is chosen to
illustrate the likelihood of our arguments.
