Reuse-based software development provides an opportunity for better quality
and increased productivity in the software products. One of the most critical
aspects of the quality of a software system is its performance. The systematic
application of software performance engineering techniques throughout the
development process can help to identify design alternatives that preserve
desirable qualities such as extensibility and reusability while meeting
performance objectives. In the present scenario, most of the performance
failures are due to a lack of consideration of performance issues early in the
development process, especially in the design phase. These performance failures
results in damaged customer relations, lost productivity for users, cost
overruns due to tuning or redesign, and missed market windows. In this paper,
we propose UML based Performance Models for design assessment in a reuse based
software development scenario.
