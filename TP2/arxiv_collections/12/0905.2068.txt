The dynamics of the acceleration of ultrathin foil targets by the radiation
pressure of superintense, circularly polarized laser pulses is investigated by
analytical modeling and particle-in-cell simulations. By addressing
self-induced transparency and charge separation effects, it is shown that for
"optimal" values of the foil thickness only a thin layer at the rear side is
accelerated by radiation pressure. The simple "Light Sail" model gives a good
estimate of the energy per nucleon, but overestimates the conversion efficiency
of laser energy into monoenergetic ions.
