In this talk, we report on a recent next-to-leading order QCD calculation of
the production of a W boson in association with three jets at hadron colliders.
The computation is performed by combining two programs, BlackHat for the
computation of the virtual one-loop matrix elements and Sherpa for the real
emission part.
