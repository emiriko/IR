(abridged) Although discovered 40 years ago, the emission mechanism
responsible for the observed pulsar radiation remains unclear. However, the
high-energy pulsed emission is usually explained in the framework of either the
polar cap or the outer gap model. The purpose of this work is to study the
pulsed component, that is the light-curves as well as the spectra of the
high-energy emission, above 10 MeV, emanating from the striped wind model.
Gamma rays are produced by scattering off the soft cosmic microwave background
photons on the ultrarelativistic leptons flowing in the current sheets. We
compute the time-dependent inverse Compton emissivity of the wind, in the
Thomson regime, by performing three-dimensional numerical integration in space
over the whole striped wind. The phase-dependent spectral variability is then
calculated as well as the change in pulse shape when going from the lowest to
the highest energies. Several light curves and spectra of inverse Compton
radiation with phase resolved dependence are presented. We apply our model to
the well-known gamma-ray pulsar Geminga. We are able to fit the EGRET spectra
between 10 MeV and 10 GeV as well as the light curve above 100 MeV with good
accuracy.
