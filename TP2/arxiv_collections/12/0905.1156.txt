In this paper, macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) effect of Z2 topological
order in the Wen-Plaquette model is studied. This kind of MQT is characterized
by quantum tunneling processes of different virtual quasi-particles moving
around a torus. By a high-order degenerate perturbation approach, the effective
pseudo-spin models of the degenerate ground states are obtained. From these
models, we get the energy splitting of the ground states, of which the results
are consistent with those from exact diagonalization method
