We present the results of a search for Higgs bosons predicted in
two-Higgs-doublet models, in the case where the Higgs bosons decay to tau
lepton pairs, using 1.8 inverse fb of integrated luminosity of
proton-antiproton collisions recorded by the CDF II experiment at the Fermilab
Tevatron. Studying the observed mass distribution in events where one or both
tau leptons decay leptonically, no evidence for a Higgs boson signal is
observed. The result is used to infer exclusion limits in the two-dimensional
parameter space of tan beta versus m(A).
