We introduce a gauge-theoretic integer lift of the Rohlin invariant of a
smooth 4-manifold X with the homology of $S^1 \times S^3$. The invariant has
two terms; one is a count of solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations on X,
and the other is essentially the index of the Dirac operator on a non-compact
manifold with end modeled on the infinite cyclic cover of X. Each term is
metric (and perturbation) dependent, and we show that these dependencies cancel
as the metric and perturbation vary in a 1-parameter family.
