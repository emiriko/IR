Using two extremely different models of glass formers in two and three
dimensions we demonstrate how to encode the subtle changes in the geometric
rearrangement of particles during the scenario of the glass transition. We
construct a statistical mechanical description that is able to explain and
predict the geometric rearrangement, the temperature dependent thermodynamic
functions and the $\alpha$-relaxation time within the measured temperature
range and beyond. The theory is based on an up-scaling to proper variables
(quasi-species) which is validated using a simple criterion. Once constructed,
the theory provides an accurate predictive tool for quantities like the
specific heat or the entropy at temperatures that cannot be reached by
measurements. In addition, the theory identifies a rapidly increasing typical
length scale $\xi$ as the temperature decreases. This growing spatial length
scale determines the $\alpha$-relaxation time as $\tau_\alpha \sim
\exp(\mu\xi/T)$ where $\mu$ is a typical chemical potential per unit length.
