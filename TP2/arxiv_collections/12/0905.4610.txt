This paper synthesizes the actions performed in order to transform a classic
scientific research journal - 'Annals. Computer Science Series' - available
only in printed form until 2008, into a modern e-journal with free access to
the full text of the articles. For achieving this goal, the research papers
have been included in various article databases, portals and library catalogs
which offered a high visibility to the journal.
