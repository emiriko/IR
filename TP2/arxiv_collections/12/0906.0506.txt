Quantum teleportation of a n-qubit state performed using as entangled
resource a general bipartite state of 2n qubits instead of n Bell states is
equivalent to a correlated Pauli channel. This provides a new characterization
of such channels in terms of many-body correlation functions of the teleporting
media. Our model is then generalized to the Continuous Variable case. We show
that this new representation provides a relatively simple method for
determining whether a correlated quantum channel is able to reliably convey
quantum messages by studying the entanglement properties of the teleportation
mediating system.
