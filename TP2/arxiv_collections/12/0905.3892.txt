In this short note, we are going to classify the cosmological evolutions in
the recently proposed, nonrelativistic gravitational theory, the
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) theory. We consider the original HL theory (theory I),
and the modified version obtained by an analytic continuation of parameters
(theory II). We discuss the possiblilities of cosmological evolutions with
arbitrary matter.
