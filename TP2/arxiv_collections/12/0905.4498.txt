We study small oscillations of the order parameter in weakly and strongly
paired superconductors driven slightly out of equilibrium, in the collisionless
approximation. While it was known for quite some time that the amplitude of the
oscillations in a weakly paired superconductor decays as 1/t^(1/2), we show
that in a superconductor sufficiently strongly paired so that its fermions form
bound states usually referred to as molecules, these oscillations decay as
1/t^(3/2). The transition between these two regimes happens when the chemical
potential of the superconductor vanishes, thus the behavior of the oscillations
can be used to distinguish weakly and strongly paired superconductors. These
results are obtained in the mean field approximation which may not be reliable
in the crossover region between the strong and weak pairing, so we also obtain
identical results within the two-channel model, which can be tuned to be
reliable throughout the entire crossover, although it then describes a special
type of interactions between the fermions which may be difficult to observe
experimentally. Finally, we interpret the result in the strongly paired
superconductor as the probability of the molecular decay as a function of time.
