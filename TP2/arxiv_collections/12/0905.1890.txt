Motivated by recent work on Hom-Lie algebras and the Hom-Yang-Baxter
equation, we introduce a twisted generalization of the classical Yang-Baxter
equation (CYBE), called the classical Hom-Yang-Baxter equation (CHYBE). We show
how an arbitrary solution of the CYBE induces multiple infinite families of
solutions of the CHYBE. We also introduce the closely related structure of
Hom-Lie bialgebras, which generalize Drinfel'd's Lie bialgebras. In particular,
we study the questions of duality and cobracket perturbation and the
sub-classes of coboundary and quasi-triangular Hom-Lie bialgebras.
