Using molecular dynamics simulations we study the slow dynamics of a hard
sphere fluid confined in a disordered porous matrix. The presence of both
discontinuous and continuous glass transitions as well as the complex interplay
between single-particle and collective dynamics are well captured by a recent
extension of mode-coupling theory for fluids in porous media. The degree of
universality of the mode-coupling theory predictions for related models of
colloids is studied by introducing size-disparity between fluid and matrix
particles, as well as softness in the interactions.
