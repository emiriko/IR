The evolution of the ground-state shape along the triaxial landscape of
several isotopes of Yb, Hf, W, Os, and Pt is analyzed using the self-consistent
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. Two well reputed interactions (Gogny D1S
and Skyrme SLy4) have been used in the study in order to asses to which extent
the results are independent of the details of the effective interaction. A
large number of even-even nuclei, with neutron numbers from N=110 up to N=122
has been considered, covering in this way a vast extension of the nuclear
landscape where signatures of oblate-prolate shape transitions have already
manifested both theoretically and experimentally.
