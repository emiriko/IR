The paper considers the nonlinear electrodynamics type model and its relation
with relativistic hydrodynamics with no dissipation (including string and
membrane hydrodynamics). We are able to convert arbitrary flux of fluid to the
family of geodesics by the conformal transformation of metric. The conditions
of transformation of nonlinear electrodynamics solution to linear
electrodynamics solution by changing of metric are presented.
