Relative abundances of the five stable isotopes of titanium (^46Ti to ^50Ti)
are measured for 11 M dwarfs belonging to the thin disk (four stars), thick
disk (three stars), the halo (one star), and either the thick or the thin disk
(three stars). Over the metallicity range of the sample (-1<[Fe/H]<0), the
isotopic ratios are approximately constant to the solar system ratios. There is
no discernible difference between the isotopic ratios for thin and thick disk
stars. Isotopic ratios are in fair accord with recent calculations of Galactic
chemical evolution despite the fact that such calculations underpredict [Ti/Fe]
by about 0.4 dex at all metallicities.
