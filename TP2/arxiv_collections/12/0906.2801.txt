We introduce quantum spin models whose ground states allow for sizeable
entanglement between distant spins. We discuss how spin models with global
end-to-end entanglement realize quantum teleportation channels with optimal
compromise between scalability and resilience to thermal decoherence, and can
be implemented straightforwardly in suitably engineered arrays of coupled
optical cavities.
