Recent experiments provide evidence of intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) in
the lattice dynamics of conventional 3D materials. Here evidence that ILMs in
uranium metal enhance the thermal conductivity is presented along with
speculation on how thermal transport by ILMs might be used to improve a
reported design for a solid-state thermal rectifier.
