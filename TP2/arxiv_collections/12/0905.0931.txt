We consider the effective dynamics obtained by double-passing a far-detuned
laser probe through a large atomic spin system. The net result of the
atom-field interaction is a type of coherent positive feedback that amplifies
the values of selected spin observables. An effective equation of motion for
the atomic system is presented, and an approximate 2-parameter model of the
dynamics is developed that should provide a viable approach to modeling even
the extremely large spin systems, with N>>1 atoms, encountered under typical
laboratory conditions.
  Combining the nonlinear dynamics that result from the positive feedback with
continuous observation of the atomic spin offers an improvement in quantum
parameter estimation. We explore the possibility of reaching the Heisenberg
uncertainty scaling in atomic magnetometry without the need for any appreciable
spin-squeezing by analyzing our system via the quantum Cramer-Rao inequality.
Finally, we develop a realistic quantum parameter estimator for atomic
magnetometry that is based on a two-parameter family of Gaussian states and
investigate the performance of this estimator through numerical simulations. In
doing so, we identify several issues, such as numerical convergence and the
reduction of estimator bias, that must be addressed when incorporating our
parameter estimation methods into an actual laboratory setting.
