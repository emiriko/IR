The behaviour produced by an instruction sequence under execution is a
behaviour to be controlled by some execution environment: each step performed
actuates the processing of an instruction by the execution environment and a
reply returned at completion of the processing determines how the behaviour
proceeds. In this paper, we are concerned with the case where the processing
takes place remotely. We describe a protocol to deal with the case where the
behaviour produced by an instruction sequence under execution leads to the
generation of a stream of instructions to be processed and a remote execution
unit handles the processing of that stream of instructions.
