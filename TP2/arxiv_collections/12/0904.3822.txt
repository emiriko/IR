Patterns of shape-phase transition in the proton-neutron coupled systems are
studied within the $SD$-pair shell model. The results show that some
transitional patterns in the $SD$-pair shell model are similar to the
$U(5)-SU(3)$, $U(5)-SO(6)$ transitions with signatures of the critical point
symmetry of the interacting boson model.
