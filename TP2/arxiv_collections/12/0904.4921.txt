In this paper I argue that infinities in the classical computation theory
such as the unsolvability of the Halting Problem can be addressed in the same
way as Feynman divergences in Quantum Field Theory, and that meaningful
versions of renormalization in this context can be devised. Connections with
quantum computation are also touched upon.
