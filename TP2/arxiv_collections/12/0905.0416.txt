A study of donor electron spins and spin--dependent electronic transitions
involving phosphorous ($^{31}$P) atoms in proximity of the (111) oriented
crystalline silicon (c-Si) to silicon dioxide (SiO$_{2}$) interface is
presented for [$^{31}$P] = 10$^{15}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and [$^{31}$P] =
10$^{16}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ at about liquid $^4$He temperatures ($T = 5$
$\mathrm{K} - 15$ $\mathrm{K}$). Using pulsed electrically detected magnetic
resonance (pEDMR), spin--dependent transitions between the \Phos donor state
and two distinguishable interface states are observed, namely (i) \Pb centers
which can be identified by their characteristic anisotropy and (ii) a more
isotropic center which is attributed to E$^\prime$ defects of the \sio bulk
close to the interface. Correlation measurements of the dynamics of
spin--dependent recombination confirm that previously proposed transitions
between \Phos and the interface defects take place. The influence of these
electronic near--interface transitions on the \Phos donor spin coherence time
$T_2$ as well as the donor spin--lattice relaxation time $T_1$ is then
investigated by comparison of spin Hahn--echo decay measurements obtained from
conventional bulk sensitive pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance and surface
sensitive pEDMR, as well as surface sensitive electrically detected inversion
recovery experiments. The measurements reveal that both $T_2$ and $T_1$ of
\Phos donor electrons spins in proximity of energetically lower interface
states at $T\leq 13$ K are reduced by several orders of magnitude.
