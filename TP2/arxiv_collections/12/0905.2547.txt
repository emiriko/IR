Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) are plots that compare the magnitudes
(luminosities) of stars in different wavelengths of light (colors). High
nonlinear correlations among the mass, color, and surface temperature of newly
formed stars induce a long narrow curved point cloud in a CMD known as the main
sequence. Aging stars form new CMD groups of red giants and white dwarfs. The
physical processes that govern this evolution can be described with
mathematical models and explored using complex computer models. These
calculations are designed to predict the plotted magnitudes as a function of
parameters of scientific interest, such as stellar age, mass, and metallicity.
Here, we describe how we use the computer models as a component of a complex
likelihood function in a Bayesian analysis that requires sophisticated
computing, corrects for contamination of the data by field stars, accounts for
complications caused by unresolved binary-star systems, and aims to compare
competing physics-based computer models of stellar evolution.
