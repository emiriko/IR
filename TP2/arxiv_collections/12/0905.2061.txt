We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of small, strongly correlated clusters,
described by a Hubbard Hamiltonian, by propagating in time the Kadanoff-Baym
equations within the Hartree-Fock, 2nd Born, GW and T-matrix approximations. We
compare the results to exact numerical solutions. We find that the T-matrix is
overall superior to the other approximations, and is in good agreement with the
exact results in the low-density regime. In the long time limit, the many-body
approximations attain an unphysical steady state which we attribute to the
implicit inclusion of infinite order diagrams in a few-body system.
