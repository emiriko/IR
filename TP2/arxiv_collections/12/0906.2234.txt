Recent advances in genomics have underscored the surprising ubiquity of DNA
copy number variation (CNV). Fortunately, modern genotyping platforms also
detect CNVs with fairly high reliability. Hidden Markov models and algorithms
have played a dominant role in the interpretation of CNV data. Here we explore
CNV reconstruction via estimation with a fused-lasso penalty as suggested by
Tibshirani and Wang [Biostatistics 9 (2008) 18--29]. We mount a fresh attack on
this difficult optimization problem by the following: (a) changing the penalty
terms slightly by substituting a smooth approximation to the absolute value
function, (b) designing and implementing a new MM (majorization--minimization)
algorithm, and (c) applying a fast version of Newton's method to jointly update
all model parameters. Together these changes enable us to minimize the
fused-lasso criterion in a highly effective way. We also reframe the
reconstruction problem in terms of imputation via discrete optimization. This
approach is easier and more accurate than parameter estimation because it
relies on the fact that only a handful of possible copy number states exist at
each SNP. The dynamic programming framework has the added bonus of exploiting
information that the current fused-lasso approach ignores. The accuracy of our
imputations is comparable to that of hidden Markov models at a substantially
lower computational cost.
