An investigation of the P/T phase diagram of the quarter-filled organic
conductors, [EDT-TTF-CONMe2]2X, is reported on the basis of transport and NMR
studies of two members, X=AsF6 and Br of the family. The strongly insulating
character of these materials in the low pressure regime has been attributed to
a remarkably stable charge ordered state confirmed by 13C NMR and the only
existence of 1/4 Umklapp e-e scattering favoring a charge ordering instead of
the 1D Mott localization seen in (TM)2X which are quarter-filled compounds with
dimerization. A non magnetic insulating phase instead of the spin density wave
state is stabilized in the deconfined regime of the phase diagram. This
sequence of phases observed under pressure may be considered as a generic
behavior for 1/4-filled conductors with correlations.
