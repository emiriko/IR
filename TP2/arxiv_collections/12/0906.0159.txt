At the charge neutral point, graphene exhibits a very unusual high resistance
metallic state and a transition to a complete insulating phase in a strong
magnetic field. We propose that the current carriers in this state are the
charged vortices of the XY valley pseudospin order-parameter, a situation which
is dual to a conventional thin superconducting film. We study energetics and
the stability of this phase in the presence of disorder.
