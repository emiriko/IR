The philosophy on production of exotic hadrons (multi-quark states) in the
framework of quark combination model is investigated, taking $f_0(980)$ as an
example. The production rate and $p_T$ spectra of $f_0(980)$ considered as
$(s\bar s)$ or $(s\bar q\bar s q)$ respectively, are calculated and compared in
Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200GeV$. The unitarity of various
combination models, when open for exotic hadron production, is addressed.
