We show that the configurational probability distribution of a classical gas
always belongs to the q-exponential family. Hence, the configurational
subsystem is non-extensive in the sense of Tsallis. One of the consequences of
this observation is that the thermodynamics of the configurational subsystem is
uniquely determined up to a scaling function. As an example we consider a
system of non-interacting harmonic oscillators. In this example, the scaling
function can be determined from the requirement that in the limit of large
systems the microcanonical temperature of the configurational subsystem should
coincide with that of the canonical ensemble. The result suggests that Renyi's
entropy function is the relevant one rather than that of Tsallis.
