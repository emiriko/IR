Some deviations from special relativity--especially isotropic effects--are
most efficiently constrained using particles with velocities very close to 1.
While there are extremely tight bounds on some of the relevant parameters
coming from astrophysical observations, many of these rely on our having an
accurate understanding of the dynamics of high-energy sources. It is desirable
to have reliable laboratory constraints on these same parameters. The
fastest-moving particles in a laboratory were electrons and positrons at LEP.
The energetics of the LEP beams were extremely well understood, and
measurements of the synchrotron emission rate indicate that that any isotropic
deviation of the speed of light from 1 must be smaller than 5 x 10^(-15).
