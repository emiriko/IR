We find explicit AdS4 solutions of massive type IIA with N=2 supersymmetry
obtained deforming with a Roman mass the type IIA supersymmetric reduction of
the M theory background AdS4 times M111. The family of solutions have SU(3)
times SU(3) structure and isometry SU(3) times U(1)^2. They are conjectured to
be dual to three-dimensional N=2 Chern-Simons theories with generic
Chern-Simons couplings and gauge group ranks.
