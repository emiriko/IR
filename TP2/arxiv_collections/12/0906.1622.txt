We develop a concept of entanglement percolation for long-distance singlet
generation in quantum networks with neighboring nodes connected by partially
entangled bipartite mixed states. We give a necessary and sufficient condition
on the class of mixed network states for the generation of singlets. States
beyond this class are insufficient for entanglement percolation. We find that
neighboring nodes are required to be connected by multiple partially entangled
states and devise a rich variety of distillation protocols for the conversion
of these states into singlets. These distillation protocols are suitable for a
variety of network geometries and have a sufficiently high success probability
even for significantly impure states. In addition to this, we discuss possible
further improvements achievable by using quantum strategies including
generalized forms of entanglement swapping.
