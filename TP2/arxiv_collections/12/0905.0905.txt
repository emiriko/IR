We propose the introduction of a Heisenberg symmetry of the Kahler potential
to solve the problems with chaotic inflation in supergravity, as a viable
alternative to the use of shift symmetry. The slope of the inflaton potential
emerges from a small Heisenberg symmetry breaking term in the superpotential.
The modulus field of the Heisenberg symmetry is stabilized and made heavy with
the help of the large vacuum energy density during inflation. The observable
predictions are indistinguishable from those of typical chaotic inflation
models, however the form of the inflationary superpotential considered here may
be interpreted in terms of sneutrino inflation arising from certain classes of
string theory.
