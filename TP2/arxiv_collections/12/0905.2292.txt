Quantum physics exhibits remarkable distinguishing characteristics. For
example, it gives only probabilistic predictions (non-determinism) and does not
allow copying of unknown state (no-cloning). Quantum correlations may be
stronger than any classical ones, nevertheless information cannot be
transmitted faster than light (no-signaling). However, all these features do
not single out quantum physics. A broad class of theories exist which share
such traits with quantum mechanics, while they allow even stronger than quantum
correlations. Here, we introduce the principle of Information Causality. It
states that information that Bob can gain about a previously completely unknown
to him data set of Alice, by using all his local resources (which may be
correlated with her resources) and a classical communication from her, is
bounded by the information volume of the communication. In other words, if
Alice communicates m bits to Bob, the total information access that Bob gains
to her data is not greater than m. For m=0, Information Causality reduces to
the standard no-signaling principle. We show that this new principle is
respected both in classical and quantum physics, whereas it is violated by all
the no-signaling correlations which are stronger that the strongest quantum
correlations. Maximally strong no-signalling correlations would allow Bob
access to any m bit subset of the whole data set held by Alice. If only one bit
is sent by Alice (m=1), this is tantamount to Bob being able to access the
value of any single bit of Alice's data (but of course not all of them). We
suggest that Information Causality, a generalization of no-signaling, might be
one of the foundational properties of Nature.
