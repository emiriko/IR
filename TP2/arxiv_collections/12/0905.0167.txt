Aperture Masking Interferometry used in combination with Adaptive Optics, is
a powerful technique that permits the detection of faint companions at small
angular separations. The precision calibration of the data achieved with this
observing mode indeed leads to reliable results up to and beyond the formal
diffraction limit, explaining why it has, in just a few years, been ported on
most major telescopes. In this poster, we present its possible implementation
on Subaru. We also discuss how the opportunity offered by the planned
Extreme-AO upgrade to HiCIAO will push further the performance of this already
successful technique, offering Subaru a unique access to a very exciting region
of the "contrast-ratio - angular separation" parameter space.
