Very little has been explored about the narrative as a process when
constructing entertainment for interactive media. Simultaneously, the interest
in narrative vehicles increases while certain occupations, seeing the narrative
as a structure, obscure the examination of the process of selecting, arranging
and rendering story material. To correct this deficiency, a method for a
narrative bridging that encourages research and design while exploring
narration as a process, is proposed with the aim to not diminish the properties
of the interactive media. This method focuses on the initial phase where
establishing and handling the information takes place and creates a foundation
that precedes its systematization and computation. The aim is to give designers
a comfortable design tool that firmly aids the design without interfering with
creativity, and at the same time aids the construction of interplay between
narration, spatiality and interactivity. The method aided the practise of a
discipline that was established through a qualitative study conducted as part
of a university course in rapid prototyping. The results demonstrated that the
method aided time-constrained design processes, simultaneously detecting
inconsistencies that would prevent the team from making improvements. The
method gave the team a shared vocabulary and outlook, allowing them to progress
without interfering with the creative flow. This enabled the team to reason
about the process and easily advice design stakeholders. The study also
provides directions for future developments within research of narrative
processes in game design.
