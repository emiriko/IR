CKM mixing between third family quarks and a possible fourth family is
constrained by global fits to the precision electroweak data. The dominant
constraint is from nondecoupling oblique corrections rather than the Zbb vertex
correction used in previous analyses. The possibility of large mixing suggested
by some recent analyses of FCNC processes is excluded, but 3-4 mixing of the
same order as the Cabbibo mixing of the first two families is allowed.
