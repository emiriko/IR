We study blowups of affine n-space with center an arbitrary monomial ideal
and call monomial ideals that render smooth blowups tame ideals. We give a
combinatorial criterion to decide whether the blowup is smooth and apply this
criterion to discuss a smoothing procedure proposed by Rosenberg, monomial
building sets and permutohedra.
