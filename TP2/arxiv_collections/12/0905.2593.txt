We present a novel system for the simulation of quantum phase transitions of
collective internal qubit and phononic states with a linear crystal of trapped
ions. The laser-ion interaction creates an energy gap in the excitation
spectrum, which induces an effective phonon-phonon repulsion and a
Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard interaction. This system shows features equivalent to
phase transitions of polaritons in coupled cavity arrays. Trapped ions allow
for easy tunabilty of the hopping frequency by adjusting the axial trapping
frequency, and the phonon-phonon repulsion via the laser detuning and
intensity. We propose an experimental protocol to access all observables of the
system, which allows one to obtain signatures of the quantum phase transitions
even with a small number of ions.
