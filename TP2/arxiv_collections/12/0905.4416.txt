Axion-like particles are an important part of the spectrum of anomalous gauge
theories involving modified mechanisms of cancellation of the gauge anomalies.
Among these are intersecting brane models, which are characterized by the
presence of one physical axion. We overview a recent study of their
supersymmetric construction and some LHC studies of the productions rates for a
gauged axion.
