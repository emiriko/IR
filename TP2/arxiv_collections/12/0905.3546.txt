I use the Newtonian equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for an isotropic
fluid sphere to generate exact anisotropic solutions of Einstein's equations.
The input function is simply the density. An infinite number of regular
solutions are constructed, some of which satisfy all the standard energy
conditions. Two classes of these solutions generalize the Newtonian polytropes
of index 0 and 1.
