This paper presents a new hybrid learning algorithm for unsupervised
classification tasks. We combined Fuzzy c-means learning algorithm and a
supervised version of Minimerror to develop a hybrid incremental strategy
allowing unsupervised classifications. We applied this new approach to a
real-world database in order to know if the information contained in unlabeled
features of a Geographic Information System (GIS), allows to well classify it.
Finally, we compared our results to a classical supervised classification
obtained by a multilayer perceptron.
