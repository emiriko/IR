Local structure of Mn atoms in Ga1-xMnxN has been investigated by the Mn L3
edge x-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) at total electron yield mode, which
preferentially looks at atoms near the surface. A modeling defects
configuration, the Mn5 micro-clusters complexed with substitutional MnGa and
interstitial MnI is found for the higher Mn doping concentration. This new
configuration is also confirmed by the total energy calculations.
