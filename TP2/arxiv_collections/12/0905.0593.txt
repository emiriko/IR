Edge channels play a crucial role for electron transport in two dimensional
electron gas under magnetic field. It is usually thought that ballistic
transport along edges occurs only in the quantum regime with low filling
factors. We show that a microwave field can stabilize edge trajectories even in
the semiclassical regime leading to a vanishing longitudinal resistance. This
mechanism gives a clear physical interpretation for observed zero-resistance
states.
