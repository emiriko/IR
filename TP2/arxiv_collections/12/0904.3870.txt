The production of jets is studied in deep-inelastic ep scattering at large
negative four momentum transfer squared 150<Q^2<15000 GeV^2 using HERA data
taken in 1999-2007, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 395 pb^-1.
Inclusive jet, 2-jet and 3-jet cross sections, normalised to the neutral
current deep-inelastic scattering cross sections, are measured as functions of
Q^2, jet transverse momentum and proton momentum fraction. The measurements are
well described by perturbative QCD calculations at next-to-leading order
corrected for hadronisation effects. The strong coupling as determined from
these measurements is alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1168 +/-0.0007 (exp.) +0.0046/-0.0030
(th.) +/-0.0016(pdf).
