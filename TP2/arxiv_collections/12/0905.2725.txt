A 20' \times 16' elliptical ring-like structure has been found near the
Galactic center in the narrow energy band corresponding to the K$\alpha$ line
from He-like sulfur. In the ring, two diffuse sources are found, a supernova
remnant candidate G359.79-0.26 and an unidentified source G359.77-0.09. The
X-ray spectrum of G359.77-0.09 is similar to that of G359.79-0.26, which can be
explained by an absorbed thin thermal plasma model with temperatures of 0.7 and
1.0 keV. The absorption column densities of these two sources are large (N_H =
6.9 \times 10^{22} and 4.5 \times 10^{22} cm^{-2}) and are consistent with that
of the Galactic center distance. The X-ray spectrum extracted from the
ring-like structure is also represented by an absorbed thin thermal plasma
model (kT_e \sim 0.9 keV). The thermal energy of the plasma filling the
ring-like structure is estimated to be 1.0 \times 10^{51} erg. We therefore
propose that the two sources comprise a single ring-like object, which is
possibly a super bubble with a size of 49 pc \times 40 pc in the Galactic
center region.
