In-medium effects for distributions of quarks and gluons in central A+A
collisions are considered. We suggest a duality principle, which means
similarity of thermal spectra of hadrons produced in heavy-ion collisions and
inclusive spectra which can be obtained within the dynamic quantum scattering
theory. Within the suggested approach we show that the mean square of the
transverse momentum for these partons grows and then saturates when the initial
energy increases. It leads to the energy dependence of hadron transverse mass
spectra which is similar to that observed in heavy ion collisions.
