It is shown that the resistance between the origin and any lattice point
(l,m,n) in an infinite perfect Simple Cubic (SC) is expressed rationally in
terms of the known value of G0(0,0,0). The resistance between arbitrary sites
in a SC is also studied and calculated when one of the resistors is removed
from the perfect lattice. Finally, the asymptotic behavior of the resistance
for both the perfect and perturbed SC network is investigated
