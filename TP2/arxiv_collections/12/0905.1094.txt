Coherent transport of atoms trapped in an optical lattice can be controlled
by microwave-induced spin flips that correlate with site-to-site hopping. We
study the controllability of homogeneous one-dimensional systems of
noninteracting atoms in the absence of site addressability. Given these
restrictions, we construct a deterministic protocol to map an initially
localized Wannier state to a wave packet that that is coherently distributed
over n sites. This is extended to analytic solutions for arbitrary unitary maps
given homogenous systems and in the presence of time-dependent uniform forces.
Such control is important for applications in quantum information processing
such as quantum computing and quantum simulations of condensed matter
phenomena.
