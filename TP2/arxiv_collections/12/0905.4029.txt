A Microcanonical Finite Site Ansatz in terms of quantities measurable in a
Finite Lattice allows to extend phenomenological renormalization (the so called
quotients method) to the microcanonical ensemble. The Ansatz is tested
numerically in two models where the canonical specific-heat diverges at
criticality, thus implying Fisher-renormalization of the critical exponents:
the 3D ferromagnetic Ising model and the 2D four-states Potts model (where
large logarithmic corrections are known to occur in the canonical ensemble). A
recently proposed microcanonical cluster method allows to simulate systems as
large as L=1024 (Potts) or L=128 (Ising). The quotients method provides
extremely accurate determinations of the anomalous dimension and of the
(Fisher-renormalized) thermal $\nu$ exponent. While in the Ising model the
numerical agreement with our theoretical expectations is impressive, in the
Potts case we need to carefully incorporate logarithmic corrections to the
microcanonical Ansatz in order to rationalize our data.
