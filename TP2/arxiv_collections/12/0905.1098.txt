We construct families of supersymmetric solutions of type IIB and D=11
supergravity that are invariant under the non-relativistic Schrodinger(z)
algebra for various values of the dynamical exponent z. The new solutions are
based on five- and seven-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, respectively,
and include supersymmetric solutions with z=2.
