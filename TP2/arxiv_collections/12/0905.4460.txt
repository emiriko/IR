We present the results of a systematic search for large-scale spectroscopic
variability in apparently single Wolf-Rayet stars brighter than ~12.5. In this
first paper we characterize the various forms of variability detected and
distinguish several separate groups. For each star in our sample, we obtained
4-5 high-resolution spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio ~100. Our ultimate
goal is to identify new candidates presenting variability that potentially
comes from Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIR).
  Out of a sample of 25 stars, 10 were found to display large-scale changes of
which 4 are of CIR-type (WR1, WR115, WR120 and WR134). The star WR134 was
already known to show such changes from previous studies. Three WN8 stars
present a different type of large-scale variability and we believe deserve a
group of their own. Also, all three WC9d stars in our sample present
large-scale variability, but it remains to be checked if these are binaries, as
many dust-making WR stars are double. Finally, of the remaining stars, 10 were
found to show small-amplitude spectral changes which we attribute to normal
line-profile variability due to inhomogeneities in the wind, and 5 were found
to show no spectral variability, as far as can be concluded from the data in
hand.
  Follow-up studies are required to identify potential periods for our
candidates showing CIR-type changes and eventually estimate a rotation rate for
these WR stars.
