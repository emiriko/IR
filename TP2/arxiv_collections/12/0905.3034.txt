The current/voltage curve of metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) displays at
high bias a sudden increase of the resistivity due to the scattering of
electrons with phonons having an anomalously-high population (hot phonons).
Here, we show that it is possible to improve the electrical performances of
metallic CNTs by C13 isotope enrichment. In fact, isotopic disorder creates
additional channels for the hot-phonon deexcitation, reduces their population
and, thus, the nanotube high-bias differential-resistance. This is an
extraordinary case where disorder improves the electronic transport.
