We establish a link between two different constructions of the action of the
twisted loop group on the space of Frobenius structures. The first construction
(due to Givental) describes the action of the twisted loop group on the
partition functions of formal Gromov-Witten theories. The explicit formulas for
the corresponding tangent action were computed by Y.-P. Lee. The second
construction (due to van de Leur) describes the action of the same group on the
space of Frobenius structures via the multi-component KP hierarchies. Our main
theorem states that the genus zero restriction of the Y.-P. Lee formulas
coincides with the tangent van de Leur action.
