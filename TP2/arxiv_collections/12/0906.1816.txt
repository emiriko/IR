Based on a recent idea by Krohn and Yavin, we construct a little Higgs model
with an internal parity that is not broken by anomalous Wess-Zumino-Witten
terms. The model is a modification of the "minimal moose" models by
Arkani-Hamed et al. and Cheng and Low. The new parity prevents large
corrections to oblique electroweak parameters and leads to a viable dark matter
candidate. It is shown how the complete Standard Model particle content,
including quarks and leptons together with their Yukawa couplings, can be
implemented. Successful electroweak symmetry breaking and consistency with
electroweak precision constraints is achieved for natural paramters choices. A
rich spectrum of new particles is predicted at the TeV scale, some of which
have sizable production cross sections and striking decay signatures at the
LHC.
