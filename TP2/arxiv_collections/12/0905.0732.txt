We construct a tractable model to describe the rate at which a knotted
polymer is ejected from a spherical capsid via a small pore. Knots are too
large to fit through the pore and must reptate to the end of the polymer for
ejection to occur. The reptation of knots is described by symmetric exclusion
on the line, with the internal capsid pressure represented by an additional
biased particle that drives knots to the end of the chain. We compute the exact
ejection speed for a finite number of knots L and find that it scales as 1/L.
We also construct a continuum theory for many knots that matches the exact
discrete theory for large L.
