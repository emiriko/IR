A combination of program algebra with the theory of meadows is designed
leading to a theory of computation in algebraic structures which use in
addition to a zero test and copying instructions the instruction set $\{x
\Leftarrow 0, x \Leftarrow 1, x\Leftarrow -x, x\Leftarrow x^{-1}, x\Leftarrow
x+y, x\Leftarrow x\cdot y\}$. It is proven that total functions on cancellation
meadows can be computed by straight-line programs using at most 5 auxiliary
variables. A similar result is obtained for signed meadows.
