We have studied the evolution of magnetic helicity and chirality in an active
region over three consecutive solar rotations. The region when it first
appeared was named NOAA10923 and in subsequent rotations it was numbered NOAA
10930, 10935 and 10941. We compare the chirality of these regions at
photospheric, chromospheric and coronal heights. The observations used for
photospheric and chromospheric heights are taken from Solar Vector Magnetograph
(SVM) and H_alpha imaging telescope of Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO),
respectively. We discuss the chirality of the sunspots and associated H_alpha
filaments in these regions. We find that the twistedness of superpenumbral
filaments is maintained in the photospheric transverse field vectors also. We
also compare the chirality at photospheric and chromospheric heights with the
chirality of the associated coronal loops, as observed from the HINODE X-Ray
Telescope.
