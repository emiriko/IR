The archaeological site Cornesti "Iarcuri" is the largest earth fortification
in Romania, made out of four concentric compounds, spreading over 1780
hectares. It is known since 1700, but it had only a few small attempts of
systematic research, the fortress gained interest only after the publishing of
some satellite images by Google Earth. It is located in an area of high fields
and it occupies three interfluves and contains two streams. Our paper contains
a geomorphologic, topographic and cartographic analysis of the site in order to
determine the limits, the structure, the morphology, the construction technique
and the functionality of such a fortification.Our research is based on
satellite image analysis, on archaeological topography, on soil, climate and
vegetation analysis as a way to offer a complex image, through this
interdisciplinary study of landscape archaeology. Through our work we try not
to date the site as this objective will be achieved only after completing the
systematic excavations which started in 2007, but only to analyze the
co-relationship with the environment.
