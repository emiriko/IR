The knowledge of accurate stellar parameters is a key stone in several fields
of stellar astrophysics, such as asteroseismology and stellar evolution.
Although the parameters can be derived both via spectroscopy and multicolor
photometry, the obtained results are sometimes affected by systematic
uncertainties. In this paper we present a self-consistent spectral analysis of
the solar-type star HD49933, which is a primary target for the CoRoT satellite.
We used high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra to carry out a
consistent parameter estimation and abundance analysis of HD49933. The LLmodels
code was employed for model atmosphere calculations, while Synth3 and Width9
codes were used for line profile calculation and LTE abundance analysis. In
this paper we provide a detailed description of the methodology adopted to
derive the fundamental parameters and the abundances. Although the obtained
parameters differ from the ones previously derived by other authors, we show
that only the set obtained in this work is able to fit the observed spectrum
accurately. In particular, the surface gravity was adjusted to fit
pressure-sensitive spectral features. We confirm the importance of a consistent
analysis of relevant spectroscopic features, application of advanced model
atmospheres, and the use of up-to-date atomic line data for the determination
of stellar parameters. These results are crucial for further studies, e.g.
detailed theoretical modelling of the observed pulsation frequencies.
