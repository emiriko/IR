A complete list of Uq(sl2)-module algebra structures on the quantum plane is
produced and the (uncountable family of) isomorphism classes of these
structures are described. The composition series of representations in question
are computed. The classical limits of the Uq(sl2)-module algebra structures are
discussed.
