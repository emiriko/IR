We report the use of impurities to probe the hidden order parameter of the
strongly correlated metal URu_2Si_2 below the transition temperature T_0 ~ 17.5
K. The nature of this order parameter has eluded researchers for more than two
decades, but is accompanied by the development of a partial gap in the single
particle density of states that can be detected through measurements of the
electronic specific heat and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate. We find that
impurities in the hidden order phase give rise to local patches of
antiferromagnetism. An analysis of the coupling between the antiferromagnetism
and the hidden order reveals that the former is not a competing order parameter
but rather a parasitic effect of the latter.
