Lattice artifacts in the 2d O(n) non-linear sigma-model are expected to be of
the form O(a^2), and hence it was (when first observed) disturbing that some
quantities in the O(3) model with various actions show parametrically stronger
cutoff dependence, apparently O(a), up to very large correlation lengths. In a
previous letter we described the solution to this puzzle. Based on the
conventional framework of Symanzik's effective action, we showed that there are
logarithmic corrections to the O(a^2) artifacts which are especially large,
(ln(a))^3, for n=3 and that such artifacts are consistent with the data. In
this paper we supply the technical details of this computation. Results of
Monte Carlo simulations using various lattice actions for O(3) and O(4) are
also presented.
