The exact large time and distance behavior of the field-field correlators has
been computed for one-dimensional impenetrable anyons at finite temperatures.
The result reproduces known asymptotics for impenetrable bosons and free
fermions in the appropriate limits of the statistics parameter. The obtained
asymptotic behavior of the correlators is dominated by the singularity in the
spectral density of the quasiparticle states at the bottom of the band, and
differs from the predictions of the conformal field theory. One can argue,
however, that the anyonic response to the low-energy probes is still determined
by the conformal terms in the asymptotic expansion.
