In biological systems, expression dynamics that can provide fitted phenotype
patterns with respect to a specific function have evolved through mutations.
This has been observed in the evolution of proteins for realizing folding
dynamics through which a target structure is shaped. We study this evolutionary
process by introducing a statistical-mechanical model of interacting spins,
where a configuration of spins and their interactions $\bm{J}$ represent a
phenotype and genotype, respectively. The phenotype dynamics are given by a
stochastic process with temperature $T_{S}$ under a Hamiltonian with $\bm{J}$.
The evolution of $\bm{J}$ is also stochastic with temperature $T_{J}$ and
follows mutations introduced into $\bm{J}$ and selection based on a fitness
defined for a configuration of a given set of target spins. Below a certain
temperature $T_{S}^{c2}$, the interactions $\bm{J}$ that achieve the target
pattern evolve, whereas another phase transition is observed at
$T_{S}^{c1}<T_{S}^{c2}$. At low temperatures $T_{S}<T_{S}^{c1}$, the
Hamiltonian exhibits a spin-glass like phase, where the dynamics toward the
target pattern require long time steps, and the fitness often decreases
drastically as a result of a single mutation to $\bm{J}$. In the
intermediate-temperature region, the dynamics to shape the target pattern
proceed rapidly and are robust to mutations of $\bm{J}$. The interactions in
this region have no frustration around the target pattern and results in
funnel-type dynamics. We propose that the ubiquity of funnel-type dynamics, as
observed in protein folding, is a consequence of evolution subjected to thermal
noise beyond a certain level; this also leads to mutational robustness of the
fitness.
