Patterns of convection in internally heated, self-gravitating rotating
spherical fluid shells are investigated through numerical simulations. While
turbulent states are of primary interest in planetary and stellar applications
the present paper emphasizes more regular dynamical features at Rayleigh
numbers not far above threshold which are similar to those which might be
observed in laboratory or space experiments. Amplitude vacillations and spatial
modulations of convection columns are common features at moderate and large
Prandtl numbers. In the low Prandtl number regime equatorially attached
convection evolves differently with increasing Rayleigh number and exhibits an
early transition into a chaotic state. Relationships of the dynamical features
to coherent structures in fully turbulent convection states are emphasized.
