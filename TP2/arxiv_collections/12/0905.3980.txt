We observe coherent, continuous wave, 455nm blue beam production via
frequency up-conversion in cesium vapor. Two infrared lasers induce strong
double-excitation in a heated cesium vapor cell, allowing the atoms to undergo
a double cascade and produce a coherent, collimated, blue beam co-propagating
with the two infrared pump lasers.
