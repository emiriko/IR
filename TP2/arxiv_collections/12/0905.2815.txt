We report on new X-ray outbursts observed with Swift from three Supergiant
Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs): XTEJ1739-302, IGRJ17544-2619 and IGRJ08408-4503.
The former two outbursts were caught during the monitoring campaign we have
been performing with the Swift satellite since October 2007: XTEJ1739-302
underwent a new outburst on 2008, August 13, IGRJ17544-2619 on 2008, September
4, while IGRJ08408-4503 on 2008, September 21. While XTEJ1739-302 and
IGRJ08408-4503 bright emission triggered the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope,
IGRJ17544-2619 did not, thus we could perform a spectral investigation only of
the spectrum below 10 keV. The broad band spectra from XTEJ1739-302 and
IGRJ08408-4503 were compatible with the X-ray spectral shape displayed during
the previous flares. A variable absorbing column density during the flare was
observed in XTEJ1739-302 for the first time. The broad band spectrum of
IGRJ08408-4503 requires the presence of two distinct photon populations, a cold
one (0.3 keV) most likely from a thermal halo around the neutron star and a
hotter one (1.4-1.8 keV) from the accreting column. The outburst from
XTEJ1739-302 could be monitored with a very good sampling, thus revealing a
shape which can be explained with a second wind component in this SFXT, in
analogy to what we have suggested in the periodic SFXT IGRJ11215-5952. The
outburst recurrence timescale in IGRJ17544-2619 during our monitoring campaign
with Swift suggests a long orbital period of ~150 days (in an highly eccentric
orbit), compatible with what previously observed with INTEGRAL.
