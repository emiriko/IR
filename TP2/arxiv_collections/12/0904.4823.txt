The features of the Resonance Chiral Theory (RChT) related to the description
of the lightest scalar resonances, sigma, f0(980) and a0(980), are discussed.
Major attention is paid to the fits of the invariant mass distributions in the
radiative decays of the phi(1020) meson. The study of the scalar sector in RChT
is motivated by the success of the theory predictive power in numerous
processes with other types of resonances. We conclude that RChT is sufficiently
flexible to describe these decays, however the further quantitative improvement
is required. The technical work-outs and related important questions are
outlined.
