A coherent state path integral is considered for fermions with precise,
discrete time separation. We derive in detail a nonlinear sigma model of a pair
condensate concerning the precise, discrete time step order which is usually
abbreviated by the appealing (but in fact non-existent) hermitian form of the
fields. This problem is ubiquitous in quantum many-body physics and already
occurs in the original Dyson equation. However, one has only to include a few
amendments concerning the precise, discrete time step development of coherent
state path integrals, compared to previous, abridged approaches, so that one
can accomplish the exact treatment of a spontaneous symmetry breaking with a
coset decomposition for pair condensates and density parts.
