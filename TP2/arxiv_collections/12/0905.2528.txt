We present an analytical model for electron self-injection in nonlinear,
multidimensional plasma wave excited by short laser pulse in the bubble regime
or by short electron beam in the blowout regime. In this regimes, which are
typical for electron acceleration in the last experiments, the laser radiation
pressure or the electron beam charge pushes out background plasma electrons
forming a plasma cavity - bubble - with a huge ion charge. The plasma electrons
can be trapped in the bubble and accelerated by the plasma wakefields up to
very high energies. The model predicts the condition for electron trapping and
the trapping cross section in terms of the bubble radius and the bubble
velocity. The obtained results are in a good agreement with results of 3D PIC
simulations.
