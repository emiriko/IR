The simulation of deterministic pushdown automata defined over a one-letter
alphabet by finite state automata is investigated from a descriptional
complexity point of view. We show that each unary deterministic pushdown
automaton of size s can be simulated by a deterministic finite automaton with a
number of states that is exponential in s. We prove that this simulation is
tight. Furthermore, its cost cannot be reduced even if it is performed by a
two-way nondeterministic automaton. We also prove that there are unary
languages for which deterministic pushdown automata cannot be exponentially
more succinct than finite automata. In order to state this result, we
investigate the conversion of deterministic pushdown automata into context-free
grammars. We prove that in the unary case the number of variables in the
resulting grammar is strictly smaller than the number of variables needed in
the case of nonunary alphabets.
