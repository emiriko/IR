We present the first polarization measurements of the radio emission from
RRAT J1819$-$1458. Our observations, conducted in parallel to regular timing
sessions, have yielded a small number of bright and polarized pulses. The
polarization characteristics and integrated profile resemble those of normal
pulsars with average spin-down energy (Edot): moderate to low linear
polarization in the integrated profile despite relatively high polarization in
the individual pulses. On average, a small degree of circular polarization is
also observed. The polarization position angle executes a remarkably smooth,
steep S-shaped curve, interrupted by two orthogonal jumps. Based on the shape
of the PA swing, we place some constraints on the emission geometry. We compare
these polarization properties to those of other radio emitting neutron star
populations, including young pulsars, pulsars with a high surface magnetic
field and radio emitting magnetars. From the polarization measurements, the
Faraday rotation measure of this RRAT is derived.
