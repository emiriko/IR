Dark and baryonic matter contribute comparable energy density to the present
Universe. The dark matter may also be responsible for the cosmic
positron/electron excesses. We connect these phenomena with Dirac seesaw for
neutrino masses. In our model (i) the dark matter relic density is a dark
matter asymmetry generated simultaneously with the baryon asymmetry so that we
can naturally understand the coincidence between the dark and baryonic matter;
(ii) the dark matter mostly decays into the leptons so that its decay can
interpret the anomalous cosmic rays with positron/electron excesses.
