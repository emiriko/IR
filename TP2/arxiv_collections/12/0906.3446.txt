Recently, Imambekov and Glazman [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 206805 (2008)] showed
that the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of the 1D Bose gas demonstrates
power-law behaviour along the limiting dispersion curve of the collective modes
and calculated the corresponding exponents exactly. Combining these recent
results with a previously obtained strong-coupling expansion we present an
interpolation formula for the DSF of the 1D Bose gas. The obtained expression
is further consistent with exact low energy exponents from Luttinger liquid
theory and shows nice agreement with recent numerical results.
