In this paper we continue to study so called ``inverse Born's rule problem'':
to construct representation of probabilistic data of any origin by a complex
probability amplitude which matches Born's rule. The corresponding algorithm --
quantum-like representation algorithm (QLRA) was recently proposed by A.
Khrennikov [1]--[5]. Formally QLRA depends on the order of conditioning. For
two observables $a$ and $b,$ $b| a$- and $a | b$ conditional probabilities
produce two representations, say in Hilbert spaces $H^{b| a}$ and $H^{a| b}.$
In this paper we prove that under natural assumptions these two representations
are unitary equivalent. This result proves consistency QLRA.
