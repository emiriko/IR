The scope of this paper is to determine the generalized form for equivalent
tension generator theorem (Helmholtz-Thevenin theorem) for three-phase
electrical circuit. Any complicated electrical power systems we can reduce
depending on any three-phase electrical consumer to a three-phase electrical
generator that has certain internal impedance. Starting with this assumption,
we have demonstrated the way to obtain the electromotive voltages for an
equivalent generator and its internal impedances.
