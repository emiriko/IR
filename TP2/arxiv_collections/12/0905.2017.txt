The light scalar mesons, discovered over forty years ago, became a challenge
for the naive quark-antiquark model from the outset. At present the nontrivial
nature of these states is no longer denied practically anybody. Two-photon
physics has made a substantial contribution to understanding the nature of the
light scalar mesons. Recently, it entered a new stage of high statistics
measurements. We review the results concerning two-photon production mechanisms
of the light scalars, based on the analysis of current experimental data.
