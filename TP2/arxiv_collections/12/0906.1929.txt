Along with compacting baryon (neutron) spacing, two very important factors
come into play at once: the lack of self-stabilization within a compact neutron
star (NS) associated with possible black hole (BH) horizon appearance and the
phase transition - color deconfinement and QCD-vacuum reconstruction - within
the nuclear matter. That is why both phenomena should be taken into account
side by side, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since, under the
above transition, the hadronic-phase vacuum (filled up with gluon and chiral
$q\bar q$-condensates) turns into the "empty" (perturbation) subhadronic-phase
one and, thus, the corresponding (very high) pressure falls down rather
abruptly, the formerly cold (degenerated) nuclear medium starts to implode into
the new vacuum. If the mass of a star is sufficiently large, then this
implosion produces an enormous heating, which stops only after quark-gluon
plasma of a temperature about 100 MeV (or even higher) is formed to withstand
the gravitational compression (whereas the highest temperatures of supernovae
bursts are, at least, one order lower). As a consequence, a "burning wall" must
be, most probably, erected on the way of further collapsing the matter towards
a black hole formation.
