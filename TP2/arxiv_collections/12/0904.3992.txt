We have used the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43, 23 and 15 GHz to
measure the solar gravitational deflection of radio waves among four radio
sources during an 18-day period in October 2005. Using phase-referenced radio
interferometry to fit the measured phase delay to the propagation equation of
the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, we have determined the
deflection parameter gamma = 0.9998 +/- 0.0003$ (68% confidence level), in
agreement with General Relativity. The results come mainly from 43 GHz
observations where the refraction effects of the solar corona were negligible
beyond 3 degrees from the sun. The purpose of this experiment is three-fold: to
improve on the previous results in the gravitational bending experiments near
the solar limb; to examine and evaluate the accuracy limits of terrestrial VLBI
techniques; and to determine the prospects and outcomes of future experiments.
Our conclusion is that a series of improved designed experiments with the VLBA
could increase the presented accuracy by at least a factor of 4.
