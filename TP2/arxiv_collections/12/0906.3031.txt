We intended to study the incidence and characteristics of water masers in the
envelopes of stars in the post-AGB and PN evolutionary stages.
  We have used the 64-m antenna in Parkes (Australia) to search for water maser
emission at 22 GHz, towards a sample of 74 sources with IRAS colours
characteristic of post-AGB stars and PNe, at declination $< -32 \deg$. In our
sample, 39% of the sources are PNe or PNe candidates, and 50% are post-AGB
stars or post-AGB candidates.
  We have detected four new water masers, all of them in optically obscured
sources: three in PNe candidates (IRAS 12405-6219, IRAS 15103-5754, and IRAS
16333-4807); and one in a post-AGB candidate (IRAS 13500-6106). The PN
candidate IRAS 15103-5754 has water fountain characteristics, and it could be
the first PN of this class found.
  We confirm the tendency suggested in Paper I that the presence of water
masers in the post-AGB phase is favoured in obscured sources with massive
envelopes. We propose an evolutionary scenario for water masers in the post-AGB
and PNe stages, in which ``water fountain'' masers could develop during
post-AGB and early PN stages. Later PNe would show lower velocity maser
emission, both along jets and close to the central objects, with only the
central masers remaining in more evolved PNe.
