Asteroids can be considered as sources of contamination of point sources and
also sources of confusion noise, depending whether their presence is detected
in the image or their flux is under the detection limit. We estimate that at
low ecliptic latitudes, ~10,000--20,000 asteroids/sq. degree will be detected
with an E-ELT like telescope, while by the end of Spitzer and Herschel
missions, infrared space observatories will provide ~100,000 serendipitous
asteroid detections. The detection and identification of asteroids is therefore
an important step in survey astronomy.
