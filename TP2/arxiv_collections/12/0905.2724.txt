The conventional wisdom is that scale-free networks are prone to cooperation
spreading. In this paper we investigate the cooperative behaviors on the
structured scale-free network. On the contrary of the conventional wisdom that
scale-free networks are prone to cooperation spreading, the evolution of
cooperation is inhibited on the structured scale-free network while performing
the prisoner's dilemma (PD) game. Firstly, we demonstrate that neither the
scale-free property nor the high clustering coefficient is responsible for the
inhibition of cooperation spreading on the structured scale-free network. Then
we provide one heuristic method to argue that the lack of age correlations and
its associated `large-world' behavior in the structured scale-free network
inhibit the spread of cooperation. The findings may help enlighten further
studies on evolutionary dynamics of the PD game in scale-free networks.
