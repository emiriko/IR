Data on e+ e- --> J/psi pi+ pi- and the X(4260) enhancement by the BABAR
collaboration [ arXiv:hep-ex/0506081, arXiv:0808.1543 ] are analysed by
modelling missing signals that should be present in the complete production
amplitude with vector quantum numbers in the charmonium region. Thus, it is
shown that the data contain evidence for the existence of the psi(5S), the
psi(4D), the psi(6S) and the psi(5D) c-cbar vector states, and furthermore a
clear indication for the mass and width of the psi(3D). Moreover, it is shown
that signs of the psi(3S), psi(2D) and psi(4S) can be observed in the same
data. Finally, it is argued that the X(4260) enhancement is not a resonance,
but rather a phenomenon connected with the opening of the D(s)(*)-Dbar(s)(*)
threshold and the coupling to the J/psi f(0)(980) channel.
