Motivated by the PAMELA anomaly in the fluxes of cosmic-ray electron and
positron, we study the cosmic gamma-ray induced by the inverse Compton (IC)
scattering process in unstable dark matter scenario assuming that the anomaly
is due to the electron and positron emission by the decay of dark matter. We
calculate the fluxes of IC-induced gamma-ray produced in our Galaxy and that
from cosmological distance, and show that both of them are significant. If the
gamma-ray flux is precisely determined by Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope for
various line-of-sight directions, it will provide an important test of the
decaying dark matter scenario.
