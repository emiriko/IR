We consider the three new crossing probabilities for percolation recently
found via conformal field theory by Simmons, Kleban and Ziff. We prove that all
three of them (i) may be simply expressed in terms of Cardy's and Watts'
crossing probabilities, (ii) are (weakly holomorphic) second-order modular
forms of weight 0 (and a single particular type) on the congruence group
$\Gamma(2)$, and (iii) under some technical assumptions (similar to those used
by Kleban and Zagier, are completely determined by their transformation laws.
  The only physical input in (iii) is Cardy's crossing formula, which suggests
an unknown connection between all crossing-type formulas.
