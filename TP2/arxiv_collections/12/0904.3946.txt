Coin flipping is a cryptographic primitive in which two distrustful parties
wish to generate a random bit in order to choose between two alternatives. This
task is impossible to realize when it relies solely on the asynchronous
exchange of classical bits: one dishonest player has complete control over the
final outcome. It is only when coin flipping is supplemented with quantum
communication that this problem can be alleviated, although partial bias
remains. Unfortunately, practical systems are subject to loss of quantum data,
which restores complete or nearly complete bias in previous protocols. We
report herein on the first implementation of a quantum coin-flipping protocol
that is impervious to loss. Moreover, in the presence of unavoidable
experimental noise, we propose to use this protocol sequentially to implement
many coin flips, which guarantees that a cheater unwillingly reveals
asymptotically, through an increased error rate, how many outcomes have been
fixed. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time the possibility of flipping
coins in a realistic setting. Flipping quantum coins thereby joins quantum key
distribution as one of the few currently practical applications of quantum
communication. We anticipate our findings to be useful for various
cryptographic protocols and other applications, such as an online casino, in
which a possibly unlimited number of coin flips has to be performed and where
each player is free to decide at any time whether to continue playing or not.
