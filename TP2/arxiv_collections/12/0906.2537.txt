We calculate the total cross section for the production of photons from the
scattering of axions by a strong inhomogeneous magnetic field in the form of a
2D delta-function, a cylindrical step function and a 2D Gaussian distribution,
which can be approximately produced by a solenoidal current. The theoretical
result is used to estimate the axion-photon conversion probability which could
be expected in a reasonable experimental situation. The calculated conversion
probabilities for QCD inspired axions are bigger by a factor of 2.67 (for the
cylindrical step function case) than those derived by applying the celebrated
1D calculation of the (inverse) coherent Primakoff effect. We also consider
scattering at a resonance $E_{axion} \sim m_{axion}$, which corresponds to the
scattering from a delta-function and gives the most enhanced results. Finally,
we analyze the results of this work in the astrophysical extension to suggest a
way in which they may be directed to a solution to some basic solar physics
problems and, in particular, the coronal heating problem.
