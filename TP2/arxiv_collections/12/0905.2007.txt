We prove that every linear-activity automaton group is amenable.
  The proof is based on showing that a sufficiently symmetric random walk on a
specially constructed degree 1 automaton group -- the mother group -- has
asymptotic entropy 0.
  Our result answers an open question by Nekrashevich in the Kourovka notebook,
and gives a partial answer to a question of Sidki.
