We have applied a collocation approach to obtain the numerical solution to
the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for systems of coupled oscillators. The
dependence of the discretized Hamiltonian on scale and angle parameters is
exploited to obtain optimal convergence to the exact results. A careful
comparison with results taken from the literature is performed, showing the
advantages of the present approach.
