We discuss the role of the magnetic degrees of freedom of the gluon plasma in
its viscosity. The main assumption is that motions of the magnetic component
and of the rest of the plasma can be considered as independent. The magnetic
component in the deconfined phase is described by a three-dimensional
(Euclidean) field theory. The parameters of the theory can be estimated
phenomenologically, from the lattice data. It is not ruled out that the
magnetic component is superfluid.
