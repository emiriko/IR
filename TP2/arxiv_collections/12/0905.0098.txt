We report a detailed magnetotransport study of the highly anisotropic
quasi-one-dimensional oxide Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ whose in-chain electrical
resistivity diverges below a temperature $T_{\rm min} \sim$ 25 K. For $T <
T_{\rm min}$, a magnetic field applied parallel to the conducting chain induces
a large negative magnetoresistance and ultimately, the recovery of a metallic
state. We show evidence that this insulator/metal crossover is a consequence of
field-induced suppression of a density-wave gap in a highly one-dimensional
conductor. At the highest fields studied, there is evidence for the possible
emergence of a novel superconducting state with an onset temperature $T_c >$ 10
K.
