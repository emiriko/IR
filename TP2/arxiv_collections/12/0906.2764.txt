Despite the importance of Type Ia supernovae as standard candles for
cosmology and to the chemical evolution of the Universe, we still have no
consistent picture of the nature of these events. Much progress has been made
in the hydrodynamical explosion modelling of supernovae Ia in the last few
years and fully 3-D explosion models are now available. However those
simulations are not directly comparable to observations: to constrain explosion
models, radiative transfer calculations must be carried out. We present a new
3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code which allows forward modelling of the
spectral evolution of Type Ia supernovae from first principles, using
hydrodynamical explosion models as input. Here, as a first application, we
calculate line-of-sight dependent colour light curves for a toy model of an
off-centre explosion.
