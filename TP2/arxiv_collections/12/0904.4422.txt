We present results from a long-term monitoring campaign on the TeV binary LSI
+61 303 with VERITAS at energies above 500 GeV, and in the 2-10 keV hard X-ray
bands with RXTE and Swift, sampling nine 26.5 day orbital cycles between
September 2006 and February 2008. The binary was observed by VERITAS to be
variable, with all integrated observations resulting in a detection at the 8.8
sigma (2006/2007) and 7.3 sigma (2007/2008) significance level for emission
above 500 GeV. The source was detected during active periods with flux values
ranging from 5 to 20% of the Crab Nebula, varying over the course of a single
orbital cycle. Additionally, the observations conducted in the 2007-2008
observing season show marginal evidence (at the 3.6 sigma significance level)
for TeV emission outside of the apastron passage of the compact object around
the Be star. Contemporaneous hard X-ray observations with RXTE and Swift show
large variability with flux values typically varying between 0.5 and 3.0*10^-11
ergs cm^-2 s^-1 over a single orbital cycle. The contemporaneous X-ray and TeV
data are examined and it is shown that the TeV sampling is not dense enough to
detect a correlation between the two bands.
