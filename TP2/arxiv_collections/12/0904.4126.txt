Mode fitting or "peak-bagging" is an important procedure in helioseismology
allowing one to determine the various mode parameters of solar oscillations. We
have recently developed a new "pseudo-global" fitting algorithm as a way of
reducing the systematic bias in the fits of certain mode parameters that are
seen when using "local" fitting techniques to analyse "sun-as-a-star" p-mode
data. This new algorithm has been designed specifically to gain the advantages
of fitting the entire power spectrum, while retaining the efficiency of local
fitting techniques.
  Using simulated data with a full fill we have previously shown that the
pseudo-global routine reduces the bias in estimates of the frequencies and
asymmetries and in the estimates of the solar background when compared with a
traditional fitting technique. Here we present results that show that the
pseudo-global routine is also effective in reducing bias in the parameter
estimates when the time-series has significant gaps. As such we are now able to
employ the routine in order to fit ground based helioseismic data such as that
collected by the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON).
