It is a challenge to synthesize graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with narrow
widths and smooth edges in large scale. Our first principles study on the
hydrogenation of GNRs shows that the hydrogenation starts from the edges of
GNRs and proceeds gradually toward the middle of the GNRs so as to maximize the
number of carbon-carbon $\pi$-$\pi$ bonds. Furthermore, the partially
hydrogenated wide GNRs have similar electronic and magnetic properties as those
of narrow GNRs. Therefore, it is not necessary to directly produce narrow GNRs
for realistic applications because partial hydrogenation could make wide GNRs
"narrower".
