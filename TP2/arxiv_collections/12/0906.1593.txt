Could we define I? Throughout this article we give a negative answer to this
question. More exactly, we show that there is no definition for I in a certain
way. But this negative answer depends on our definition of definability. Here,
we try to consider sufficient generalized definition of definability. In the
middle of paper a paradox will arise which makes us to modify the way we use
the concept of property and definability.
