The search for sample-variable associations is an important problem in the
exploratory analysis of high dimensional data. Biclustering methods search for
sample-variable associations in the form of distinguished submatrices of the
data matrix. (The rows and columns of a submatrix need not be contiguous.) In
this paper we propose and evaluate a statistically motivated biclustering
procedure (LAS) that finds large average submatrices within a given real-valued
data matrix. The procedure operates in an iterative-residual fashion, and is
driven by a Bonferroni-based significance score that effectively trades off
between submatrix size and average value. We examine the performance and
potential utility of LAS, and compare it with a number of existing methods,
through an extensive three-part validation study using two gene expression
datasets. The validation study examines quantitative properties of biclusters,
biological and clinical assessments using auxiliary information, and
classification of disease subtypes using bicluster membership. In addition, we
carry out a simulation study to assess the effectiveness and noise sensitivity
of the LAS search procedure. These results suggest that LAS is an effective
exploratory tool for the discovery of biologically relevant structures in high
dimensional data. Software is available at https://genome.unc.edu/las/.
