We present and discuss a variance-reduced stochastic particle method for
simulating the relaxation-time model of the Boltzmann transport equation. The
present paper focuses on the dilute gas case, although the method is expected
to directly extend to all fields (carriers) for which the relaxation-time
approximation is reasonable. The variance reduction, achieved by simulating
only the deviation from equilibrium, results in a significant computational
efficiency advantage compared to traditional stochastic particle methods in the
limit of small deviation from equilibrium. More specifically, the proposed
method can efficiently simulate arbitrarily small deviations from equilibrium
at a computational cost that is independent of the deviation from equilibrium,
which is in sharp contrast to traditional particle methods.
