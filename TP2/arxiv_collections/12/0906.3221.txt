Superconducting epitaxial FeSe0.5Te0.5 thin films were prepared on SrTiO3
(001) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The high purity of the phase, the
quality of the growth and the epitaxy were studied with different experimental
techniques: X-rays diffraction, reflection high energy electron diffraction,
scanning tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The substrate
temperature during the deposition was found to be the main parameter governing
sample morphology and superconducting critical temperature. Films obtained in
the optimal conditions show an epitaxial growth with c axis perpendicular to
the film surface and the a and b axis parallel to the substrates one, without
the evidence of any other orientation. Moreover, such films show a metallic
behavior over the whole measured temperature range and critical temperature
above 17K, which is higher than the target one.
