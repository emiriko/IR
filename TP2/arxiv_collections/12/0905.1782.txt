We study the CP-violating terms of the spin-spin correlations in neutralino
production and their subsequent two-body decays into sleptons plus leptons at
the ILC. We analyze CP-sensitive observables with the help of T-odd products of
the spin-spin terms. These terms depend on the polarizations of both
neutralinos, with one polarization perpendicular to the production plane. We
present a detailed numerical study of the CP-sensitive observables, cross
sections, and neutralino branching ratios in the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model with complex parameters.
