An analysis of inclusive quasielastic electron scattering is presented using
different descriptions of the final state interactions within the framework of
the relativistic impulse approximation. The relativistic Green's function
approach is compared with calculations based on the use of relativistic purely
real mean field potentials in the final state. Both approaches lead to a
redistribution of the strength but conserving the total flux. Results for the
differential cross section at different energies are presented. Scaling
properties are also analyzed and discussed.
