We present a theoretical analysis of open aperture $Z$-scan signatures for
materials exhibiting an absorption admixture of different multiphoton
processes. Based on a polynomial expansion, we suggest some procedures to
separate the contribution to the trace of the recorded transmittance made by
absorptions of distinct order. The signal processing from experimental data
allows a sequential estimation of assorted nonlinear absorption coefficients
accurately.
