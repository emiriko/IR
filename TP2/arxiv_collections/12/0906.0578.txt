After summarizing the respective merits of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and
Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) paradigms in various stellar systems, we
investigate the possibility that a non-standard interaction between baryonic
and dark matter could reproduce the successes of CDM at extragalactic scales
while making baryonic matter effectively obey the MOND field equation in spiral
galaxies.
