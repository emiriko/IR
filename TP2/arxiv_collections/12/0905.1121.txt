In addition to producing gravitational waves (GW), the dynamics of a binary
black hole system could induce emission of electromagnetic (EM) radiation by
affecting the behavior of plasmas and electromagnetic fields in their vicinity.
We here study how the electromagnetic fields are affected by a pair of orbiting
black holes through the merger. In particular, we show how the binary's
dynamics induce a variability in possible electromagnetically induced emissions
as well as a possible enhancement of electromagnetic fields during the
late-merge and merger epochs. These time dependent features will likely leave
their imprint in processes generating detectable emissions and can be exploited
in the detection of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational waves.
