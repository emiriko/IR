The Radon transform is one of the most useful and applicable tools in
functional analysis. First constructed by John Radon in 1917 it has now been
adapted to several settings. One of the principle theorems involving the Radon
transform is the Support Theorem. In this paper, we discuss how the Radon
transform can be constructed in the white noise setting. We also develop a
Support Theorem in this setting.
