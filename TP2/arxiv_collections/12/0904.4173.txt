In this paper we present the evolution of a low mass model (initial mass
M=1.5 Msun) with a very low metal content (Z=5x10^{-5}, equivalent to
[Fe/H]=-2.44). We find that, at the beginning of the AGB phase, protons are
ingested from the envelope in the underlying convective shell generated by the
first fully developed thermal pulse. This peculiar phase is followed by a deep
third dredge up episode, which carries to the surface the freshly synthesized
13C, 14N and 7Li. A standard TP-AGB evolution, then, follows. During the proton
ingestion phase, a very high neutron density is attained and the s-process is
efficiently activated. We therefore adopt a nuclear network of about 700
isotopes, linked by more than 1200 reactions, and we couple it with the
physical evolution of the model. We discuss in detail the evolution of the
surface chemical composition, starting from the proton ingestion up to the end
of the TP-AGB phase.
