Let $\Omega $ be a bounded ${\mathcal{C}}^{\infty}$-smoothly bounded domain
in ${\mathbb{C}}^{n}.$ For such a domain we define a new notion between strict
pseudo-convexity and pseudo-convexity: the size of the set $W$ of weakly
pseudo-convex points on $\partial \Omega $ is small with respect to Minkowski
dimension: near each point in the boundary $\partial \Omega ,$ there is at
least one complex tangent direction in which the slices of $W$ has a upper
Minkowski dimension strictly smaller than $2.$ We propose to call this notion
"strong pseudo-convexity"; this word is free since "strict pseudo-convexity"
gets the precedence in the case where all the points in $\partial \Omega $ are
stricly pseudo-convex.
  For such domains we prove that if $S$ is a separated sequence of points
contained in the support of a divisor in the Blaschke class, then a canonical
measure associated to $S$ is bounded. If moreover the domain is $p$-regular,
and the sequence $S$ is dual bounded in the Hardy space $H^{p}(\Omega),$ then
the previous measure is Carleson.
  As an application we prove a theorem on interpolating sequences in bounded
convex domains of finte type in ${\mathbb{C}}^{n}.$
  Examples of such pseudo-convex domains are finite type domains in
${\mathbb{C}}^{2},$ finite type convex domains in ${\mathbb{C}}^{n},$ finite
type domains which have locally diagonalizable Levi form, domains with real
analytic boundary and of course, stricly pseudo-convex domains in
${\mathbb{C}}^{n}.$
  Domains like $|{z_{1}}| ^{2}+\exp \{1-|{z_{2}}| ^{-2}\}<1,$ which are not of
finite type are nevertheless strongly pseudo-convex, in this sense.
