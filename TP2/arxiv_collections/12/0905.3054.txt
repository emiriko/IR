In this article we present the integral field spectroscopy (IFS) wiki site,
http://ifs.wikidot.com; what the wiki is, our motivation for creating it, and a
short introduction to IFS. The IFS wiki is designed to be a central repository
of information, tips, codes, tools, references, etc., regarding the whole
subject of IFS, which is accessible and editable by the whole community.
Currently the wiki contains a broad base of information covering topics from
current and future integral field spectrographs, to observing, to data
reduction and analysis techniques. We encourage everyone who wants to know more
about IFS to look at this web-site, and any question you may have you can post
from there. And if you have had any experience with IFS yourself, we encourage
you to contribute your knowledge and help the site develop its full potential.
