We present the photometry of 30 globular clusters (GCs) and GC candidates in
15 intermediate-band filters covering from ~3000 to ~10000 \AA using the
archival CCD images of M31 observed as part of the Beijing - Arizona - Taiwan -
Connecticut (BATC) Multicolour Sky Survey. We transform these intermediate-band
photometric data to the photometry in the standard UBVRI broad-bands. These M31
GC candidates are selected from the Revised Bologna Catalogue (RBC V.3.5), and
most of these candidates do not have any photometric data. Therefore the
present photometric data are supplement to RBC V.3.5. We find that 4 out of 61
GCs and GC candidates in RBC V.3.5 do not show any signal on the BATC images at
their locations. By linear fit of the distribution in colour-magnitude diagram
of blue GCs and GC candidates using the data from RBC V.3.5, and in this study
we find the ``blue-tilt'' of blue M31 GCs with a high confidence at 99.95% or
3.47 sigma for the confirmed GCs, and >99.99% or 4.87 sigma for GCs and GC
candidates.
