We use the real-time Keldysh formalism to investigate finite lifetime effects
on the photon emission from a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). We provide an ansatz
which eliminates the divergent contribution from the vacuum polarization and
renders the photon spectrum UV-finite if the time evolution of the QGP is
described in a suitable manner.
