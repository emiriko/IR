The structure of the Taurid meteor complex based on photographic orbits
available in the IAU Meteor database is studied. We have searched for potential
sub-streams or filaments to be associated with the complex utilizing the
Southworth-Hawkins D-criterion. Applying a strict limiting value for D=0.10,
fifteen sub-streams or filaments, consisting of more than three members, could
be separated out from the general complex. To confirm their mutual consistence
as filaments, rather than fortuitous clumping at the present time, the orbital
evolution over 5000 years of each member is studied. Utilizing the D-criterion
we also searched for NEOs that might be associated with the streams and
filaments of the complex and investigated the orbital evolution of potential
members. Possible associations between 7 Taurid filaments and 9 NEOs were
found. The most probable are for S Psc(b) -- 2003QC10, N Tau(a) -- 2004TG10, o
Ori -- 2003UL3 and N Tau(b) -- 2002XM35. Some of the potential parent objects
could be either dormant comets or larger boulders moving within the complex.
Three of the most populated filaments of the complex may have originated from
2P/Encke.
