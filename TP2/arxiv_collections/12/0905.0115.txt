Entanglement of spins is analyzed for two electrons extracted from a mixed
many electron state by projecting onto the two-electron subspace. The
concurrence formulae are expressed in a compact form for states with a well
defined square of the total spin projection. As an example, the thermal
entanglement for a qubit pair with an anisotropic Heisenberg and the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in an inhomogeneous magnetic field is given
analytically. Remarkably, the concurrence of a pair of electrons with
antiparallel spins and in a delocalised orbital state is given by the scalar
product of the state with its spin-flipped state and not with the time-reversed
state.
