An analytical method is developed for calculating the geometric wakefield and
impedances of an ultrarelativistic beam propagating on- and off-axis through an
axially symmetric geometry with slowly varying circular cross-section, such as
a transition. Unlike previous analytical methods, our approach considers a beam
of arbitrary longitudinal profile and permits detailed perturbative
investigation of impedance as a function of frequency. We compare the accuracy
of the results of our approach with numerical simulations performed using the
code ECHO and determine parameters in which there is good agreement with the
asymptotic analysis.
