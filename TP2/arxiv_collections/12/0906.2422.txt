We investigate nonextensive effects on phase transition in nuclear matter in
the context Walecka many-body field theory. Changes in the general behavior are
observed when the results calculated for the nuclear matter at vanishing baryon
density are compared to those obtained through the standard Fermi-Dirac
distribution. It is observed a dependence between the nonextensive parameter
$q$ and the coupling constants $C_S^2$ of the phase transition. A numerical
relation for this thermodynamical dependence is also proposed.
