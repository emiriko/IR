Departing from the assumption that pairing is induced by an retarded external
'bosonic glue', we reformulate the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of
superconductivity as a scaling theory. Conventional superconductors correspond
with the asymptotically free case but the theory can be effortlessly
generalized to handle quantum critical metals. We find that superconducting
Tc's are strongly enhanced in the latter when retardation is strong while the
coupling is weak. It appears that this simple scaling theory does account quite
well for superconducting properties near quantum critical points.
