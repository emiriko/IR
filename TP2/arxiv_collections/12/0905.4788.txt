We study the gravity assist in the general case, i.e. when the spacecraft is
not in a coplanar motion with respect to the planet's orbit. Our derivation is
based on Kepler's planetary motion and Galilean addition of velocities,
subjects covered in introductory physics courses. The main purpose of this
paper is to illustrate how the gravity assist can be used to deviate a
spacecraft outside its original plane of motion. As an example, we use the
NASA-ESA's Ulysses mission to "test" our simple model.
