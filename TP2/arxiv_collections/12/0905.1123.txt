We present black hole masses and accretion rates for 182 Type 1 AGN in
COSMOS. We estimate masses using the scaling relations for the broad Hb, MgII,
and CIV emission lines in the redshift ranges 0.16<z<0.88, 1<z<2.4, and
2.7<z<4.9. We estimate the accretion rate using an Eddington ratio L_I/L_Edd
estimated from optical and X-ray data. We find that very few Type 1 AGN accrete
below L_I/L_Edd ~ 0.01, despite simulations of synthetic spectra which show
that the survey is sensitive to such Type 1 AGN. At lower accretion rates the
BLR may become obscured, diluted or nonexistent. We find evidence that Type 1
AGN at higher accretion rates have higher optical luminosities, as more of
their emission comes from the cool (optical) accretion disk with respect to
shorter wavelengths. We measure a larger range in accretion rate than previous
works, suggesting that COSMOS is more efficient at finding low accretion rate
Type 1 AGN. However the measured range in accretion rate is still comparable to
the intrinsic scatter from the scaling relations, suggesting that Type 1 AGN
accrete at a narrow range of Eddington ratio, with L_I/L_Edd ~ 0.1.
