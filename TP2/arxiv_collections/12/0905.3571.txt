The recent discovery of iron-based superconductors challenges the existing
paradigm of high-temperature superconductivity. Owing to their unusual
multi-orbital band structure, magnetism, and electron correlation, theories
propose a unique sign reversed s-wave pairing state, with the order parameter
changing sign between the electron and hole Fermi pockets. However, because of
the complex Fermi surface topology and material related issues, the predicted
sign reversal remains unconfirmed. Here we report a novel phase-sensitive
technique for probing unconventional pairing symmetry in the polycrystalline
iron-pnictides. Through the observation of both integer and half-integer
flux-quantum transitions in composite niobium/iron-pnictide loops, we provide
the first phase-sensitive evidence of the sign change of the order parameter in
NdFeAsO0.88F0.12, lending strong support for microscopic models predicting
unconventional s-wave pairing symmetry. These findings have important
implications on the mechanism of pnictide superconductivity, and lay the
groundwork for future studies of new physics arising from the exotic order in
the FeAs-based superconductors.
