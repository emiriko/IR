We explore some second-order amplitudes in loop quantum gravity. In
particular, we compute some second-order contributions to diagonal components
of the graviton propagator in the large distance limit, using the old version
of the Barrett-Crane vertex amplitude. We illustrate the geometry associated to
these terms. We find some peculiar phenomena in the large distance behavior of
these amplitudes, related with the geometry of the generalized triangulations
dual to the Feynman graphs of the corresponding group field theory. In
particular, we point out a possible further difficulty with the old
Barrett-Crane vertex: it appears to lead to flatness instead of Ricci-flatness,
at least in some situations. The observation raises the question whether this
difficulty remains with the new version of the vertex.
