We have developed a quantum memory technique that is completely compatible
with current quantum information processing for continuous variables of light,
where arbitrary frequency sidebands of a squeezed vacuum can be stored and
retrieved using bichromatic electromagnetic induced transparency. 2MHz
sidebands of squeezed vacuum pulses with temporal widths of 470ns and a
squeezing level of -1.78 +- 0.02dB were stored for 3us in the laser-cooled 87Rb
atoms. -0.44 +- 0.02dB of squeezing was retrieved, which is the highest
squeezing ever reported for a retrieved pulse.
