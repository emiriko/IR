It was recently shown by computer simulations that a large class of liquids
exhibits strong correlations in their thermal fluctuations of virial and
potential energy [Pedersen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 015701 (2008)]. Among
organic liquids the class of strongly correlating liquids includes van der
Waals liquids, but excludes ionic and hydrogen-bonding liquids. The present
note focuses on the density scaling of strongly correlating liquids, i.e., the
fact their relaxation time tau at different densities rho and temperatures T
collapses to a master curve according to the expression tau propto
F(rho^gamma/T) [Schroder et al., arXiv:0803.2199]. We here show how to
calculate the exponent gamma from bulk modulus and specific heat data, either
measured as functions of frequency in the metastable liquid or extrapolated
from the glass and liquid phases to a common temperature (close to the glass
transition temperature). Thus an exponent defined from the response to highly
nonlinear parameter changes may be determined from linear response
measurements.
