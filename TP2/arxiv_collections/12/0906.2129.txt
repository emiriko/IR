We study the splitting scheme associated with the linear stochastic Cauchy
problem dU(t) = AU(t) dt + dW(t), where A is the generator of an analytic
C_0-semigroup S={S(t)} on a Banach space E and W={W(t)} is a Brownian motion
with values in a fractional domain space E_\b associated with A. We prove that
if \a,\b,\g,\th \ge 0 are such that \g + \th < 1 and max[0,(\a-\b+\th)] + \g <
1/2, then the approximate solutions U_n (where n is the number of time steps)
converge to the solution U in the Holder space C^\g([0,T];E_\a), both in
L^p-means and almost surely, with rate 1/n^\th.
