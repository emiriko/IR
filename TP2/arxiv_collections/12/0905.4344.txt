We analyse the spectral energy distribution of the evolved carbon giant DY
Per with a spectral synthesis technique. The red giant shows the photometric
features of R CrB type stars. We derive the atmospheric parameters of DY Per
using three variants of molecular line lists. We estimate Teff to be in the
range 2900 < Teff < 3300 K. We adopted log g = 0. The star may be metal
deficient and hydrogen deficient. The maximum possible carbon abundance in the
star, [C]=0.94, provides the following atmospheric parameters: Tef=3100 K,
[Fe/H] = 0, log(C/O)=0.6, [N/Fe] = 0, [H/He] = 0, with Jorgensen's line lists
for the molecules C2 and CN.
