We study the quasinormal modes of the massless scalar perturbation in the
background of a deformed black hole in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with
coupling constant $\lambda=1$. Our results show that the quasinormal
frequencies depend on the parameter in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity and the
behavior of the quasinormal modes is different from those in the
Reissner-Norstr\"{om} and Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole spacetimes. The
absolute value of imaginary parts is smaller and the scalar perturbations decay
more slowly in the deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz black hole spacetime. This
information can help us understand more about the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity.
