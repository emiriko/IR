We study trapping and propagation of a matter-wave soliton through the
interface between uniform medium and a nonlinear optical lattice (NOL).
Different regimes for transmission of a broad and a narrow soliton are
investigated. Reflections and transmissions of solitons are predicted as
function of the lattice phase. The existence of a threshold in the amplitude of
the nonlinear optical lattice, separating the transmission and reflection
regimes, is verified. The localized nonlinear surface state, corresponding to
the soliton trapped by the interface, is found. Variational approach
predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations for the original
Gross-Pitaevskii equation with nonlinear periodic potentials.
