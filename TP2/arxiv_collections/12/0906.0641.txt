The quantum differential equations can be regarded as examples of equations
with certain universal properties which are of wider interest beyond quantum
cohomology itself. We present this point of view as part of a framework which
accommodates the KdV equation and other well known integrable systems. In the
case of quantum cohomology, the theory is remarkably effective in packaging
geometric information; we illustrate this with reference to simple examples of
Gromov-Witten invariants, variations of Hodge structure, the Reconstruction
Theorem, and the Crepant Resolution Conjecture. Based on lectures given at the
summer school "Geometric and Topological Methods for Quantum Field Theory",
