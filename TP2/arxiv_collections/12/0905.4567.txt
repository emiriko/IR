A strong confluence result for Q*, a quantum lambda-calculus with
measurements, is proved. More precisely, confluence is shown to hold both for
finite and infinite computations. The technique used in the confluence proof is
syntactical but innovative. This makes Q* different from similar quantum lambda
calculi, which are either measurement-free or provided with a reduction
strategy.
