We study the ground-state properties and quantum dynamics of few-boson
mixtures with strong inter-species repulsion in one-dimensional traps. If one
species localizes at the center, e.g., due to a very large mass compared to the
other component, it represents an effective barrier for the latter and the
system can be mapped onto identical bosons in a double well. For weaker
localization, the barrier atoms begin to respond to the light component,
leading to an induced attraction between the mobile atoms that may even
outweigh their bare intra-species repulsion. To explain the resulting effects,
we derive an effective Hubbard model for the lighter species accounting for the
backaction of the barrier in correction terms to the lattice parameters. Also
the tunneling is drastically affected: Varying the degree of localization of
the "barrier" atoms, the dynamics of intrinsically noninteracting bosons can
change from Rabi oscillations to effective pair tunneling. For identical
fermions (or fermionized bosons) this leads to the tunneling of attractively
bound pairs.
