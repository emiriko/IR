Two generations of a novel detector for high-resolution transmission imaging
and spectrometry of fast-neutrons are presented. These devices are based on a
hydrogenous fiber scintillator screen and single- or multiple-gated intensified
camera systems (ICCD). This detector is designed for energy-selective neutron
radiography with nanosecond-pulsed broad-energy (1 - 10 MeV) neutron beams.
Utilizing the Time-of-Flight (TOF) method, such a detector is capable of
simultaneously capturing several images, each at a different neutron energy
(TOF). In addition, a gamma-ray image can also be simultaneously registered,
allowing combined neutron/gamma inspection of objects. This permits combining
the sensitivity of the fast-neutron resonance method to low-Z elements with
that of gamma radiography to high-Z materials.
