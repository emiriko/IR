We have measured an Ag/Al interface specific resistance, 2AR(Ag/Al)(111) =
1.4 fOhm-m^2, that is twice that predicted for a perfect interface, 50% larger
than for a 2 ML 50%-50% alloy, and even larger than our newly predicted 1.3
fOhmm^2 for a 4 ML 50%-50% alloy. Such a large value of 2ARAg/Al(111) confirms
a predicted sensitivity to interfacial disorder and suggests an interface
greater than or equal to 4 ML thick. From our calculations, a predicted
anisotropy ratio, 2AR(Ag/Al)(001)/2AR(Ag/Al)(111), of more then 4 for a perfect
interface, should be reduced to less than 2 for a 4 ML interface, making it
harder to detect any such anisotropy.
