We obtain the most general static cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions of
the Einstein field equations in $(4 + N)$ dimensions. Under the assumption of
separation of variables, we construct a family of Levi-Civita-Kasner vacuum
solutions in $(4 + N)$. We discuss the dimensional reduction of the static
solutions. Depending on the reduction procedure, they can be interpreted either
as a scalar-vacuum generalization of Levi-Civita spacetimes, or as the
effective 4D vacuum spacetime outside of an idealized string in braneworld
theory.
