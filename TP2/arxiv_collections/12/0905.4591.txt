We report on a comprehensive study of CePd$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$ $(0.6 \leq x \leq
0.95)$ poly- and single crystals close to the ferromagnetic instability by
means of low-temperature ac susceptibility, magnetization and volume thermal
expansion. The signature of ferromagnetism in this heavy-fermion system can be
traced from 6.6 K in CePd down to 25 mK for $x=0.87$. Despite pronounced
non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) effects in both, specific heat and thermal expansion,
the Gr\"uneisen ratio {\it does not} diverge as $T\to 0$, providing evidence
for the absence of a quantum critical point. Instead, a peculiar
"Kondo-cluster-glass" state is found for $x\geq 0.65$, and the NFL effects in
the specific heat, ac susceptibility and magnetization are compatible with the
quantum Griffiths phase scenario.
