The increasing use of model-based tools enables further use of formal
verification techniques in the context of distributed real-time systems. To
avoid state explosion, it is necessary to construct verification models that
focus on the aspects under consideration.
  In this paper, we discuss how we construct a verification model for timing
analysis in distributed real-time systems. We (1) give observations concerning
restrictions of timed automata to model these systems, (2) formulate
mathematical representations on how to perform model-to-model transformation to
derive verification models from system models, and (3) propose some theoretical
criteria how to reduce the model size. The latter is in particular important,
as for the verification of complex systems, an efficient model reflecting the
properties of the system under consideration is equally important to the
verification algorithm itself. Finally, we present an extension of the
model-based development tool FTOS, designed to develop fault-tolerant systems,
to demonstrate %the benefits of our approach.
