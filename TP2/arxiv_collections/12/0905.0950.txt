We present a 1D LTE chemical abundance analysis of the very bright (V=9.1)
Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) star BD +44 493, based on high-resolution,
high signal-to-noise spectra obtained with Subaru/HDS. The star is shown to be
a subgiant with an extremely low iron abundance ([Fe/H]=-3.7), while it is rich
in C ([C/Fe]=+1.3) and O ([O/Fe]=+1.6). Although astronomers have been
searching for extremely metal-poor stars for decades, this is the first star
found with [Fe/H]<-3.5 and an apparent magnitude V<12. Based on its low
abundances of neutron-capture elements (e.g., [Ba/Fe]=-0.59), BD +44 493 is
classified as a "CEMP-no" star. Its abundance pattern implies that a
first-generation faint supernova is the most likely origin of its carbon
excess, while scenarios related to mass loss from rapidly-rotating massive
stars or mass transfer from an AGB companion star are not favored. From a
high-quality spectrum in the near-UV region, we set an very low upper limit on
this star's beryllium abundance (A(Be)=log(Be/H)+12<-2.0), which indicates that
the decreasing trend of Be abundances with lower [Fe/H] still holds at
[Fe/H]<-3.5. This is the first attempt to measure a Be abundance for a CEMP
star, and demonstrates that high C and O abundances do not necessarily imply
high Be abundances.
