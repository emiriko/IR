In this Letter, the radial velocity variability of the chemically peculiar
star Epsilon Ursae Majoris ($\epsilon$ UMa) from the sharp cores of the
hydrogen lines is investigated. This study is based on the ELODIE archival data
obtained at different phases of the rotational cycle. The star exhibits
low-amplitude radial velocity variations with a period of P=5.0887 d. The best
Keplerian solution yields an eccentricity e=0.503 and a minimum mass
~14.7$M_{\rm Jup}$ on the hypothesis that the rotational axis of $\epsilon$ UMa
is perpendicular to the orbital plane. This result indicate that the companion
is the brown-dwarf with the projected semi-amplitude variation of the radial
velocity $K_{\rm 2}$=135.9 km/sec and the sine of inclination times semi-major
axis $a_{2}$sin(i)=0.055 au.
