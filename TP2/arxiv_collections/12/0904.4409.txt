It is shown how Seiberg-Witten equations can be obtained by means of Fedosov
deformation quantization of endomorphism bundle and the corresponding theory of
equivalences of star products. In such setting, Seiberg-Witten map can be
iteratively computed for arbitrary gauge group up to any given degree with
recursive methods of Fedosov construction. Presented approach can be also
considered as a generalization of Seiberg-Witten equations to Fedosov type of
noncommutativity.
