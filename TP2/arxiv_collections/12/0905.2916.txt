The operation of Thick Gaseous Electron Multipliers (THGEM) in Ne and Ne/CH4
mixtures, features high multiplication factors at relatively low operation
potentials, in both single- and double-THGEM configurations. We present some
systematic data measured with UV-photons and soft x-rays, in various Ne
mixtures. It includes gain dependence on hole diameter and gas purity,
photoelectron extraction efficiency from CsI photocathodes into the gas,
long-term gain stability and pulse rise-time. Position resolution of a 100x100
mm^2 X-rays imaging detector is presented. Possible applications are discussed.
