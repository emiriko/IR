Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model
possibly solving many standing issues in particle physics and cosmology. The
general purpose ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is an
experiment capable of discovering or excluding TeV SUSY. However discovery can
only be claimed when the Standard Model backgrounds are understood and are
under control. The expectations at the LHC are that Monte Carlo simulation
predictions may not be sufficient to achieve this and the backgrounds will have
to determined from data itself. In this note we will highlight some data driven
methods developed to estimate backgrounds and detect a possible SUSY excess.
