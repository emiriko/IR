We show that a two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled system in the presence of a
charge/spin-density wave with a wave-vector perpendicular to an applied
electric field supports bulk manifestations of the direct/inverse spin-Hall
effect. We develop a theory of this phenomenon in the framework of the spin
diffusion equation formalism and show that, due to the inhomogeneity created by
a spin-grating, an anomalous bulk charge-density wave is induced away from
sample boundaries. The optimal conditions for the observation of the effect are
determined. The main experimental manifestation of the bulk spin-Hall effect,
the induced charge/spin-density-wave, is characterized by a pi/2-phase shift
relative to the initial non-homogeneous spin/charge-polarization profile and
has a non-monotonic time-varying amplitude.
