The scaling properties of various composite information-theoretic measures
(Shannon and R\'enyi entropy sums, Fisher and Onicescu information products,
Tsallis entropy ratio, Fisher-Shannon product and shape complexity) are studied
in position and momentum spaces for the non-relativistic hydrogenic atoms in
the presence of parallel magnetic and electric fields. Such measures are found
to be invariant at the fixed values of the scaling parameters given by $s_1 = B
\hbar^3(4\pi\epsilon_0)^2 / (Z^2m^2e^3)$ and $s_2 = F \hbar^4(4\pi\epsilon_0)^3
/ (Z^3e^5m^2)$. Numerical results which support the validity of the scaling
properties are shown by choosing the representative example of the position
space shape complexity. Physical significance of the resulting scaling
behaviour is discussed.
