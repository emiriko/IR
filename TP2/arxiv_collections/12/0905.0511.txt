We report first principles calculations of the electronic structure and
electron-phonon coupling in the non-centrosymmetric superconductor LaNiC$_2$.
These show that the material is a conventional electron-phonon superconductor
with intermediate coupling. There are large contributions to the coupling by
two low frequency C non-bond-stretching modes, one of which has strong Kohn
anomalies. Since LaNiC$_2$ lacks inversion symmetry, the pairing is of dominant
s-wave type with some mixture of p-wave character. This will give exponential
decay in the specific heat.
