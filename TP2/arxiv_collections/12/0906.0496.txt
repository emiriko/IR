Measurement of the in-medium energy loss of fast partons is one of the most
active topics in heavy-ion physics. Such studies provide an opportunity to gain
insight into the fundamental behavior of QCD processes by studying them away
from vacuum conditions. A promising channel for relating theoretical models to
data are two particle correlations using direct photon triggers. Recent results
on this observeable using the PHENIX detector are presented.
