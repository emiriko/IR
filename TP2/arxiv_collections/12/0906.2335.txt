We study the clustering structure and the internal or sub-structure of
clusters in $^{112-122}$Ba nuclei within the framework of relativistic mean
field theory in an axially deformed cylindrical co-ordinate. We calculate the
total density distribution, and the individual neutrons and protons density
distributions. From the analysis of the clustering confugurations of the
density distributions of various shapes, we find different sub-structures
inside the Ba nuclei considered here. The important step, carried out for the
first time, is the counting of number of protons and neutrons present in the
clustering region(s). $^{12}$C is shown to consitute the cluster configuration
of Ba nuclei in most cases, with $^{2,3}$H and $^4$He constituting the neck
between two fissioning symmetrical fragments.
