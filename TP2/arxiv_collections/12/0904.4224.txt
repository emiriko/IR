We demonstrate a method to locally control the temperature of photonic
crystal devices via micron-scale electrical heaters. The method is used to
control the resonant frequency of InAs quantum dots strongly coupled to GaAs
photonic crystal resonators. This technique enables independent control of
large ensembles of photonic devices located on the same chip at tuning speed as
high as hundreds of kHz.
