Current neutrino experimental data on neutrino mixing are well describes by
Tri-bi-maximal mixing, which is predicts sin^{2}\theta_{12}=1/3,zero U_{e3} and
\theta_{23}=45^{o}. We consider the planck scale operator on neutrino mixing.
We assume that the neutrino masses and mixing arise through physics at a scale
intrimediate between planck scale and the electroweak braking scale. We also
assume, that just above the electroweak breaking scale neutrino mass are nearly
degenerate and the mixing is tri-bi-maximal. Quantum gravity (Planck scale)
effects lead to an effective SU(2)_{L}\times U(1) invariant dimension-5
Lagrangian symmetry involving Standard Model. On electroweak symmetry breaking,
this operator gives rise to correction to the neutrino masses and mixings these
additional terms can be considered as perturbation to the tri-bimaximal
neutrino mass matrix. We compute the deviation of the three mixing angles and
oscillation probability. We find that the only large change in solar mixing
angle and % change in maximum P_{\mu e} is about 10%.
