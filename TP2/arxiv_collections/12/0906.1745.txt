We investigate the novel intermetallic ternary compounds
\emph{R}Co$_{9}$Ge$_{4}$ with \emph{R} = La and Ce by means of $X$-ray
diffraction, susceptibility and specific heat measurements. CeCo$_{9}$Ge$_{4}$
crystallizes in the space group ${I}$ 4/ ${mcm}$ and is characterized by the
coexistence of two different magnetic sublattices. The Ce-based sublattice,
with an effective moment close to the expected value for a Ce$^{3+}$-ion,
exhibits a magnetically ordered ground state with $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.5$ K. The
Co-based sublattice, however, exhibits magnetic moments due to itinerant 3$d$
electrons. The magnetic specific heat contribution of the Ce-sublattice is
discussed in terms of a resonance-level model implying the interplay between an
antiferromagnetic phase transition and the Kondo-effect and an underlying
Schottky-anomaly indicating a crystal field level scheme splitting into three
twofold degenerated micro states ($\Delta_1 = 69$ K, $\Delta_2 = 133$ K).
