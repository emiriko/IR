In 2005 V. Turaev introduced the theory of topology of words and phrases.
Turaev defined an equivalence relation on generalized words and phrases which
is called homotopy. This is suggested by the Reidemeister moves in the knot
theory. Then Turaev gave the homotopy classification of generalized words with
less than or equal to five letters. In this paper we give the classification of
generalized phrases up to homotopy with less than or equal to three letters. To
do this we construct a new homotopy invariant for nanophrases over any
$\alpha$.
