Due to close encounters with the inner planets, Near-Earth-Asteroids (NEAs)
can have very chaotic orbits. Because of this chaoticity, a statistical
treatment of the dynamical properties of NEAs becomes difficult or even
impossible. We propose a new way to classify NEAs by using methods from Fuzzy
Logic. We demonstrate how a fuzzy characterization of NEAs can be obtained and
how a subsequent analysis can deliver valid and quantitative results concerning
the long-term dynamics of NEAs.
