The Zurich IMaging POLarimeter (ZIMPOL) developed at ETH Zurich and installed
permanently at the Gregory Coude Telescope at Istituto Ricerche Solari Locarno
(IRSOL) allows a polarimetric precision down to 10^-5 to be reached. This makes
it possible to perform several accurate spectro-polarimetric measurements of
scattering polarization and to investigate solar magnetic fields through the
signatures of the Hanle and Zeeman effects. The research programs are currently
being extended to monochromatic imaging of the Stokes vector with a recently
installed Fabry-Perot rapidly tunable filter system with a narrow pass band of
about 30mA. The spatial resolution is being improved by the installation of an
Adaptive Optics system.
