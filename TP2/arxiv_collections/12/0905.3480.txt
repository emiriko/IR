A compact complex of line emission filaments in the galactic plane has the
appearance of those expected of an evolved supernova remnant though non-thermal
radio and X-ray emission have not yet been detected. This optical emission line
region has now been observed with deep imagery and both low and high-dispersion
spectroscopy. Diagnostic diagrams of the line intensities from the present
spectra and the new kinematical observations both point to a supernova origin.
However, several features of the nebular complex still require an explanation
within this interpretation.
