We study possible real structures in the space of solutions to the quantum
differential equation. We show that, under mild conditions, a real structure in
orbifold quantum cohomology yields a pure and polarized tt^*-geometry near the
large radius limit. We compute an example of P^1 which is pure and polarized
over the whole Kaehler moduli space H^2(P^1,C^*).
