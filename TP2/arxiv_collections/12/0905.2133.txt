We prove that the area of cross-sections of light-cones, in space-times
satisfying suitable energy conditions, is smaller than or equal to that of the
corresponding cross-sections in Minkowski, or de Sitter, or anti-de Sitter
space-time. The equality holds if and only if the metric coincides with the
corresponding model in the domain of dependence of the light-cone.
