We analyse scattering of a heavy atom off a weakly bound molecule comprising
an identical heavy and a light atom in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We
focus on the situation where the heavy atoms are bosons, which was realized in
several experiments. The elastic and inelastic cross sections for the
atom-molecular scattering exhibit a series of resonances corresponding to
three-body Efimov states. Resonances in elastic collisions are accessible
experimentally through thermalization rates, and thus constitute an alternative
way of observing Efimov states.
