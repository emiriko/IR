Given that a ferroelectric domain is generally a three dimensional entity,
the determination of its area as well as its depth is mandatory for full
characterization. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is known for its ability
to map the lateral dimensions of ferroelectric domains with high accuracy.
However, no depth profile information has been readily available so far. Here,
we have used ferroelectric domains of known depth profile to determine the
dependence of the PFM response on the depth of the domain, and thus effectively
the depth resolution of PFM detection.
