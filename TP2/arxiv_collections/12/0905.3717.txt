We show that a tilted magnetic field transforms the structure and THz
dynamics of charge domains in a biased semiconductor superlattice. At critical
field values, strong coupling between the Bloch and cyclotron motion of a
miniband electron triggers chaotic delocalization of the electron orbits,
causing strong resonant enhancement of their drift velocity. This dramatically
affects the collective electron behavior by inducing multiple propagating
charge domains and GHz-THz current oscillations with frequencies ten times
higher than with no tilted field.
