A bias correction to Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is derived for
seemingly unrelated regressions models. The correction is of particular use
when the sample size is not much larger than the number of fitted parameters. A
small-sample simulation study indicates that the bias-corrected AIC (AICc)
provides better model choices than other model selection criteria.
