At a critical ``chiral'' coupling, topologically massive gravity with a
negative cosmological constant exhibits several unusual features, including the
emergence of a new logarithmic branch of solutions and a linearization
instability for certain boundary conditions. I show that at this coupling, the
linearized theory may be parametrized by a free scalar field at the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, and use this description to investigate these
features.
