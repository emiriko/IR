It is demonstrated that non-locality and non-linearity of Hartree-Fock
equations dramatically affect the properties of their solutions that
essentially differ from solutions of Schr?dinger equation with a local
potential. Namely, it acquires extra zeroes, has different coordinate
asymptotic, violates so-called gauge-invariance, has different scattering
phases at zero energy, has in some cases several solutions with the same set of
quantum numbers, usually equivalent expressions of current and Green's
functions became non-equivalent. These features result in a number of
consequences for probabilities of some physical processes, leading e. g. to
extra width of atomic Giant resonances and enhance considerably the ionization
probability of inner atomic electrons by a strong field.
