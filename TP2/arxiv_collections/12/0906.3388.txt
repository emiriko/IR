We point out that the compact Feynman rules for Majorana fermions proposed by
Denner et al. are in fact a convention for the complex phases of (anti)spinors,
valid for both Majorana and Dirac fermions. We establish the relation of this
phase convention with that common in the use of spinor techniques.
