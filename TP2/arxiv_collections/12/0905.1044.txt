Borexino is an experiment designed to detect in real-time low energy solar
neutrinos. It is installed at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory and has
started taking data in May 2007. We report the direct measurement of the 7Be
solar neutrino signal rate after 1 year of data taking. Implications and
perspectives are discussed.
