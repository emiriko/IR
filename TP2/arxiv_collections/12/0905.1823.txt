We investigate 3-dimensional globally hyperbolic AdS manifolds containing
"particles", i.e., cone singularities along a graph $\Gamma$. We impose
physically relevant conditions on the cone singularities, e.g. positivity of
mass (angle less than $2\pi$ on time-like singular segments). We construct
examples of such manifolds, describe the cone singularities that can arise and
the way they can interact (the local geometry near the vertices of $\Gamma$).
The local geometry near an "interaction point" (a vertex of the singular locus)
has a simple geometric description in terms of polyhedra in the extension of
hyperbolic 3-space by the de Sitter space.
  We then concentrate on spaces containing only (interacting) massive
particles. To each such space we associate a graph and a finite family of pairs
of hyperbolic surfaces with cone singularities. We show that this data is
sufficient to recover the space locally (i.e., in the neighborhood of a fixed
metric). This is a partial extension of a result of Mess for non-singular
globally hyperbolic AdS manifolds.
