We have considered the orbital-free approximation of the kinetic energy
functional to investigate the zero temperature properties of dilute
harmonically trapped two component Fermi gas at unitarity. It is shown that our
approach provides a realible and inexpensive method to study superfluid
strongly interacting dilute Fermi gases.
