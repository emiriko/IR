We present a study on the mechanical configuration and the electronic
properties of semiconducting carbon nanotubes supported by partially
depassivated silicon substrates, as inferred from topographic and spectroscopic
data acquired with a room-temperature ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling
microscope and density-functional theory calculations. A mechanical distortion
and doping for semiconducting carbon nanotubes on Si(100)-(2x1):H with
hydrogen-depassivated stripes up to 100 Angstrom wide are ascertained from both
experiment and theory. The results presented here point towards novel and local
functionalities of nanotube-semiconductor interfaces.
