We give a pattern avoidance criterion to classify the orbits of Sp(p,C) x
Sp(q,C) (resp. GL(n,C)) on the flag variety of type C_{p+q} (resp. D_n) with
rationally smooth closure. We show that all such orbit closures fiber (with
smooth fiber) over a smaller flag variety, and hence are in fact smooth. In
addition we prove that the classification is insensitive to isogeny.
