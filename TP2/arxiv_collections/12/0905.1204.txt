We study the absorptive and dispersive properties of Doppler-broadened atomic
media as a function of detuning. Beginning from the exact lineshape calculated
for a two-level atom, a series of approximations to the electric susceptibility
are made. These simplified functions facilitate direct comparison between
absorption and dispersion, and show that dispersion dominates the atom-light
interaction far from resonance. The calculated absorption and dispersion are
compared to experimental data, showing the validity of the approximations.
