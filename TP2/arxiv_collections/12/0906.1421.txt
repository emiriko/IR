This paper deals with phase II, univariate, statistical process control when
a set of in-control data is available, and when both the in-control and
out-of-control distributions of the process are unknown. Existing process
control techniques typically require substantial knowledge about the in-control
and out-of-control distributions of the process, which is often difficult to
obtain in practice. We propose (a) using a sequence of control limits for the
cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts, where the control limits are determined
by the conditional distribution of the CUSUM statistic given the last time it
was zero, and (b) estimating the control limits by bootstrap. Traditionally,
the CUSUM control chart uses a single control limit, which is obtained under
the assumption that the in-control and out-of-control distributions of the
process are Normal. When the normality assumption is not valid, which is often
true in applications, the actual in-control average run length, defined to be
the expected time duration before the control chart signals a process change,
is quite different from the nominal in-control average run length. This
limitation is mostly eliminated in the proposed procedure, which is
distribution-free and robust against different choices of the in-control and
out-of-control distributions.
