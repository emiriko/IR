The study of phase structure of dilute $^3$He - $^4$He solid mixture of
different quality is performed by spin echo NMR technique. The diffusion
coefficient is determined for each coexistent phase. Two diffusion processes
are observed in rapidly quenched (non-equilibrium) hcp samples: the first
process has a diffusion coefficient corresponding to hcp phase, the second one
has huge diffusion coefficient corresponding to liquid phase. That is evidence
of liquid-like inclusions formation during fast crystal growing. It is
established that these inclusions disappear in equilibrium crystals after
careful annealing.
