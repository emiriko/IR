We rewrite the property of confocality with respect to a pseudo-Euclidean
space. Our observation is that the generalized definition of confocality in
$\cite{stachel}$ does not give back to the original definition of confocality
of Euclidean conics. The "confocality property" of $\cite{stachel}$ can be get
from our definition in the case when the projection transformation is regular,
it is the identity transformation of the space. Our examination concentrate to
the singular cases, too because they are playing important role in the
investigations of essential examples.
