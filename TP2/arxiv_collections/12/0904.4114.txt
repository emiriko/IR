The problem of Dirac fermions in graphite subject to a perpendicular magnetic
field is studied. We show analytically that the weak inter-layer interaction
between the graphene sheets leads to anomalies in the Shubnikov-de Haas and de
Haas-van Alphen magneto-oscillations governed by the orbits around extremal
cross-sections of the graphite Fermi surface. The calculation of the Landau
plot performed within a four band continuum model reveals that
magneto-oscillations are aperiodic, except of the case of vanishing inter-layer
interaction at the H point of the graphite Brillouin zone. Also for all other
orbits along the H-K-H edge the magneto-oscillations are only asymptotically
periodic in the quasi-classical limit, with the phase corresponding to massive
fermions.
