Results from PHENIX at RHIC in p-p and Au+Au collisions are presented from
the perspective of measurements in p-p collisions at the CERN ISR which serve
as a basis for many of the techniques used. Notable results include the
equality of the suppression of inclusive pi0 and direct electrons (from the
decay of heavy quarks) in the range of transverse momentuum 4 < pT < 9 GeV/c in
central Au+Au collisions. This result appears to strongly disfavor the
explanation of suppression as due to radiative energy loss of partons
traversing a Quark Gluon Plasma but opens up a fundamental discussion of how
Fermions get mass, whether all six quarks are nearly massless in a QGP and how
to test this.
