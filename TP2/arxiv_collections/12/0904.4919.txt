The problem of anomalously high levels of flicker noise observed in the
normal state of the high-temperature superconductors is addressed. It is argued
that the anomaly is the result of incorrect normalization of the power spectra
according to the Hooge formula. A careful analysis of the available
experimental data is given, which shows that the scaling of the spectral power
with sample size is essentially different from the inverse proportionality. It
is demonstrated that the measured spectra obey the law given by the recently
proposed quantum theory of fundamental flicker noise.
