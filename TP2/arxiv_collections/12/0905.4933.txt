We analyze the One Boson Exchange Potential from the point of view of
Renormalization theory. We show that the nucleon-meson Lagrangean while
predicting the NN force does not predict the NN scattering matrix nor the
deuteron properties unambiguously due to the appearance of short distance
singularities. While the problem has traditionally been circumvented by
introducing vertex functions via phenomenological strong form factors, we
propose to impose physical renormalization conditions on the scattering
amplitude at low energies. Working in the large Nc approximation with
pi,sigma,rho and omega mesons, we show that, once these conditions are applied,
results for low energy phases of proton-neutron scattering as well as deuteron
properties become largely insensitive to the form factors and to the vector
mesons and yield a reasonable agreement with the data, for realistic values of
the coupling constants.
