We review the emerging field of optomechanics, where the radiation pressure
of light circulating inside an optical cavity is employed to cool, manipulate
and read out micro- and nanomechanical oscillators. These systems display a
rich classical nonlinear dynamics and can be used for sensitive detection. Once
they are successfully cooled into the quantum ground state, they promise
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics in a new regime.
