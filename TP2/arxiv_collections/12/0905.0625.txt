A Josephson junction consisting of an Anderson impurity weakly coupled with
two-band and single-band superconductors exposes a time reversal breaking
ground state when the coupling between the two bands exceeds a certain
threshold. The critical regime occurs around local moment formation.
  This indicates a fundamental and distinct role of strong correlations:
Driving a system into a time reversal breaking ground state. One of the
observable consequences is that the impurity magnetization in this phase is
reduced.
