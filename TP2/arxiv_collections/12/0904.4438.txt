According to Moore law, the silicon semiconductor transistor based
information system is facing its physical limitations due to fluctuations of
random charge and leakage current. Molecular electronics is becoming more and
more attractive owing to the advantages of easy molecular structure
variability, flexibility, low-cost and compatibility with bioelectronics. In
this handbook chapter, we reviewed the recent research progress of molecular
electronics, especially the studies on nanoscale information memories, from the
viewpoints of structure-property relationship. Two kinds of molecular systems
including redox dendrimeric thin films and self-assembled molecular monolayers
are discussed in detail. The investigation and application of other molecular
thin films such as polymers, charge transfer salts and Langmuir-Blodgett layers
are also briefly introduced. We suggest that two promising molecular systems
have the most potentials for using as building blocks in nanoscale information
storage. One is single-molecule-based memory device with sub-10 nm
characteristics built on self-assembled monolayer. Multimode information
storage is the other powerful way to make breakthrough in the challenging area
of nanoscale data storage. This relies on further experimental and theoretical
advances. Moreover, a big foreseeable obstacle is how to bridge the big gap
between such novel system and the current bit world.
