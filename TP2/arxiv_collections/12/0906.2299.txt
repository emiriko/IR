We have grown the single crystals of LaAu$_{2}$In$_{4}$ and
CeAu$_{2}$In$_{4}$ by high temperature solution method and report on the
anisotropic magnetic behavior of CeAu$_{2}$In$_{4}$ . The compounds crystallize
in an orthorhombic structure with space group \textit {Pnma}.
LaAu$_{2}$In$_{4}$ shows a Pauli-paramagnetic behavior. CeAu$_{2}$In$_{4}$ do
not order down to 1.8 K. The easy axis of magnetization for CeAu$_{2}$In$_{4}$
is along [010] direction. The magnetization data is analyzed on the basis of
crystalline electric field (CEF) model.
