Using light-induced localized surface plasmon interactions in a metamaterial,
we present a plasmonic control of light absorption for photonic switching. We
discuss that the present surface plasmon-induced photonic switching is
comparable with coherence swapping in a tripod optical system based on
electromagnetically induced transparency. This outcome opens a door to active
controls of the surface plasmons in a metamaterial for potential applications
of nano photonics.
