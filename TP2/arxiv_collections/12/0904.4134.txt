We present AKARI/IRC observations of a sample of six extremely red IRAS
sources, of which three are variable OH/IR stars and the rest are early
post-AGB stars. The OH/IR stars show a red continuum with the expected strong
10 micron silicate absorption feature, while the post-AGB stars show an even
redder continuum accompanied with a comparably weak silicate absorption. We
modelled the spectral energy distributions with DUSTY. While for the OH/IR
stars a reasonable fit can be obtained with almost pure silicate dust, the
post-AGB stars require a mixture of silicate and carbon-rich dust. We assume
that in the latter objects the inner dust shell is carbon-rich, while the outer
shells are still oxygen-rich.
