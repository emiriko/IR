A high-quality single crystal of Ce3Pt23Si11 has been grown using the
Czochralski method. The crystal structure is presented and the chemical
composition has been checked using an electron microprobe analyzer.
Measurements of the electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility
performed at low temperature show a ferromagnetic transition at Tc = 0.44 K.
