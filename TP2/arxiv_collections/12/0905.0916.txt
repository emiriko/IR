The logarithmic triplet model W_2,3 at c=0 is studied. In particular, we
determine the fusion rules of the irreducible representations from first
principles, and show that there exists a finite set of representations,
including all irreducible representations, that closes under fusion. With the
help of these results we then investigate the possible boundary conditions of
the W_2,3 theory. Unlike the familiar Cardy case where there is a consistent
boundary condition for every representation of the chiral algebra, we find that
for W_2,3 only a subset of representations gives rise to consistent boundary
conditions. These then have boundary spectra with non-degenerate two-point
correlators.
