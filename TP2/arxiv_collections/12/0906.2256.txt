An all non-optical method for accurately determining the pulse parameters of
individual few-cycle laser shots is presented. By analyzing the "left" and
"right" asymmetry of high-energy photoelectrons along the polarization axis
using the recently developed quantitative rescattering theory, we show that the
carrier-envelope phase, the pulse duration and the peak intensity of each
single-shot pulse can be readily retrieved. Unlike optical measurements, this
method provides the laser intensity in the interaction region directly.
