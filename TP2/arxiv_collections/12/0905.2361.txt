We summarize our new scanning magnetic 3-D imaging system. This scanning
system uses optically detected magnetic resonance in a single nitrogen vacancy
center in a diamond nanocrystal. The theoretical analysis and the first
experimental demonstrations have proved that this method has single spin
sensitivity and a sub-nanoscale spatial resolution at room temperature.
