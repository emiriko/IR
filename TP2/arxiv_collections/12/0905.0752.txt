Low-energy scattering of $D^*$ and $D_1$ meson are studied using quenched
lattice QCD with improved lattice actions on anisotropic lattices. The
calculation is performed within L\"uscher's finite-size formalism which
establishes the relation between the scattering phase in the infinite volume
and the exact energy level in the finite volume. The threshold scattering
parameters, namely the scattering length $a_0$ and the effective range $r_0$,
for the s-wave scattering in $J^P=0^-$ channel are extracted. After the chiral
and continuum extrapolations, we obtain: $a_0=2.52(47)$fm and $r_0=0.7(1)$fm
where the errors are purely statistical. Based on these results, we discuss the
possibility of a shallow bound state for the two charmed mesons within the
non-relativistic potential scattering model. It is argued that, albeit the
interaction between the two charmed mesons being attractive, it is unlikely
that they can form a shallow bound state in this channel. This calculation
provides some useful information on the nature of the newly discovered
resonance-like structure $Z^+(4430)$ by the Belle Collaboration.
