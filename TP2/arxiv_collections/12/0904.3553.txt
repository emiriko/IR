We measure the projected spatial correlation function w_p(r_p) from a large
sample combining GALEX ultraviolet imaging with the SDSS spectroscopic sample.
We study the dependence of the clustering strength for samples selected on (NUV
- r)_abs color, specific star formation rate (SSFR), and stellar mass. We find
that there is a smooth transition in the clustering of galaxies as a function
of this color from weak clustering among blue galaxies to stronger clustering
for red galaxies. The clustering of galaxies within the "green valley" has an
intermediate strength, and is consistent with that expected from galaxy groups.
The results are robust to the correction for dust extinction. The comparison
with simple analytical modeling suggests that the halo occupation number
increases with older star formation epochs. When splitting according to SSFR,
we find that the SSFR is a more sensitive tracer of environment than stellar
mass.
