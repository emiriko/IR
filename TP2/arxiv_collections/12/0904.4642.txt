We consider quantum spin systems defined on finite sets $V$ equipped with a
metric. In typical examples, $V$ is a large, but finite subset of Z^d. For
finite range Hamiltonians with uniformly bounded interaction terms and a
unique, gapped ground state, we demonstrate a locality property of the
corresponding ground state projector. In such systems, this ground state
projector can be approximated by the product of observables with quantifiable
supports. In fact, given any subset, X, of V the ground state projector can be
approximated by the product of two projections, one supported on X and one
supported on X^c, and a bounded observable supported on a boundary region in
such a way that as the boundary region increases, the approximation becomes
better. Such an approximation was useful in proving an area law in one
dimension, and this result corresponds to a multi-dimensional analogue.
