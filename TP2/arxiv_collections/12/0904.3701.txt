Social Network Analysis (SNA) tries to understand and exploit the key
features of social networks in order to manage their life cycle and predict
their evolution. Increasingly popular web 2.0 sites are forming huge social
network. Classical methods from social network analysis (SNA) have been applied
to such online networks. In this paper, we propose leveraging semantic web
technologies to merge and exploit the best features of each domain. We present
how to facilitate and enhance the analysis of online social networks,
exploiting the power of semantic social network analysis.
