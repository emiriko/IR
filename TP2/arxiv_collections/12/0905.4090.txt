This paper is a sequel to arXiv:0902.2355 and continues the study of quantum
logic via dagger kernel categories. It develops the relation between these
categories and both orthomodular lattices and Foulis semigroups. The relation
between the latter two notions has been uncovered in the 1960s. The current
categorical perspective gives a broader context and reconstructs this
relationship between orthomodular lattices and Foulis semigroups as special
instance.
