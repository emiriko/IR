The notion coexistence of quantum observables was introduced to describe the
possibility of measuring two or more observables together. Here we survey the
various different formalisations of this notion and their connections. We
review examples illustrating the necessary degrees of unsharpness for two
noncommuting observables to be jointly measurable (in one sense of the phrase).
We demonstrate the possibility of measuring together (in another sense of the
phrase) noncoexistent observables. This leads us to a reconsideration of the
connection between joint measurability and noncommutativity of observables and
of the statistical and individual aspects of quantum measurements.
