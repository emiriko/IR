We study the possibility to detect extrasolar planets in M31 through
pixel-lensing observations. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we select the
physical parameters of the binary lens system, a star hosting a planet, and we
calculate the pixel-lensing light curve taking into account the finite source
effects. Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31
microlensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable
planetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the
corresponding Paczy\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary
deviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size
increases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the
required accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary
companion. Although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about $2
M_{\rm {Jupiter}}$, even small mass planets ($M_{\rm P} < 20 M_{\oplus}$) can
cause significant deviations, at least in the observations with large
telescopes. However, even in the former case, the probability to find
detectable planetary features in pixel-lensing light curves is at most a few
percent of the detectable events, and therefore many events have to be
collected in order to detect an extrasolar planet in M31. Our analysis also
supports the claim that the anomaly found in the candidate event PA-99-N2
towards M31 can be explained by a companion object orbiting the lens star.
