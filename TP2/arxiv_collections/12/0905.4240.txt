A new uniform asymptotic approximation for the Wigner $6j$ symbol is given in
terms of Wigner rotation matrices ($d$-matrices). The approximation is uniform
in the sense that it applies for all values of the quantum numbers, even those
near caustics. The derivation of the new approximation is not given, but the
geometrical ideas supporting it are discussed and numerical tests are
presented, including comparisons with the exact $6j$-symbol and with the
Ponzano-Regge approximation.
