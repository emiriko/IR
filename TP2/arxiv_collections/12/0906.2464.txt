Standard parton distribution functions contain neither information on the
correlations between partons nor on their transverse motion, then a vital
knowledge about the three dimensional structure of the nucleon is lost. Hard
exclusive processes, in particular DVCS, are essential reactions to go beyond
this standard picture. In the following, we examine the most recent data from
HERA (at low $x_{Bj}<10^{-2}$) and their impact on GPD models. The most recent
measurements of the Beam Charge Asymmetry by the H1 experiment is discussed.
Perspectives are presented for further measurements of DVCS cross sections at
CERN, within the COMPASS experiment.
