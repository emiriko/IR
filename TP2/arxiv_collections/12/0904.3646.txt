This paper continues description of applications of signed chord length
distribution started in part I (arXiv:0711.4734). It is shown simple relation
between equation for some transfer integrals with source and target bodies and
different geometrical distributions for union of this bodies. The union of
disjoint bodies is always nonconvex object and for such a case derivatives of
correlation function (used for definition of signed radii and chord lengths
distributions) always produce (quasi)densities with negative values. Many
equations used in this part are direct consequences of analogue formulas in
part I.
