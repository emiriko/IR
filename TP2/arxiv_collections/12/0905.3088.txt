We study CP asymmetries in two-body decays of top squarks into neutralinos
and sleptons at the LHC. These asymmetries are used to probe the CP phases
possibly present in the stop and neutralino sector of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. Taking into account bounds from experimental
electric dipole moment searches, we identify areas in the mSUGRA parameter
space where CP asymmetries can be sizeable and discuss the feasibility of their
observation at the LHC. As a result, potentially detectable CP asymmetries in
stop decays at the LHC are found, motivating further detailed experimental
studies for probing SUSY CP phases.
