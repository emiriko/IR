This thesis focuses on the study of the hyperaccreting neutron-star disks and
magnetized accretion flows. It is usually proposed that hyperaccreting disks
surrounding stellar-mass black holes with a huge accretion rate are central
engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, hyperaccretion disks around
neutron stars may exist in some GRB formation scenarios. We study the structure
and neutrino emission of a hyperaccretion disk around a neutron star. We
consider a steady-state hyperaccretion disk, and as a reasonable approximation,
divide it into two regions, the inner and outer disks. The outer disk is
similar to that of a black hole. The inner disk has a self-similar structure,
such as the entropy-conservation or the advection structure, depending on the
energy transfer and emission in the disk. We see that the neutron star disk can
cool more efficiently, produce much higher neutrino luminosity and neutrino
annihilation luminosity than a black hole disk. The neutrino emission from the
neutron star surface boundary layer could increase the neutrino annihilation
luminosity.
  Moreover, we study the effects of a global magnetic field on
viscously-rotating and vertically-integrated accretion disks around compact
objects using a self-similar treatment, and use two methods to study magnetized
flows with convection. We also give a review on GRB progenitors, central
engines and an outlook in this thesis.
