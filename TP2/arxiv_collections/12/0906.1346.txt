Different departments of a large organization often run dedicated cluster
systems for different computing loads, like HPC (high performance computing)
jobs or Web service applications. In this paper, we have designed and
implemented a cloud management system software Phoenix Cloud to consolidate
heterogeneous workloads from different departments affiliated to the same
organization on the shared cluster system. We have also proposed cooperative
resource provisioning and management policies for a large organization and its
affiliated departments, running HPC jobs and Web service applications, to share
the consolidated cluster system. The experiments show that in comparison with
the case that each department operates its dedicated cluster system, Phoenix
Cloud significantly decreases the scale of the required cluster system for a
large organization, improves the benefit of the scientific computing
department, and at the same time provisions enough resources to the other
department running Web services with varying loads.
