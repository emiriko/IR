The physical principles are studied for the optimal design of a quantum
multiwell heterostructure working as an electrostatic energy storage device. We
performed the search for an optimal multiwell trapping potential for electrons
that results in the maximum static palarizability of the system. The response
of the heterostructure is modeled quantum mechanically using nonlocal linear
response theory. Three main design strategies are identified, which lead to the
maximization of the stored energy. We found that the efficiency of each
strategy crucially depends on the temperature and the broadening of electron
levels. The energy density for optimized heterostructures can exceed the
nonoptimized value by a factor more than $400$. These findings provide a basis
for the development of new nanoscale capacitors with high energy density
storage capabilities.
