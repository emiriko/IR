The KLOE experiment at the DA$\Phi$NE $\phi$-factory has performed a new
precise measurement of the pion form factor using Initial State Radiation
events. Results based on an integrated luminosity of 240 pb$^{-1}$ and
extraction of the $\pi\pi$ contribution to $a_\mu$ in the mass range $0.35<
M^2_{\pi\pi}<0.95$ GeV$^2$ are presented. The new value of $a^{\pi\pi}_\mu$ has
smaller statistical and systematic error and is consistent with the KLOE
published value (confirming the current disagreement between the Standard Model
prediction for $a_\mu$ and the measured value).
