We argued in a previous paper [R. A. Vanderveld et al. 2006,
arXiv:astro-ph/0602476] that negative deceleration parameters at the center of
symmetry in Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi cosmological models can only occur if the
model is not smooth at the origin. Here we demonstrate explicitly the
connection between non-smoothness and the failure of positivity theorems for
deceleration. We also address some confusion that has arisen in the literature
and respond to some recent criticisms of our arguments.
