Pairing between fermions that attract each other, reveal itself to the
macroscopic world in the form of superfluidity. Since the discovery of
fermionic superfluidity, intense search has been going on to find various
unconventional forms of fermion pairing as well as to increase the transition
temperature. Here, we show that a two dimensional mixture of single-component
fermions and dipolar bosons allows to reach experimentally feasible superfluid
transition temperatures for non-standard pairing symmetries. Excitations in
these superfluids are anyonic and their statistics depends on the order of
their permutations, i.e is non-Abelian. Our results provide for the first time
an example of a highly tunable system which exhibits various kind of pairing
symmetry and high transition temperature. Additionally, they provide a
playground to observe anyonic excitations and their braiding properties.
