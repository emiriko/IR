The magnetic properties of NaVO2 are investigated using full-potential
linearized augmented plane wave method. We perform calculations for three
structures. For the rhombohedral structure at 100 K, the t2g orbitals of V ions
are split into upper a1g and lower e'g orbitals by a trigonal distortion of
compression. For the monoclinic structure at 91.5 K, the system behaves like a
frustrated spin lattice with spatially anisotropic exchange interactions. For
another monoclinic structure at 20 K, the magnetic frustration is relieved by a
lattice distortion which is driven by a certain orbital ordering, and the
long-range magnetic ordering is thus formed. Moreover, the small magnetic
moment originates from the compensation oforbital moment for the spin moment.
