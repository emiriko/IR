We study numerically some possible vortex configurations in a rotating
cylinder that is tilted with respect to the rotation axis and where different
numbers of vortices can be present at given rotation velocity. In a long
cylinder at small tilt angles the vortices tend to align along the cylinder
axis and not along the rotation axis. We also show that the axial flow along
the cylinder axis, caused by the tilt, will result in the Ostermeier-Glaberson
instability above some critical tilt angle. When the vortices become unstable
the final state often appears to be a dynamical steady state, which may contain
turbulent regions where new vortices are constantly created. These new vortices
push other vortices in regions with laminar flow towards the top and bottom
ends of the cylinder where they finally annihilate. Experimentally the inclined
cylinder could be a convenient environment to create long lasting turbulence
with a polarization which can be adjusted with the tilt angle.
