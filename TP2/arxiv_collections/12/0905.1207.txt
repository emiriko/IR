Recently, a correspondence has been shown to exist between the structure of a
single Standard Model generation of elementary particles and the properties of
the Clifford algebra of nonrelativistic phase space. Here, this correspondence
is spelled out in terms of phase-space variables. Thus, a phase-space
interpretation of the connections between leptons, quarks and their
antiparticles is proposed, in particular providing a timeless alternative to
the standard Stueckelberg-Feynman interpretation. The issue of the additivity
of canonical momenta is raised and argued to be intimately related to the
unobservability of free quarks and the emergence of mesons and baryons.
