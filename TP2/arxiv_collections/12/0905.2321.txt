This paper constructs perfectly matched layers (PML) for a system of 2D
Coupled Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with mixed derivatives which arises
in the modeling of gap solitons in nonlinear periodic structures with a
non-separable linear part. The PML construction is performed in Laplace Fourier
space via a modal analysis and can be viewed as a complex change of variables.
The mixed derivatives cause the presence of waves with opposite phase and group
velocities, which has previously been shown to cause instability of layer
equations in certain types of hyperbolic problems. Nevertheless, here the PML
is stable if the absorption function $\sigma$ lies below a specified threshold.
The PML construction and analysis are carried out for the linear part of the
system. Numerical tests are then performed in both the linear and nonlinear
regimes checking convergence of the error with respect to the layer width and
showing that the PML performs well even in many nonlinear simulations.
