Here we apply high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) using a wide excitation energy range to probe the electronic structure
and the Fermi surface topology of the Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (Tc = 32 K) superconductor.
We find significant deviations in the low energy band structure from that
predicted in calculations. A set of Fermi surface sheets with unexpected
topology is detected at the Brillouin zone boundary. At the X-symmetry point
the Fermi surface is formed by a shallow electron-like pocket surrounded by
four hole-like pockets elongated in G-X and G-Y directions.
