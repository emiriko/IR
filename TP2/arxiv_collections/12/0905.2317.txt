We study confinement property of pure SU(3) gauge theory, combining in this
effort the non-perturbative gluon and ghost propagators obtained as solutions
of Dyson--Schwinger equations with solutions of an integral ladder diagram
summation type equation for the Wilson loop. We obtain the string potential and
effective UV coupling.
