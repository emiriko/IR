The gravitational wave signature from binary black hole coalescences is an
important target for LIGO and VIRGO. The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA)
project brought together the numerical relativity and gravitational wave data
analysis communities, with the goal to optimize the detectability of these
events. In its first instantiation, the NINJA project produced a simulated data
set with numerical waveforms from binary black hole coalescences of various
morphologies (spin, mass ratio, initial conditions), superimposed to Gaussian
colored noise at the design sensitivity for initial LIGO and VIRGO. We analyzed
this simulated data set with the Q-pipeline burst algorithm. This code,
designed for the all-sky detection of gravitational wave bursts with minimal
assumptions on the shape of the waveform, filters the data with a bank of
sine-Gaussians, or sinusoids with Gaussian envelope. The algorithm's
performance was compared to matched filtering with ring-down templates. The
results are qualitatively consistent; however due to the low simulation
statistics in the first NINJA project, it is premature to draw quantitative
conclusions at this stage.
