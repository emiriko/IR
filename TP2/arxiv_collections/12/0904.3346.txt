We review the current status of axions as dark matter. Motivation, models,
constraints and experimental searches are outlined. The axion remains an
excellent candidate for the dark matter and future experiments, particularly
the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX), will cover a large fraction of the
axion parameter space.
