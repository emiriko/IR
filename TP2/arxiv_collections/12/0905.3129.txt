We investigate the roughening of shear cracks running along the interface
between a thin film and a rigid substrate. We demonstrate that short-range
correlated fluctuations of the interface strength lead to self-affine
roughening of the crack front as the driving force (the applied shear
stress/stress intensity factor) increases towards a critical value. We
investigate the disorder-induced perturbations of the crack displacement field
and crack energy, and use the results to determine the crack pinning force and
to assess the shape of the critical crack. The analytical arguments are
validated by comparison with simulations of interface cracking.
