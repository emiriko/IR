Naturalness arguments do not forbid the possibility that the first two
families of squarks and sleptons are heavier than the rest of the
supersymmetric spectrum. In this framework, we study the phenomenology related
to the flavor physics and we give bounds on the flavor violating parameters
that we compare with the case of nearly degenerate squarks. The peculiar
structure of the hierarchical scheme allows us to make definite predictions and
suggests also a natural size for the flavor violating parameters.
