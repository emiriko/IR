We present the results of our Thousand Asteroid Light Curve Survey (TALCS)
conducted with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in September 2006. Our
untargeted survey detected 828 Main Belt asteroids to a limiting magnitude of
g'~22.5 corresponding to a diameter range of 0.4 km <= D <= 10 km. Of these,
278 objects had photometry of sufficient quality to perform rotation period
fits. We debiased the observations and light curve fitting process to determine
the true distribution of rotation periods and light curve amplitudes of Main
Belt asteroids. We confirm a previously reported excess in the fraction of fast
rotators but find a much larger excess of slow rotating asteroids (~15% of our
sample). A few percent of objects in the TALCS size range have large light
curve amplitudes of ~1 mag. Fits to the debiased distribution of light curve
amplitudes indicate that the distribution of triaxial ellipsoid asteroid shapes
is proportional to the square of the axis-ratio, (b/a)^2, and may be bi-modal.
Finally, we find six objects with rotation periods that may be less than 2
hours with diameters between 400 m and 1.5 km, well above the break-up limit
for a gravitationally-bound aggregate. Our debiased data indicate that this
population represents <4% of the Main Belt in the 1-10 km size range.
