We explore the age distribution of the globular cluster (GC) system of the
nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 5128 using ultraviolet (UV) photometry from Galaxy
Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observations, with UV - optical colors used as the
age indicator. Most GCs in NGC 5128 follow the general trends of GCs in M31 and
Milky Way in UV - optical color-color diagram, which indicates that the
majority of GCs in NGC 5128 are old similar to the age range of old GCs in M31
and Milky Way. A large fraction of spectroscopically identified
intermediate-age GC (IAGC) candidates with ~ 3-8 Gyr are not detected in the
FUV passband. Considering the nature of intermediate-age populations being
faint in the far-UV (FUV) passband, we suggest that many of the
spectroscopically identified IAGCs may be truly intermediate in age. This is in
contrast to the case of M31 where a large fraction of spectroscopically
suggested IAGCs are detected in FUV and therefore may not be genuine IAGCs but
rather older GCs with developed blue horizontal branch stars. Our UV photometry
strengthens the results previously suggesting the presence of GC and stellar
subpopulation with intermediate age in NGC 5128. The existence of IAGCs
strongly indicates the occurrence of at least one more major star formation
episode after a starburst at high redshift.
