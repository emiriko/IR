We study the dynamical behavior of a lattice model of glass former on a
random graph, where no corrections to the mean field description are expected.
We find that the behavior of dynamical correlation functions and dynamical
susceptibility are consistent with the quantitative predictions of the Mode
Coupling Theory of the glass transition.
