Examples of test electromagnetic waves on a
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker(FLRW) background are constructed from
explicit perturbations of the FLRW space-times describing gravitational waves
propagating in the isotropic universes. A possible physical mechanism for the
production of the test electromagnetic waves is shown to be the coupling of the
gravitational waves with a test magnetic field, confirming the observation of
Marklund, Dunsby and Brodin [Phys.Rev. D62,101501(R) (2000)].
