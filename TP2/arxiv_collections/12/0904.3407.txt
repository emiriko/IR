Nanoscale 3D surface modifications, by scanning tunneling microscopy under
ambient conditions, of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films have been performed. It was
demonstrated that there are well defined combinations of bias voltages and scan
speeds which allow for controlled surface structuring. Lateral structures with
sizes down to 1.5 nm are possible to obtain. Moreover, it is possible to
reproducibly control the depth of etching with half a unit cell precision,
enabling design of 3D surface structures and control of the surface termination
of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 through etching.
