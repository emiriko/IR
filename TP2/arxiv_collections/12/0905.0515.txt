In this note we prove the a pointwise ergodic theorem for functions taking
values in a separable complete CAT(0)-space, analogous to Lindenstrauss'
pointwise ergodic theorem for real-valued integrable functions on a probability
space subject to a probability-preserving action of an amenable l.c.s.c. group,
where in the CAT(0) setting the role of ergodic averages is played by the
barycentres of the empirical distributions of a CAT(0)-valued map along an
orbit of the group action. The proof rests on an approximation argument and an
appeal to that result for real-valued maps.
