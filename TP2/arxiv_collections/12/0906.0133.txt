Intermolecular forces are known to precipitate adhesion events between solid
bodies. Inspired by a macro-scale experiment showing the hysteretic adhesion of
a piece of flexible tape over a plastic substrate, we develop here a model of
far-field dry adhesion between two flexible sheets interacting via a power-law
potential. We show that phase transitions from unadhered to adhered states
occur as dictated by a dimensionless bending parameter representing the ratio
of interaction strength to bending stiffness. The order of the adhesion
transitions, as well as their hysteretic nature, is shown to depend on the form
of the interaction potential between the flexible sheets. When three or more
sheets interact, additional geometrical considerations determine the
hierarchical or sequential nature of the adhesion transitions.
