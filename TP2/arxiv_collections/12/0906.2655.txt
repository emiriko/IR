Achieving the demanding sensitivity and bandwidth, envisaged for third
generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories, is extremely challenging with
a single broadband interferometer. Very high optical powers (Megawatts) are
required to reduce the quantum noise contribution at high frequencies, while
the interferometer mirrors have to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures in order
to reduce thermal noise sources at low frequencies. To resolve this potential
conflict of cryogenic test masses with high thermal load, we present a
conceptual design for a 2-band xylophone configuration for a third generation
GW observatory, composed of a high-power, high-frequency interferometer and a
cryogenic low-power, low-frequency instrument. Featuring inspiral ranges of
3200Mpc and 38000Mpc for binary neutron stars and binary black holes
coalesences, respectively, we find that the potential sensitivity of xylophone
configurations can be significantly wider and better than what is possible in a
single broadband interferometer.
