We compare localization properties of one-dimensional Frenkel excitons with
Gaussian and Lorentzian uncorrelated diagonal disorder. We focus on the states
of the Lifshits tail, which dominate the optical response and low-temperature
energy transport in molecular J-aggregates. The absence of exchange narrowing
in chains with Lorentzian disorder is shown to manifest itself in the disorder
scaling of the localization length distribution. Also, we show that the local
exciton level structure of the Lifshits tail differs substantially for these
two types of disorder: In addition to the singlets and doublets of localized
states near the bare band edge, strongly resembling those found for Gaussian
disorder, for Lorentzian disorder two other types of states are found in this
energy region as well, namely multiplets of three or four states localized on
the same chain segment and isolated states localized on short segments.
Finally, below the Lifshits tail, Lorentzian disorder induces strongly
localized exciton states, centered around low energy sites, with localization
properties that strongly depend on energy. For Gaussian disorder with a
magnitude that does not exceed the exciton bandwidth, the likelihood to find
such very deep states is exponentially small.
