This Colloquium reviews statistical models for money, wealth, and income
distributions developed in the econophysics literature since the late 1990s. By
analogy with the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of energy in physics, it is shown
that the probability distribution of money is exponential for certain classes
of models with interacting economic agents. Alternative scenarios are also
reviewed. Data analysis of the empirical distributions of wealth and income
reveals a two-class distribution. The majority of the population belongs to the
lower class, characterized by the exponential ("thermal") distribution, whereas
a small fraction of the population in the upper class is characterized by the
power-law ("superthermal") distribution. The lower part is very stable,
stationary in time, whereas the upper part is highly dynamical and out of
equilibrium.
