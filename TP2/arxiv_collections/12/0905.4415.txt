We study the spectroscopic and photometric properties of carbon stars. In the
first paper of this series we focus on objects that can be described by
hydrostatic models neglecting dynamical phenomena like pulsation and mass loss.
As a consequence, the reddening due to circumstellar dust is not included. Our
results are collected in a database, which can be used in conjunction with
stellar evolution and population synthesis calculations involving the AGB. We
have computed a grid of 746 spherically symmetric COMARCS atmospheres covering
effective temperatures between 2400 and 4000K, surface gravities from log(g) =
0.0 to -1.0, metallicities ranging from the solar value down to one tenth of it
and C/O ratios in the interval between 1.05 and 5.0. Subsequently, we used
these models to create synthetic low resolution spectra and photometric data
for a large number of filter systems. The tables including the results are
electronically available. We have selected some of the most commonly used
colours in order to discuss their behaviour as a function of the stellar
parameters. A comparison with measured data shows that down to 2800K the
agreement between predictions and observations of carbon stars is good. Below
this limit the synthetic colours are much too blue. The obvious reason for
these problems is the neglect of circumstellar reddening and structural changes
due to pulsation and mass loss.
