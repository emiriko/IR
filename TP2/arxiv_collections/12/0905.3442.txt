The dynamics of entanglement between two photons with one of them passing
through noisy quantum channels is characterized. It is described by a simple
factorization law which was first theoretically proposed by Konrad {\it et al.}
[Nature Phys., 4, 99 (2008)]. Quantum state tomography process is employed to
reconstruct the reduced density matrixes of the final states and the
corresponding concurrences are calculated. Good fittings between experimental
results and theoretical predictions are found, which imply the validity of the
general factorization law in the characterization of entanglement dynamics.
