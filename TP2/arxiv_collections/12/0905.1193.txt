We have acquired simultaneous high-precision space photometry and radial
velocities of the bright hybrid Beta Cep/SPB pulsator Gamma Peg. Frequency
analyses reveal the presence of six g modes of high radial order together with
eight low-order Beta Cep oscillations in both data sets. Mode identification
shows that all pulsations have spherical degrees l = 0 - 2. An 8.5 solar mass
model reproduces the observed pulsation frequencies; all theoretically
predicted modes are detected. We suggest, contrary to previous authors, that
Gamma Peg is a single star; the claimed orbital variations are due to g-mode
pulsation. Gamma Peg is the first hybrid pulsator for which a sufficiently
large number of high-order g modes and low order p and mixed modes have been
detected and identified to be usable for in-depth seismic modeling.
