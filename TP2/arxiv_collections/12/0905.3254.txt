We propose a technique that allows to simultaneously perform universal
control of the evolution operator and compensate for the first order
contribution of an arbitrary Hermitian constant noise. We show that, at least,
a three-valued Hamiltonian is needed in order to protect the system against any
such noise. This technique is illystrated by an explicit algorithm for a
control sequence that is applied to numerically design a safe two-qubit gate.
