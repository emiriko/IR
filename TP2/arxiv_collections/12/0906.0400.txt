CoO2 is the parent compound for the superconductor NaxCoO2\cdot1.3H2O and was
widely believed to be a Mott insulator. We performed 59Co nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) studies on LixCoO2 (x =
0.35, 0.25, 0.12, and 0.0) to uncover the electronic state and spin
correlations in this series of compounds which was recently obtained through
electrochemical de-intercalation of Li from pristine LiCoO2. We find that
although the antiferromagnetic spin correlations systematically increase with
decreasing Li-content (x), the end member, CoO2 is a non-correlated metal that
well satisfies the Korringa relation for a Fermi liquid. Thus, CoO2 is not
simply located at the limit of x->0 for AxCoO2 (A = Li, Na) compounds. The
disappearance of the electron correlations in CoO2 is due to the three
dimensionality of the compound which is in contrast to the highly two
dimensional structure of AxCoO2.
