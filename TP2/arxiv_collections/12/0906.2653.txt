Measurement results of the acoustoelectric effects (surface acoustic waves
(SAW) attenuation and velocity) in a high-mobility $p$-SiGe/Ge/SiGe structure
are presented. The structure was LEPECVD grown with a two dimensional (2D)
channel buried in the strained Ge layer. The measurements were performed as a
function of temperature (1.5 - 4.2 K) and magnetic field (up to 8.4 T) at
different SAW intensities at frequencies 28 and 87 MHz. Shubnikov-de Haas-like
oscillations of both SAW attenuation and the velocity change have been
observed. Hole density and mobility, effective mass, quantum and transport
relaxation times, as well as the Dingle temperature were measured with a method
free of electric contacts. The effect of heating of the 2D hole gas by the
electric field of the SAW was investigated. Energy relaxation time
$\tau_{\varepsilon}$ and the deformation potential constant determined.
