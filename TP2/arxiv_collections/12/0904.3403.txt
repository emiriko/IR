The lower solar atmosphere consists of partially ionized turbulent plasmas
harbouring velocity field, magnetic field and current density fluctuations. The
correlations amongst these small scale fluctuations give rise to large scale
flows and magnetic fields which decisively affect all transport processes. The
three fluid system consisting of electrons, ions and neutral particles supports
nonideal effects such as the Hall effect and the ambipolar diffusion. Here, we
study magnetic transport by ambipolar diffusion and compare the characteristic
timescales of the laminar and the turbulent ambipolar diffusion processes. As
expected from a turbulent transport process, the time scale of the turbulent
ambipolar diffusion is found to be smaller by orders of magnitude as compared
with the laminar ambipolar diffusion.The nonlinearity of the laminar ambipolar
diffusion creates magnetic structures with sharp gradients which are amenable
to processes such as magnetic reconnection and energy release therefrom for
heating and flaring of the solar plasma.
