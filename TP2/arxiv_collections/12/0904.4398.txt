By means of self-consistent 3D MHD numerical simulations, we analyze
magnetized solar-like stellar winds and their dependence on the plasma-beta
parameter. We adopt in our simulations a heating parameter described by gamma,
which is responsible for the thermal acceleration of the wind. We analyze winds
with polar magnetic field intensities ranging from 1 to 20G. We show that the
wind structure presents characteristics that are similar to the solar coronal
wind. The steady-state magnetic field topology for all cases is similar,
presenting a configuration of helmet streamer-type, with zones of closed field
lines and open field lines coexisting. Higher magnetic field intensities lead
to faster and hotter winds. The increase of the field intensity generates a
larger dead zone in the wind, i. e., the closed loops that inhibit matter to
escape from latitudes lower than ~45 degrees extend farther away from the star.
The Lorentz force leads naturally to a latitude-dependent wind. We show that by
increasing the density and maintaining B0=20G, the system recover back to
slower and cooler winds. For a fixed gamma, we show that the key parameter in
determining the wind velocity profile is the beta-parameter at the coronal
base. Therefore, there is a group of magnetized flows that would present the
same terminal velocity despite of its thermal and magnetic energy densities, as
long as the plasma-beta parameter is the same. This degeneracy, however, can be
removed if we compare other physical parameters of the wind, such as the
mass-loss rate. We analyze the influence of gamma in our results and we show
that it is also important in determining the wind structure. (Abridged)
