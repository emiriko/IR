Quantum mechanics has predicted many counterintuitive phenomena in daily
life, and has changed our view of the world. Among such predictions, the
existence of a macroscopic object in superposition is especially unbelievable.
As Einstein asked, "Do you really believe that the moon exists only when you
look at it?". However, recent experimental results on a mesoscopic scale will
ultimately require us to dismiss commonsense so-called macroscopic reality.
Leggett and Garg applied the Bell scheme for testing local realism to the time
evolution of a macroscopic two-state system, and proposed a temporal version of
the Bell inequality (the Leggett-Garg (LG) inequality) for testing macroscopic
realism. However, as with the Bell inequality, the statistical approach behind
this scheme may be less effective in showing clear incompatibility. Here we
propose a temporal version of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) scheme
without statistical treatment for testing Einstein's moon using three-time
correlations.
