Both CDF and D{\O}experiments have been searching for evidence of physics
beyond the standard model (SM) using the Tevatron $p\bar{p}$ collider at
Fermilab. We report on recent searches in the $B$ flavor sector, especially
decays via flavor changing neutral current processes (FCNC), $B^0_{(s)} \to
e^+\mu^-$ and $B^0_{s} to \mu^+ \mu^-$, at the Tevatron.
