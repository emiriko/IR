In recent experiments ultra-relativistic femtosecond electron bunches were
generated by a Laser Wakefield Accelerator (LWFA) in different regimes. Here we
predict that even attosecond bunches can be generated by an LWFA due to the
fast betatron phase mixing within a femtosecond electron bunch. The attosecond
bunches are stable outside the LWFA and can propagate in vacuum many tens of
centimeter without significant change in their duration. Our calculations show
that evidence for the formation of attosecond bunches can be found in the
spectrum of coherent betatron radiation from LWFA's.
