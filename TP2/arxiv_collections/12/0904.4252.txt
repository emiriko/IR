(Abridged) We introduce a novel technique to construct spatially resolved
maps of stellar mass surface density in galaxies based on optical and near IR
imaging. We use optical/NIR colour(s) to infer effective stellar mass-to-light
ratios (M/L) at each pixel, which are then multiplied by the surface brightness
to obtain the local stellar surface mass density. We build look-up tables to
express M/L as a function of colour(s) by marginalizing over a Monte Carlo
library of 50,000 stellar population synthesis (SPS) models by Charlot &
Bruzual (2007), which include a revised prescription for the TP-AGB stellar
evolutionary phase, with a wide range of dust exinctions. In order to extract
reliable flux and colour information at any position in the galaxy, we perform
a median adaptive smoothing of the images that preserves the highest possible
spatial resolution. As the most practical and robust, and hence fiducial
method, we express the M/L in the H band as a function of (g-i) and (i-H).
Stellar mass maps computed in this way have a typical accuracy of 30 per cent
or less at any given pixel, determined from the scatter in the models. We
compare maps obtained with our fiducial method with those derived using other
combinations of bandpasses and the old BC03 TP-AGB prescription. Finally, we
compare total stellar mass estimates obtained by integrating resolved mass maps
with those obtained with unresolved photometry. In galaxies with evident dust
lanes, unresolved estimates may miss up to 40 per cent of the total stellar
mass because dusty regions are strongly under-represented in the luminous
fluxes.
