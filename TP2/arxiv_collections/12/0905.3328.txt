The thermally induced denaturation of DNA in the presence of attractive solid
surface is studied. The two strands of DNA are modeled via two coupled flexible
chains without volume interactions. If the two strands are adsorbed on the
surface, the denaturation phase-transition disappears. Instead, there is a
smooth crossover to a weakly naturated state. Our second conclusion is that
even when the inter-strand attraction alone is too weak for creating a
naturated state at the given temperature, and also the surface-strand
attraction alone is too weak for creating an adsorbed state, the combined
effect of the two attractions can lead to a naturated and adsorbed state.
