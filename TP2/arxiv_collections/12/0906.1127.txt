We investigate a chiral d-density wave (CDDW) mean field Hamiltonian in
momentum space for the under-doped YBCO. We consider the commensurate density
wave order which doubles the unit cell of the real space lattice and derive an
expression for entropy in the CDDW state in the absence of magnetic field. We
show that the transition to CDDW state gives rise to the occurrence of
discontinuities in the entropy density difference between the CDDW state and
the normal state at eight points(Hot spots) on the boundary of the reduced
Brillouin zone. The chirality induced anomalous Nernst signal is shown to arise
mainly from the points close to these Hot spots and not from the hole pockets
as reported by the previous authors. We also show the possibility of quantum
oscillations in the specific heat for the system under consideration in the
presence of a changing magnetic field.
