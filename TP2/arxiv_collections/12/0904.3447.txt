The coefficients of dispersion, D_{ij}, and the dispersivity, a_{ijkl},
appear in the expression for the flux of a solute in saturated flow through
porous media. We present a detailed analysis of these tensors in an axially
symmetric porous medium and show that in such a medium, the dispersivity is
governed by 6 independent moduli. We present also the constraints that have to
be satisfied by these moduli. We also show that at least two independent
experiments are required in order to obtain the values of these coefficients
for any three-dimensional porous medium domain.
