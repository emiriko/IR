We explore the role played by the intrinsic decoherence in superconducting
charge qubits in the presence of a microwave field applied as a magnetic flux.
We study how the delayed creation of entanglement, which is opposite to the
sudden death of entanglement, can be induced. We compute the time evolution of
the population inversion, total correlation and entanglement, taking into
account the junction mixed state and dissipation of the cavity field. We show
that although decoherence destroys the correlation of the junction and field,
information of the initial state may be obtained via quasi-probability
distribution functions.
