A new phase space criterion, encoding the physically motivated behavior of
coincidence arrangements of local observables, is proposed in this work. This
condition entails, in particular, uniqueness and purity of the energetically
accessible vacuum states. It is shown that the qualitative part of this new
criterion is equivalent to a compactness condition proposed in the literature.
Its novel quantitative part is verified in massive free field theory.
