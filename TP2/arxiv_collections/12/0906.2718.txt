I develop the decision-theoretic approach to quantum probability, originally
proposed by David Deutsch, into a mathematically rigorous proof of the Born
rule in (Everett-interpreted) quantum mechanics. I sketch the argument
informally, then prove it formally, and lastly consider a number of proposed
``counter-examples'' to show exactly which premises of the argument they
violate.
