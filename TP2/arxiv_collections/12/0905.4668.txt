Sufficient conditions for wave breaking are found for the short-pulse
equation describing wave packets of few cycles on the ultra-short pulse scale.
The analysis relies on the method of characteristics and conserved quantities
of the short-pulse equation and holds both on an infinite line and in a
periodic domain. Numerical illustrations of the finite-time wave breaking are
given in a periodic domain.
