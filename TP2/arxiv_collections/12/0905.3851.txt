We compare weak and strong coupling theory of counterion-mediated
electrostatic interactions between two asymmetrically charged plates with
extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. Analytical results in both weak and strong
coupling limits compare excellently with simulations in their respective
regimes of validity. The system shows a surprisingly rich structure in terms of
interactions between the surfaces as well as fundamental qualitative
differences in behavior in the weak and the strong coupling limits.
