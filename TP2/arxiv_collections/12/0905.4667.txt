We show that a non-equilibrium diffusive dynamics in a finite-dimensional
space takes in the Lagrangian frame of its mean local velocity an equilibrium
form with the detailed balance property. This explains the equilibrium nature
of the fluctuation-dissipation relations in that frame observed previously. The
general considerations are illustrated on few examples of stochastic particle
dynamics.
