Burst-only sources are X-ray sources showing up only during short bursts but
with no persistent emission (at least with the monitoring instrument which led
to their discovery). These bursts have spectral characteristics consistent with
thermonuclear (type I) burst from the neutron star surface, linking burst-only
sources to neutron star X-ray binary transients. We have carried out a series
of snapshot observations of the entire sample of burst-only sources with the
Swift satellite. We found a few sources in outburst and detect faint candidates
likely representing their quiescent counterparts. In addition, we observed
three quasi-persistent faint X-ray binary transients. Finally we discuss
burst-only sources and quasi-persistent sources in the framework of neutron
star transients.
