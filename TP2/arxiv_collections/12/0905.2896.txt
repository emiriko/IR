We present a new framework for radiation hydrodynamics simulations. Gas
dynamics is modelled by the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method,
whereas radiation transfer is simulated via a time-dependent Monte-Carlo
approach that traces photon packets. As a first step in the development of the
method, in this paper we consider the momentum transfer between radiation field
and gas, which is important for systems where radiation pressure is high. There
is no fundamental limitations on the number of radiation sources, geometry or
the optical depth of the problems that can be studied with the method. However,
as expected for any Monte-Carlo transfer scheme, stochastic noise presents a
serious limitation. We present a number of tests that show that the errors of
the method can be estimated accurately by considering Poisson noise
fluctuations in the number of photon packets that SPH particles interact with
per dynamical time. It is found that for a reasonable accuracy the momentum
carried by photon packets must be much smaller than a typical momentum of SPH
particles. We discuss numerical limitations of the code, and future steps that
can be taken to improve performance and applicability of the method.
