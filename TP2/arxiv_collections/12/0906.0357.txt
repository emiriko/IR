A class of local SU(2)-invariant spin-1/2 Hamiltonians is studied that has
ground states within the space of nearest neighbor valence bond states on the
kagome lattice. Cases include "generalized Klein'' models without obvious
non-valence bond ground states, as well as a "resonating-valence-bond"
Hamiltonian whose unique ground states within the nearest neighbor valence bond
space are four topologically degenerate "Sutherland-Rokhsar-Kivelson'' (SRK)
type wavefunctions, which are expected to describe a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin
liquid. The proof of this uniqueness is intimately related to the linear
independence of the nearest neighbor valence bond states on quite general and
arbitrarily large kagome lattices, which is also established in this work. It
is argued that the SRK ground states are also unique within the entire Hilbert
space, depending on properties of the generalized Klein models. Applications of
the strategies developed in this work to other lattice types are also
discussed.
