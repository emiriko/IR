The scaled momentum distributions of charged particles in jets have been
measured for dijet photoproduction with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an
integrated luminosity of 359 pb-1. The distributions are compared to
predictions based on perturbative QCD carried out in the framework of the
modified leading-logarithmic approximation (MLLA) and assuming local
parton-hadron duality (LPHD). The universal MLLA scale, Lambda_eff, and the
LPHD parameter, kappa^ch, are extracted.
