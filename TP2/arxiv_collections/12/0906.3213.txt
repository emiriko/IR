This talk advocates intrinsic universality as a notion to identify simple
cellular automata with complex computational behavior. After an historical
introduction and proper definitions of intrinsic universality, which is
discussed with respect to Turing and circuit universality, we discuss
construction methods for small intrinsically universal cellular automata before
discussing techniques for proving non universality.
