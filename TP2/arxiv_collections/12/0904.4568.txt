We develop the deformation theory of hyperbolic cone-3-manifolds with
cone-angles less than $2\pi$, i.e. contained in the interval $(0,2\pi)$. In the
present paper we focus on deformations keeping the topological type of the
cone-manifold fixed. We prove local rigidity for such structures. This gives a
positive answer to a question of A. Casson.
