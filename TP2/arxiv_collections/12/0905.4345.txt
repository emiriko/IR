The data sample recorded with the Belle detector at the KEKB B factory
(Tsukuba, Japan) operating at the Y(5S) energy provides interesting and new
results about the Bs0 mesons and the Y(5S) resonance. Recent analyses, based on
data samples collected at the Y(5S) resonance (23.6 /fb) or near it (7.9 /fb),
are presented with a special focus on the final results on the Bs0 ->Ds- pi+
and Bs0 -> Ds-/+ K+/- decays, and on the intriguing Y(5S) -> Y(nS) pi+ pi-
measurements.
