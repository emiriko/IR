The Bloch sphere is a familiar and useful geometrical picture of the dynamics
of a single spin or two-level system's quantum evolution. The analogous
geometrical picture for three-level systems is presented, with several
applications. The relevant SU(3) group and su(3) algebra are eight-dimensional
objects and are realized in our picture as two four-dimensional manifolds
describing the time evolution operator. The first, called the base manifold, is
the counterpart of the S^2 Bloch sphere, whereas the second, called the fiber,
generalizes the single U(1) phase of a single spin. Now four-dimensional, it
breaks down further into smaller objects depending on alternative
representations that we discuss. Geometrical phases are also developed and
presented for specific applications. Arbitrary time-dependent couplings between
three levels or between two spins (qubits) with SU(3) Hamiltonians can be
conveniently handled through these geometrical objects.
