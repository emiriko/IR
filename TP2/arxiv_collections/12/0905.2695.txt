Local-box hydrodynamical model atmospheres provide statistical information
about a star's emergent radiation field which allows one to predict the level
of its granulation-related micro-variability. Space-based photometry is now
sufficiently accurate to test model predictions. We aim to model the
photometric granulation background of HD49933 as well as the Sun, and compare
the predictions to the measurements obtained by the COROT and SOHO satellite
missions. We construct hydrodynamical model atmospheres representing HD49933
and the Sun, and use a previously developed scaling technique to obtain the
observable disk-integrated brightness fluctuations. We further performed
exploratory magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to gauge the impact of small
scale magnetic fields on the synthetic light-curves. We find that the
granulation-related brightness fluctuations depend on metallicity. We obtain a
satisfactory correspondence between prediction and observation for the Sun,
validating our approach. For HD49933, we arrive at a significant
over-estimation by a factor of two to three in total power. Locally generated
magnetic fields are unlikely to be responsible, otherwise existing fields would
need to be rather strong to sufficiently suppress the granulation signal.
Presently suggested updates on the fundamental stellar parameters do not
improve the correspondence; however, an ad-hoc increase of the HD49933 surface
gravity by about 0.2dex would eliminate most of the discrepancy. We diagnose a
puzzling discrepancy between the predicted and observed granulation background
in HD49933, with only rather ad-hoc ideas for remedies at hand.
