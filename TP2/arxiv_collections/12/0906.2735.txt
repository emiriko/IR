Using new results on the separability properties of bosonic systems, we
provide a new complete criterion for separability. This criterion aims at
characterizing the set of separable states from the inside by means of a
sequence of efficiently solvable semidefinite programs. We apply this method to
derive arbitrarily good approximations to the optimal measure-and-prepare
strategy in generic state estimation problems. Finally, we report its
performance in combination with the criterion developed by Doherty et al. [1]
for the calculation of the entanglement robustness of a relevant family of
quantum states whose separability properties were unknown.
