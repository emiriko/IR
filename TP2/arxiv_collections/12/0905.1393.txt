We use a method of linearization to study the emergence of the future
cosmological singularity characterized by finite value of the cosmological
radius. We uncover such singularities that keep Hubble parameter finite while
making all higher derivatives of the scale factor (starting out from the $\ddot
a$) diverge as the cosmological singularity is approached. Since such
singularities has been obtained before in the brane world model we name them
the "brane-like" singularities. These singularities can occur during the
expanding phase in usual Friedmann universe filled with both a self-acting,
minimally coupled scalar field and a homogeneous tachyon field. We discover a
new type of finite-time, future singularity which is different from type I-IV
cosmological singularities in that it has the scale factor, pressure and
density finite and nonzero. The generalization of $w$-singularity is obtained
as well.
