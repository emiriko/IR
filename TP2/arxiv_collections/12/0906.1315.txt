Using e+e- collision data in the sqrt{s} = 4 GeV energy region, CLEO-c has
made extensive studies of semileptonic and leptonic decays of the D0, D+, and
Ds+ charmed mesons. We report recent measurements of absolute branching
fractions, form factors, and decay constants that serve as precision tests of
theoretical calculations.
