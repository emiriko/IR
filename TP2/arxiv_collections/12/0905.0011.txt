The Boltzmann factor comes from the linear change in entropy of an infinite
heat bath during a local fluctuation; small systems have significant nonlinear
terms. We present theoretical arguments, experimental data, and Monte-Carlo
simulations indicating that nonlinear terms may also occur when a particle
interacts directly with a finite number of neighboring particles, forming a
local region that fluctuates independent of the infinite bath. A possible
mechanism comes from the net force necessary to change the state of a particle
while conserving local momentum. These finite-sized local regions yield
nonlinear fluctuation constraints, beyond the Boltzmann factor. One such
fluctuation constraint applied to simulations of the Ising model lowers the
energy, makes the entropy extensive, and greatly improves agreement with the
corrections to scaling measured in ferromagnetic materials and critical fluids.
