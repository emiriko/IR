We present accretion rates obtained from three-dimensional self-gravitating
radiation hydrodynamical models of giant planet growth. We investigate the
dependence of accretion rates upon grain opacity and core/protoplanet mass. The
accretion rates found for low mass cores are inline with the results of
previous one-dimensional models that include radiative transfer.
