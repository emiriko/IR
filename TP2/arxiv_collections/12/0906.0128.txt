We investigate the enhanced microwave transmission through the array of
metallic coaxial annular apertures (MCAAs) experimentally and theoretically.
The even-mode and the odd-mode surface resonances are clarified from the
spatial field distributions and the dispersion diagram. The impact of local
resonance is thoroughly embodied in the even-mode surface resonant states,
while the odd-mode surface resonances are scaled by periodicity, invariant to
different local geometry of the unit cell, and invisible in measurements. The
enhanced transmission is the collective selections on the interplay between the
local resonances and the evanescent Bloch wave channels on the surface.
Transmission measurements for different inner diameter of the apertures show
that the transmissivity extrema with respect to the specific angles precisely
correspond to the degenerate points in the dispersion diagram of surface
resonances.
