We investigate several aspects of the correlations reported by the Pierre
Auger Observatory between the highest energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and galaxies
in the Veron-Cetty Veron (VCV) catalog of AGNs. First, we quantify the extent
of the inhomogeneity and impurity of the VCV catalog. Second, we determine how
the correlation between the highest energy Auger UHECRs and VCV galaxies is
modified when only optically-identified AGNs are used. Finally, we measure the
correlation between the published Auger UHECRs and the distribution of matter.
Our most important finding is that the correlation between UHECRs and AGNs is
too strong to be explained purely by AGNs tracing the large scale distribution
of matter, indicating that (barring the correlation being a statistical fluke)
some substantial fraction of UHECRs are produced by AGNs. We also find that
once we take into account the heavy oversampling of the VCV catalog in the
Virgo region, the lack of UHECR events from that region is not incompatible
with UHECR having AGN sources.
