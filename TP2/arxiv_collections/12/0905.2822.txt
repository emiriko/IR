The hole states in the valence band of a large class of semiconductors are
degenerate in the projections of angular momentum. Here we show that the
switching of a hole between the states can efficiently be realized by acoustic
solitons. The microscopic mechanism of such a state conversion is related to
the valence band splitting by local elastic strain. The conversion is studied
here for heavy holes localized at shallow and deep acceptors in silicon quantum
wells.
