We study flavor violating processes in the production or decay of a neutral
pseudoscalar meson $P^0$ in the framework of a general two Higgs Doublet Model
type III (2HDM-III). We use a version of the model where Yukawa interactions of
neutral Higgs bosons allow for flavor change at the tree-level, but conserves
CP symmetry. We focus on all possible $\tau^{\pm} \to l^{\pm}P^0 $ and $P^0 \to
l^+l'^-$ decay channels, where $l,l'$ are charged leptons. We find that these
processes provide complementary information on quark and lepton FCNC Yukawa
couplings. In particular flavor violating parameters in the quark sector,
$\chi_{sb}$ and $\chi_{db}$, are significantly constrained by present
experimental data, whereas the corresponding parameters in the leptonic sector
are less constrained.
