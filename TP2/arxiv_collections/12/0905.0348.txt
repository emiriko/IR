We investigated the superhump evolution, analysing optical photometric
observations of the 2000 February-March, the 2002 October-November, and the
2006 September superoutbursts of SW UMa. The superhumps evolved in the same way
after their appearance during the 2000 and the 2002 superoutbursts, and
probably during the 2006 one. This indicates that the superhump evolution may
be governed by the invariable binary parameters. We detected a periodicity in
light curve after the end of the 2000 superoutburst without phase shift, which
seems to be the remains of the superhumps. We found QPOs at the end stage of
the 2000 and the 2002 superoutbursts, but failed to find extraordinarily
large-amplitude QPOs called `super-QPOs' which previously have been observed in
SW UMa.
