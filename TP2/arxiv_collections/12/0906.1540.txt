Electron-positron pair production is considered in the relativistic collision
of a nucleus and an anti-nucleus, in which both leptons are created in bound
states of the corresponding nucleus-lepton system. Compared to free and
bound-free pair production this process is shown to display a qualitatively
different dependency both on the impact energy and charged of the colliding
particles. Interestingly, at high impact energies the cross section for this
process is found to be larger than that for the analogous atomic process of
non-radiative electron capture although the latter does not involve the
creation of new particles.
