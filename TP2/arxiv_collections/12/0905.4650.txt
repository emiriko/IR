We prove that, in the Gilbert model for a random geometric graph, almost
every graph becomes Hamiltonian exactly when it first becomes 2-connected. This
answers a question of Penrose. We also show that in the k-nearest neighbor
model, there is a constant \kappa\ such that almost every \kappa-connected
graph has a Hamilton cycle.
