This summary of the Workshop "Beyond the 3-generation SM in the LHC era"
presents a brief discussion of the following four statements about the fourth
generation: 1) It is not excluded by EW precision data; 2) It addresses some of
the currently open questions; 3) It can accommodate emerging possible hints of
new physics; 4) LHC has the potential to discover or fully exclude it.
