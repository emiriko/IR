The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Regional Radio Conference
(RRC06) established in 2006 a new frequency plan for the introduction of
digital broadcasting in European, African, Arab, CIS countries and Iran. The
preparation of the plan involved complex calculations under short deadline and
required dependable and efficient computing capability. The ITU designed and
deployed in-situ a dedicated PC farm, in parallel to the European Organization
for Nuclear Research (CERN) which provided and supported a system based on the
EGEE Grid. The planning cycle at the RRC06 required a periodic execution in the
order of 200,000 short jobs, using several hundreds of CPU hours, in a period
of less than 12 hours. The nature of the problem required dynamic
workload-balancing and low-latency access to the computing resources. We
present the strategy and key technical choices that delivered a reliable
service to the RRC06.
