We study the effects of a time-varying gravitomagnetic field on the motion of
test particles. Starting from recent results, we consider the gravitomagnetic
field of a source whose spin angular momentum has a linearly time-varying
magnitude. The acceleration due to such a time-varying gravitomagnetic field is
considered as a perturbation of the Newtonian motion, and we explicitly
evaluate the effects of this perturbation on the Keplerian elements of a closed
orbit. The theoretical predictions are compared with actual astronomical and
astrophysical scenarios, both in the solar system and in binary pulsars
systems, in order to evaluate the impact of these effects on real systems.
