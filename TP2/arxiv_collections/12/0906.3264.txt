In this talk it is shown a way for constructing magnetic surface sources for
stationary axisymmetric electrovac spacetimes possessing a non-smooth
electromagnetic Ernst potential. The magnetic moment density is related to this
lack of smoothness and its calculation involves solving a linear elliptic
differential equation. As an application the results are used for constructing
a magnetic source for the Kerr-Newman field.
