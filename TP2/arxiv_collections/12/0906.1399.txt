An open problem in communication complexity proposed by several authors is to
prove that for every Boolean function f, the task of computing f(x AND y) has
polynomially related classical and quantum bounded-error complexities. We solve
a variant of this question. For every f, we prove that the task of computing,
on input x and y, both of the quantities f(x AND y) and f(x OR y) has
polynomially related classical and quantum bounded-error complexities. We
further show that the quantum bounded-error complexity is polynomially related
to the classical deterministic complexity and the block sensitivity of f. This
result holds regardless of prior entanglement.
