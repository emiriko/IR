An infinite family of finite axisymmetric charged dust disks is presented.
The disks are obtained by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations for
conformastatic spacetimes by assuming a functional dependency between the
time-like component of the electromagnetic potential and the metric potential
in terms of a solution of the Laplace equation. We give solutions to the
Einstein-Maxwell equations with disk sources of finite extension in which the
charge density is proportional to the energy surface density. We apply the
well-know "inverse" approach to the gravitational potential representing finite
thin disks given by Gonzalez and Reina to generate conformastatic charged dust
thin discs. Exact examples of conformastatic metrics with disk sources are
worked out in full.
