We report spin polarized density functional calculations of ferromagnetic
properties of a series of ZnO clusters and solid containing one or two
substitutional carbon impurities. We analyze the eigen value spectra, spin
densities and molecular orbitals, and induced magnetic moments for ZnC,
Zn$_{2}$C, Zn$_{2}$OC, carbon substituted clusters Zn$_{n}$O$_{n}$ (n=3--10,
12) and ZnO solid. The results show that the doping induces magnetic moment of
the $\sim$2 $\mu_{B}$ in all the cases. All the systems with two carbon
impurities show ferromagnetic interaction except when the carbon atoms share
the same Zn atom as the nearest neighbor. This ferromagnetic interaction is
predominantly mediated via $\pi$ bonds in ring structures and through $\pi$ and
$\sigma$ bonds in three dimensional structure. The calculations also show that
the interaction is significantly enhanced in solid, bringing out the role of
dimensionality of Zn-O network connecting two carbon atoms.
