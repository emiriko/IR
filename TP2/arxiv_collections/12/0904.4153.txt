The magnetic shielding $\sigma$ of $^3$He is studied. The complete
relativistic corrections of order $O(\alpha^2)$, leading QED corrections of
order $O(\alpha^3 \ln\alpha)$, and finite nuclear mass effects of order
$O(m/m_{\rm N})$ are calculated with high numerical precision. The resulting
theoretical predictions for $\sigma = 59.967~43(10)\cdot 10^{-6}$ are the most
accurate to date among all elements and support the use of $^3$He as a NMR
standard.
