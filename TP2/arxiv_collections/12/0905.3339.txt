We analyze the scattering of a planar monochromatic electromagnetic wave
incident upon a Schwarzschild black hole. We obtain accurate numerical results
from the partial wave method for the electromagnetic scattering cross section,
and show that they are in excellent agreement with analytical approximations.
The scattering of electromagnetic waves is compared with the scattering of
scalar, spinor and gravitational waves. We present a unified picture of the
scattering of all massless fields for the first time.
