Initial reactions involved in the bacterial degradation of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) include a ring-dihydroxylation catalyzed by a
dioxygenase and a subsequent oxidation of the dihydrodiol products by a
dehydrogenase. In this study, the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from the
PAH-degrading Sphingomonas strain CHY-1 has been characterized. The bphB gene
encoding PAH dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (PDDH) was cloned and overexpressed as a
His-tagged protein. The recombinant protein was purified as a homotetramer with
an apparent Mr of 110,000. PDDH oxidized the cis-dihydrodiols derived from
biphenyl and eight polycyclic hydrocarbons, including chrysene,
benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyene, to corresponding catechols. Remarkably,
the enzyme oxidized pyrene 4,5-dihydrodiol, whereas pyrene is not metabolized
by strain CHY-1. The PAH catechols produced by PDDH rapidly auto-oxidized in
air but were regenerated upon reaction of the o-quinones formed with NADH.
Kinetic analyses performed under anoxic conditions revealed that the enzyme
efficiently utilized two- to four-ring dihydrodiols, with Km values in the
range of 1.4 to 7.1 $\mu$M, and exhibited a much higher Michaelis constant for
NAD+ (Km of 160 $\mu$M). At pH 7.0, the specificity constant ranged from (1.3
$\pm$ 0.1) x 106 M?1 s?1 with benz[a]anthracene 1,2-dihydrodiol to (20.0 $\pm$
0.8) x 106 M?1 s?1 with naphthalene 1,2-dihydrodiol. The catalytic activity of
the enzyme was 13-fold higher at pH 9.5. PDDH was subjected to inhibition by
NADH and by 3,4-dihydroxyphenanthrene, and the inhibition patterns suggested
that the mechanism of the reaction was ordered Bi Bi. The regulation of PDDH
activity appears as a means to prevent the accumulation of PAH catechols in
bacterial cells.
