We examine few simple extremal black hole configurations of N=8, d=4
supergravity. We first elucidate the relation between the BPS
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and the non-BPS Kaluza-Klein dyonic black hole.
Their classical entropy, given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, can be
reproduced via the attractor mechanism by suitable choices of symplectic frame.
Then, we display the embedding of the axion-dilaton black hole into N=8
supergravity.
