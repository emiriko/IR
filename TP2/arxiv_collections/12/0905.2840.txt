The large values of the transverse single spin asymmetry, A_N, seen in
forward pi0 production from polarized proton collisions have stimulated
important questions and have been studied in QCD based transverse spin models.
We report the first RHIC measurement of A_N for the two photon mass region of
the eta meson. The eta peak for meson energies greater than 50 GeV (Feynman x_F
>0.5) was observed in the STAR Forward Pion Detectors, along with pi0 mesons,
at pseudo-rapidity of 3.65 in sqrt{s}=200 GeV pp collisions. The pi0 transverse
asymmetry, which has already been reported in detail by the STAR collaboration,
is compared to the transverse asymmetry in the eta mass region. The surprising
observation is that in this kinematic region, the eta asymmetry is larger than
the already large pi0 asymmetry.
