Compressed sensing has a wide range of applications that include error
correction, imaging, radar and many more. Given a sparse signal in a high
dimensional space, one wishes to reconstruct that signal accurately and
efficiently from a number of linear measurements much less than its actual
dimension. Although in theory it is clear that this is possible, the difficulty
lies in the construction of algorithms that perform the recovery efficiently,
as well as determining which kind of linear measurements allow for the
reconstruction. There have been two distinct major approaches to sparse
recovery that each present different benefits and shortcomings. The first,
L1-minimization methods such as Basis Pursuit, use a linear optimization
problem to recover the signal. This method provides strong guarantees and
stability, but relies on Linear Programming, whose methods do not yet have
strong polynomially bounded runtimes. The second approach uses greedy methods
that compute the support of the signal iteratively. These methods are usually
much faster than Basis Pursuit, but until recently had not been able to provide
the same guarantees. This gap between the two approaches was bridged when we
developed and analyzed the greedy algorithm Regularized Orthogonal Matching
Pursuit (ROMP). ROMP provides similar guarantees to Basis Pursuit as well as
the speed of a greedy algorithm. Our more recent algorithm Compressive Sampling
Matching Pursuit (CoSaMP) improves upon these guarantees, and is optimal in
every important aspect.
