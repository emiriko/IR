We study the various linear responses of neutron stars to external
relativistic tidal fields. We focus on three different tidal responses,
associated to three different tidal coefficients: (i) a gravito-electric-type
coefficient G\mu_\ell=[length]^{2\ell+1} measuring the \ell^{th}-order mass
multipolar moment GM_{a_1... a_\ell} induced in a star by an external
\ell^{th}-order gravito-electric tidal field G_{a_1... a_\ell}; (ii) a
gravito-magnetic-type coefficient G\sigma_\ell=[length]^{2\ell+1} measuring the
\ell^{th} spin multipole moment G S_{a_1... a_\ell} induced in a star by an
external \ell^{th}-order gravito-magnetic tidal field H_{a_1... a_\ell}; and
(iii) a dimensionless ``shape'' Love number h_\ell measuring the distortion of
the shape of the surface of a star by an external \ell^{th}-order
gravito-electric tidal field. All the dimensionless tidal coefficients
G\mu_\ell/R^{2\ell+1}, G\sigma_\l/R^{2\ell+1} and h_\ell (where R is the radius
of the star) are found to have a strong sensitivity to the value of the star's
``compactness'' c\equiv GM/(c_0^2 R) (where we indicate by c_0 the speed of
light). In particular, G\mu_\l/R^{2\l+1}\sim k_\ell is found to strongly
decrease, as c increases, down to a zero value as c is formally extended to the
``black-hole (BH) limit'' c^{BH}=1/2. The shape Love number h_\ell is also
found to significantly decrease as c increases, though it does not vanish in
the formal limit c\to c^{BH}. The formal vanishing of \mu_\ell and \sigma_\ell
as c\to c^{BH} is a consequence of the no-hair properties of black holes; this
suggests, but in no way proves, that the effective action describing the
gravitational interactions of black holes may not need to be augmented by
nonminimal worldline couplings.
