The partial oxidation of methane was investigated using a self-stirred
reactor under a wide range of operating conditions. The recation mechanism was
determined by comparing ecperimental results with the results of simulations
made using the Chemkin-Surface software. The proposed mechanism includes 444
homogeneous reactions and 33 surface reactions.
