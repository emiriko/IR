Computational complexity is examined using the principle of increasing
entropy. To consider computation as a physical process from an initial instance
to the final acceptance is motivated because many natural processes have been
recognized to complete in non-polynomial time (NP). The irreversible process
with three or more degrees of freedom is found intractable because, in terms of
physics, flows of energy are inseparable from their driving forces. In
computational terms, when solving problems in the class NP, decisions will
affect subsequently available sets of decisions. The state space of a
non-deterministic finite automaton is evolving due to the computation itself
hence it cannot be efficiently contracted using a deterministic finite
automaton that will arrive at a solution in super-polynomial time. The solution
of the NP problem itself is verifiable in polynomial time (P) because the
corresponding state is stationary. Likewise the class P set of states does not
depend on computational history hence it can be efficiently contracted to the
accepting state by a deterministic sequence of dissipative transformations.
Thus it is concluded that the class P set of states is inherently smaller than
the set of class NP. Since the computational time to contract a given set is
proportional to dissipation, the computational complexity class P is a subset
of NP.
