A bottom tangle is a tangle in a cube consisting of arc components whose
boundary points are on a line in the bottom square of the cube. A ribbon bottom
tangle is a bottom tangle whose closure is a ribbon link. For every n-component
ribbon bottom tangle T, we prove that the universal invariant J_T of T
associated to the quantized enveloping algebra U_h(sl_2) of the Lie algebra
sl_2 is contained in a certain Z[q,q^{-1}]-subalgebra of the n-fold completed
tensor power of U_h(sl_2). This result is applied to the colored Jones
polynomial of ribbon links.
