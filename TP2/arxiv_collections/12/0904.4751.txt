Photoassociation of spin-polarized metastable helium to the three lowest
rovibrational levels of the J=1, $0_u^+$ state asymptoting to 2$s
{}^{3}$S$_{1}+2p {}^{3}$P$_{0}$ is studied using a second-order perturbative
treatment of the line shifts valid for low laser intensities, and two variants
of a non-perturbative close-coupled treatment, one based upon dressed states of
the matter plus laser system, and the other on a modified radiative coupling
which vanishes asymptotically, thus simulating experimental conditions. These
non-perturbative treatments are valid for arbitrary laser intensities and yield
the complete photoassociation resonance profile. Both variants give nearly
identical results for the line shifts and widths of the resonances and show
that their dependence upon laser intensity is very close to linear and
quadratic respectively for the two lowest levels. The resonance profiles are
superimposed upon a significant background loss, a feature for this metastable
helium system not present in studies of photoassociation in other systems,
which is due to the very shallow nature of the excited state $0_u^+$ potential.
The results for the line shifts from the close-coupled and perturbative
calculations agree very closely at low laser intensities.
