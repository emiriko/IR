We present the JHKs light curves for the double-lined eclipsing binary 2MASS
J05352184-0546085, in which both components are brown dwarfs. We analyze these
light curves with the published Ic-band light curve and radial velocities to
provide refined measurements of the system's physical parameters. The component
masses and radii are here determined with an accuracy of ~6.5% and ~1.5%,
respectively. We confirm the previous surprising finding that the primary brown
dwarf has a cooler effective temperature than its companion. Next, we perform a
detailed study of the variations in the out-of-eclipse phases of the light
curves to ascertain the properties of any inhomogeneities on the surfaces of
the brown dwarfs. Our analysis reveals two low-amplitude periodic signals, one
attributable to the rotation of the primary (with a period of 3.293+/-0.001 d)
and the other to that of the secondary (14.05+/-0.05 d). Finally, we explore
the effects on the derived physical parameters of the system when spots are
included in the modeling. The observed low-amplitude rotational modulations are
well fit by cool spots covering a small fraction of their surfaces. To mimic
the observed ~200 K suppression of the primary's temperature, our model
requires that the primary possess a very large spot coverage fraction of ~65%.
Altogether, a spot configuration in which the primary is heavily spotted while
the secondary is lightly spotted can explain the apparent temperature reversal
and can bring the temperatures of the brown dwarfs into agreement with the
predictions of theoretical models.
