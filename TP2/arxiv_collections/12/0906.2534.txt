The effects of initial conditions and system parameters on entanglement
dynamics and asymptotic entanglement for a two-qubit anisotropic XY Heisenberg
system in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field and spin-orbit
interaction are investigated. We suppose that each qubit interacts with a
separate thermal reservoir which is held in its own temperature. The effects of
the parameters of the system and environment like spin-orbit interaction and
temperature difference of reservoirs are also discussed.
