We give a high precision polynomial-time approximation scheme for the
supremum of any honest n-variate (n+2)-nomial with a constant term, allowing
real exponents as well as real coefficients. Our complexity bounds count field
operations and inequality checks, and are polynomial in n and the logarithm of
a certain condition number. For the special case of polynomials (i.e., integer
exponents), the log of our condition number is quadratic in the sparse
encoding. The best previous complexity bounds were exponential in the sparse
encoding, even for n fixed. Along the way, we extend the theory of
A-discriminants to real exponents and certain exponential sums, and find new
and natural NP_R-complete problems.
