We consider billiard trajectories in a smooth convex body in $\mathbb R^d$
and estimate the number of distinct periodic trajectories that make exactly $p$
reflections per period at the boundary of the body. In the case of prime $p$ we
obtain the lower bound $(d-2)(p-1)+2$, which is much better than the previous
estimates.
