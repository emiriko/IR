We study various properties of a one parameter mass term for the Skyrme
model, originating from the works of Kopeliovich, Piette and Zakrzewski,
through the use of axially symmetric solutions obtained numerically by
simulated-annealing. These solutions allow us to observe asymptotic behaviors
of the B=2 binding energies that differ to those previously obtained. We also
decipher the characteristics of three distinct vibrational modes that appear as
eigenstates of the vibrational Hamiltonian. This analysis further examine the
assertion that the one parameter mass term offers a better account of baryonic
matter than the traditional mass term.
