We conjecture an expression for the Liouville theory conformal blocks and
correlation functions on a Riemann surface of genus g and n punctures as the
Nekrasov partition function of a certain class of N=2 SCFTs recently defined by
one of the authors. We conduct extensive tests of the conjecture at genus 0,1.
