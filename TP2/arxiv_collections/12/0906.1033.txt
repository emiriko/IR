- In this paper we present a method to compute the coefficients of the
fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) on a quantum computer using quantum gates
of polynomial complexity of the order O(n^3). The FrFt, a generalization of the
DFT, has wide applications in signal processing and is particularly useful to
implement the Pseudopolar and Radon transforms. Even though the FrFT is a
non-unitary operation, to develop its quantum counterpart, we develop a unitary
operator called the quantum Pseudo-fraction Fourier Transform (QPFrFT) in a
higher-dimensional Hilbert space, in order to computer the coefficients of the
FrFT. In this process we develop a unitary operator denoted U by which is an
essential step to implement the QPFrFT. We then show the application of the
operator U in the problem of quantum phase estimation.
