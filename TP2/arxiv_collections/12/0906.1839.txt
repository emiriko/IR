We provide a complete description of the giant component of the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ as soon as it emerges from the scaling
window, i.e., for $p = (1+\epsilon)/n$ where $\epsilon^3 n \to \infty$ and
$\epsilon=o(1)$.
  Our description is particularly simple for $\epsilon = o(n^{-1/4})$, where
the giant component $C_1$ is contiguous with the following model (i.e., every
graph property that holds with high probability for this model also holds
w.h.p. for $C_1$). Let $Z$ be normal with mean $\frac23 \epsilon^3 n$ and
variance $\epsilon^3 n$, and let $K$ be a random 3-regular graph on $2\lfloor
Z\rfloor$ vertices. Replace each edge of $K$ by a path, where the path lengths
are i.i.d. geometric with mean $1/\epsilon$. Finally, attach an independent
Poisson($1-\epsilon$)-Galton-Watson tree to each vertex.
  A similar picture is obtained for larger $\epsilon=o(1)$, in which case the
random 3-regular graph is replaced by a random graph with $N_k$ vertices of
degree $k$ for $k\geq 3$, where $N_k$ has mean and variance of order
$\epsilon^k n$.
  This description enables us to determine fundamental characteristics of the
supercritical random graph. Namely, we can infer the asymptotics of the
diameter of the giant component for any rate of decay of $\epsilon$, as well as
the mixing time of the random walk on $C_1$.
