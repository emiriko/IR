We present projected rotational velocity values for 97 Galactic, 55 SMC, and
106 LMC O-B type stars from archival FUSE observations. The evolved and
unevolved samples from each environment are compared through the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine if the distribution of equatorial
rotational velocities is metallicity dependent for these massive objects.
Stellar interior models predict that massive stars with SMC metallicity will
have significantly reduced angular momentum loss on the main sequence compared
to their Galactic counterparts. Our results find some support for this
prediction but also show that even at Galactic metallicity, evolved and
unevolved massive stars have fairly similar fractions of stars with large V sin
i values. Macroturbulent broadening that is present in the spectral features of
Galactic evolved massive stars is lower in the LMC and SMC samples. This
suggests the processes that lead to macroturbulence are dependent upon
metallicity.
