Secret sharing is a procedure for sharing a secret among a number of
participants such that only the qualified subsets of participants have the
ability to reconstruct the secret. Even in the presence of eavesdropping,
secret sharing can be achieved when all the members are quantum. So what
happens if not all the members are quantum? In this paper we propose two
semi-quantum secret sharing protocols using maximally entangled GHZ-type states
in which quantum Alice shares a secret with two classical parties, Bob and
Charlie, in a way that both parties are sufficient to obtain the secret, but
one of them cannot. The presented protocols are also showed to be secure
against eavesdropping.
