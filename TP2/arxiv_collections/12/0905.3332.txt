We report the magnetic and electrical characteristics of a polycrystalline
specimen of FeTiO3 synthesized at high pressure that is isostructural with
acentric LiNbO3 (LBO). Piezoresponse force microscopy, optical second harmonic
generation, and magnetometry demonstrate that FeTiO3-II is ferroelectric at and
below room temperature and weakly ferromagnetic below ~120 K. These results
validate symmetry-based materials design criteria and first principles
calculations of coexistence between ferroelectricity and weak ferromagnetism in
a series of transition metal titanates crystallizing in the LBO structure. The
high-pressure form of FeTiO3 stands out as a rare example of a ferroelectric
exhibiting weak ferromagnetism generated by a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction.
