Cilia and flagella are hair-like extensions of eukaryotic cells which
generate oscillatory beat patterns that can propel micro-organisms and create
fluid flows near cellular surfaces. The evolutionary highly conserved core of
cilia and flagella consists of a cylindrical arrangement of nine microtubule
doublets, called the axoneme. The axoneme is an actively bending structure
whose motility results from the action of dynein motor proteins cross-linking
microtubule doublets and generating stresses that induce bending deformations.
The periodic beat patterns are the result of a mechanical feedback that leads
to self-organized bending waves along the axoneme. Using a theoretical
framework to describe planar beating motion, we derive a nonlinear wave
equation that describes the fundamental Fourier mode of the axonemal beat. We
study the role of nonlinearities and investigate how the amplitude of
oscillations increases in the vicinity of an oscillatory instability. We
furthermore present numerical solutions of the nonlinear wave equation for
different boundary conditions. We find that the nonlinear waves are well
approximated by the linearly unstable modes for amplitudes of beat patterns
similar to those observed experimentally.
