In work [1] (Yu. N. Pokotilovski, arXiv:0902.3425v2) restrictions on
constants of pseudo-magnetic interaction gSgP are presented. These restrictions
are considerably differed from restrictions on gSgP, before published in work
[2] (A.P. Serebrov, arXiv:0902.1056v1). Restrictions in work [1] are received
from the same experimental data which are used in work [2], however difference
in restrictions is considerable. This difference is changed in a range from 1
to 10^7 times depending on value lambda. In the given work it is shown that
restrictions of work [1] are wrong and the possible reasons of the admitted
errors are considered.
