We investigate the dynamical Casimir effect in a coplanar waveguide (CPW)
terminated by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Changing
the magnetic flux through the SQUID parametrically modulates the boundary
condition of the CPW, and thereby, its effective length. Effective boundary
velocities comparable to the speed of light in the CPW result in broadband
photon generation which is identical to the one calculated in the dynamical
Casimir effect for a single oscillating mirror. We estimate the power of the
radiation for realistic parameters and show that it is experimentally feasible
to directly detect this nonclassical broadband radiation.
