A scheme for generating a fractal butterfly Floquet spectrum, first proposed
by Wang and Gong [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 77}, 031405(R) (2008)], is extended to
driven SU(2) systems such as a driven two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate. A new
class of driven systems without a link with the Harper model context is shown
to have an intriguing butterfly Floquet spectrum. The found butterfly spectrum
shows remarkable deviations from the known Hosftadter's butterfly. In addition,
the level crossings between Floquet states of the same parity and between
Floquet states of different parities are studied and highlighted. The results
are relevant to studies of fractal statistics, quantum chaos, coherent
destruction of tunneling, as well as the validity of mean-field descriptions of
Bose-Einstein condensates.
