The low energy band structure of the FeAs based superconductors is fitted by
a tight binding model with two Fe ions per unit cell and two degenerate
orbitals per Fe ion. Based on this, superconductivity with extended s-wave
pairing symmetry of the form $\cos k_x +\cos k_y$ is examined. The local
density of states near an impurity is also investigated by using T-matrix
approach. For the nonmagnetic scattering potential, we found that there exist
two major resonances inside the gap. The height of the resonance peaks depends
on the strength of the impurity potential. These in-gap resonances are
originated in the Andreev's bound states due to the quasiparticle scattering
between the hole Fermi surfaces around $\Gamma$ point with positive order
parameter and the electron Fermi surfaces around $M$ point with negative order
parameter.
