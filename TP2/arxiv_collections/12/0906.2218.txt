The growth of biological systems described by the Gompertz and
West-Brown-Enquist functions is considered in the framework of the space-like
supersymmetric quantum mechanics. It has been shown that the supersymmetric
effect of a fermion-boson conversion has a biological analogue in the
phenomenon of a growth-regression transformation under the influence of a
cycle-non-specific drug of a constant concentration. The results obtained
reveal that the biological growth can be viewed as the macroscopic quantum
phenomenon endowed with the space-like supersymmetric properties not
established so far in the domain of biology and medicine.
