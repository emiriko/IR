M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky gave a categorification of the HOMFLY-PT
polynomial. This study is a generalization of the Khovanov-Rozansky homology.
We define a homology associated to the quantum $(sl_n,\land V_n)$ link
invariant, where $\land V_n$ is the set of the fundamental representations of
the quantum group of $sl_n$. In the case of a [1,k]-colored link diagram, we
prove that its homology is a link invariant. In the case of an [i,j]-colored
link diagram, we define a normalized Poincare polynomial of its homology and
prove the polynomial is a link invariant.
