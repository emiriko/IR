We study massive graviton propagations of scalar, vector, and tensor modes in
the deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity by introducing Lorentz-violating mass
term. It turns out that vector and tensor modes are massively propagating on
the Minkowski spacetime background. However, adding the mass term does not cure
a ghost instability in the Ho\v{r}ava scalar.
