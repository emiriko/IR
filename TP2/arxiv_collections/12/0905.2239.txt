A self-similar formalism for the study of the gravitational collapse of
molecular gas provides an important theoretical framework from which to explore
the dynamics of star formation. Motivated by the presence of elongated and
filamentary structures observed in giant molecular clouds, we build upon the
existing body of work on cylindrical self-similar collapse flows by including
dynamic equations of state that are different from the effective equation of
state that produces the initial density distribution. We focus primarily on the
collapse of initial states for which the gas is at rest and everywhere
overdense from its corresponding hydrostatic equilibrium profile by a factor
$\Lambda$, and apply our results toward the analysis of star formation within
dense, elongated molecular cores. An important aspect of this work is the
determination of the mass infall rates over a range of the parameters which
define the overall state of the gas -- the overdensity parameter $\Lambda$, the
index $\Gamma$ of the static equation of state, and the index $\gamma$ of the
dynamic equation of state. While most of the parameter space explored in this
work leads to solutions for which the underlying equations do not become
singular, we do include a discussion on how to treat cases for which solutions
pass smoothly through the singular surface. In addition, we also present a
different class of collapse solutions for the special case $\gamma = 1$.
