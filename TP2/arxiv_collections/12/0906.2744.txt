Nonlinear kinetic inductance in a high Q superconducting coplanar waveguide
microresonator can cause a bifurcation of the resonance curve. Near the
critical pumping power and frequency for bifurcation, large parametric gain is
observed for signals in the frequency band near resonance. We show experimental
results on signal and intermodulation gain which are well described by a theory
of the parametric amplification based on a Kerr nonlinearity. Phase dependent
gain, or signal squeezing, is verified with a homodyne detection scheme.
