Geometric Langlands duality relates a representation of a simple Lie group
$G^\vee$ to the cohomology of a certain moduli space associated with the dual
group $G$. In this correspondence, a principal $SL_2$ subgroup of $G^\vee$
makes an unexpected appearance. Why this happens can be explained using gauge
theory, as we will see in this article, with the help of the equations of Nahm
and Bogomolny. (Based on a lecture at Geometry and Physics: Atiyah 80,
Edinburgh, April 2009.)
