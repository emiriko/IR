The scaling hypothesis postulates proportionality of two columns of the
Majorana neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis. This Ansatz was shown to
lead to an inverted hierarchy and U_{e3} = 0. We discuss theoretical and
phenomenological properties of this hypothesis. We show that (i) the neutrino
mass matrix with scaling follows as a consequence of a generalized mu-tau
symmetry imposed on the type-I see-saw model; (ii) there exists a unique
texture for the Dirac mass matrix m_D which leads to scaling for arbitrary
Majorana matrix M_R in the context of the type-I see-saw mechanism; (iii)
unlike in the mu-tau symmetric case, a simple model with two right-handed
neutrinos and scaling can lead to successful leptogenesis both with and without
the inclusion of flavor effects.
