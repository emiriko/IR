Producing useful electrical work in consuming chemical energy, the fuel cell
have to reject heat to its surrounding. However, as it occurs for any other
type of engine, this thermal energy cannot be exchanged in an isothermal way in
finite time through finite areas. As it was already done for various types of
systems, we study the fuel cell within the finite time thermodynamics framework
and define an endoreversible fuel cell. Considering different types of heat
transfer laws, we obtain an optimal value of the operating temperature,
corresponding to a maximum produced power. This analysis is a first step of a
thermodynamical approach of design of thermal management devices, taking into
account performances of the whole system.
