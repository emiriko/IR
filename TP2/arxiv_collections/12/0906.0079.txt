We derive the second-order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamic equations in
a generic frame with a continuous parameter from the relativistic Boltzmann
equation. We present explicitly the relaxation terms in the energy and particle
frames. Our results show that the viscosities are frame-independent but the
relaxation times are generically frame-dependent. We confirm that the
dissipative part of the energy-momentum tensor in the particle frame satisfies
$\delta T^\mu_\mu = 0$ obtained for the first-order equation before, in
contrast to the Eckart choice $u_\mu \delta T^{\mu\nu} u_\nu = 0$ adopted as a
matching condition in the literature. We emphasize that the new constraint
$\delta T^\mu_\mu = 0$ can be compatible with the phenomenological derivation
of hydrodynamics based on the second law of thermodynamics.
