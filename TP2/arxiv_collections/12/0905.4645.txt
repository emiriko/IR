We calculate the `exact' potential corresponding to a one-dimensional
interacting system of two electrons with a specific, tailored density. We use
one-dimensional density-functional theory with a local-density approximation
(LDA) on the same system and calculate densities and energies, which are
compared with the `exact' ones. The `interacting-LDA system' corresponding to
the LDA density is then found and its potential compared with the original one.
Finally we calculate and compare the spatial entanglement of the electronic
systems corresponding to the interacting-LDA and original interacting system.
