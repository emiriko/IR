The Suzaku X-ray satellite observed the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258 for a
total good exposure time of 100 ks. We present an analysis of the Suzaku XIS
data, in which we confirm that the 0.5--2 keV spectra of the interstellar
medium (ISM) are well-represented by a two-temperature model. The cool and hot
ISM temperatures are 0.23+-0.02 and 0.59 +-0.01 keV, respectively. Suzaku's
excellent spectral sensitivity enables us to measure the metal abundances of O,
Ne, Mg, Si and Fe of the ISM for the first time. The resultant abundance
pattern of O, Mg, Si, and Fe is consistent with that of the new solar abundance
table of Lodders (2003), rather than Anders & Grevesse (1989). This suggests
that the metal enrichment processes of NGC 4258 and of our Galaxy are similar.
