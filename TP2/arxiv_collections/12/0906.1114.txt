Chiral smectic liquid crystals exhibit a series of phases, including
ferroelectric, antiferroelectric and ferrielectric commensurate structures as
well as an incommensurate SmCalpha phase. We carried out an extension of the
phenomenological model, recently presented by M. B. Hamaneh and P. L. Taylor,
based upon the distorted clock model.
