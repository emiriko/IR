The X-ray pulsar SAX J0635+0533 was repeatedly observed with the XMM-Newton
satellite in 2003-2004. The precise localization provided by these observations
confirms the association of SAX J0635+0533 with a Be star. The source was
found, for the first time, in a low intensity state, a factor ~30 lower than
that seen in all previous observations. The spectrum, well fitted by an
absorbed power law with photon index ~1.7 and N_H = 1.2x10^22 cm^-2, was
compatible with that of the high state. The low flux did not allow the
detection of the pulsations at 33.8 ms seen BeppoSAX and RXTE data. In view of
the small luminosity observed in 2003-2004, we reconsider the peculiarities of
this source in both the accretion and rotation powered scenarios.
