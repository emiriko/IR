We present an analytical derivation of the winding number counting
topological defects created by an O(N) symmetry-breaking quantum quench in N
spatial dimensions. Our approach is universal in the sense that we do not
employ any approximations apart from the large-$N$ limit. The final result is
nonperturbative in N, i.e., it cannot be obtained by %the usual an expansion in
1/N, and we obtain far less topological defects than quasiparticle excitations,
in sharp distinction to previous, low-dimensional investigations.
