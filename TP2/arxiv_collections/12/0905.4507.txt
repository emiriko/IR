There are numerous examples of societies with extremely stable mix of
contrasting opinions. We argue that this stability is a result of an interplay
between society network topology adjustment and opinion changing processes. To
support this position we present a computer model of opinion formation based on
some novel assumptions, designed to bring the model closer to social reality.
In our model, the agents, in addition to changing their opinions due to
influence of the rest of society and external propaganda, have the ability to
modify their social network, forming links with agents sharing the same
opinions and cutting the links with those they disagree with. To improve the
model further we divide the agents into `fanatics' and `opportunists',
depending on how easy is to change their opinions. The simulations show
significant differences compared to traditional models, where network links are
static. In particular, for the dynamical model where inter-agent links are
adjustable, the final network structure and opinion distribution is shown to
resemble real world observations, such as social structures and persistence of
minority groups even when most of the society is against them and the
propaganda is strong.
