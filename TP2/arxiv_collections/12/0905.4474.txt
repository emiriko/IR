We study theoretically the existence of bulk and surface discrete breathers
in a one-dimensional magnetic metamaterial comprised of a periodic binary array
of split-ring resonators. The two types of resonators differ in the size of
their slits and this leads to different resonant frequencies. In the framework
of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) we construct several types of breather
excitations for both the energy-conserved and the dissipative-driven systems by
continuation of trivial breather solutions from the anticontinuous limit to
finite couplings. Numerically-exact computations that integrate the full model
equations confirm the quality of the RWA results. Moreover, it is demonstrated
that discrete breathers can spontaneously appear in the dissipative-driven
system as a results of a fundamental instability.
