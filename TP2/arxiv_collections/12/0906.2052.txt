A rigorous non perturbative adiabatic approximation of the evolution operator
in the many-body physics of degenerate systems is derived. This approximation
is used to solve the long-standing problem of the choice of the initial states
of H0 leading to eigenstates of H0+V for degenerate systems. These initial
states are eigenstates of P0 V P0, where P0 is the projection onto a degenerate
eigenspace of H0. This result is used to give the proper definition of the
Green function, the statistical Green function and the non-equilibrium Green
function of degenerate systems. The convergence of these Green functions is
established.
