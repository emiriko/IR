This paper presents a unified framework for dealing with a deduction system
and a denotational semantics of exceptions. It is based on the fact that
handling exceptions can be seen as a kind of generalized case distinction. This
point of view on exceptions has been introduced in 2004, it is based on the
notion of diagrammatic logic, which assumes some familiarity with category
theory. Extensive sums of types can be used for dealing with case distinctions.
The aim of this new paper is to focus on the role of generalized extensivity
property for dealing with exceptions. Moreover, the presentation of this paper
makes only a restricted use of category theory.
