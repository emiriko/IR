New classical integrable systems of Camassa-Holm peakon type are proposed.
They realize the maximal even piecewise-D_2 generalization of the
Calogero-Francoise flows, yielding periodic and pseudoperiodic
trigonometric/hyperbolic potentials. The associated r-matrices are computed.
They are dynamical and depend on both sets {p_i} and {q_i} of canonical
variables.
