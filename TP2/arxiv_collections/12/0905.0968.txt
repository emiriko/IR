We measured the electrical resistivity and ac magnetic susceptibility of
BaFe2As2 and SrFe2As2 single crystals under pressure using a cubic anvil
apparatus. For BaFe2As2, the antiferromagnetic (AF) and structural transitions
are suppressed with increasing pressure. Unexpectedly, these transitions
persist up to 8 GPa, and no signature of a superconducting transition was
observed in the pressure range investigated here. On the other hand, the AF and
structural transitions of SrFe2As2 collapse at around the critical pressure Pc
~ 5 GPa, resulting in the appearance of bulk superconductivity. The
superconducting volume fraction abruptly increases above Pc, and shows a dome
centered at approximately 6 GPa. Our results suggest that the bulk
superconducting phase competes with the AF/orthorhombic phase and only appears
in the narrow pressure region of the tetragonal phase.
