We modify previous quasi-local mass definition. The new definition provides
expressions of the quasi-local energy, the quasi-local linear momentum and the
quasi-local mass. And they are equal to the ADM expressions at spatial
infinity. Moreover, the new quasi-local energy has the positivity property.
