We show that the statistics of spreads in real order books is characterized
by an intrinsic asymmetry due to discreteness effects for even or odd values of
the spread. An analysis of data from the NYSE order book points out that
traders' strategies contribute to this asymmetry. We also investigate this
phenomenon in the framework of a microscopic model and, by introducing a
non-uniform deposition mechanism for limit orders, we are able to
quantitatively reproduce the asymmetry found in the experimental data.
Simulations of our model also show a realistic dynamics with a sort of
intermittent behavior characterized by long periods in which the order book is
compact and liquid interrupted by volatile configurations. The order placement
strategies produce a non-trivial behavior of the spread relaxation dynamics
which is similar to the one observed in real markets.
