MARF is an open-source research platform and a collection of
voice/sound/speech/text and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms
written in Java and arranged into a modular and extensible framework
facilitating addition of new algorithms. MARF can run distributively over the
network and may act as a library in applications or be used as a source for
learning and extension. A few example applications are provided to show how to
use the framework. There is an API reference in the Javadoc format as well as
this set of accompanying notes with the detailed description of the
architectural design, algorithms, and applications. MARF and its applications
are released under a BSD-style license and is hosted at SourceForge.net. This
document provides the details and the insight on the internals of MARF and some
of the mentioned applications.
