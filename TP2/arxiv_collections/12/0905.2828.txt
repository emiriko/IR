We present a LO evaluation of helicity densities of valence, \Delta
u_v+\Delta d_v, non-strange sea, \Delta\bar{u}+\Delta\bar{d}, and strange
quarks, \Delta s (assumed to be equal to \Delta\bar{s}). They have been
obtained from the inclusive asymmetry A_{3,d} and the semi-inclusive
asymmetries A^{\pi+}_{1,d}, A^{\pi-}_{1,d}, A^{K+}_{1,d}, A^{K-}_{1,d} measured
in polarised deep inelastic muon-deuteron scattering. The full deuteron
statistics of COMPASS (years 2002-2004 and 2006) has been used. The data cover
the range Q^2 > 1 (GeV/c)^2 and 0.004<x<0.3. Both non-strange densities are
found to be in a good agreement with previous measurements. The distribution of
\Delta s(x) is compatible with zero in the whole measured range, in contrast to
the shape of the strange quark helicity distribution obtained in most LO and
NLO QCD fits. The sensitivity of the values of \Delta s(x) upon the choice of
fragmentation functions used in the derivation is discussed.
