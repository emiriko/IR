LHCb is the dedicated B physics experiment at the LHC and is due to start
data taking later this year. Its goal is to search for new physics in very rare
processes and make precision measurements of CP violation in B decays. The CKM
angle gamma plays an important role in flavour physics in the Standard Model.
LHCb will exploit the large variety of B hadrons produced by the 14 TeV pp
collisions, performing gamma measurements to the precision of a few degrees.
Here, we will present a summary of the expected gamma sensitivities LHCb will
reach during its first years of data taking, with contributions from several
strategies in both tree and loop processes.
