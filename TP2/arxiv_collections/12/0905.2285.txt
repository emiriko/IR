We present the results of searches for non-standard model phenomena in photon
and jet final states. These searches use data from integrated luminosities of
0.7--2.7/fb of p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV, collected with the CDF
and D0 detectors at the Fermilab Tevatron. No significant excess in data has
been observed. We report limits on the parameters of several models, including:
large extra dimension, compositeness, leptoquarks, and supersymmetry.
