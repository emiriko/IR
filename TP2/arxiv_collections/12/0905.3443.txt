We obtain an exact many-body scattering eigenstate in an open quantum dot
system. The scattering state is not in the form of the Bethe eigenstate in the
sense that the wave-number set of the incoming plane wave is not conserved
during the scattering and many-body bound states appear. By using the
scattering state, we study the average nonequilibrium current through the
quantum dot under a finite bias voltage. The current-voltage characteristics
that we obtained by taking the two-body bound state into account is
qualitatively similar to several known results.
