Each acyclic graph, and more generally, each acyclic orientation of the graph
associated to a Cartan matrix, allows to define a so-called frise; this is a
collection of sequences over the positive natural numbers, one for each vertex
of the graph. We prove that if these sequences satisfy a linear recurrence,
then the Cartan matrix is of Dynkin type (if the sequences are bounded) or of
Euclidean type (if the sequences are unbounded). We prove the converse in all
cases, except for the exceptional Euclidean Cartan matrices; we show even that
the sequences are rational over the positive natural numbers. We generalize
these results by considering frises with variables; as a byproduct we obtain,
for the Dynkin and Euclidean type A cases, explicit formulas for the cluster
variables, over the semiring of Laurent polynomials over the positive natural
numbers generated by the initial variables (which explains simultaneously
positivity and the Laurent phenomenon). The general tool are the so-called
SL_2-tilings of the plane; these are fillings of the whole discrete plane by
elements of a ring, in such a way that each 2 by 2 connected submatrix is of
determinant 1.
