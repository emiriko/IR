Neutrino scillations cannot arise from an initial isolated one particle state
if four-momentum is conserved. The transition matrix element is generally
squared and summed over all final states with no interference between
orthogonal final states. Lorentz covariant descriptions based on relativistic
quantum field theory cannot describe interference between orthogonal states
with different $\nu$ masses producing neutrino oscillations. Simplified model
presents rigorous derivation of handwaving argument about "energy-time
uncertainty". Standard time-dependent perturbation theory for decays shows how
energy spectrum of final state is much broader than natural line width at times
much shorter than decay lifetime. Initial state containing two components with
different energies decay into two orthogonal states with different $\nu$ masses
completely separated at long times with no interference. At short times the
broadened energy spectra of the two amplitudes overlap and interfere.
"Darmstadt oscillation" experiment attempts to measure the momentum difference
between the two contributing coherent initial states and obtain information
about $\nu$ masses without detecting the $\nu$. Simple interpretation gives
value for the squared $\nu$ mass difference differing by less than a factor of
three from values calculated from the KAMLAND experiment. Treatment holds only
in laboratory frame with values of energy, time and momentum determined by
experimental environment at rest in the laboratory.
