Previous studies have shown that small changes can be monitored in a
scattering medium by observing phase shifts in the coda. Passive monitoring of
weak changes through ambient noise correlation has already been applied to
seismology, acoustics and engineering. Usually, this is done under the
assumption that a properly reconstructed Green function as well as stable
background noise sources are necessary. In order to further develop this
monitoring technique, a laboratory experiment was performed in the 2.5MHz range
in a gel with scattering inclusions, comparing an active (pulse-echo) form of
monitoring to a passive (correlation) one. Present results show that
temperature changes in the medium can be observed even if the Green function
(GF) of the medium is not reconstructed. Moreover, this article establishes
that the GF reconstruction in the correlations is not a necessary condition:
the only condition to monitoring with correlation (passive experiment) is the
relative stability of the background noise structure.
