Context: Among late-type red giants, an interesting change occurs in the
structure of the outer atmospheric layers as one moves to later spectral types
in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram: a chromosphere is always present, but the
coronal emission diminishes and a cool massive wind steps in.
  Aims: Where most studies have focussed on short-wavelength observations, this
article explores the influence of the chromosphere and the wind on
long-wavelength photometric measurements.
  Methods: The observational spectral energy distributions are compared with
the theoretical predictions of the MARCS atmosphere models for a sample of 9 K-
and M-giants. The discrepancies found are explained using basic models for flux
emission originating from a chromosphere or an ionized wind.
  Results: For 7 out of 9 sample stars, a clear flux excess is detected at
(sub)millimeter and/or centimeter wavelengths. The precise start of the excess
depends upon the star under consideration. The flux at wavelengths shorter than
about 1 mm is most likely dominated by an optically thick chromosphere, where
an optically thick ionized wind is the main flux contributor at longer
wavelengths.
  Conclusions: Although the optical to mid-infrared spectrum of the studied K-
and M-giants is well represented by a radiative equilibrium atmospheric model,
the presence of a chromosphere and/or ionized stellar wind at higher altitudes
dominates the spectrum in the (sub)millimeter and centimeter wavelength ranges.
The presence of a flux excess also has implications on the role of these stars
as fiducial spectrophotometric calibrators in the (sub)millimeter and
centimeter wavelength range.
