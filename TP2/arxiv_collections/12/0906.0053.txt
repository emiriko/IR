Negativity has been adopted to investigate the entanglement in a system
composed of a two-level atom and a two-mode cavity field. Effects of Kerr-like
medium and the number of photon inside the cavity on the entanglement are
studied. Our results show that atomic initial state must be superposed, so that
the two cavity field modes can be entangled. Moreover, we also conclude that
the number of photon in the two cavity mode should be equal. The interaction
between modes, namely, the Kerr effect, has a significant negative
contribution. Note that the atom frequency and the cavity frequency have an
indistinguishable effect, so a corresponding approximation has been made in
this article. These results may be useful for quantum information in optics
systems.
