In this paper we demonstrate an active polarization drift compensation scheme
for optical fibres employed in a quantum key distribution experiment with
polarization encoded qubits. The quantum signals are wavelength multiplexed in
one fibre along with two classical optical side channels that provide the
control information for the polarization compensation scheme. This set-up
allows us to continuously track any polarization change without the need to
interrupt the key exchange. The results obtained show that fast polarization
rotations of the order of 40*pi rad/s are effectively compensated for. We
demonstrate that our set-up allows continuous quantum key distribution even in
a fibre stressed by random polarization fluctuations. Our results pave the way
for Bell-state measurements using only linear optics with parties separated by
long-distance optical fibres.
