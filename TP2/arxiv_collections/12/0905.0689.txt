Electrons in a metal subject to magnetic field commonly exhibit oscillatory
behavior as the field strength varies, with a period set by the area of
quantized electronic orbits. Recent experiments on elemental bismuth have
revealed oscillations for fields above 9 tesla that do not follow this simple
dependence and have been interpreted as a signature of electron
fractionalization in the bulk. We argue instead that a simple explanation in
terms of the surface states of bismuth exists when additional features of the
experiment are included. These surface electrons are known to have significant
spin-orbit interaction. We show the observed oscillations are in quantitative
agreement with the surface theory, which we propose to test by studying the
effect of the Zeeman coupling in higher fields, dependence on the field
orientation, and the thickness of the samples.
