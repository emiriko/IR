We analyse the triviality-quantum decoherence of Euclidean quantum
chromodynamics in the gauge invariant sector in the presence of an external
U(infinite)-flavor constant charged white noise reservoir and producing thus a
proof for confinement in the Color-charge QCD through the modeling of the QCD
vacuum by constant gauge fields
