A succession of near-IR spectroscopic observations, taken nightly throughout
an entire cycle of SS433's orbit, reveal (i) the persistent signature of
SS433's accretion disc, having a rotation speed of ~500 km/s, (ii) the presence
of the circumbinary disc recently discovered at optical wavelengths by
Blundell, Bowler and Schmidtobreick (2008) and (iii) a much faster outflow than
has previously been measured for the disc wind. From these, we find a much
faster accretion disc wind than has noted before, with a terminal velocity of
~1500 km/s. The increased wind terminal velocity results in a mass-loss rate of
~10e-4 M_sun/yr. These, together with the newly (upwardly) determined masses
for the components of the SS433 system, result in an accurate diagnosis of the
extent to which SS433 has super-Eddington flows. Our observations imply that
the size of the companion star is comparable with the semi-minor axis of the
orbit which is given by (1-e^2)^(1/2) 40 R_sun, where e is the eccentricity.
Our relatively high spectral resolution at these near-IR wavelengths has
enabled us to deconstruct the different components that comprise the
Brackett-gamma line in this binary system, and their physical origins. With
this line dominated throughout our series of observations by the disc wind, and
the accretion disc itself being only a minority (~15 per cent) contribution, we
caution against use of the unresolved Brackett-gamma line intensity as an
"accretion signature" in X-ray binaries or microquasars in any quantitative
way.
