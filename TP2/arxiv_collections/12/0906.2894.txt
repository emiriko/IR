We report low-temperature measurements of the electrical resistivity of
Yb(Rh1-xCox)2Si2 single crystals with 0 <= x <= 0.12. The isoelectronic
substitution of Co on the Rh site leads to a decrease of the unit cell volume
which stabilizes the antiferromagnetism. Consequently, the antiferromagnetic
transition temperature increases upon Co substitution. For x = 0.07 Co content
a subsequent low-temperature transition is observed in agreement with
susceptibility measurements and results on YbRh2Si2 under hydrostatic pressure.
Above the Neel transition the resistivity follows a non-Fermi liquid behavior
similar to that of YbRh2Si2.
