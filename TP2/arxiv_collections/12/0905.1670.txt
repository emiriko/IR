We will examine the issue of diffeomorphism symmetry in simplicial models of
(quantum) gravity, in particular for Regge calculus. We find that for a
solution with curvature there do not exist exact gauge symmetries on the
discrete level. Furthermore we derive a canonical formulation that exactly
matches the dynamics and hence symmetries of the covariant picture. In this
canonical formulation broken symmetries lead to the replacements of constraints
by so--called pseudo constraints. These considerations should be taken into
account in attempts to connect spin foam models, based on the Regge action,
with canonical loop quantum gravity, which aims at implementing proper
constraints. We will argue that the long standing problem of finding a
consistent constraint algebra for discretized gravity theories is equivalent to
the problem of finding an action with exact diffeomorphism symmetries. Finally
we will analyze different limits in which the pseudo constraints might turn
into proper constraints. This could be helpful to infer alternative
discretization schemes in which the symmetries are not broken.
