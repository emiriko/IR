Among the mechanisms which successfully explain the generation of the Baryon
Asymmetry of the Universe, Leptogenesis through right-handed neutrino decays is
especially attractive. Unfortunately, this theory suffers from a lack of
testability. Indeed, the high energy relevant ingredients in the asymmetry
creation are either indirectly linked to low energy observables or unreachable
by our present experiments. We propose here to take the problem the other way
around by studying whether this mechanism could at least be disproved. We argue
that the observation of a right handed gauge boson W_R at future colliders
could play this role.
