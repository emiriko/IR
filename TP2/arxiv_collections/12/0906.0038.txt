Quantum transport in mesoscopic conductors is essentially governed by the
laws of quantum mechanics. One of the major open questions of quantum mechanics
is what happens if non-commuting observables are measured simultaneously. Since
current operators at different times do not commute, the high-frequency
correlation functions of the current are realization of this fundamental
quantum question. We formulate this problem in the context of measurements of
finite-frequency current cumulants in a general quantum point contact, which
are the subject to ongoing experimental effort. To this end, we present two
models of detectors that correspond to a weak time-resolved measurement of the
electronic current in a mesoscopic junction. In both cases, the backaction of
the detector leads to observable corrections to the current correlations
functions involving the so-called noise susceptibilities. As a result, we
propose a reinterpretation of environmental corrections to the finite-frequency
cumulants as inevitable effect resulting from basic quantum mechanical
principles. Finally we make concrete predictions for the temperature-,
voltage-, and frequency-dependence of the third cumulant, which could be
verified directly using current experimental techniques.
