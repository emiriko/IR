We study the polarization transport of transverse phonons by adopting a new
approach based on the quantum mechanics of spin-orbit interactions. This
approach has the advantage of being apt for incorporating fluctuations in the
system. The formalism gives rise to Berry effect terms manifested as the Rytov
polarization rotation law and the polarization-dependent Hall effect. We derive
the distribution of the Rytov rotation angle in the presence of thermal noise
and show that the rotation angle is robust against fluctuations.
