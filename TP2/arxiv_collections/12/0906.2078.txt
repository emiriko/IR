For the adhesive contact of elastomers, we propose expressions to quantify
the impact of viscoelastic response on effective adhesion energy as a function
of contact edge velocity. The expressions we propose are simple analytical
functionals of the creep response and should be suitable for experimental data
analysis in terms of measured rheologies. We also emphasize the role of the
coupling between local stress field at the contact edge and the macroscopic
remote loading (far field). We show that the contrast between growing and
receding contact originates from the impact of viscoelastic response on
coupling, while the separation process at the contact edge is similarly
affected by viscoelasticity in both cases.
