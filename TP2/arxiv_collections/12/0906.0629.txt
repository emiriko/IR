We have constructed a phase diagram in temperature-magnetic field-disorder
space for homogeneously disordered superconducting tantalum thin films. Phases
are phenomenologically identified by the nonlinear transport characteristics
that are unique in each phase. The resulting phase diagram shows that a direct
superconductor-insulator transition is prohibited at any disorder because the
superconducting phase is completely surrounded by the intervening metallic
phase.
