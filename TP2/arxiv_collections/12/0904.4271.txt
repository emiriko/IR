We prove an LDP for the empirical measure of complex zeros of a Gaussian
random complex polynomial of degree N of one variable as N tends to infinity.
The Gaussian measure is induced by an inner product defined by a smooth weight
(Hermitian metric) $h$ and a Bernstein-Markov measure $\nu$. The speed is N^2
and the the unique minimizer of the rate function $I$ is the weighted
equilibrium measure $\nu_{h, K}$ with respect to $h$ on the support $K$ of
$\nu$.
