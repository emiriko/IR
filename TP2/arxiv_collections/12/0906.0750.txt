The light emission rate of a single quantum dot can be drastically enhanced
by embedding it in a resonant semiconductor microcavity. This phenomenon is
known as the Purcell effect, and the coupling strength between emitter and
cavity can be quantified by the Purcell factor. The most natural way for
probing the Purcell effect is a time-resolved measurement. However, this
approach is not always the most convenient one, and alternative approaches
based on a continuous-wave measurement are often more appropriate. Various
signatures of the Purcell effect can indeed be observed using continuous-wave
measurements (increase of the pump rate needed to saturate the quantum dot
emission, enhancement of its emission rate at saturation, change of its
radiation pattern), signatures which are encountered when a quantum dot is put
on-resonance with the cavity mode. All these observations potentially allow one
to estimate the Purcell factor. In this paper, we carry out these different
types of measurements for a single quantum dot in a pillar microcavity and we
compare their reliability. We include in the data analysis the presence of
independent, non-resonant emitters in the microcavity environment, which are
responsible for a part of the observed fluorescence.
