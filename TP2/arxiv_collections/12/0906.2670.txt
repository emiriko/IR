We review two recently proposed on-shell schemes for the renormalization of
the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix in the Standard Model.
One first constructs gauge-independent mass counterterm matrices for the up-
and down-type quarks complying with the hermiticity of the complete mass
matrices. Diagonalization of the latter then leads to explicit expressions for
the CKM counterterm matrix, which are gauge independent, preserve unitarity,
and lead to renormalized amplitudes that are non-singular in the limit in which
any two quarks become mass degenerate. One of the schemes also automatically
satisfies flavor democracy.
