The pros and cons of various forms of atomism and holism that are applicable
both in physical science and today's philosophy of nature are evaluated. To
this end, Lewis' thesis of Humean supervenience is presented as an important
case study of an atomistic doctrine in philosophical thought. According to the
thesis of Humean supervenience, the world is fragmented into local matters of
particular fact and everything else supervenes upon them in conjunction with
the spatiotemporal relations among them. It is explicitly shown that Lewis'
ontological doctrine of Humean supervenience incorporates at its foundation the
so-called separability principle of classical physics. In view of the
systematic violation of the latter within quantum mechanics, it is argued that
contemporary physical science posits non-supervenient relations over and above
the spatiotemporal ones. It is demonstrated that the relation of quantum
entanglement constitutes the prototypical example of a holistic, irreducible
physical relation that does not supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of
Humean qualities, undermining, thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It
is concluded, in this respect, that the assumption of ontological reductionism,
as expressed in Lewis' Humean doctrine, cannot be regarded as a reliable code
of the nature of the physical world and its contents. It is proposed instead
that - due to the undeniable existence of generic non-supervenient relations -
a metaphysic of relations of a moderate kind ought to be acknowledged as an
indispensable part of our understanding of the natural world at a fundamental
level.
