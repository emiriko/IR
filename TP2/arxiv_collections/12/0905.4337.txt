We report the results of a time-series CCD photometric survey of variable
stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 2126. In about one square degree
field covering the cluster, a total number of 21 variable candidates are
detected during this survey, of which 16 are newly found. The periods,
classifications and spectral types of 14 newly discovered variables are
discussed, which consist of six eclipsing binaries systems, three pulsating
variable stars, three long period variables, one RS CVn star, and one W UMa or
$\delta$ Scuti star. In addition, there are two variable candidates, the
properties of which cannot be determined in this paper. By a method based on
fitting spectral energy distributions(SEDs) of stars with theoretical ones, the
membership probabilities and the fundamental parameters of this cluster are
determined. As a result, five variables are probably members of NGC 2126. The
fundamental parameters of the this cluster are determined as: the metallicity
to be 0.008 $Z_\odot$, the age $\log(t)$= 8.95, the distance modulus
$(m-M)_{0}$= 10.34 and the reddening value $E(B-V)$=0.55 mag.
