Generalizations of the density-matrix renormalization group method have long
been sought after. In this paper, we assess the accuracy of projected
entangled-pair states on infinite lattices by comparing with Quantum Monte
Carlo results for several non-frustrated spin-1/2 systems. Furthermore, we
apply the method to a frustrated quantum system.
