We extend the quantum-mechanical results of Muller & Saunders (2008)
establishing the weak discernibility of an arbitrary number of similar fermions
in finite-dimensional Hilbert-spaces in two ways: (a) from fermions to bosons
for all finite-dimensional Hilbert-spaces; and (b) from finite-dimensional to
infinite-dimensional Hilbert-spaces for all elementary particles. In both cases
this is performed using operators whose physical significance is beyond
doubt.This confutes the currently dominant view that (A) the quantum-mechanical
description of similar particles conflicts with Leibniz's Principle of the
Identity of Indiscernibles (PII); and that (B) the only way to save PII is by
adopting some pre-Kantian metaphysical notion such as Scotusian haecceittas or
Adamsian primitive thisness. We take sides with Muller & Saunders (2008)
against this currently dominant view, which has been expounded and defended by,
among others, Schr\"odinger, Margenau, Cortes, Dalla Chiara, Di Francia,
Redhead, French, Teller, Butterfield, Mittelstaedt, Giuntini, Castellani,
Krause and Huggett.
