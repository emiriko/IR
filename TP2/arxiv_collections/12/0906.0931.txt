We propose a pump probe experiment for detecting the d-wave superfluid and
d-density wave phases of ultracold Fermions on an optical lattice. The pump
consists of periodic modulations of the optical lattice intensity which creates
quasiparticle pairs in these systems. The changes in the momentum distribution
under the drive can be used to measure quasiparticle dispersion and gap
anisotropy. Further, we show that the pattern of peaks and dips in the spin
selective density-density correlation function provides a phase sensitive probe
of the symmetry of the order parameter in these systems.
