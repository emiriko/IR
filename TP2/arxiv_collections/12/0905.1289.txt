The rare decay B --> K* mu+ mu- is considered to be a golden channel for
LHCb, as the polarization of the K* allows a precise angular reconstruction
resulting in many observables that offer new important tests of the Standard
Model and its extensions. These angular observables can be expressed in terms
of CP-conserving and CP-violating quantities which we study in terms of the
full form factors calculated from QCD sum rules on the light-cone, including
QCD factorization corrections. We investigate all observables in the context of
the Standard Model and various New Physics models, in particular the Littlest
Higgs model with T-parity and various MSSM scenarios, identifying those
observables with small to moderate dependence on hadronic quantities and large
impact of New Physics.
