We study the interplay of quantum statistics, strong interactions and finite
temperatures in the two-component (spinor) Bose gas with repulsive
delta-function interactions in one dimension. Using the Thermodynamic Bethe
Ansatz, we obtain the equation of state, population densities and local density
correlation numerically as a function of all physical parameters (interaction,
temperature and chemical potentials), quantifying the full crossover between
low-temperature ferromagnetic and high-temperature unpolarized regimes. In
contrast to the single-component, Lieb-Liniger gas, nonmonotonic behaviour of
the local density correlation as a function of temperature is observed.
