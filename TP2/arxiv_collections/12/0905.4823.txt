Scalar fields with $SU(2)_L$ quantum numbers provide several viable Dark
Matter candidates around the TeV scale. Thanks to scalar quartic interactions,
the observed relic density can be obtained for a large range of masses, which
we determine. In turn, the constraints on the scalar couplings lead to testable
predictions in future direct and indirect searches.
