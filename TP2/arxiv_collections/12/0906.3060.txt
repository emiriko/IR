Re-analysis of experimental data on primary gamma-transitions averaged over
some energy intervals of neutron resonances has been performed. Approximation
of their cumulative sums together with extrapolation of the obtained
distribution to zero value allowed us to determine mean intensities of of E1-
and M1-transitions, their probable number and total dispersion of intensity
deviations from the mean value. The level density and sum of radiative strength
functions determined in this way confirm main peculiarities of these nuclear
parameters determined from intensities of the two-step gamma-cascades.
