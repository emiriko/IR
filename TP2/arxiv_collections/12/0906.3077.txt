We withdraw our claim that a component in an XMM-Newton satellite light curve
of the BL Lacertae object S5 0716 + 714 shows quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) of $\sim$30 minutes. Although both our original periodogram and wavelet
analyses gave consistent results, the data do not lead to a statistically
significant result once red-noise at low frequencies is properly taken into
account for periodogram analyses.
