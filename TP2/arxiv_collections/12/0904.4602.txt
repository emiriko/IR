The fluorescence decay-time constants have been measured for several
scintillator mixtures based on phenyl-o-xylylethane (PXE) and linear
alkylbenzene (LAB) solvents. The resulting values are of relevance for the
physics performance of the proposed large-volume liquid scintillator detector
LENA (Low Energy Neutrino Astronomy). In particular, the impact of the measured
values to the search for proton decay via p -> K+ antineutrino is evaluated in
this work.
