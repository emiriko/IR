This pseudo-paper consists of excerpts drawn from two of my quantum-email
samizdats. Section 1 draws a picture of a physical world whose essence is
``Darwinism all the way down.'' Section 2 outlines how quantum theory should be
viewed in light of this, i.e., as being an expression of probabilism (in Bruno
de Finetti or Richard Jeffrey's sense) all the way back up. Section 3 describes
how the idea of ``identical'' quantum measurement outcomes, though sounding
atomistic in character, nonetheless meshes well with a Jamesian style ``radical
pluralism.'' Sections 4 and 5 further detail how quantum theory should not be
viewed so much as a ``theory of the world,'' but rather as a theory of
decision-making for agents immersed within a world of a particular
character--the quantum world. Finally, Sections 6 and 7 attempt to sketch the
very positive sense in which quantum theory is incomplete, but still just as
complete is it can be. In total, I hope these heady speculations convey some of
the excitement and potential I see for the malleable world quantum mechanics
hints of.
