Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) in $ep$ collisions has emerged in
recent years as a an essential reaction to obtain information on the
correlation of partons in the hadron (proton) or on the transverse distribution
of these partons. In these proceedings, we examine the lattest data from HERA
(at low $x_{Bj}<10^{-2}$) and their impact on models. We analyse in detail what
these data imply on the spatial structure of the proton. In particular, the
most recent measurements of the Beam Charge Asymmetry by the H1 experiment is
discussed in this context. Perspectives are presented for further measurements
of DVCS cross sections at CERN, within the COMPASS experiment.
