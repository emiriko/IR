We express the AdS-Schwarzschild black-hole configuration in coordinates such
that the boundary metric is of the FLRW type. We review how this construction
can be used in order to calculate the stress-energy tensor of the dual CFT on
the FLRW background. We deduce the temperature and entropy of the CFT, which
are related to the temperature and entropy of the black hole. We find that the
entropy is proportional to the area of an apparent horizon, different from the
black-hole event horizon. For a dS boundary we reproduce correctly the
intrinsic temperature of dS space.
