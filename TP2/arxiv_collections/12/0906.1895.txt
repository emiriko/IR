We probe the magnetotransport properties of individual InAs nanowires in a
field effect transistor geometry. In the low magnetic field regime we observe
magnetoresistance that is well described by the weak localization (WL)
description in diffusive conductors. The weak localization correction is
modified to weak anti-localization (WAL) as the gate voltage is increased. We
show that the gate voltage can be used to tune the phase coherence length
($l_\phi$) and spin-orbit length ($l_{so}$) by a factor of $\sim$ 2. In the
high field and low temperature regime we observe the mobility of devices can be
modified significantly as a function of magnetic field. We argue that the role
of skipping orbits and the nature of surface scattering is essential in
understanding high field magnetotransport in nanowires.
