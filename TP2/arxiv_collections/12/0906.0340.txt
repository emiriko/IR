Density scaling has a rich history in density functional theory, providing
exact conditions for use in the construction of ever more accurate
approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation functional. We define a
conjugate potential scaling for each density scaling. This provides exact
relations on various important density functionals, in particular, relating
functionals evaluated on exact densities of different potentials. We illustrate
these conditions on the two- and four-electron ion series.
