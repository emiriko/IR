We propose, analyze, and demonstrate a discontinuous Galerkin method for
fractal conservation laws. Various stability estimates are established along
with error estimates for regular solutions of linear equations. Moreover, in
the nonlinear case and whenever piecewise constant elements are utilized, we
prove a rate of convergence toward the unique entropy solution. We present
numerical results for different types of solutions of linear and nonlinear
fractal conservation laws.
