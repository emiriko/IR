Dusty disks around young stars are formed out of interstellar dust that
consists of amorphous, submicrometre grains. Yet the grains found in comets and
meteorites, and traced in the spectra of young stars, include large crystalline
grains that must have undergone annealing or condensation at temperatures in
excess of 1,000 K, even though they are mixed with surrounding material that
never experienced temperatures as high as that. This prompted theories of
large-scale mixing capable of transporting thermally altered grains from the
inner, hot part of accretion disks to outer, colder disk region, but all have
assumptions that may be problematic. Here I report that infrared radiation
arising from the dusty disk can loft grains bigger than one micrometre out of
the inner disk, whereupon they are pushed outwards by stellar radiation
pressure while gliding above the disk. Grains re-enter the disk at radii where
it is too cold to produce sufficient infrared radiation pressure support for a
given grain size and solid density. Properties of the observed disks suggest
that this process might be active in almost all young stellar objects and young
brown dwarfs.
