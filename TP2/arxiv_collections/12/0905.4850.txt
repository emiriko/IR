Web applications are becoming truly pervasive in all kinds of business models
and organizations. Today, most critical systems such as those related to health
care, banking, or even emergency response, are relying on these applications.
They must therefore include, in addition to the expected value offered to their
users, reliable mechanisms to ensure their security. In this paper, we focus on
the specific problem of cross-site scripting attacks against web applications.
We present a study of this kind of attacks, and survey current approaches for
their prevention. Applicability and limitations of each proposal are also
discussed.
