Recent results from experiments like PAMELA have pointed to excesses of e+e-
in cosmic rays. If interpreted in terms of Dark Matter annihilations, they
imply the existence of an abundant population of e+e- in the galactic halo at
large. We consider the high energy gamma ray fluxes produced by Inverse Compton
scattering of interstellar photons on such e+e-, and compare them with the
available data from EGRET and some preliminary data from FERMI. We consider
different observation regions of the sky and a range of DM masses, annihilation
channels and DM profiles. We find that large portions of the parameter space
are excluded, in particular for DM masses larger than 1 TeV, for leptonic
annihilation channels and for benchmark Einasto or NFW profiles.
