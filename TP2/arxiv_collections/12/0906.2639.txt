A single impurity problem is investigated for multiband s-wave
superconductors with different sign order parameters (+-s-wave superconductors)
suggested in Fe-pnictide superconductors. Not only intraband but also interband
scattering is considered at the impurity. The latter gives rise to
impurity-induced local boundstates close to the impurity. We present an exact
form of the energy of the local boundstates as a function of strength of the
two types of impurity scattering. The essential role of the impurity is
unchanged in finite number of impurities. The main conclusions for a single
impurity problem help us understand effects of dense impurities in the +-s-wave
superconductors. Local density of states around the single impurity is also
investigated. We suggest impurity site nuclear magnetic resonance as a suitable
experiment to probe the local boundstates that is peculiar to the +-s-wave
state. We find that the +-s-wave model is mapped to a chiral dx2-y2+-idxy-wave,
reflecting the unconventional nature of the sign reversing order parameter. For
a quantum magnetic impurity, interband scattering destabilizes the Kondo
singlet.
