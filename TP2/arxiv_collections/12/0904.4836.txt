Our project aims at supporting the creation of sustainable and meaningful
longer-term human-robot relationships through the creation of embodied robots
with face recognition and natural language dialogue capabilities, which exploit
and publish social information available on the web (Facebook). Our main
underlying experimental hypothesis is that such relationships can be
significantly enhanced if the human and the robot are gradually creating a pool
of shared episodic memories that they can co-refer to (shared memories), and if
they are both embedded in a social web of other humans and robots they both
know and encounter (shared friends). In this paper, we are presenting such a
robot, which as we will see achieves two significant novelties.
