We analyse the time evolution of two open source Java projects: Eclipse and
Netbeans, both developed following agile practices, though to a different
extent. Our study is centered on quality analysis of the systems, measured as
defects absence, and its relation with software metrics evolution. The two
projects are described through a software graph in which nodes are represented
by Java files and edges describe the existing relation between nodes. We
propose a metrics suite for Java files based on Chidamber and Kemerer suite,
and use it to study software evolution and its relationship with bug count.
