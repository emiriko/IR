We study normal functions capturing D-brane superpotentials on several one-
and two-parameter Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and complete intersections in
weighted projective space. We calculate in the B-model and interpret the
results using mirror symmetry in the large volume regime, albeit without
identifying the precise A-model geometry in all cases. We identify new classes
of extensions of Picard-Fuchs equations, as well as a novel type of topology
changing phase transition involving quantum D-branes. A 4-d domain wall which
is obtained in one region of closed string moduli space from wrapping a
four-chain interpolating between two Lagrangian submanifolds is, for other
values of the parameters, represented by a disk ending on a single Lagrangian.
