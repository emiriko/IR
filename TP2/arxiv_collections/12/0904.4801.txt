In this article we propose to simulate acoustic black holes with ions in
rings. If the ions are rotating with a stationary and inhomogeneous velocity
profile, regions can appear where the ion velocity exceeds the group velocity
of the phonons. In these regions phonons are trapped like light in black holes,
even though we have a discrete field theory and a nonlinear dispersion
relation. We study the appearance of Hawking radiation in this setup and
propose a scheme to detect it.
