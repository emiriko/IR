In this note we propose a method to classify homogeneous nilpotent elements
in a real $Z_m$-graded semisimple Lie algebra $g$. Using this we describe the
set of orbits of homogeneous elements in a real $Z_2$-graded semisimple Lie
algebra. A classification of 4-vectors (resp. 4-forms) on $R^8$ can be given
using this method.
