The ability to accumulate and retrieve entanglement in the fields of two
remote cavities with pairs of two-level atoms is discussed. It is shown that
this transfer and retrieval can be indeed ideal with a resonant interaction.
The case of initial non-maximally entangled atomic pairs is also considered.
This leads to the possibility of concentrating entanglement into a single pair
at the retrieval stage. A teleportation protocol based on the same setup is
presented. This makes possible teleportation with built-in entanglement
concentration.
