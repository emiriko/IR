Starting from the effective low energy theory of a doped Mott insulator, we
show that the effective carrier density in the underdoped regime agrees with a
two - fluid description. Namely, it has distinct temperature independent and
thermally activated components. We identify the thermally activated component
as the bound state of a hole and a charge 2e boson, which occurs naturally in
the effective theory. The thermally activated unbinding of this state leads to
the strange metal and subsequent $T-$linear resistivity. We find that the
doping dependence of the binding energy is in excellent agreement with the
experimentally determined pseudogap energy scale in cuprate superconductors.
