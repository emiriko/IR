We present Doppler and modulation tomography of the X-ray nova XTE J1118+480
with data obtained during quiescence using the 10-m Keck II telescope. The hot
spot where the gas stream hits the accretion disc is seen in H-Alpha, H-Beta,
He I Lambda-5876, and Ca II Lambda-8662, thus verifying the presence of
continued mass transfer within the system. The disc is clearly seen in H-Alpha
and Ca II Lambda-8662. We image the mass-donor star in narrow absorption lines
of Na I Lambda-Lambda-5890, 5896, 8183, 8195 and Ca II Lambda-8662, implying an
origin from the secondary itself rather than the interstellar medium. We also
detect deviations in the centroid of the double peak of H-Alpha akin to those
found by Zurita et al. 2002 suggesting disc eccentricity.
