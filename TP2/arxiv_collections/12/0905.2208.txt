On the basis of negative transport coefficients, it has been argued that the
quantum oscillations observed in underdoped YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+x) in high magnetic
fields must be due to antinodal electron pockets. We point out a counter
example in which electron-like transport in a hole-doped cuprate is associated
with Fermi-arc states. We also present evidence that the antinodal gap in
YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+x) is robust to modest applied magnetic fields. We suggest that
these observations should be taken into account when interpreting the results
of the quantum oscillation experiments.
