The supercurrent transport in metallic Josephson tunnel junctions with an
additional interlayer made up by chromium, being an itinerant antiferromagnet,
was studied. Uniform Josephson coupling was observed as a function of the
magnetic field. The supercurrent shows a weak dependence on the interlayer
thickness for thin chromium layers and decays exponentially for thicker films.
The diffusion constant and the coherence length in the antiferromagnet were
estimated. The antiferromagnetic state of the barrier was indirectly verified
using reference samples. Our results are compared to macroscopic and
microscopic models.
