Decaying electron magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) turbulence in three dimensions
is studied via high-resolution numerical simulations. The resulting energy
spectra asymptotically approach a k^{-2} law with increasing R_B, the ratio of
the nonlinear to linear timescales in the governing equation, consistent with
theoretical predictions. No evidence is found of a dissipative cutoff,
consistent with non-local spectral energy transfer and recent studies of 2D
EMHD turbulence. Dissipative cutoffs found in previous studies are explained as
artificial effects of hyperdiffusivity. In another similarity to 2D EMHD
turbulence, relatively stationary structures are found to develop in time,
rather than the variability found in ordinary or MHD turbulence. Further,
cascades of energy in 3D EMHD turbulence are found to be suppressed in all
directions under the influence of a uniform background field. Energy transfer
is further reduced in the direction parallel to the field, displaying scale
dependent anisotropy. Finally, the governing equation is found to yield a weak
inverse cascade, at least partially transferring magnetic energy from small to
large scales.
