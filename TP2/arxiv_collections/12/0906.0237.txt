Power analysis attacks against embedded secret key cryptosystems are widely
studied since the seminal paper of Paul Kocher, Joshua Ja, and Benjamin Jun in
1998 where has been introduced the powerful Differential Power Analysis. The
strength of DPA is such that it became necessary to develop sound and efficient
countermeasures. Nowadays embedded cryptographic primitives usually integrate
one or several of these countermeasures (e.g. masking techniques, asynchronous
designs, balanced dynamic dual-rail gates designs, noise adding, power
consumption smoothing, etc. ...). This document presents a simple, yet
interesting, countermeasure to DPA and HO-DPA attacks, called brutal
countermeasure and new power analysis attacks using multi-linear approximations
(MLPA attacks) based on very recent and still unpublished results of Tavernier
et al..
