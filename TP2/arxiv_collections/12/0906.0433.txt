We report pulsed laser deposition synthesis and characterization of
polycrystalline Fe1-xCox Si thin films on Si (111). X-ray diffraction,
transmission electron, and atomic force microscopies reveal films to be dense,
very smooth, and single phase with a cubic B20 crystal structure.
Ferromagnetism with significant magnetic hysteresis is found for all films
including nominally pure FeSi films in contrast to the very weak paramagnetism
of bulk FeSi. For Fe1-xCoxSi this signifies a change from helimagnetism in
bulk, to ferromagnetism in thin films. These ferromagnetic thin films are
promising as a magnetic-silicide/silicon system for polarized current
production, manipulation, and detection.
