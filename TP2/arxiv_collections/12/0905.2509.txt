The Web 2.0 fosters the creation of communities by offering users a wide
array of social software tools. While the success of these tools is based on
their ability to support different interaction patterns among users by imposing
as few limitations as possible, the communities they support are not free of
rules (just think about the posting rules in a community forum or the editing
rules in a thematic wiki). In this paper we propose a framework for the sharing
of best community practices in the form of a (potentially rule-based)
annotation layer that can be integrated with existing Web 2.0 community tools
(with specific focus on wikis). This solution is characterized by minimal
intrusiveness and plays nicely within the open spirit of the Web 2.0 by
providing users with behavioral hints rather than by enforcing the strict
adherence to a set of rules.
