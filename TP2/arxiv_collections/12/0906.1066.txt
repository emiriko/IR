We discuss first the flavor mixing of the quarks, using the texture zero mass
matrices. Then we study a similar model for the mass matrices of the leptons.
We are able to relate the mass eigenvalues of the charged leptons and of the
neutrinos to the mixing angles and can predict the masses of the neutrinos. We
find a normal hierarchy - the masses are 0.004 eV, 0.01 eV and 0.05 eV. The
atmospheric mixing angle is given by the mass ratios of the charged leptons and
the neutrinos. we find about 40 degrees, consistent with the experiments. The
mixing element, connecting the first neutrino wit the electron, is predicted to
be 0.05. This prediction can soon be checked by the Daya Bay experiment.
