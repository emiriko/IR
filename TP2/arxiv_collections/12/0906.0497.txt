Single-crystals of the new ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe have been
grown. The quality of as-grown samples can be significantly improved by a
heat-treatment procedure, which increases the residual resistance ratio (RRR)
from ~5 to ~30. Magnetization and resistivity measurements show the annealed
samples have a sharp ferromagnetic transition with a Curie temperature T_C is
2.8 K. The ordered moment of 0.06 mu_B is directed along the orthorhombic
c-axis. Superconductivity is found below a resistive transition temperature T_s
= 0.65 K.
