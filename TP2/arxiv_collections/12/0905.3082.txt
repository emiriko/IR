We consider the trace map associated with the silver ratio Schrodinger
operator as a diffeomorphism on the invariant surface associated with a given
coupling constant and prove that the non-wandering set of this map is
hyperbolic if the coupling is sufficiently large. As a consequence, for this
values of the coupling constant, the local and global Hausdorff dimension and
the local and global box counting dimension of the spectrum of this operator
all coincide and are smooth functions of the coupling constant.
