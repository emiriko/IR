basic education, waking up changes that represent a challenge for teachers, who
besides are adapted to new academic loads, they face an approach different in
the treatment from the new themes. Beyond the conflicts that all reform can
generate, the present paper is not a political or social analysis, but it
approaches some differences between authorities of Secretaria de Educacion
Publica (Public Education Secretary) and teachers, studying the implications of
the new curriculum of Sciences II (Physics). Additionally, it is considers the

school by active learning.
