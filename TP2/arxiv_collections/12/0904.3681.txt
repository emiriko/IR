In this paper, it is proved that, if a toric ideal possesses a fundamental
binomial none of whose monomials is squarefree, then the corresponding
semigroup ring is not very ample. Moreover, very ample semigroup rings of
Lawrence type are discussed. As an application, we study very ampleness of
configurations arising from contingency tables.
