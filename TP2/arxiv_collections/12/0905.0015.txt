Some of the algorithms for solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle can be applied
"with eyes closed" or "without memory". Here we survey the solution for the
classical Tower of Hanoi that uses finite automata, as well as some variations
on the original puzzle. In passing, we obtain a new result on morphisms
generating the classical and the lazy Tower of Hanoi.
