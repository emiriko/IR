Without any analytical assumption we solve the ladder QED2+1 in Minkowski
space. Further, we transform Greens functions to the Temporal Euclidean space,
wherein we show that in the special case of ladder QED2+1 the solution is fully
equivalent to the Minkowski one. QCD quark gap equation is solved in the
framework of Temporal Euclidean space as well. In both models, the obtained
complex fermion propagators exhibits confinement, since it does not satisfies
Khallen-Lehmann representation.
