Metropolized integrators for ergodic stochastic differential equations (SDE)
are proposed which (i) are ergodic with respect to the (known) equilibrium
distribution of the SDE and (ii) approximate pathwise the solutions of the SDE
on finite time intervals. Both these properties are demonstrated in the paper
and precise strong error estimates are obtained. It is also shown that the
Metropolized integrator retains these properties even in situations where the
drift in the SDE is nonglobally Lipschitz, and vanilla explicit integrators for
SDEs typically become unstable and fail to be ergodic.
