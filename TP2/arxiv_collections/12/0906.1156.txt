We investigated noncollinear second harmonic generation form Zinc oxide
films, grown on glass substrates by dual ion beam sputtering technique. At a
fixed incidence angle, the generated signal is investigated by scanning the
polarization state of both fundamental beams. We show that the map of the
generated signal as a function of polarization states of both pump beams,
together with the analytical curves, allows to retrieve the orientation of the
optical axis and, eventually, its angular tilt, with respect to the surface
normal
