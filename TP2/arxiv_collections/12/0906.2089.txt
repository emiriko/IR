This work reports on the experimental investigation of surface plasmon
polaritons (SPP) on cylindrical wires of small diameters. Applying a new
technique that was developed by this group and recently reported, single wire
and wire array samples of gold (Au) and silver (Ag) with small diameters 400nm
< D < 3 mum and high aspect ratios <= 75000 in photonic crystal fibers and
single hole capillaries are fabricated. Additionally, effective bulk metal
wires of Au and Ag are created by a hybrid technique, including fiber tapering
and magnetron sputter deposition for a large number of different diameters
between 13 mum to 50 mum.
  The measurement of the absorption, corresponding to the excitation of SPP
modes is realized with a new goniometer-based experimental setup for oblique
incidence laser beam scattering at a single wavelength. A device is developed
that allows a simultaneous measurement of the scattering amplitude in s- and
p-polarization under varied incident angle.
  For comparison, a model for the dispersion of discrete SPP modes and their
angles of excitation is derived. The computed results are for the first time
compared with a theoretical approach to electromagnetic scattering theory for
cylinders, that is calculated analogue to Mie scattering and to an exact
solution of Maxwell's equations for cylindrical SPP. The validity of the model
is proved for higher incident angles. The first oblique incidence examination
of SPP on metal wires for this size range is reported. The experimental results
for low incident angles show good accordance to the numerical results from
scattering theory.
