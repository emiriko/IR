We theoretically investigate the interaction of a single quantum dipole with
the modes of a fiber-coupled semiconductor waveguide. Through a combination of
tight modal confinement and phase-matched evanescent coupling, we predict that
approximately 70 % of the dipole's emission can be collected into a single mode
optical fiber. Calculations further show that the dipole strongly modifies
resonant light transmission through the system, with over an order of magnitude
change possible for an appropriate choice of fiber-waveguide coupler geometry.
