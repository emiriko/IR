It is a classical result, due to F. Tricceri, that the blow-up of a manifold
of locally conformally K\"ahler (l.c.K. for short) type at some point is again
of l.c.K. type. However, the proof given in \cite{Tric} is somehow unclear. We
give a different argument to prove the result, using "standard tricks" in
algebraic geometry
