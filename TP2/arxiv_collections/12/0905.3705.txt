We show that there is a complex structure on the symplectic 4-manifold $W_{4,
k}$ obtained from the elliptic surface E(4) by rationally blowing down $k$
sections for $2\le k\le 9$. And we interpret it via ${\mathbb Q}$-Gorenstein
smoothing. This answers affirmatively to a question raised by R. Gompf.
