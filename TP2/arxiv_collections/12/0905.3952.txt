The photocurrent properties of freely suspended single-walled carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) are investigated as a function of uniaxial strain. We observe
that at low strain, the photocurrent signal of the CNTs increases for
increasing strain, while for large strain, the signal decreases, respectively.
We interpret the non-monotonous behavior by a superposition of the influence of
the uniaxial strain on the resistivity of the CNTs and the effects caused by
Schottky contacts between the CNTs and the metal contacts.
