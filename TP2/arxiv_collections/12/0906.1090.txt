Weibel instability turns out to be the a ubiquitous phenomenon in High-Energy
Density environments, ranging from astrophysical sources, e.g., gamma-ray
bursts, to laboratory experiments involving laser-produced plasmas.
Relativistic particles (electrons) radiate in the Weibel-produced magnetic
fields in the Jitter regime. Conventionally, in this regime, the particle
deflections are considered to be smaller than the relativistic beaming angle of
1/$\gamma$ ($\gamma$ being the Lorentz factor of an emitting particle) and the
particle distribution is assumed to be isotropic. This is a relatively
idealized situation as far as lab experiments are concerned. We relax the
assumption of the isotropy of radiating particle distribution and present the
extension of the jitter theory amenable for comparisons with experimental data.
