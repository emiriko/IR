A novel aluminium rich alloy for hydrogen storage has been discovered,
ScAl0.8Mg0.2, which has superior properties regarding hydrogen storage
capacity, kinetics and stability towards air oxidation in comparison to
hydrogen absorption in state-of-the-art intermetallic compounds. Detailed
analysis of the hydrogen absorption in ScAl0.8Mg0.2 has been performed using in
situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction
and quantum mechanical calculations. The results from calculations and
experiments are in good agreement with each other.
