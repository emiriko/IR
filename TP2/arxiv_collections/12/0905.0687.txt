The time delay of light as it passes by a massive object, first calculated by
Shapiro in 1964, is a hallmark of the curvature of space-time. To date, all
measurements of the Shapiro time delay have been made over solar-system
distance scales. We show that the new generation of kilometer-scale laser
interferometers being constructed as gravitational wave detectors, in
particular Advanced LIGO, will in principle be sensitive enough to measure
variations in the Shapiro time delay produced by a suitably designed rotating
object placed near the laser beam. We show that such an apparatus is feasible
(though not easy) to construct, present an example design, and calculate the
signal that would be detectable by Advanced LIGO. This offers the first
opportunity to measure space-time curvature effects on a laboratory distance
scale.
