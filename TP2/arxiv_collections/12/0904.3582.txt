We propose an experimental scheme to detect unambiguously parity-mxing of
Cooper pairs in noncentrosymmetric superconductors, which utilizes crossed
Andreev reflection processes between two oppositely spin-polarized normal metal
leads and a noncentrosymmetric superconductor. It is demonstrated that a
non-local conductance exhibits a clear signature of parity breaking of Cooper
pairs, and thus, can be a direct probe for the parity-mixing.
