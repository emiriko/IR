We model the formation of silicate atmospheres on hot volatile-free
super-Earths. Our calculations assume that all volatile elements such as H, C,
N, S, and Cl have been lost from the planet. We find that the atmospheres are
composed primarily of Na, O2, O, and SiO gas, in order of decreasing abundance.
The atmospheric composition may be altered by fractional vaporization, cloud
condensation, photoionization, and reaction with any residual volatile elements
remaining in the atmosphere. Cloud condensation reduces the abundance of all
elements in the atmosphere except Na and K. We speculate that large Na and K
clouds such as those observed around Mercury and Io may surround hot
super-Earths. These clouds would occult much larger fractions of the parent
star than a closely bound atmosphere, and may be observable through currently
available methods.
