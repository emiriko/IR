This paper deals with a model of cellular growth called "Epigenetic
Tracking", whose key features are: i) distinction bewteen "normal" and "driver"
cells; ii) presence in driver cells of an epigenetic memory, that holds the
position of the cell in the driver cell lineage tree and represents the source
of differentiation during development. In the first part of the paper the model
is proved able to generate arbitrary target shapes of unmatched size and
variety by means of evo-devo techniques, thus being validated as a model of
embryogenesis and cellular differentiation. In the second part of the paper it
is shown how the model can produce artificial counterparts for some key aspects
of multicellular biology, such as junk DNA, ageing and carcinogenesis. If
individually each of these topics has been the subject of intense investigation
and modelling effort, to our knowledge no single model or theory seeking to
cover all of them under a unified framework has been put forward as yet: this
work contains such a theory, which makes Epigenetic Tracking a potential basis
for a project of Artificial Biology.
