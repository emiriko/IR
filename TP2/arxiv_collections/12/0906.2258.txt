Whispering Gallery modes in bulk cylindrical Gallium Arsenide and Gallium
Phosphide samples have been examined both in darkness and under white light at
cryogenics temperatures < 50 K. In both cases persistent photoconductivity was
observed after initially exposing semiconductors to white light from a halogen
lamp. Photoconductance decay time constants for GaP and GaAs were determined to
be 0.900 +/- 0.081 ns and 1.098 +/- 0.063 ns, respectively, using this method.
