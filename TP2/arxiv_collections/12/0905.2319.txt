Amorphous silica density at ambient pressure is known to depend on thermal
history (through the quenching rate) but also, at room temperature, on the
maximum pressure applied in the past. Here we show that beyond density, a
mechanical loading can endow the structure with an orientational order.
Molecular dynamics simulations show evidence that amorphous silica develops a
permanent anisotropic structure after extended shear plastic flow. This
anisotropy which survives for an unstressed specimen is revealed markedly by
the fabric tensor computed over the Si-O-Si orientations, albeit the SiO4
tetrahedra microstructure remains mostly unaltered.
