The aim of this paper is to test numerically the predictions of the Mode
Coupling Theory (MCT) of the glass transition and study its finite size scaling
properties in a model with an exact MCT transition, which we choose to be the
fully connected Random Orthogonal Model. Surprisingly, some predictions are
verified while others seem clearly violated, with inconsistent values of some
MCT exponents. We show that this is due to strong pre-asymptotic effects that
disappear only in a surprisingly narrow region around the critical point. Our
study of Finite Size Scaling (FSS) show that standard theory valid for pure
systems fails because of strong sample to sample fluctuations. We propose a
modified form of FSS that accounts well for our results. {\it En passant,} we
also give new theoretical insights about FSS in disordered systems above their
upper critical dimension. Our conclusion is that the quantitative predictions
of MCT are exceedingly difficult to test even for models for which MCT is
exact. Our results highlight that some predictions are more robust than others.
This could provide useful guidance when dealing with experimental data.
