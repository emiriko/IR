We have performed a holographic calculation of the hadronic contributions to
the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, using the gauge/gravity duality. We
study a model of holographic QCD in the five dimensional AdS background with a
hard-wall cutoff. Both 5D SU(2) and U(3) flavor gauge symmetries are considered
for the neutral pion, eta and eta' contributions to the hadronic corrections.
We find the total light-by-light contributions of pseudo scalars to the muon
anomalous magnetic moment, a_mu=10.7 x 10^(-10), which is consistent with
previous estimates, based on other approaches.
