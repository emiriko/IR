The present paper is a sequel to the paper by Karchev (2008
J.Phys.:Condens.Matter {\bf 20} 325219). A two-sublattice ferrimagnet, with
spin-$s_1$ operators $\bf{S_{1i}}$ at the sublattice $A$ site and spin-$s_2$
operators $\bf{S_{2i}}$ at the sublattice $B$ site, is considered. Renormalized
spin-wave theory, which accounts for the magnon-magnon interaction, and its
extension are developed to describe the two ferrimagnetic phases $(0,T^*)$ and
$(T^*,T_N)$ in the system, and to calculate the magnetization as a function of
temperature.
  The influence of the parameters in the theory on the characteristic
temperatures $T_N$ and $T^*$ is studied. It is shown that, increasing the
inter-sublattice exchange interaction, the ratio $T_N/T^*>1$ decreases
approaching one, and above some critical value of the exchange constant there
is only one phase $T_N = T^*$, and the magnetization-temperature curve has the
typical Curie-Weiss profile. When the intra-exchange constant of sublattice
with stronger intra-exchange interaction increases the $Ne\grave{e}l$
temperature increases while $T^*$ remains unchanged. Finally, when the magnetic
order of the sublattice with smaller magnetic order decreases, $T^*$ decreases.
The theoretical predictions are utilize to interpret the experimentally
measured magnetization-temperature curves.
