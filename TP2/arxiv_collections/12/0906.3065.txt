Existing algorithms for isolating real solutions of zero-dimensional
polynomial systems do not compute the multiplicities of the solutions. In this
paper, we define in a natural way the multiplicity of solutions of
zero-dimensional triangular polynomial systems and prove that our definition is
equivalent to the classical definition of local (intersection) multiplicity.
Then we present an effective and complete algorithm for isolating real
solutions with multiplicities of zero-dimensional triangular polynomial systems
using our definition. The algorithm is based on interval arithmetic and
square-free factorization of polynomials with real algebraic coefficients. The
computational results on some examples from the literature are presented.
