We give a derivation of tagged particle processes from unlabeled interacting
Brownian motions. We give a criteria of the non-explosion property of tagged
particle processes. We prove the quasi-regularity of Dirichlet forms describing
the environment seen from the tagged particle, which were used in previous
papers to prove the invariance principle of tagged particles of interacting
Brownian motions.
