We propose to use transformation optics to generate a general illusion such
that an arbitrary object appears to be like some other object of our choice.
This is achieved by using a remote device that transforms the scattered light
outside a virtual boundary into that of the object chosen for the illusion,
regardless of the profile of the incident wave. This type of illusion device
also enables people to see through walls. Our work extends the concept of
cloaking as a special form of illusion to the wider realm of illusion optics.
