In all modern hadronic colliders, jets recieve a large contribution from a
soft background: pileup in the case of proton-proton collisions at the LHC, or
the underlying event for heavy-ion collisions at RHIC or the LHC. In these
proceedings, we present a generic and simple method, based on jet areas, to
subtract the contribution of the soft background from the jets. This allows for
more precise kinematic reconstruction of jets in dense environments.
