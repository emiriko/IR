All the modern day applications have the interface, absolutely defined by the
developers. The use of adaptive interface or dynamic layout allows some
variations, but even all of them are predetermined on the design stage, because
the best reaction (from designer's view) on any possible users' movement was
hardcoded. But there is a different world of applications, totally constructed
on moveable / resizable elements; such applications turn the full control to
the users. The crucial thing in such programs is that not something but
everything must become moveable and resizable. This article describes the
features of such applications and the algorithm behind their design.
