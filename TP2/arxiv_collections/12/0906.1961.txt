We have measured time-resolved the photon storage time and the quality factor
of an ultrafast photonic cavity using an autocorrelator. The cavity consists of
a $\lambda$-thick GaAs layer sandwiched between GaAs/AlAs distributed Bragg
reflectors and resonates at 985 nm wavelength. The inverse relative linewidth
measured with white light reflectivity is 830, while the quality factor
obtained from the time resolved measurements is 1500. The photon storage time
in the cavity is 0.78 ps. We show that the difference between the quality
factor and the inverse relative linewidth results from inhomogeneous broadening
of the microcavity resonance due to a spatial gradient in the cavity layer.
