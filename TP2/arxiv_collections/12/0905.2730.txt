Analytical solutions of Maxwell equations in background spacetime of black
hole in braneworld immersed in external uniform magnetic field have been found.
Influence of both magnetic and brane parameters on effective potential of the
radial motion of charged test particle around slowly rotating black hole in
braneworld immersed in uniform magnetic field has been investigated by using
Hamilton-Jacobi method. Exact analytical solution for dependence of the radius
of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) $r_{\rm ISCO}$ from brane
parameter for motion of test particle around nonrotating isolated black hole in
braneworld has been derived. It has been shown that radius $r_{\rm ISCO}$ is
monotonically growing with the increase of module of brane tidal charge.
Comparison of the predictions on $r_{\rm ISCO}$ of the brane world model and of
the observational results of ISCO from relativistic accretion disks around
black holes provided upper limit for brane tidal charge $\lesssim 10^9 {\rm
cm}^2$.
