The results of the investigation of impact of pulse humidity changes on the
parameters of dynamic current-voltage loops and charge-voltage loops, and also
dynamic transient currents for Pt/LiNbO3-film/Pt:Ti/SiO2/Si and porous Si/Si
structures are presented. The peculiarities of current-voltage loops and
transient currents curves are characteristic for poling processes in the space
charge region similar to that observed in the case of ionic semiconductors. The
efficiency of using the methods of dynamic electrophysical characterization for
studying characteristics of various under fast humidity changes was
demonstrated. The results are considered from the standpoint of applications in
high-speed humidity sensing.
