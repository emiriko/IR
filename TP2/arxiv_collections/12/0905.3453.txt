The aim of the present work is to study the radio emission on the parsec
scale of 4C 26.42, the Brightest cluster galaxy in Abell 1795, in the framework
of radiosources in a dense cool core cluster. We present Very Long Baseline
Array (VLBA) observations at 1.6, 5, 8.4 and 22 GHz. We performed a spectral
index and multiepoch analysis. The source appears two-sided with a well defined
and symmetric Z-structure at ~5 mas from the core. The kiloparsec-scale
morphology is similar to the parsec-scale structure, but reversed in P.A., with
symmetric 90 deg. bends at about 2 arcsec from the nuclear region. Comparing
data obtained at 3 different epochs we derive a 3$\sigma$ limit to the apparent
proper motion of $\beta_a$ < 0.04. We suggest that the parsec-scale jets are
sub-relativistic, in contrast with the high velocities found for most low-power
radio galaxies. The origin of the unusual radio morphology remains a puzzle. We
suggest that the identification of the parent galaxy with the central cD in a
cooling cluster plays an important role in the properties and structure of the
jets.
