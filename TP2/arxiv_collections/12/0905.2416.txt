Blogs have recently become one of the most favored services on the Web. Many
users maintain a blog and write posts to express their opinion, experience and
knowledge about a product, an event and every subject of general or specific
interest. More users visit blogs to read these posts and comment them. This
"participatory journalism" of blogs has such an impact upon the masses that
Keller and Berry argued that through blogging "one American in tens tells the
other nine how to vote, where to eat and what to buy" \cite{keller1}.
Therefore, a significant issue is how to identify such influential bloggers.
This problem is very new and the relevant literature lacks sophisticated
solutions, but most importantly these solutions have not taken into account
temporal aspects for identifying influential bloggers, even though the time is
the most critical aspect of the Blogosphere. This article investigates the
issue of identifying influential bloggers by proposing two easily computed
blogger ranking methods, which incorporate temporal aspects of the blogging
activity. Each method is based on a specific metric to score the blogger's
posts. The first metric, termed MEIBI, takes into consideration the number of
the blog post's inlinks and its comments, along with the publication date of
the post. The second metric, MEIBIX, is used to score a blog post according to
the number and age of the blog post's inlinks and its comments. These methods
are evaluated against the state-of-the-art influential blogger identification
method utilizing data collected from a real-world community blog site. The
obtained results attest that the new methods are able to better identify
significant temporal patterns in the blogging behaviour.
