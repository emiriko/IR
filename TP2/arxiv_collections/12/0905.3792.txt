Using nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations, we study the temperature
dependence of the negative differential thermal resistance that appears in
two-segment Frenkel-Kontorova lattices. We apply the theoretical method based
on Landauer equation to obtain the relationship between the heat current and
the temperature, which states a fundamental interpretation about the underlying
physical mechanism of the negative differential thermal resistance. The
temperature profiles and transport coefficients are demonstrated to explain the
crossover from diffusive to ballistic transport. The finite-size effect is also
discussed.
