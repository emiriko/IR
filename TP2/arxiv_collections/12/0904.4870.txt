We study classical capacity regions of quantum Gaussian multiple access
channels (MAC). In classical variants of such channels, whilst some capacity
superadditivity-type effects such as the so called {\it water filling effect}
may be achieved, a fundamental classical additivity law can still be
identified, {\it viz.} adding resources to one sender is never advantageous to
other senders in sending their respective information to the receiver. Here, we
show that quantum resources allows violation of this law, by providing two
illustrative schemes of experimentally feasible Gaussian MACs.
