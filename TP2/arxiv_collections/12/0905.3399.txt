We study competition between the dissipative and coherent effects in the
entanglement dynamics of two qubits. The coherent interactions are needed for
designing logic gate operations with systems like ion traps, semicondutor
quantum dots and atoms. We show that the interactions lead to a phenomenon of
periodic disentanglement and entanglement between the qubits. The
disentanglement is primarily caused by environmental perturbations. The qubits
are seen to remain disentangled for a finite time before getting entangled
again. We find that the phenomenon is generic and occurs for wide variety of
models of the environment. We present analytical results for the time
dependence of concurrence for all the models. The periodic disentanglement and
entanglement behavior is seen to be precursor to the sudden death of
entanglement (ESD) and can happen, for environments which do not show ESD for
noninteracting qubits. Further we also find that this phenomenon can even lead
to delayed death of entanglement for correlated environments.
