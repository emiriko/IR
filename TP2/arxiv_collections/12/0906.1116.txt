Local dissipation scales are a manifestation of the intermittent small-scale
nature of turbulence. We report the first experimental evaluation of the
distribution of local dissipation scales in turbulent pipe flows for a range of
Reynolds numbers, 2.4x10^4<=Re_D<=7.0x10^4. Our measurements at the nearly
isotropic pipe centerline and within the anisotropic logarithmic layer show
excellent agreement with distributions that were previously calculated from
numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic box turbulence and with those
predicted by theory. The reported results suggest a universality of the
smallest-scale fluctuations around the classical Kolmogorov dissipation length.
