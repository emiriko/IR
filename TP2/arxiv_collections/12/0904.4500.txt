The High Resolution Fly's Eye experiment has measured the flux of ultrahigh
energy cosmic rays using the stereoscopic air fluorescence technique. The HiRes
experiment consists of two detectors that observe cosmic ray showers via the
fluorescence light they emit. HiRes data can be analyzed in monocular mode,
where each detector is treated separately, or in stereoscopic mode where they
are considered together. Using the monocular mode the HiRes collaboration
measured the cosmic ray spectrum and made the first observation of the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. In this paper we present the cosmic ray
spectrum measured by the stereoscopic technique. Good agreement is found with
the monocular spectrum in all details.
