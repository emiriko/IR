The next-to-leading order (NLO) evolution of the parton distribution
functions (PDF's) in QCD is the "industry standard" in the lepton-hadron and
hadron-hadron collider data analysis. The standard NLO DGLAP evolution is
formulated for inclusive (integrated) PDFs and is done using inclusive NLO
kernels. We report here on the ongoing project, called KRKMC, in which NLO
DGLAP evolution is performed for the exclusive multiparton (fully unintegrated)
distributions (ePDF's) with the help of the exclusive kernels. These kernels
are calculated within the two-parton phase space for bremsstrahlung subset of
the Feynman diagrams of the non-singlet evolution, using
Curci-Furmanski-Petronzio factorization scheme. The multiparton distribution
with multiple use of the exclusive NLO kernels is implemented in the Monte
Carlo program simulating multi-gluon emission from single quark emitter. With
high statistics tests ($\sim 10^{9}$ events) it is shown that the new scheme
works perfectly well in practice and is equivalent at the inclusive level with
the traditional inclusive NLO DGLAP evolution. Once completed, this Monte Carlo
module is aimed as a building block for the NLO parton shower Monte Carlo, for
W/Z production at LHC and for ep scattering, as well as a starting point for
other perturbative QCD based Monte Carlo projects.
