A simulation study of the magnetic electron drift vortex (MEDV) mode
turbulence in a magnetoplasma in the presence of inhomogeneities in the plasma
temperature and density, as well as in the external magnetic field, is
presented. The study shows that the influence of the magnetic field
inhomogeneity is to suppress streamer-like structures observed in previous
simulation studies without background magnetic fields. The MEDV mode turbulence
exhibits non-universal (non-Kolmogorov type) spectra for different sets of the
plasma parameters. In the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, the
spectrum changes to a 7/3 power law, which is flatter than without magnetic
field gradients. The relevance of this work to laser-produced plasmas in the
laboratory is briefly mentioned.
