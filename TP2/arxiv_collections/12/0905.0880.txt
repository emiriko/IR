The Mauritius Radio Telescope (MRT) images show systematics in the positional
errors of sources when compared to source positions in the Molonglo Reference
Catalogue (MRC). We have applied two-dimensional homography to correct
positional errors in the image domain and avoid re-processing the visibility
data. Positions of bright (above 15-$\sigma$) sources, common to MRT and MRC
catalogues, are used to set up an over-determined system to solve for the 2-D
homography matrix. After correction, the errors are found to be within 10% of
the beamwidth for these bright sources and the systematics are eliminated from
the images.
