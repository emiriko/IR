We discuss the results of a multi-wavelength differential imaging lab
experiment with the High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. The HCIT combines a Lyot coronagraph with a Xinetics deformable
mirror in a vacuum environment to simulate a space telescope in order to test
technologies and algorithms for a future exoplanet coronagraph mission. At
present, ground based telescopes have achieved significant attenuation of
speckle noise using the technique of spectral differential imaging (SDI). We
test whether ground-based SDI can be generalized to a non-simultaneous spectral
differential imaging technique (NSDI) for a space mission. In our lab
experiment, a series of 5 filter images centered around the O2(A) absorption
feature at 0.762 um were acquired at nominal contrast values of 10^-6, 10^-7,
10^-8, and 10^-9. Outside the dark hole, single differences of images improve
contrast by a factor of ~6. Inside the dark hole, we found significant speckle
chromatism as a function of wavelength offset from the nulling wavelength,
leading to a contrast degradation by a factor of 7.2 across the entire ~80 nm
bandwidth. This effect likely stems from the chromatic behavior of the current
occulter. New, less chromatic occulters are currently in development; we expect
that these new occulters will resolve the speckle chromatism issue.
