Pictor A is a nearby Fanaroff-Riley class II (FR II) radio galaxy with a
bright hot spot, the western hot spot. Observation of high polarization in the
optical emission of the hot spot indicates that the optical emission could be
synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons in the hot spot. These
electrons may be able to produce high energy gamma-ray photons through inverse
Compton (IC) scattering. We use single-zone and multi-zone synchrotron +
synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) models to fit the observed spectral energy
distribution (SED) from the radio to the X-ray band of the hot spot. Our esults
show that in the case of a much weaker magnetic field strength than the
equipartition magnetic field, both the single-zone and multi-zone models can
fit the SED, but the multi-zone model significantly improves the fit. The two
models predict the hot spot as a GeV-TeV source, which might be marginally
detectable with Fermi/LAT and HESS. The inverse Compton scattering of cosmic
microwave background (IC/CMB) is also considered, but its contribution to
GeV-TeV emission is negligible. Note that under the equipartition condition,
the SED can also be fit with the multi-zone model, but the predicted flux at
10^22 Hz is too weak to be detectable. The detection of TeV gamma-rays from
this FR II radio galaxy, if confirmed, would establish a new subclass of
extragalactic source in this energy regime since most of the AGNs detected to
date at TeV energies are high-energy-peaked BL Lac objects.
