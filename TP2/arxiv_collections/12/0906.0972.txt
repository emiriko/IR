The magnetic analog of the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter, i.e., the magnetocaloric
effect, is a valuable tool for studying field-tuned quantum phase transitions.
We determine the magnetic Gr\"{u}neisen parameter of the one-dimensional random
transverse-field Ising model, focusing on its low-temperature behavior at the
exotic infinite-randomness quantum critical point and in the associated quantum
Griffiths phases. We present extensive numerical simulations showing that the
magnetic Gr\"{u}neisen parameter diverges logarithmically with decreasing
temperature in the quantum Griffiths phase. It changes sign right at
criticality. These results confirm a recent strong-disorder renormalization
group theory. We also compare our findings to the behavior of the clean
transverse-field Ising chain.
