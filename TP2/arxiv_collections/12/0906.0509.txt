We start from Feynman`s idea to use negative probabilities to describe the
two slit experiment and other quantum interfernce experiments. Formally by
using negative probability distributions we can explain the results of the two
slit experiment on the basis of the pure corpuscular picture of quantum
mechnanics. However, negative probabilities are absurd objects in the framework
of the standard Kolmogorov theory of probability. We present a large class of
non-Kolmogorovean probability models where negative probabilities are well
defined on the frequency basis. These are models with probabilities which
belong to the so-called field of $p$-adic numbers. However, these models are
characterized by correlations between trails. Therefore, we predict
correlations between particles in interference experiments. In fact, our
predictions are similar to the predictions of the so-called nonergodic
interpretation of quantum mechanics, which was proposed by V. Buonomano. We
propose the concrete experiments (in particular, in the framework of the
neutron interferometry) to verify our predictions on the correlations.
