Using a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo method suitable to nanomagnetism, we
investigate representative systems of interacting sub-10nm grained nanomagnets
with large uniaxial anisotropy. Various magnetization memory and aging effects
are found in such systems. We explain these dynamical effects using the
distributed relaxation times of the interacting nanomagnets due to their large
anisotropy energies.
