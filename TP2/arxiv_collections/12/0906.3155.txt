We propose a new method for discretizing the time variable in integrable
lattice systems while maintaining the locality of the equations of motion. The
method is based on the zero-curvature (Lax pair) representation and the
lowest-order "conservation laws". In contrast to the pioneering work of
Ablowitz and Ladik, our method allows the auxiliary dependent variables
appearing in the stage of time discretization to be expressed locally in terms
of the original dependent variables. The time-discretized lattice systems have
the same set of conserved quantities and the same structures of the solutions
as the continuous-time lattice systems; only the time evolution of the
parameters in the solutions that correspond to the angle variables is
discretized. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated using examples such
as the Toda lattice, the Volterra lattice, the modified Volterra lattice, the
Ablowitz-Ladik lattice (an integrable semi-discrete nonlinear Schroedinger
system), and the lattice Heisenberg ferromagnet model. For the Volterra lattice
and modified Volterra lattice, we also present their ultradiscrete analogues.
