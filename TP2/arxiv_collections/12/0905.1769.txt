This paper presents a classification of Cellular Automata rules based on its
properties at the nth iteration. Elaborate computer program has been designed
to get the nth iteration for arbitrary 1-D or 2-D CA rules. Studies indicate
that the figures at some particular iteration might be helpful for some
specific application. The hardware circuit implementation can be done using
opto-electronic components [1-7].
