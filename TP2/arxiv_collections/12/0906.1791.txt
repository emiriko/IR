We address frequency-dependent quantum transport through mesoscopic
conductors in the semiclassical limit. By generalizing the trajectory-based
semiclassical theory of dc quantum transport to the ac case, we derive the
average screened conductance as well as ac weak-localization corrections for
chaotic conductors. Thereby we confirm respective random matrix results and
generalize them by accounting for Ehrenfest time effects. We consider the case
of a cavity connected through many leads to a macroscopic circuit which
contains ac-sources. In addition to the reservoir the cavity itself is
capacitively coupled to a gate. By incorporating tunnel barriers between cavity
and leads we obtain results for arbitrary tunnel rates. Finally, based on our
findings we investigate the effect of dephasing on the charge relaxation
resistance of a mesoscopic capacitor in the linear low-frequency regime.
