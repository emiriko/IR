Nuclei are propitious tools to investigate the role of the superfluidity in
the compressibility of a Fermionic system. The centroid of the Giant Monopole
Resonance (GMR) in Tin isotopes is predicted using a constrained Hartree-Fock
Bogoliubov approach, ensuring a full self-consistent treatment. Superfluidity
is found to favour the compressibitily of nuclei. Pairing correlations explain
why doubly magic nuclei such as $^{208}$Pb are stiffer compared to open-shell
nuclei. Fully self-consistent predictions of the GMR on an isotopic chain
should be the way to microscopically extract both the incompressibility and the
density dependence of a given energy functional. The macroscopic extraction of
K$_{sym}$, the asymmetry incompressibility, is questioned. Investigations of
the GMR in unstable nuclei are called for. Pairing gap dependence of the
nuclear matter incompressibility should also be investigated.
