We calculate the excursion and meander area distributions of the elastic
Brownian motion by using the self adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian of the
free quantum particle on the half line. We also give some comments on the area
of the Brownian motion bridge on the real line with the origin removed. We will
stress on the power of self adjoint extension to investigate different possible
boundary conditions for the stochastic processes.
