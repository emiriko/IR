We have analyzed ACS/WFC and WFPC2 images from HST, as well as ground-based
data to study the radial distribution of the double sub-giant branch (SGB)
recently discovered in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 1851. We found that
the SGB split can be followed all the way from the cluster center out to at
least 8\arcmin from the center. Beyond this distance out to the tidal radius at
$\sim 11.7$ arcmin, there are simply too few SGB stars to dentify the
sequences. The number ratio of the bright SGB to the faint SGB stars shows no
significant radial trend. Furthermore, we have found that the ratio of blue
horizontal-branch (HB) stars plus RR Lyrae to the red HB stars also remains
constant from the cluster center to the outer envelope.
