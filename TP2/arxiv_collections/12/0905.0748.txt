The guided dispersion characteristics of subwavelength nanoscale plasmonic
coaxial lines are analyzed in detail over a wide optical frequency range below
the plasma frequency with a varying gap between the inner and outer plasmonic
conductors, providing important preliminary information for understanding the
guided mode characteristics of subwavelength nanoscale coaxial lines with
plasmonic metals. In particular, when the inner or outer radius is varied,
guided modes with similar and dissimilar dispersive features are obtained and
discussed. A brief comparison of the propagating modes for the present
subwavelength plasmonic coaxial lines and those for a subwavelength plasmonic
hole and wire is also made.
