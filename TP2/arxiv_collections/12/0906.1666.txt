A prospective analysis for the search of the Standard Model Higgs boson
decaying in vector boson pairs is presented with the CMS experiment in the
context of the initial luminosity at the CERN LHC pp collider. Monte Carlo data
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 1 fb$^{-1}$ are analysed and
the expected significance for a Standard Model-like Higgs boson in these
channels is established.
