(Abridged) Recently, the magnetic field induced Zeeman splitting was measured
for the strongest known 6.7 GHz methanol maser, which arises in the massive
star forming region G09.62+0.20. This maser is one of a handful of periodically
flaring methanol masers. The 100-m Effelsberg telescope was used to monitor the
6.7 GHz methanol masers of G09.62+0.20. With the exception of a two week period
during the peak of the maser flare, we measure a constant magnetic field of
B_||~11+-2 mG in the two strongest maser components of G09.62+0.20 that are
separated by over 200 AU. In the two week period that coincides exactly with
the peak of the maser flare of the strongest maser feature, we measure a sharp
decrease and possible reversal of the Zeeman splitting. The exact cause of both
maser and polarization variability is still unclear, but it could be related to
either background amplification of polarized emission or the presence of a
massive protostar with a close-by companion. Alternatively, the polarization
variability could be caused by non-Zeeman effects related to the radiative
transfer of polarized maser emission.
