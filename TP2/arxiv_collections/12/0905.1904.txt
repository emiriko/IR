We propose a theoretical analysis of the experimental data on the time
behaviour K-shell electron capture (EC) decays of atoms 180Re and 142Pm in
solid targets, obtained recently by Faestermann et al. Phys. Lett. B 672, 227
(2009) and Vetter et al., Phys. Lett. B 670, 149 (2008). We show that the
absence of the time modulation in these data rules out the explanation of the
"GSI Oscillations" (Yu. A. Litvinov et al., Phys. Lett. B 664, 162 (2008)) by
means of two closely spaced ground mass-eigenstates of mother nuclei.
