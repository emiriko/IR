We compare the critical behavior of the ground state and the thermal state of
the XX model. We analyze the full energy spectrum and the eigenstates to
reconstruct the ground state and the thermally excited state. With the
solutions, we discuss about several physical properties of the states, which
are related to quantum phase transition, in various limits, at zero temperature
as well as at a thermal equilibrium.
