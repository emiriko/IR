A series of infrared-active optical phonons have been detected in type-I
clathrate Ba$_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$ by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The
conductivity spectra with the lowest-lying peaks at 1.15 and 1.80 THz are
identified with so-called rattling phonons, i.e., optical modes of the guest
ion Ba$^{2+}(2)$ with $T_{1u}$ symmetry in the oversized tetrakaidecahedral
cage. The temperature dependence of the spectra from these modes are totally
consistent with calculations based on a one-dimensional anharmonic potential
model that, with decreasing temperature, the shape becomes asymmetrically sharp
associated with a softening for the weight to shift to lower frequency. These
temperature dependences are determined, without any interaction effects, by the
Bose-factor for optical excitations of anharmonic phonons with the nonequally
spaced energy levels.
