We study a system of heteronuclear molecules on a triangular lattice and
analyze the potential of this system for the experimental realization of a
supersolid phase. The ground state phase diagram contains superfluid, solid and
supersolid phases. At finite temperatures and strong interactions there is an
additional emulsion region, in contrast to similar models with short-range
interactions. We derive the maximal critical temperature $T_c$ and the
corresponding entropy $S/N = 0.04(1)$ for supersolidity and find feasible
experimental conditions for its realization.
