Kashaev algebra associated to a surface is a noncommutative deformation of
the algebra of rational functions of Kashaev coordinates. For two arbitrary
complex numbers, there is a generalized Kashaev algebra. The relationship
between the shear coordinates and Kashaev coordinates induces a natural
relationship between the quantum Teichm\"uller space and the generalized
Kashaev algebra.
