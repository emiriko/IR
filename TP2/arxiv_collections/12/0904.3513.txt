A measurement of the inclusive deep-inelastic neutral current e+p scattering
cross section is reported in the region of four-momentum transfer squared,
12<=Q^2<=150 GeV^2, and Bjorken x, 2x10^-4<=x<=0.1. The results are based on
data collected by the H1 Collaboration at the ep collider HERA at positron and
proton beam energies of E_e=27.6 GeV and E_p=920 GeV, respectively. The data
are combined with previously published data, taken at E_p=820 GeV. The accuracy
of the combined measurement is typically in the range of 1.3-2%. A QCD analysis
at next-to-leading order is performed to determine the parton distributions in
the proton based on H1 data.
