We examine a potential role of the neutrino deuteron reactions in the
mechanism of supernova explosion by evaluating the energy transfer cross
section for the neutrino heating. We calculate the energy loss rate due to the
neutrino absorptions through the charged-current process as well as the
neutrino scattering through the neutral-current process. In so doing, we adopt
a detailed evaluation of cross sections for the neutrino deuteron reactions
with the phenomenological Lagrangian approach. We find the energy transfer
cross section for the deuteron is larger than those for $^{3}$H, $^{3}$He and
$^{4}$He for neutrino temperatures (T$_\nu$ $\sim 4$ MeV) relevant to supernova
core. Because of the low energy threshold for the deuteron breakup, the energy
transfer rate rapidly increases from low temperature, T$_\nu$ $\sim 1$ MeV.
This suggests that the neutrino deuteron reactions may contribute effectively
to the heating mechanism during the dissociation of irons into light elements
and nucleons in the shocked material of supernova core.
