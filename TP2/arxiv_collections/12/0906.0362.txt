We consider a scenario within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
extended by a singlet chiral superfield, in which neutralino dark matter
annihilates to light singlet-like Higgs bosons, which proceed to decay to
either electron-positron or muon-antimuon pairs. Unlike neutralino
annihilations in the MSSM, this model can provide a good fit to the PAMELA
cosmic ray positron fraction excess. Furthermore, the singlet-like scalar Higgs
can induce a large Sommerfeld enhancement and provide an annihilation rate
sufficient to accommodate the observed positron excess.
