Signals are a classical tool used in cellular automata constructions that
proved to be useful for language recognition or firing-squad synchronisation.
Particles and collisions formalize this idea one step further, describing
regular nets of colliding signals. In the present paper, we investigate the use
of particles and collisions for constructions involving an infinite number of
interacting particles. We obtain a high-level construction for a new smallest
intrinsically universal cellular automaton with 4 states.
