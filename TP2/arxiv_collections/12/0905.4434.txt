For a real oriented hyperplane arrangement, we show that the corresponding
Salvetti complex is homotopy equivalent to the complement of the complexified
arrangement. This result was originally proved by M. Salvetti. Our proof
follows the framework of a proof given by L. Paris and relies heavily on the
notation of oriented matroids. We also show that homotopy equivalence is
preserved when we quotient by the action of the corresponding reflection group.
In particular, the Salvetti complex of the braid arrangement in $\ell$
dimensions modulo the action of the symmetric group is a cell complex which is
homotopy equivalent to the space of unlabelled configurations of $\ell$
distinct points. Lastly, we describe a construction of the orbit complex from
the dual complex for all finite reflection arrangements in dimension 2. This
description yields an easy derivation of the so-called "braid relations" in the
case of braid arrangement.
