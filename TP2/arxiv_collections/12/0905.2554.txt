In this paper, we present the latest results of the searches for beyond
standard model Higgs boson production at the Tevatron collider of Fermilab.
Analyses have been carried out on samples of about 1-4 inverse fb of data
collected by the CDF and D0 detectors. In particular, Higgs bosons in
supersymmetric models and fermiophobic scenario have been investigated, and
limits on production cross sections and theory parameters have been
established.
