The phase diagram at finite temperature and density is investigated in the
framework of the Polyakov linear sigma model (PLSM) with three light quark
flavors in the mean field approximation. It is found that in the PLSM, the
three phase transitions, i.e, the chiral restoration of $u,d$ quarks, the
chiral restoration of $s$ quark, and the deconfinement phase transition are
independent. There exists two-flavor quarkyonic phase at low density and
three-flavor quarkyonic phase at high density. The critical end point (CEP)
which separating the crossover from the first-order line in the PLSM model is
located at$(T_E, \mu_E)=(188 \mathrm{MeV},139.5 \mathrm{MeV})$. In the
transition region the thermodynamic properties and bulk viscosity over entropy
density ratio $\zeta/s$ are also discussed in the PLSM.
