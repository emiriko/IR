We study how phonon structure manifests itself in the electronic density of
states of graphene. A procedure for extracting the value of the electron-phonon
renormalization $\lambda$ is developed. In addition, we identify direct phonon
structures. With increasing doping, these structures, along with $\lambda$,
grow in amplitude and no longer display particle-hole symmetry.
