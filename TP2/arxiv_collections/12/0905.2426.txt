We have studied the frequency and voltage dependence of voltage-induced
torsional strains in orthorhombic TaS3 [V. Ya. Pokrovskii, et al, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 98, 206404 (2007)] by measuring the modulation of the resonant frequency
of an RF cavity containing the sample. The strain has an onset voltage below
the charge-density-wave (CDW) threshold voltages associated with changes in
shear compliance and resistance, suggesting that the strain is associated with
polarization of the CDW rather than CDW current. Measurements with square-wave
voltages show that the strain is very sluggish, not even reaching its dc value
at a frequency of 0.1 Hz, but the dynamics appear to be very sample dependent.
By applying oscillating torque while biasing the sample with a dc current, we
have also looked for strain induced voltage in the sample; none is observed at
the low biases where the voltage-induced strains first occur, but an induced
voltage is observed at higher biases, probably associated with strain-dependent
CDW conductance.
