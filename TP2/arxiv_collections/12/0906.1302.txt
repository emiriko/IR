We present results from electroweak precision measurements at CDF. These
include the measurement of the Z boson rapidity distribution using di-electron
events, the W boson charge asymmetry measurement in the electron-neutrino decay
and the direct measurement of the W boson mass and width in both the
electron-neutrino and muon-neutrino decay channels.
