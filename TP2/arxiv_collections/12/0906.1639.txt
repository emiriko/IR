Double Chooz is a reactor neutrino experiment which investigates the last
neutrino mixing angle; theta-13. It is necessary to measure reactor neutrino
disappearance with precision 1% or better to detect finite value of theta-13.
This requirement is the most strict compared to other reactor neutrino
experiments performed so far. The Double Chooz experiment makes use of a number
of techniques to reduce the possible errors to achieve the sensitivity. The
detector is now under construction and it is expected to take first neutrino
data in 2009 and to measure sin^22theta-13 with a sensitivity of 0.03 (90%C.L.)
In this proceedings, the technical concepts of Double Chooz detector are
explained stressing on how it copes with the systematic errors.
