Acceleration and transport of high-energy particles and fluid dynamics of
atmospheric plasma are interrelated aspects of solar flares. We present here
self-consistently combined Fokker-Planck modeling of particles and hydrodynamic
simulation of flare plasma. Energetic electrons are modeled with the Stanford
unified code of acceleration, transport, and radiation, while plasma is modeled
with the NRL flux tube code. We calculated the collisional heating rate from
the particle transport code, which is more accurate than those based on
approximate analytical solutions. We used a realistic spectrum of injected
electrons provided by the stochastic acceleration model, which has a smooth
transition from a quasi-thermal background at low energies to a nonthermal tail
at high energies. The inclusion of low-energy electrons results in relatively
more heating in the corona (vs. chromosphere), a larger downward conductive
flux, and thus a stronger chromospheric evaporation than obtained in previous
studies, which had a deficit in low-energy electrons due to an arbitrarily
assumed low-energy cutoff. The energy and spatial distributions of energetic
electrons and bremsstrahlung photons bear signatures of the changing density
distribution caused by chromospheric evaporation. In particular, the density
jump at the evaporation front gives rise to enhanced X-ray emission.
