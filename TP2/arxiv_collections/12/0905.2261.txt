We propose a formulation to obtain the line shape of a magnetic response with
dissipative effects that directly reflects the nature of the environment.
Making use of the fact that the time evolution of a response function is
described by the same equation as the reduced density operator, we formulate a
full description of the complex susceptibility. We describe the dynamics using
the equation of motion for the reduced density operator, including the term for
the initial correlation between the system and a thermal bath. In this
formalism, we treat the full description of non-Markovian dynamics, including
the initial correlation. We present an explicit and compact formula up to the
second order of cumulants, which can be applied in a straightforward way to
multiple spin systems. We also take into account the frequency shift by the
system-bath interaction. We study the dependence of the line shape on the type
of interaction between the system and the thermal bath. We demonstrate that the
present formalism is a powerful tool for investigating various kinds of
systems, and we show how it is applied to spin systems, including those with up
to three spins. We distinguish the contributions of the initial correlation and
the frequency shift, and make clear the role of each contribution in the Ohmic
coupling spectral function. As examples of applications to multispin systems,
we obtain the dependence of the line shape on the spatial orientation in
relation to the direction of the static field (Nagata-Tazuke effect), including
the effects of the thermal environment, in a two-spin system, along with the
dependence on the arrangement of a triangle in a three-spin system.
