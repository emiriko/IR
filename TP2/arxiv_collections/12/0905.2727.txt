In this contribution, a comprehensive review of the main aspects of high pt
jet physics in Run II at the Tevatron is presented. Recent measurements on
inclusive jet and dijet production are discussed using different jet algorithms
and covering a wide region of jet transverse momentum and jet rapidity. Several
measurements, sensitive to a proper description of soft gluon radiation and the
underlying event in hadron collisions, are also shown.
