The aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of the intervening
absorbers lying along the line of sight of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 080319B
through the analysis of its optical absorption features. To this purpose, we
analyze a multi-epoch, high resolution spectroscopic observations (R=40000,
corresponding to 7.5 km/s) of the optical afterglow of GRB080319B (z=0.937),
taken with UVES at the VLT. Thanks to the rapid response mode (RRM), we
observed the afterglow just 8m:30s after the GRB onset when the magnitude was R
~ 12. This allowed us to obtain the best signal-to-noise, high resolution
spectrum of a GRB afterglow ever (S/N per resolution element ~ 50). Two further
RRM and target of opportunity observations were obtained starting 1.0 and 2.4
hours after the event, respectively. Four MgII absorption systems lying along
the line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in the redshift range 0.5
< z < 0.8, most of them showing a complex structure featuring several
components. Absorptions due to FeII, MgI and MnII are also present; they appear
in four, two and one intervening absorbers, respectively. One out of four
systems show a MgII2796 rest frame equivalent width larger than 1A. This
confirms the excess of strong MgII absorbers compared to quasars, with dn/dz =
0.9, ~ 4 times larger than the one observed along quasar lines of sight. In
addition, the analysis of multi-epoch, high-resolution spectra allowed us to
exclude a significant variability in the column density of the single
components of each absorber. Combining this result with estimates of the size
of the emitting region, we can reject the hypothesis that the difference
between GRB and QSO MgII absorbers is due to a different size of the emitting
regions.
