We construct a generalized Markov kernel which transforms the observable
associated with the homodyne tomography into a covariant phase space observable
with a regular kernel state. Illustrative examples are given in the cases of a
'Schrodinger cat' kernel state and the Cahill-Glauber s-parametrized
distributions. Also we consider an example of a kernel state when the
generalized Markov kernel cannot be constructed.
