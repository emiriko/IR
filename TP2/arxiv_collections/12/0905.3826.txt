With the purpose to reveal consistency between multiple quantum (MQ)
coherences and entanglement, we investigate numerically the dynamics of these
phenomena in one-dimensional linear chains and ring of nuclear spins 1/2
coupled by dipole dipole interactions. As opposed to the calculation of the MQ
coherence intensity based on the density matrix describing the spin system as a
whole, we consider the "differentiated" intensity related only to the chosen
spin pair based on the reduced density matrix. It is shown that the
entanglement and the MQ coherence have similar dynamics only for nearest
neighbors while we did not obtained any consistency for remote spins.
