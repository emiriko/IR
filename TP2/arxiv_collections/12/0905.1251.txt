We report an experimental and theoretical investigation of the
frequency-dependent effective mass, $\tilde{M}(\omega)$, of loose granular
particles which occupy a rigid cavity to a given filling fraction, the
remaining volume being air of differing humidities. This allow us to study the
mechanisms of elastic response and attenuation of acoustic modes in granular
media. We demonstrate that this is a sensitive and direct way to measure those
properties of the granular medium that are the cause of the changes in acoustic
properties of structures containing grain-filled cavities. Specifically, we
apply this understanding to the case of the flexural resonances of a
rectangular bar with a grain-filled cavity within it. The dominant features of
$\tilde{M}(\omega)$ are a sharp resonance and a broad background, which we
analyze within the context of simple models. We find that: a) These systems may
be understood in terms of a height-dependent and diameter-dependent effective
sound speed ($\sim 100-300$ m/s) and an effective viscosity ($\sim 5\times
10^4$ Poise). b) There is a dynamic Janssen effect in the sense that, at any
frequency, and depending on the method of sample preparation, approximately
one-half of the effective mass is borne by the side walls of the cavity and
one-half by the bottom. c) By performing experiments under varying humidity
conditions we conclude that, on a fundamental level, damping of acoustic modes
is dominated by adsorbed films of water at grain-grain contacts in our
experiments, not by global viscous dampening. d) There is a monotonically
increasing effect of humidity on the dampening of the fundamental resonance
within the granular medium which translates to a non-monotonic, but
predictable, variation of dampening within the grain-loaded bar.
