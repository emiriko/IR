The central engines of both type 1 and type 2 AGNs are thought to harbor a
toroidal structure that absorbs and reprocesses high-energy photons from the
central X-ray source. If the reprocessor is Compton-thick, the calculation of
emission-line and continuum spectra that are suitable for direct fitting to
X-ray data is challenging because the reprocessed emission depends on the
spectral shape of the incident continuum, which may not be directly observable.
We present new Monte-Carlo calculations of Green's functions for a toroidal
reprocessor that provide significant improvements over currently available
models. The Green's function approach enables the construction of X-ray
spectral fitting models that allow arbitrary incident spectra as part of the
fitting process. The calculations are fully relativistic and have been
performed for column densities that cover the Compton-thin to Compton-thick
regime, for incident photon energies up to 500 keV. The reprocessed continuum
and fluorescent line emission due to Fe Ka, Fe Kb, and Ni Ka are treated
self-consistently, eliminating the need for ad hoc modeling that is currently
common practice. We find that the spectral shape of the Compton-thick
reflection spectrum in both the soft and hard X-ray bands in our toroidal
geometry is different compared to that obtained from disk models. A key result
of our study is that a Compton-thick toroidal structure that subtends the same
solid angle at the X-ray source as a disk can produce a reflection spectrum
that is ~6 times weaker than that from a disk. This highlights the widespread
and erroneous interpretation of the so-called "reflection-fraction" as a solid
angle, obtained from fitting disk-reflection models to Compton-thick sources
without regard for proper consideration of geometry. (Abridged)
