In this paper we introduce the notion of quasi-expansivity for 2D CA and we
show that it shares many properties with expansivity (that holds only for 1D
CA). Similarly, we introduce the notions of quasi-sensitivity and prove that
the classical dichotomy theorem holds in this new setting. Moreover, we show a
tight relation between closingness and openness for 2D CA. Finally, the
undecidability of closingness property for 2D CA is proved.
