We investigate the appearance of the classical anisotropic universe from the
no-boundary quantum state according to the prescription proposed by Hartle,
Hawking and Hertog. Our model is homogeneous, anisotropic, closed universes
with a minimally coupled scalar field and cosmological constant. We found that
there are an ensemble of classical Lorentzian histories with anisotropies and
experience inflationary expansion at late time, and the probability of
histories with anisotropies are lower than isotropic histories. Thus the
no-boundary condition may be able to explain the emergence of our universe. If
the classical late time histories are extended back, some become singular by
the existence of initial anisotropies with large accelerations. However we do
not find any chaotic behavior of anisotropies near the initial singularity.
