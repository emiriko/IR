Full exploitation of the physics potential of a future International Linear
Collider will require the use of polarized electron and positron beams.
Experiment E166 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) has
demonstrated a scheme in which an electron beam passes through a helical
undulator to generate photons (whose first-harmonic spectrum extended to
7.9MeV) with circular polarization, which are then converted in a thin target
to generate longitudinally polarized positrons and electrons. The experiment
was carried out with a one-meter-long, 400-period, pulsed helical undulator in
the Final Focus Test Beam (FFTB) operated at 46.6GeV. Measurements of the
positron polarization have been performed at five positron energies from 4.5 to
7.5MeV. In addition, the electron polarization has been determined at 6.7MeV,
and the effect of operating the undulator with a ferrofluid was also
investigated. To compare the measurements with expectations, detailed
simulations were made with an upgraded version of Geant4 that includes the
dominant polarization-dependent interactions of electrons, positrons, and
photons with matter. The measurements agree with calculations, corresponding to
80% polarization for positrons near 6MeV and 90% for electrons near 7MeV.
