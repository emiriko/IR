We propose a fluxon-controlled quantum computer incorporated with three-qubit
quantum error correction using special gate operations, i.e., joint-phase and
SWAP gate operations, inherent in capacitively coupled superconducting flux
qubits. The proposed quantum computer acts exactly like a knitting machine at
home.
