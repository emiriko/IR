In-gas-cell laser spectroscopy study of the 57,59,63,65Cu isotopes has been
performed for the first time using the 244.164 nm optical transition from the
atomic ground state of copper. The nuclear magnetic dipole moments for
57,59,65Cu relative to that of 63Cu have been extracted. The new value for 57Cu
of mu(57Cu) = +2.582(7)mu_N is in strong disagreement with the previous
literature value but in good agreement with recent theoretical and systematic
predictions.
