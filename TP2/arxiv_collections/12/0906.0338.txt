A commercial, position-sensitive ion detector was used for the first time for
the time-of-flight ion-cyclotron resonance detection technique in Penning trap
mass spectrometry. In this work, the characteristics of the detector and its
implementation in a Penning trap mass spectrometer will be presented. In
addition, simulations and experimental studies concerning the observation of
ions ejected from a Penning trap are described. This will allow for a precise
monitoring of the state of ion motion in the trap.
