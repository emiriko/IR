Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be an affine Kac-Moody algebra with symmetric Cartan
datum, $\mathfrak{n^{+}}$ be the maximal nilpotent subalgebra of
$\mathfrak{g}$. By the Hall algebra approach, we construct integral bases of
the $\mathbb{Z}$-form of the enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{n^{+}})$. In
particular, the representation theory of tame quivers is essentially used in
this paper.
