Mining frequent sequential patterns from sequence databases has been a
central research topic in data mining and various efficient mining sequential
patterns algorithms have been proposed and studied. Recently, in many problem
domains (e.g, program execution traces), a novel sequential pattern mining
research, called mining repetitive gapped sequential patterns, has attracted
the attention of many researchers, considering not only the repetition of
sequential pattern in different sequences but also the repetition within a
sequence is more meaningful than the general sequential pattern mining which
only captures occurrences in different sequences. However, the number of
repetitive gapped sequential patterns generated by even these closed mining
algorithms may be too large to understand for users, especially when support
threshold is low. In this paper, we propose and study the problem of
compressing repetitive gapped sequential patterns. Inspired by the ideas of
summarizing frequent itemsets, RPglobal, we develop an algorithm, CRGSgrow
(Compressing Repetitive Gapped Sequential pattern grow), including an efficient
pruning strategy, SyncScan, and an efficient representative pattern checking
scheme, -dominate sequential pattern checking. The CRGSgrow is a two-step
approach: in the first step, we obtain all closed repetitive sequential
patterns as the candidate set of representative repetitive sequential patterns,
and at the same time get the most of representative repetitive sequential
patterns; in the second step, we only spend a little time in finding the
remaining the representative patterns from the candidate set. An empirical
study with both real and synthetic data sets clearly shows that the CRGSgrow
has good performance.
