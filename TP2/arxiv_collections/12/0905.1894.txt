In the framework of the kt-factorization approach, we study the production of
Higgs bosons associated with a heavy (beauty or top) quark pair at the CERN LHC
collider conditions. Our consideration is based mainly on the off-shell
gluon-gluon fusion suprocess g + g -> Q + Q + H. The corresponding matrix
element squared have been calculated for the first time. We investigate the
total and differential cross sections of bbH and ttH production taking into
account also the non-negligible contribution from the q + q -> Q + Q + H
mechanism. In the numerical calculations we use the unintegrated gluon
distributions obtained from the CCFM evolution equation. Our results are
compared with the leading and next-to-leading order predictions of the
collinear factorization of QCD.
