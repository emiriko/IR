The cross sections of the scalar meson $f_0(980)$, $a_0(980)$ and
$\sigma(600)$ production in collision of electron and positron beams were
calculated. The two-photon decays of the scalar mesons, obtained in the
framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, were used. The quark and meson loops
were taken into account.
