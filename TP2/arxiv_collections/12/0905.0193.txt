We discuss various aspects of vector meson production, first analysing the
interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of the QCD
calculation. Using a general method adapted to incorporate both perturbative
and nonpertubative aspects, we show that nonperturbative effects are important
for all experimentally available values of the photon virtuality Q2. We compare
the huge amount of experimental information now available with our theoretical
results obtained using a specific nonperturbative model without free
parameters, showing that quite simple features are able to explain the data.
