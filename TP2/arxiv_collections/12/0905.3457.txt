We calculate the current density in a semiconductor superlattice with
parabolic miniband under crossed non-quantizing electric and magnetic fields.
The Corbino disk geometry is considered. The current-voltage curve contains
oscillations with period proportional to the magnetic field. The possibility is
shown of the negative absolute conductivity. The Ampere-Gauss characteristics
also contain overshoots under high enough electric fields. In all cases, the
peaks smear with temperature rising.
