Low-energy electronic structure of (unbiased) bilayer graphene is made of two
Fermi points with quadratic dispersions, if trigonal-warping and other high
order contributions are ignored. We show that as a result of this qualitative
difference from single-layer graphene, short-range (or screened Coulomb)
interactions are marginally relevant. We use renormalization group to study
their effects on low-energy properties of the system, and show that the two
quadratic Fermi points spontaneously split into four Dirac points, at zero
temperature. This results in a nematic state that spontaneously breaks the
six-fold lattice rotation symmetry (combined with layer permutation) down to a
two-fold one, with a finite transition temperature. Critical properties of the
transition and effects of trigonal warping are also discussed.
