The goal of comparison is to reveal the difference of compared objects as
fast and reliably as possible. In this paper we formulate and investigate the
unambiguous comparison of unknown quantum measurements represented by
non-degenerate sharp POVMs. We distinguish between measurement devices with
apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases we can unambiguously
conclude only that the measurements are different. For the labeled case it is
sufficient to use each unknown measurement only once and the average
conditional success probability decreases with the Hilbert space dimension as
1/d. If the outcomes of the apparatuses are not labeled, then the problem is
more complicated. We analyze the case of two-dimensional Hilbert space. In this
case single shot comparison is impossible and each measurement device must be
used (at least) twice. The optimal test state in the two-shots scenario gives
the average conditional success probability 3/4. Interestingly, the optimal
experiment detects unambiguously the difference with nonvanishing probability
for any pair of observables.
