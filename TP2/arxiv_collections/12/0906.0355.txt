We investigate stationary slim accretion disks around Kerr black holes. We
construct a new numerical method based on the relaxation technique. We
systematically cover the whole parameter space relevant to stellar mass X-ray
binaries. We also notice some non-monotonic features in the disk structure,
overlooked in previous studies.
