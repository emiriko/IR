We address the inverse problem of designing isotropic pairwise particle
interaction potentials that lead to the formation of a desired lattice when a
system of particles is cooled. The design problem is motivated by the desire to
produce materials with pre-specified structure and properties. We present a
heuristic computation-free geometric method, as well as a fast and robust trend
optimization method that lead to the formation of high quality honeycomb
lattices. The trend optimization method is particularly successful since it is
well-suited to efficient optimization of the noisy and expensive objective
functions encountered in the self-assembly design problem. We also present
anisotropic potentials that robustly lead to the formation of the kagome
lattice, a lattice that has not previously been obtained with isotropic
potentials.
