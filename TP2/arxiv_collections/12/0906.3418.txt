The overdamped Brownian motion of a self-propelled particle which is driven
by a projected internal force is studied by solving the Langevin equation
analytically. The "active" particle under study is restricted to move along a
linear channel. The direction of its internal force is orientationally
diffusing on a unit circle in a plane perpendicular to the substrate. An
additional time-dependent torque is acting on the internal force orientation.
The model is relevant for active particles like catalytically driven Janus
particles and bacteria moving on a substrate. Analytical results for the first
four time-dependent displacement moments are presented and analysed for several
special situations. For vanishing torque, there is a significant dynamical
non-Gaussian behaviour at finite times t as signalled by a non-vanishing
normalized kurtosis in the particle displacement which approaches zero for long
time with a 1/t long-time tail.
