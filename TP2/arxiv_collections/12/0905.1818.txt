We study electron transport in a double quantum dot in the Pauli spin
blockade regime, in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. The effect of
spin-orbit coupling is incorporated into a modified interdot tunnel coupling.
We elucidate the role of the external magnetic field, the nuclear fields in the
dots, and spin relaxation. We find qualitative agreement with experimental
observations, and we propose a way to extend the range of magnetic fields in
which blockade can be observed.
