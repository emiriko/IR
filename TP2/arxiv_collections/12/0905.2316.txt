The ANTARES collaboration is currently operating the largest neutrino
detector in the Northern Hemisphere. One of the goals of ANTARES is the search
for dark matter in the universe. In this paper, the first results on the search
for dark matter in the Sun with ANTARES in its 5 line configuration, as well as
sensitivity studies on the dark matter search with the full ANTARES detector
and the future cubic-kilometer neutrino telescope studied by the KM3NeT
consortium are presented.
