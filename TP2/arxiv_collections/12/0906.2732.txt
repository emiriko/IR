A review and consolidation of some of our more recent publications, many with
our various collaborators. While we cannot resist mentioning Tribimaximal
mixing, our main theme is Flavour Symmetry, in particular Flavour-Symmetric
Observables, scalar (or pseudo-scalar) under $S3_l \times S3_{\nu}$. Our "best
guess" for the smallest neutrino mixing angle remains: $\sin
\theta_{13}=\sqrt{2 \Delta m^2_{sol}/(3 \Delta m^2_{atm})} \simeq 0.13$.
