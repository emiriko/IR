The observed extrasolar planets possess both large masses (with a median M
sin i of 1.65 MJ) and a wide range in orbital eccentricity (0 < e < 0.94). As
planets are thought to form in circumstellar disks, one important question in
planet formation is determining whether, and to what degree, a gaseous disk
affects an eccentric planet's orbit. Recent studies have probed the interaction
between a disk and a terrestrial planet on an eccentric orbit, and the
interaction between a disk and a gas giant on a nearly circular orbit, but
little is known about the interaction between a disk and an eccentric gas
giant. Such a scenario could arise due to scattering while the disk is still
present, or perhaps through planet formation via gravitational instability. We
fill this gap with simulations of eccentric, massive (gap-forming) planets in
disks using the hydrodynamical code FARGO. Although the long-term orbital
evolution of the planet depends on disk properties, including the boundary
conditions used, the disk always acts to damp eccentricity when the planet is
released into the disk. This eccentricity damping takes place on a timescale of
40 years, 15 times faster than the migration timescale.
