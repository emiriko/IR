We prove that the Schr\"odinger equation is approximately controllable in
Sobolev spaces $H^s$, $s>0$ generically with respect to the potential. We give
two applications of this result. First, in the case of one space dimension,
combining our result with a local exact controllability property, we get the
global exact controllability of the system in higher Sobolev spaces.
  Then we prove that the Schr\"odinger equation with a potential which has a
random time-dependent amplitude admits at most one stationary measure on the
unit sphere $S$ in $L^2 $.
