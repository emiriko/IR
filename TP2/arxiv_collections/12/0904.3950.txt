The Open Science Grid (OSG) includes work to enable new science, new
scientists, and new modalities in support of computationally based research.
There are frequently significant sociological and organizational changes
required in transformation from the existing to the new. OSG leverages its
deliverables to the large scale physics experiment member communities to
benefit new communities at all scales through activities in education,
engagement and the distributed facility. As a partner to the poster and
tutorial at SciDAC 2008, this paper gives both a brief general description and
some specific examples of new science enabled on the OSG. More information is
available at the OSG web site: (http://www.opensciencegrid.org).
