The high temperature many-body density matrix is fundamental to path integral
computation. The pair approximation, where the interaction part is written as a
product of pair density matrices, is commonly used and is accurate to order tau
squared, where tau is the step size in the imaginary time. Here we present a
method for systems with Coulomb interactions in periodic boundary conditions
that consistently treats the all interactions with the same level of accuracy.
It shown that this leads to a more accurate high temperature solution of the
Bloch equation. The method is applied to many-body simulation and tests for the
isolated hydrogen atom and molecule are presented.
