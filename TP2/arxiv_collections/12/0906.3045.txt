Over a period of several decades it has been noticed that most astronauts,
either orbiting the earth or on trips to the moon, have observed phosphenes or
light flashes (LF) including streaks, spots and clouds of light when their eyes
are closed or they are in a darkened cabin. Scientists suspect that two
separate components of cosmic rays cause these flashes due to direct
interaction with the retina. This phenomenon is not noticed on the ground
because of cosmic ray interaction with the atmosphere. The argument is advanced
that this effect may provide us with a new method of exploring the weak
equivalence principle from the standpoint of Einstein's original thought
experiment involving human subjects. This can be done, utilizing the retina
only, as an animate quantum mechanical measuring device or, in conjunction with
the Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts (ALTEA) facility.
