We present calculations of the free energy, and hence the melting properties,
of a simple tight-binding model for transition metals in the region of d-band
filling near the middle of a d-series, the parameters of the model being
designed to mimic molybdenum. The melting properties are calculated for
pressures ranging from ambient to several Mbar. The model is intended to be the
simplest possible tight-binding representation of the two basic parts of the
energy: first, the pairwise repulsion due to Fermi exclusion; and second, the
d-band bonding energy described in terms of an electronic density of states
that depends on structure. In addition to the number of d-electrons, the model
contains four parameters, which are adjusted to fit the pressure dependent
d-band width and the zero-temperature pressure-volume relation of Mo. We show
that the resulting model reproduces well the phonon dispersion relations of Mo
in the body-centred-cubic structure, as well as the radial distribution
function of the high-temperature solid and liquid given by earlier
first-principles simulations. Our free-energy calculations start from the free
energy of the liquid and solid phases of the purely repulsive pair-potential
model, without d-band bonding. The free energy of the full tight-binding model
is obtained from this by thermodynamic integration. The resulting melting
properties of the model are quite close to those given by earlier
first-principles work on Mo. An interpretation of these melting properties is
provided by showing how they are related to those of the purely repulsive
model.
