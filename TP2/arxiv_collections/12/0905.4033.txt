We give a new theta-function identity, a special case of which is utilised to
prove Kawanaka's Macdonald polynomial conjecture. The theta-function identity
further yields a transformation formula for multivariable elliptic
hypergeometric series which appears to be new even in the one-variable, basic
case.
