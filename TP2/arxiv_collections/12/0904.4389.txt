We report the systematic investigations of the oscillation of the Josephson
vortex (JV) flow resistance in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$
micro-fabricated junctions with various geometries and superconducting
anisotropy parameters. As the applied magnetic field parallel to the $ab$-plane
is increased, oscillation with a period corresponding to a $\phi_0/2$ par
atomic Josephson junction changes to oscillation with a doubled period. This
crossover is scaled by both the junction length and the anisotropy parameter,
indicating that the bulk inductive coupling that favors the triangular JV
lattice is replaced with the surface deformation energy as the dominant
interaction for a JV lattice. These results suggest that the in-phase square JV
lattice is pronounced at a higher magnetic field in a smaller and more
anisotropic sample.
