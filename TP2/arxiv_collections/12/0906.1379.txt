The noise from laser phase fluctuation sets a major technical obstacle to
cool the nano-mechanical oscillators to the quantum region. We propose a
cooling configuration based on the opto-mechanical coupling with two cavity
modes to significantly reduce this phase noise by $(2\omega_m/\gamma)^2$ times,
where $\omega_m$ is the frequency of the mechanical mode and $\gamma$ is the
decay rate of the cavity mode. We also discuss the detection of the phonon
number when the mechanical oscillator is cooled near the quantum region and
specify the required conditions for this detection.
