Carbon-tetrafluoride (CF4) is used as a counting gas in particle detectors,
but some of its properties that are of interest for large time-projection
chambers are not well known. We measure the mean energy, which is proportional
to the diffusion coefficent, and the attentuation coefficient of electron
propagation in CF4 gas using a 10-liter dark matter detector prototype of the
DMTPC project.
