The supergravity solutions to various $p$-branes are presented and typically
it breaks one quarter of supersymmetry except for the D1 brane case, where it
breaks one half of supersymmetry and are manifestly non-relativistic in nature.
The symmetries that the solutions enjoys are that of space and time
translations, rotations, boosts but without any scaling and special conformal
transformations except for $p\neq 3$. We have also constructed supersymmetric
non-relativistic cascading solutions to intersecting $D3$ and $D5$ branes on
both the singular as well as on deformed conifold, where the $D5$'s are wrapped
on the $S^2$ of the Calabi-Yau i.e. the analogs of Klebanov-Tseytlin and
Klebanov-Strassler solutions and the supersymmetric non-relativistic M2 brane
solution.
