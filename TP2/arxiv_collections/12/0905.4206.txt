The spectrum from the black hole X-ray transient GRO J1655-40. obtained using
the $Chandra$ High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) in 2005 is notable as a
laboratory for the study of warm absorbers, and for the presence of many lines
from odd-$Z$ elements between Na and Co (and Ti and Cr) not previously observed
in X-rays. We present synthetic spectral models which can be used to constrain
these element abundances and other parameters describing the outflow from the
warm absorber in this object. We present results of fitting to the spectrum
using various tools and techniques, including automated line fitting,
phenomenological models, and photoionization modeling. We show that the
behavior of the curves of growth of lines from H-like and Li-like ions indicate
that the lines are either saturated or affected by filling-in from scattered or
a partially covered continuum source. We confirm the conclusion of previous
work by \cite{Mill06} and \cite{Mill08} which shows that the ionization
conditions are not consistent with wind driving due to thermal expansion. The
spectrum provides the opportunity to measure abundances for several elements
not typically observable in the X-ray band. These show a pattern of enhancement
for iron peak elements, and solar or sub-solar values for elements lighter than
calcium. Models show that this is consistent with enrichment by a core-collapse
supernova. We discuss the implications these values for the evolutionary
history of this system.
