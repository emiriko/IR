Recent theoretical and experimental investigations of coherent feedback
control, the feedback control of a quantum system with another quantum system,
has raised the important problem of how to synthesize a class of quantum
systems, called the class of linear quantum stochastic systems, from basic
quantum optical components and devices in a systematic way. The synthesis
theory sought in this case can be naturally viewed as a quantum analogue of
linear electrical network synthesis theory and as such has potential for
applications beyond the realization of coherent feedback controllers. In
earlier work, Nurdin, James and Doherty have established that an arbitrary
linear quantum stochastic system can be realized as a cascade connection of
simpler one degree of freedom quantum harmonic oscillators, together with a
direct interaction Hamiltonian which is bilinear in the canonical operators of
the oscillators. However, from an experimental perspective and based on current
methods and technologies, direct interaction Hamiltonians are challenging to
implement for systems with more than just a few degrees of freedom. In order to
facilitate more tractable physical realizations of these systems, this paper
develops a new synthesis algorithm for linear quantum stochastic systems that
relies solely on field-mediated interactions, including in implementation of
the direct interaction Hamiltonian. Explicit synthesis examples are provided to
illustrate the realization of two degrees of freedom linear quantum stochastic
systems using the new algorithm.
