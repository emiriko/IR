Let $S$ be a set of $r$ red points and $b=r+2d$ blue points in general
position in the plane, with $d\geq 0$. A line $\ell$ determined by them is said
to be balanced if in each open half-plane bounded by $\ell$ the difference
between the number of red points and blue points is $d$. We show that every set
$S$ as above has at least $r$ balanced lines. The main techniques in the proof
are rotations and a generalization, sliding rotations, introduced here.
