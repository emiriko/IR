Phase behavior of diblock copolymer/homopolymer blends (AB/C) is investigated
theoretically. The study focuses on a special case where all three binary
pairs, A/B, B/C and C/A, are miscible. Despite the miscibility of the binary
pairs, a closed-loop immiscible region exists in the AB/C blends when the A/C
and B/C pair interactions are sufficiently different. Inside the closed-loop,
the system undergoes microphase separation, exhibiting different ordered
structures. This phenomenon is enhanced when the homopolymer (C) interacts more
strongly to one of the blocks (A or B).
