Inclusive and exclusive production of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons via
gluon-gluon fusion is considered. A new experimental test is proposed, which
can probe the polarization state of the gluons in exclusive production
processes and check the compatibility of the two-gluon exchange mechanism with
the properties of conventional Pomeron
