The paper investigates the possible coherent and effective alternatives to
solve the problems related to the communication needs of any multimedia
product. In essence, the presentation will focus on identifying the issues and
principles governing three types of the design - in fact, the multimedia design
in a broader sense - namely the information design - precisely aiming at ways
of organization and presentation of information in a useful and significant
form, the graphical user interface design, whose sub-domain consists of the
information displayed on the monitor screen and of interactivity between user,
computer and electronic devices, meaning, in fact, everything the user sees,
touches, hears and all the elements with which he interacts, the graphic
design, whose main concern is to create an aesthetic layout arrangement (from
the visual and perceptive) information.
