Interest in targeted disease prevention has stimulated development of models
that assign risks to individuals, using their personal covariates. We need to
evaluate these models, and to quantify the gains achieved by expanding a model
with additional covariates. We describe several performance measures for risk
models, and show how they are related. Application of the measures to risk
models for hypothetical populations and for postmenopausal US women illustrate
several points. First, model performance is constrained by the distribution of
true risks in the population. This complicates the comparison of two models if
they are applied to populations with different covariate distributions. Second,
the Brier Score and the Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) are more
useful than the concordance statistic for quantifying precision gains obtained
from model expansion. Finally, these precision gains are apt to be small,
although they may be large for some individuals. We propose a new way to
identify these individuals, and show how to quantify how much they gain by
measuring the additional covariates. Those with largest gains could be targeted
for cost-efficient covariate assessment.
