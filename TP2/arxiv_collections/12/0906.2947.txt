In this paper, we describe an attack against one of the
Oblivious-Transfer-based blind signatures scheme, proposed in [1]. An attacker
with a primitive capability of producing specific-range random numbers, while
exhibiting a partial MITM behavior, is able to corrupt the communication
between the protocol participants. The attack is quite efficient as it leads to
a protocol communication corruption and has a sound-minimal computational cost.
We propose a solution to fix the security flaw.
