In this paper we investigate if the phantom-like regime in the LDGP model can
be enlarged by the inclusion of a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term into the bulk.
However, we show that the opposite occurs: the GB effect seems instead to
induce a breakdown of the phantom-like behaviour at an even smaller redshift.
