In quantum Bayesian inference problems, any conclusions drawn from a finite
number of measurements depend not only on the outcomes of the measurements but
also on a prior. Here we show that, in general, the prior remains important
even in the limit of an infinite number of measurements. We illustrate this
point with several examples where two priors lead to very different conclusions
given the same measurement data.
