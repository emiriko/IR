From dumbbells to FCC crystals, we study the self-assembly pathway of
amphiphatic, spherical colloidal particles as a function of the size of the
hydrophobic region using molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we
analyze how local inter-particle interactions correlate to the final
self-assembled aggregate and how they affect the dynamical pathway of structure
formation. We present a detailed diagram separating the many phases that we
find for different sizes of the hydrophobic area, and uncover a narrow region
where particles self-assemble into hollow, faceted cages that could potentially
find interesting engineering applications.
