We have conducted millimeter interferometric observations of the Orion
Molecular Cloud-2 (OMC-2) FIR 6 region at an angular resolution of $\sim$
4$\arcsec$ - 7$\arcsec$ with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA). In the 3.3 mm
continuum emission we detected dusty core counterparts of the previously
identified FIR sources (FIR 6a, 6b, 6c, and 6d), and moreover, resolved FIR 6a
into three dusty cores. The size and mass of these cores are estimated to be
1100-5900 AU and 0.19-5.5 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. We found that in the
$^{12}$CO ($J$=1--0) emission FIR 6b, 6c, and 6d eject the molecular outflow
and that the FIR 6c outflow also exhibits at least two collimated jet-like
components in the SiO ($J$=2--1) emission. At the tip of one of the SiO
components there appears abrupt increase of the SiO line width ($\sim$ 15 km
s$^{-1}$), where the three resolved cores in FIR 6a seem to delineate the tip.
These results imply the presence of the interaction and the bowshock front
between the FIR 6c molecular outflow and FIR 6a.
