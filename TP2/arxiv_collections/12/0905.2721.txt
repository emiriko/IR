We study an effect of large-scale coherent structures on global properties of
turbulent convection in laboratory experiments in air flow in a rectangular
chamber with aspect ratios $A \approx 2$ and $A\approx 4$ (with the Rayleigh
numbers varying in the range from $5 \times 10^6$ to $10^8$). The large-scale
coherent structures comprise the one-cell and two-cell flow patterns. We found
that a main contribution to the turbulence kinetic energy production in
turbulent convection with large-scale coherent structures is due to the
non-uniform large-scale motions. Turbulence in large Rayleigh number convection
with coherent structures is produced by shear, rather than by buoyancy. We
determined the scalings of global parameters (e.g., the production and
dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy, the turbulent velocity and integral
turbulent scale, the large-scale shear, etc.) of turbulent convection versus
the temperature difference between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber.
These scalings are in an agreement with our theoretical predictions. We
demonstrated that the degree of inhomogeneity of the turbulent convection with
large-scale coherent structures is small.
