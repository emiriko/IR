The classical limit problem of quantum mechanics is revisited on the basis of
a scheme that enables a quantitative study of the way the quantum-classical
agreement emerges while going through the intermediate mass range between the
microscopic and the macroscopic domains. As a specific application of such a
scheme, we investigate the classical limit of a quantum time distribution - an
area of study that has remained largely unexplored. For this purpose, we focus
on the arrival time distribution in order to examine the way the observable
results pertaining to the quantum arrival time distribution which is defined in
terms of the probability current density gradually approach the relevant
classical statistical results for an ensemble that corresponds to a Gaussian
wave packet evolving in a linear potential.
