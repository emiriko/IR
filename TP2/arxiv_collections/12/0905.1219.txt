Some Cerium compounds exhibit hysteresis cycles with sharp macroscopic jumps
in the magnetization at very low temperatures. This effect is attributed to the
formation of clusters in which the anisotropy competes with the applied
magnetic field. Here, we present a simple model where a lattice of
ferromagnetically coupled spins is separated in clusters of random sizes and
with random anisotropy. Within this model, we obtain hysteresis cycles
presenting jumps that behave in a similar way that the experimental ones, and
that disappear when increasing the temperature. The results are in good
agreement with the hysteresis cycles measured at very low temperatures in
CeNi$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$ and the comparison with these experimental results allows
to discriminate the relative importance of the mechanisms driving the thermal
evolution of the cycles.
