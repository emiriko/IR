We have calculated the cross section of the process e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma
\to b\bar{b} in the littlest Higgs model with T parity (LHT). We find that, for
the favorable parameters, the total cross section \sigma(e^+e^- \to
\gamma\gamma \to b\bar{b}) is sensitive to the breaking scale f, mixing
parameter x_L, the masses of the mirror quarks m_{Hi}, and the relative
correction of the LHT model is a few percent to dozens of percent. The cross
section is significantly larger than the corresponding results in the standard
model and in the other typical new physics models. Therefore the prediction in
the LHT model is quite different from the predictions in other new physics
models and such a process is really interesting in searching for the signs of
the LHT model.
