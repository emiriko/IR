The main sources of information energy in the universe are shown to be
stellar heated gas and dust and black holes. Information energy has properties
similar to dark energy with a significant energy density that has remained
nearly constant for at least the last half of cosmic time, corresponding to an
equation of state parameter, wi~-1, the value unique to dark energy. Changes in
universe information content during star formation require an accelerating
universe expansion in order to ensure dI>0. The size of this required
acceleration is in good agreement with the observed extra doubling in universe
size due to dark energy. Any information energy contribution to dark energy is
determined by the extent of star formation, possibly answering the 'cosmic
coincidence' question - 'Why now?'
