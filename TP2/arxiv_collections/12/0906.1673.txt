People have to make important decisions within a time frame. Hence, it is
imperative to employ means or strategy to aid effective decision making.
Consequently, Economic Intelligence (EI) has emerged as a field to aid
strategic and timely decision making in an organization. In the course of
attaining this goal: it is indispensable to be more optimistic towards
provision for conservation of intellectual resource invested into the process
of decision making. This intellectual resource is nothing else but the
knowledge of the actors as well as that of the various processes for effecting
decision making. Knowledge has been recognized as a strategic economic resource
for enhancing productivity and a key for innovation in any organization or
community. Thus, its adequate management with cognizance of its temporal
properties is highly indispensable. Temporal properties of knowledge refer to
the date and time (known as timestamp) such knowledge is created as well as the
duration or interval between related knowledge. This paper focuses on the needs
for a user-centered knowledge management approach as well as exploitation of
associated temporal properties. Our perspective of knowledge is with respect to
decision-problems projects in EI. Our hypothesis is that the possibility of
reasoning about temporal properties in exploitation of knowledge in EI projects
should foster timely decision making through generation of useful inferences
from available and reusable knowledge for a new project.
