We classify all noetherian Hopf algebras $H$ over an algebraically closed
field $k$ of characteristic zero which are integral domains of Gelfand-Kirillov
dimension two and satisfy the condition $\Ext^1_H(k,k)\neq 0$. The latter
condition is conjecturally redundant, as no examples are known (among
noetherian Hopf algebra domains of GK-dimension two) where it fails.
