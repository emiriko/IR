We examine the stability of hadron resonance gas models by extending them to
take care of undiscovered resonances through the Hagedorn formula. We find that
the influence of unknown resonances on thermodynamics is large but bounded.
Hadron resonance gases are internally consistent up to a temperature higher
than the cross over temperature in QCD; but by examining quark number
susceptibilities we find that their region of applicability seems to end even
below the QCD cross over. We model the decays of resonances and investigate the
ratios of particle yields in heavy-ion collisions. We find that observables
such as hydrodynamics and hadron yield ratios change little upon extending the
model. As a result, heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC are insensitive to a
possible exponential rise in the hadronic density of states, thus increasing
the stability of the predictions of hadron resonance gas models.
