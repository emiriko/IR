There has been strong observational evidence suggesting a causal connection
between the binary history of neutron stars and the evolution of their magnetic
field. In this article we discuss one of the plausible mechanisms proposed for
the evolution of the surface magnetic field, that of the diamagnetic screening
of the field by accreted material.
