We consider the late-time asymptotic behavior for solutions of Einstein's
equations with the wave map matter. Solutions starting from small compactly
supported $\ell$-equivariant initial data with $\ell\geq 1$ are shown to decay
as $t^{-(2\ell+2)}$ at future timelike infinity and as $u^{-(\ell+1)}$ at
future null infinity.
