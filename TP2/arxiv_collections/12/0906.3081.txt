We investigate the geometric phase or Berry phase of adiabatic quantum
evolution in an atom-molecule conversion system, and find that the Berry phase
in such system consists of two parts: the usual Berry connection term and a
novel term from the nonlinearity brought forth by the atom-molecule conversion.
The geometric phase can be viewed as the flux of the magnetic field of a
monopole through the surface enclosed by a closed path in parameter space. The
charge of the monopole, however, is found to be one third of the elementary
charge of the usual quantized monopole.
