We investigate a model of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate residing
on an optical lattice. Within a Bogolioubov-approach at the mean-field level,
we derive exact analytical expressions for the excitation spectrum of the
two-component condensate when taking into account hopping and interactions
between arbitrary sites. Our results thus constitute a basis for works that
seek to clarify the effects of higher-order interactions in the system. We
investigate the excitation spectrum and the two branches of superfluid velocity
in more detail for two limiting cases of particular relevance. Moreover, we
relate the hopping and interaction parameters in the effective Bose-Hubbard
model to microscopic parameters in the system, such as the laserlight
wavelength and atomic masses of the components in the condensate. These results
are then used to calculate analytically and numerically the drag coefficient
between the components of the condensate. We find that the drag is most
effective close to the symmetric case of equal masses between the components,
regardless of the strength of the intercomponent interaction and the lattice
well depth.
