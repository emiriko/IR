One of the key ingredients to understand the properties of neutrons stars is
the equation of state at finite densities far beyond nuclear saturation.
Investigating the phase structure of quark matter that might be realized in the
core of NS inspires theory and observation. We discuss recent results of our
work to point out our view on challenges and possibilities in this evolving
field by means of a few examples.
