We review what we have learned about the scattering of electrons by the
interfaces between two different metals (M1/M2) in the
current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) geometry. In this geometry, the intrinsic
quantity is the specific resistance, AR, the product of the area through which
the CPP current flows times the CPP resistance. We describe results for both
non-magnetic/non-magnetic (N1/N2) and ferromagnetic/non-magnetic (F/N) pairs.
We focus especially upon cases where M1/M2 are lattice matched (i.e., have the
same crystal structure and the same lattice parameters to within ~ 1%), because
in these cases no-free-parameter calculations of 2AR agree surprisingly well
with measured values. But we also list and briefly discuss cases where M1/M2
are not lattice matched, either having different crystal structures, or lattice
parameters that differ by several percent. The published calculations of 2AR in
these latter cases do not agree so well with measured values.
