Recently proposed Horava-Lifshitz gravity promises a UV completion of
Einstein's theory by sacrificing general covariance at short distances and
introducing anisotropic spacetime scaling. Here we present a dyonic solution by
coupling this theory to a vector field and we discuss some properties of
solution.
