Pressure-melting temperature relationship is proposed and tested against the
experiments of metals (Pt and Al), salt (NaCl), and ceramic (MgO) with positive
results. The equation contains one open parameter which remains constant for
the investigated substances. The constant value of the parameter indicates that
the presented equation for the melting curve might be the first one which does
not contain any arbitrary constant which is left open to fit to the
experiments.
