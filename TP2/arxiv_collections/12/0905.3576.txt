We develop an asynchronous event-driven First-Passage Kinetic Monte Carlo
(FPKMC) algorithm for continuous time and space systems involving multiple
diffusing and reacting species of spherical particles in two and three
dimensions. The FPKMC algorithm presented here is based on the method
introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett., 97:230602, 2006] and is implemented in a
robust and flexible framework. Unlike standard KMC algorithms such as the
n-fold algorithm, FPKMC is most efficient at low densities where it replaces
the many small hops needed for reactants to find each other with large
first-passage hops sampled from exact time-dependent Green's functions, without
sacrificing accuracy. We describe in detail the key components of the
algorithm, including the event-loop and the sampling of first-passage
probability distributions, and demonstrate the accuracy of the new method. We
apply the FPKMC algorithm to the challenging problem of simulation of long-term
irradiation of metals, relevant to the performance and aging of nuclear
materials in current and future nuclear power plants. The problem of radiation
damage spans many decades of time-scales, from picosecond spikes caused by
primary cascades, to years of slow damage annealing and microstructure
evolution. Our implementation of the FPKMC algorithm has been able to simulate
the irradiation of a metal sample for durations that are orders of magnitude
longer than any previous simulations using the standard Object KMC or more
recent asynchronous algorithms.
