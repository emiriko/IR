ARIES Baker-Nunn Schmidt telescope project is converting a Baker-Nunn
satellite tracking camera for Astronomical research. Original Baker-Nunn camera
produces an extremely large (5X30 degree) curved focal plane at the prime focus
for photographic imaging. We present here the re-designing of the camera
produces a wide (4 X 4 degree) flat field of view for CCD imaging observations,
which have many scientific potentials in Astronomy. Imaging performance of the
CCD camera is also estimated.
