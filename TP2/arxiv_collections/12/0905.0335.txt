We investigate the dynamics of quasiparticle agglomerates in edge states of
the Jain sequence for \nu=2/5. Comparison of the Fradkin-Lopez model with the
Wen one is presented within a field theoretical construction, focusing on
similarities and differences. We demonstrate that both models predict the same
universal role for the multiple-quasiparticle agglomerates that dominate on
single quasiparticles at low energy. This result is induced by the presence of
neutral modes with finite velocity and is essential to explain the anomalous
behavior of tunneling conductance and noise through a point contact.
