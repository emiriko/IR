Symport/antiport P systems provide a very simple machinery inspired by
corresponding operations in the living cell. It turns out that systems of small
descriptional complexity are needed to achieve the universality by these
systems. This makes them a good candidate for small universal devices replacing
register machines for different simulations, especially when a simulating
parallel machinery is involved. This article contains survey of these systems
and presents different trade-offs between parameters.
