The affect of demographic stochasticity of a system of globally coupled
chaotic maps is considered. A two-step model is studied, where the intra-patch
chaotic dynamics is followed by a migration step that coupled all patches; the
equilibrium number of agents on each site, $N$, controls the strength of the
discreteness-induced fluctuations. For small $N$ (large fluctuations) a
period-doubling cascade appears as the coupling (migration) increases. As $N$
grows an extremely slow dynamic emerges, leading to a flow along a
one-dimensional family of almost period 2 solutions. This manifold become a
true solutions in the deterministic limit. The degeneracy between different
attractors that characterizes the clustering phase of the deterministic system
is thus the $N \to \infty$ limit of the slow dynamics manifold.
