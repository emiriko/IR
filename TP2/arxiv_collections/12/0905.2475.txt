We determine both representations of the Fundamental Plane [Re Sig^a Ie^b and
Re (Sig^2/Ie)^lambda] and the luminosity-effective phase space density [L
fe^(-gamma)] scaling relation for N-body remnants of binary mergers of
spiral-like galaxies. The main set of merger simulations involves a mass-ratio
of the progenitors in the range of about 1:1 to 1:5, harboring or not a
bulge-like component, and are constructed using a cosmological motivated model.
Equal-mass mergers are also considered. Remnants lead to average values for the
scaling indices of <a>~1.6, <b>~0.6, <lambda>~0.7, and <gamma>~0.65. These
values are consistent with those of K--band observations (Mobasher et al. 1999)
of ellipticals: <a>~1.5, <b>~0.8, <lambda>~0.7, and <gamma>~0.60. The b index
is, however, not well reproduced. This study does not allow us to establish a
conclusive preference for models with or without a bulge as progenitors. Our
results indicate that the L--fe and FP scalings might be determined to a large
extent by dissipationless processes, a result that appears to be in
contradiction to other dissipationless results.
