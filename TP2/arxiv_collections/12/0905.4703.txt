Some characteristics of midvelocity emissions in semiperipheral heavy-ion
collisions at Fermi energies are discussed in the framework of a
multifragmenting scenario. We report on binary dissipative collisions of 93Nb +
93Nb at 38AMeV in which we measured an abundant emission of particles and
fragments not originated from the usual evaporative decay of hot primary
fragments. We checked the compatibility of these emissions with the
multifragmentation of a source which forms in the overlap region. One can
fairly well reproduce the data assuming a hot and dilute source, possibly more
n-rich than the initial nuclei; the results appear to be insensitive to the
source size.
