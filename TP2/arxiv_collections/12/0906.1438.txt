This paper describes a novel atom-cavity interaction induced by periodically
poled atom-cavity coupling constant which leads to multiple narrow
photoemission bands for an initially inverted two-level atom under the strong
coupling condition. The emission bandpass narrowing has a close analogy with
the folded Solc filter in the context of quasi-phase matching by periodic
poling. We present a closed form solution of the emission probability at the
end of interaction and deduce the multiple phase matching condition for this
system which is programmable by the interaction time. The Bloch sphere analysis
provides a clear understanding of the underlying atomic dynamics associated
with the multiple resonances in the semiclassical limit. Furthermore, we show
that this interaction can be applied to generation of the nonclassical field
with sub-Poisson photon statistics.
