We review the structure of local Lagrangians and field equations for free
bosonic and fermionic gauge fields of mixed symmetry in flat space. These are
first presented in a constrained setting and then the ($\g$-)trace constraints
on fields and gauge parameters are eliminated via the introduction of a number
of auxiliary fields.
