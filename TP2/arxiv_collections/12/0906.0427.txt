We study a simple magnetohydrodynamical approach in which hydrodynamics and
MHD turbulence are coupled in a shell model, with given dynamo constrains in
the large scales. We consider the case of a low Prandtl number fluid for which
the inertial range of the velocity field is much wider than that of the
magnetic field. Random reversals of the magnetic field are observed and it
shown that the magnetic field has a non trivial evolution linked to the nature
of the hydrodynamics turbulence.
