ALICE at CERN-LHC is an experiment dedicated to the study of high-energy
heavy-ion collision. In this paper we will briefly describe the experimental
layout and give an overview on the installation status of the ALICE detector
components including an outlook towards the completion of the staged detector
setup. We will review the commissioning of the detector components with
emphasis on the central detectors, in particular the time projection chamber
(TPC). The commissioning took place in summer 2008 awaiting the first beams
from the LHC in the fall. The result from commissioning are compared with the
performance figures, which are outlined in the ALICE Physics Performance
Reports.
