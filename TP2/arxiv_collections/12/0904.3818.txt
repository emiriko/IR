We investigate the solution of the continued fraction equation by which we
determine "the renormalized angular momentum parameter", $\nu$, in the
formalism developed by Leaver and Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi. In this
formalism, we describe the homogeneous solutions of the radial Teukolsky
equation, which is the basic equation of the black hole perturbation formalism.
We find that, contrary to the assumption made in previous works, the solution,
$\nu$, becomes complex valued as $\omega$ (the angular frequency) becomes large
for each $l$ and $m$ (the degree and order of the spin-weighted spheroidal
harmonics). We compare the power radiated by gravitational waves from a
particle in a circular orbit in the equatorial plane around a Kerr black hole
in two ways, one using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism with complex $\nu$
and the other using a direct numerical integration method. We find that the two
methods produce consistent results. These facts prove the validity of using
complex solutions to determine the homogeneous solutions of the Teukolsky
equation.
