We explore the opportunity to look for quark compositeness in the early
stages of the LHC running by analyzing high-$E_T$ dijet production. The quark
substructure that will manifest itself by affecting various kinematic
distributions at the center-of-mass energy $E_{CM}$=10 TeV and in the
integrated luminosity range from 0.5 to 10 fb$^{-1}$ is investigated. The
estimation of the characteristic energy scale $\Lambda$, based on the novel,
potentially powerful observable, is found to be sensitive to the sign of the
interference between Standard Model and four-fermion contact interactions. We
find the lower limits on $\Lambda$ at the LHC to be about 10.5(15.0) TeV for
constructive interference and 8.5(11.5) TeV for destructive one at the
integrated luminosity 0.5(10) fb$^{-1}$ and $E_{CM}=10$ TeV.
