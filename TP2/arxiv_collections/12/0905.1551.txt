We study the asymptotic behavior and the asymptotic stability of the
two-dimensional Euler equations and of the two-dimensional linearized Euler
equations close to parallel flows. We focus on spectrally stable jet profiles
$U(y)$ with stationary streamlines $y_{0}$ such that $U'(y_{0})=0$, a case that
has not been studied previously. We describe a new dynamical phenomenon: the
depletion of the vorticity at the stationary streamlines. An unexpected
consequence, is that the velocity decays for large times with power laws,
similarly to what happens in the case of the Orr mechanism for base flows
without stationary streamlines. The asymptotic behaviors of velocity and the
asymptotic profiles of vorticity are theoretically predicted and compared with
direct numerical simulations. We argue on the asymptotic stability of these
flow velocities even in the absence of any dissipative mechanisms.
