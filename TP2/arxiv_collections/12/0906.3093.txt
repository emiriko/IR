Using simulations of hard rods in smectic-A states, we find non-gaussian
diffusion and heterogeneous dynamics due to the equilibrium periodic smectic
density profiles, which give rise to permanent barriers for layer-to-layer
diffusion. This relaxation behavior is surprisingly similar to that of
non-equilibrium supercooled liquids, although there the particles are trapped
in transient (instead of permanent) cages. Interestingly, we also find
stringlike clusters of up to 10 inter-layer rods exhibiting dynamic
cooperativity in this equilibrium state.
