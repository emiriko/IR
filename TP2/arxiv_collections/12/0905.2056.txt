Exclusive photoproduction of dileptons, gamma N ->l+l- N, is and will be
measured in ultraperipheralcollisions at hadron colliders. We demonstrate that
the timelike deeply virtual Compton scattering (TCS) mechanism gamma q -> l+l-
q, where the lepton pair comes from the subprocess gamma q -> gamma* q,
dominates in some accessible kinematical regions, thus opening a new way to
study generalized parton distributions (GPD) in the nucleon at small
skewedness.
