The MEG Experiment searches for a lepton flavour violating decay,
$\mu^+\to\mathrm{e}^+\gamma $, with a branching-ratio sensitivity of $10^{-13}$
in order to explore the parameter region predicted by many theoretical models
beyond the Standard Model. Detector construction and the Engineering Run were
completed in 2007, and the first Physics Run will be carried out in 2008. In
this paper, the prospects of MEG Physics Run in 2008 is described in addition
to the experimental overview.
