Aggregations of Web resources are increasingly important in scholarship as it
adopts new methods that are data-centric, collaborative, and networked-based.
The same notion of aggregations of resources is common to the mashed-up,
socially networked information environment of Web 2.0. We present a mechanism
to identify and describe aggregations of Web resources that has resulted from
the Open Archives Initiative - Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) project. The
OAI-ORE specifications are based on the principles of the Architecture of the
World Wide Web, the Semantic Web, and the Linked Data effort. Therefore, their
incorporation into the cyberinfrastructure that supports eScholarship will
ensure the integration of the products of scholarly research into the Data Web.
