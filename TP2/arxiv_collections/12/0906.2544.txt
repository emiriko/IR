The solar atmosphere contains a wide variety of small-scale transient
features. Here, we explore the inter-relation between some of them such as
surges, explosive events and blinkers via simultaneous spectral and imaging
data taken with the TRACE imager, the SUMER, and CDS spectrometers on board
SoHO, and SVST La Palma. The alignment of all data both in time and solar XY
shows that SUMER line profiles, which are attributed to explosive events, are
due to a surge phenomenon. The surge is triggered, most probably, by one or
more Elerman bombs which are best visible in Halpha +-350 A but were also
registered by TRACE Fe IX/X 171 A and correspond to a strong radiance increase
in the CDS Mg IX 368.07 A line. With the present study we demonstrate that the
division of small-scale transient events into a number of different subgroups,
for instance explosive events, blinkers, spicules, surges or just brightenings,
is ambiguous, implying that the definition of a feature based only on either
spectroscopic or imaging characteristics as well as insufficient spectral and
spatial resolution can be incomplete.
