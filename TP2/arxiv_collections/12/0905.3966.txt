We apply the property of selfsimilarity that corresponds to the concept of a
fractal universe, to the dimension of time. It follows that any interval of
time, given by any tick of any clock, is proportional to the age of the
universe. The fractality of time gives the fractality of space and mass. First
consequence is that the speed of light decreases inversely proportional to
time, same as the Hubble parameter. We then revise the universal constants and,
at the cosmological scale, they are all of order one, as Dirac proposed. We
find three different scales, each one separated by a factor of about 5x10^60:
the universe, the Planck scale and what we call the sub Planck scale.
Integration of the Einstein cosmological equations, for this fractal universe,
gives the solution of a non-expanding universe with the present value of the
observed numerical parameters. The red shift measured from the distant galaxies
is interpreted here as due to the decreasing speed of light in a fractal
universe.
