We investigate the infrared singularity structure of Feynman diagrams
entering the next-to-leading-order (NLO) DGLAP kernel (non-singlet). We examine
cancellations between diagrams for two gluon emission contributing to NLO
kernels. We observe the crucial role of color coherence effects in
cancellations of infra-red singularities. Numerical calculations are explained
using analytical formulas for the singular contributions.
