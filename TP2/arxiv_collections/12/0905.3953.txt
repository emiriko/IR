We explain the Fano peak (an asymmetric resonance peak) as an interference
effect involving resonant states. We reveal that there are three types of Fano
asymmetry according to their origins: the interference between a resonant state
and an anti-resonant state, that between a resonant state and a bound state,
and that between two resonant states. We show that the last two show the
asymmetric energy dependence given by Fano, but the first one shows a slightly
different form. In order to show the above, we analytically and microscopically
derive a formula where we express the conductance purely in terms of the
summation over all discrete eigenstates including resonant states and
anti-resonant states, without any background integrals. We thereby obtain
microscopic expressions of the Fano parameters that describe the three types of
the Fano asymmetry. One of the expressions indicate that the corresponding Fano
parameter becomes complex under an external magnetic field.
