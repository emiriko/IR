The old Bulgarian keyboard standard BDS 5237-78 was developed for use mostly
on typewriter machines. The wide distribution of the computers forced the
update of this standard. On one hand this is because of the need to support
symbols such as the Bulgarian quotation marks, the Cyrillic letter I with grave
accent, the long dash, etc. On the other hand the so called "phonetic layout"
became popular and this layout is not standartized by BDS. In this work we are
analyzing the possibilities to improve the keyboard layout according to BDS
5237-78, as well as the traditional phonetic layout. At the same time we are
making a comparison with the new proposed Bulgarian keyboard layout standard
BDS 5237:2006. We are proposing an algorithm for placement of additional
symbols on the keys of the keyboard in a way that makes easy for the users to
find the symbols even when they are not inscripted on the keys. We are giving
formal definitions and illustrations of four keyboard layouts - three extended
keyboard layouts for typing in "Cyrillic" mode (BDS, traditional phonetic and
phonetic according to the new proposed BDS 5237:2006) and one extended layout
for typing in "Latin" mode.
