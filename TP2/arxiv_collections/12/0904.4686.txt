The problem of computing the edit-distance between a string and a finite
automaton arises in a variety of applications in computational biology, text
processing, and speech recognition. This paper presents linear-space algorithms
for computing the edit-distance between a string and an arbitrary weighted
automaton over the tropical semiring, or an unambiguous weighted automaton over
an arbitrary semiring. It also gives an efficient linear-space algorithm for
finding an optimal alignment of a string and such a weighted automaton.
