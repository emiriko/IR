We report magnetic and transport properties of a new quaternary borocarbide
PrRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$C, based on magnetisation, resistivity and specific heat
studies. This compound forms in LuNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C-type tetragonal structure
(space group {\it I4/mmm}) and does not exhibit magnetic ordering or
superconductivity down to 0.5 K. The crystal field analysis of specific heat
data suggests a singlet ground state in this compound. The high value of the
Sommerfeld coefficient, $\gamma$ $\approx$ 250 mJ/mole K$^{2}$, together with a
singlet ground state suggests that the heavy fermion behaviour in
PrRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$C results from the interaction of the conduction electrons
with the low lying crystal field excitations. No signature of magnetic ordering
or superconductivity is observed in PrRh$_{2}$B$_{2}$C under the application of
pressure up to 23 kbar.
