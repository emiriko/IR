We report the results of the Suzaku X-ray observation of XSS J12270-4859, one
of the hard X-ray sources in the INTEGRAL catalogue. The object has been
classified as an intermediate polar (IP) by optical spectra and a putative
X-ray period of ~860 s. With a 30 ks exposure of Suzaku, we obtained a
well-exposed spectrum in the 0.2-70 keV band. We conclude against the previous
IP classification based on the lack of Fe Ka emission features in the spectrum
and the failure to confirm the previously reported X-ray period. Instead, the
X-ray light curve is filled with exotic phenomena, including repetitive flares
lasting ~100 s, occasional dips with no apparent periodicities, spectral
hardening after some flares, and bimodal changes pivoting between quiet and
active phases. The rapid flux changes, the dips, and the power-law spectrum
point toward the interpretation that this is a low-mass X-ray binary. Some
temporal characteristics are similar to those in the Rapid Burster and GRO
J1744-28, making XSS J12270-4859 a very rare object.
