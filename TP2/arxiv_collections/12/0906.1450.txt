An overview over the recent heavy flavour results of the H1 and ZEUS
collaborations is presented. Various techniques to tag the heavy quark, which
allow to explore different phase space regions, are employed. Predictions of
pertubative QCD are compared to the charm and beauty production data. Charm and
beauty fractions of the proton structure function $F_2$ are
