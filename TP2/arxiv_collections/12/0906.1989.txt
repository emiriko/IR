Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), driven with pulses of optimum
shape and delay has the potential of reaching fidelities high enough to make it
suitable for fault-tolerant quantum information processing. The optimum pulse
shapes are obtained upon reduction of STIRAP to effective two-state systems. We
use the Dykhne-Davis-Pechukas (DDP) method to minimize nonadiabatic transitions
and to maximize the fidelity of STIRAP. This results in a particular relation
between the pulse shapes of the two fields driving the Raman process. The
DDP-optimized version of STIRAP maintains its robustness against variations in
the pulse intensities and durations, the single-photon detuning and possible
losses from the intermediate state.
