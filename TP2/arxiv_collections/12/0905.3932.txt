Explicit-exact expressions for the particle propagator of the spin 1/2
Calogero-Sutherland model are derived for the system of a finite number of
particles and for that in the thermodynamic limit. Derivation of the expression
in the thermodynamic limit is also presented in detail. Combining this result
with the hole propagator obtained in earlier studies, we calculate the spectral
function of the single particle Green's function in the full range of the
energy and momentum space. The resultant spectral function exhibits power-law
singularity characteristic to correlated particle systems in one dimension.
