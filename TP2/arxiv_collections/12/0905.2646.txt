Monotonic convergence is established for a general class of multiplicative
algorithms introduced by Silvey, Titterington and Torsney [Comm. Statist.
Theory Methods 14 (1978) 1379--1389] for computing optimal designs. A
conjecture of Titterington [Appl. Stat. 27 (1978) 227--234] is confirmed as a
consequence. Optimal designs for logistic regression are used as an
illustration.
