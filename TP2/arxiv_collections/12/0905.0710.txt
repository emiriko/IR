Spatial manipulation of current flow in graphene could be achieved through
the use of a tilted pn junction. We show through numerical simulation that a
pseudo-Hall effect (i.e. non-equilibrium charge and current density
accumulating along one of the sides of a graphene ribbon) can be observed under
these conditions. The tilt angle and the pn transition length are two key
parameters in tuning the strength of this effect. This phenomenon can be
explained using classical trajectory via ray analysis, and is therefore
relatively robust against disorder. Lastly, we propose and simulate a three
terminal device that allows direct experimental access to the proposed effect.
