We employ a continuous dynamical decoupling scheme to suppress the
decoherence induced by elastic collisions of cold atoms. Using a continuous
echo pulse we achieve a thirty-fold increase in the coherence time of Rb87
atoms trapped in a dipole trap. Coherence times of more than 100ms are
demonstrated for an ensemble with an optical depth of 120.
