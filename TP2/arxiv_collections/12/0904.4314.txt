A heterostructure of a semi-infinite metal and a Mott insulator is
considered. It is supposed that both materials have an identical lattice
spacing and hopping integrals and differ in the Hubbard repulsion which is
negligible in the metal and exceeds the critical value for the Mott transition
in the insulator. At half-filling and for low temperatures the insulator has
the long-range antiferromagnetic order. Its low-lying elementary excitations
are standing spin waves and a spin-wave mode which is localized near the
interface and has a two-dimensional dispersion. This mode ejects bulk modes
from the boundary region. The antiferromagnetic ordering of the insulator
induces an antiferromagnetic order in the metal where the magnetization decays
exponentially with distance from the interface. This decay is characterized by
the correlation length equal to 5-6 lattice spacings.
