Using mean-field models with a dynamical quenching formalism we show that in
finite domains magnetic helicity fluxes associated with small-scale magnetic
fields are able to alleviate catastrophic quenching. We consider fluxes that
result either from advection by a mean flow, the turbulent mixing down the
gradient of mean small-scale magnetic helicity concentration, or the explicit
removal which may be associated with the effects of coronal mass ejections in
the Sun. In the absence of shear, all the small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes
are found to be equally strong both for large-scale and small-scale fields. In
the presence of shear there is also an additional magnetic helicity flux
associated with the mean field, but this flux does not alleviate catastrophic
quenching. Outside the dynamo-active region there are neither sources nor sinks
of magnetic helicity, so in a steady state this flux must be constant. It is
shown that unphysical behavior emerges if the small-scale magnetic helicity
flux is forced to vanish within the computational domain.
