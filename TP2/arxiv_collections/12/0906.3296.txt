The abundance of beryllium in the oldest, most metal-poor stars acts as a
probe of early star formation and Galactic chemical evolution. We have analyzed
high-resolution, high signal-to-noise Keck/HIRES spectra of 24 stars with
[Fe/H] from -2.3 to -3.5 in order to determine the history of Be abundances and
explore the possibility of a Be plateau. We have determined stellar parameters
spectroscopically. Oxygen abundances have been derived from three OH features
which occur in the same spectral region. We have supplemented this sample with
reanalyzed spectra of 25 stars from previous observations; our total sample
ranges in [Fe/H] from -0.5 to -3.5. We find that the relationship between Be
and [Fe/H] continues to lower metallicities with a slope of 0.92 +-0.04.
Although there is no indication of a plateau with constant Be abundance, the
four lowest metallicity stars do show a Be enhancement relative to Fe. A single
relationship between Be and [O/H] has a slope of 1.21 +-0.08, but there is also
a good fit with two slopes: 1.59 for [O/H] > -1.6 and 0.74 for stars with [O/H]
< -1.6. This change in slope could result from a change in the dominant
production mechanism for Be. In the era of the formation of the more metal poor
stars Be would be formed by acceleration of CNO atoms in the vicinity of SNII
and in later times by high-energy cosmic rays bombarding CNO in the ambient
interstellar gas. We find an excellent correlation between [Fe/H] and [O/H].
