The contact between a liquid and an elastic solid generates a stress vector
depending on the curvature tensor in each point of the separating surface. For
nanometer values of the mean curvature and for suitable materials, the stress
vector takes significant amplitude on the surface. Although the surface average
action of the liquid on the solid is the hydrostatic pressure, the local strain
generates torques tending to regularize the surface undulations and asperities.
