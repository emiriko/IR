We report a determination of the antiproton magnetic moment, measured in a
three-body system, independent of previous experiments. We present results from
a systematic study of the hyperfine (HF) structure of antiprotonic helium where
we have achieved a precision more than a factor of 10 better than our first
measurement. A comparison between the experimental results and three-body
quantum electrodynamic (QED) calculations leads to a new value for the
antiproton magnetic moment is -2.7862 (83) nuclear magnetons, which agrees with
the magnetic moment of the proton within 2.9 x 10e-3.
