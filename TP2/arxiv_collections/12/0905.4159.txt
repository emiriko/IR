The ALPS collaboration runs a light-shining-through-walls (LSW) experiment to
search for photon oscillations into "weakly interacting sub-eV particles"
(WISPs) inside of a superconducting HERA dipole magnet at the site of DESY. In
this paper we report on the first successful integration of a large-scale
optical cavity to boost the available power for WISP production in this type of
experiments. The key elements are a frequency tunable narrow line-width
continuous wave laser acting as the primary light source and an electronic
feed-back control loop to stabilize the power build-up. We describe and
characterize our apparatus and demonstrate the data analysis procedures on the
basis of a brief exemplary run.
