Recent results obtained by the CDF and D0 collaborations are presented here.
These Tevatron Higgs searches look for a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson
decaying into W-boson pairs, with the W-bosons decaying into electron-neutrino
or muon neutrino final states. In the mass range of 135 GeV/c2 to 200 Gev/c2,
the SM Higgs decays prominently into W-boson pairs. The presented results are
based on an integrated luminosity that ranges from 3.0 to 4.2 fb-1. No
significant excess over expected background is observed and the 95% CL limits
are set for a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson for different mass hypotheses
ranging from 100 GeV/c2 to 200 GeV/c2. The combined Tevatron results exclude SM
Higgs boson mass of 160 < m(H) < 170 GeV/c2.
