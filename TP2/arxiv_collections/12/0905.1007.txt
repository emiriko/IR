Our aim is to investigate tidal interaction in High-Mass X-ray Binary stars
in order to determine in which objects the rotation of the mass donors is
synchronized or pseudosynchronized with the orbital motion of the compact
companion. We calculate the pseudosynchronization period (P_ps) and compare it
with the rotational period of the mass donors (P_rot). We find that
  (1) the Be/X-ray binaries are not synchronized, the mass donors rotate faster
than the orbital period and the ratio P_ps/P_rot is 2-300;
  (2) the giant and supergiant systems are close to synchronization and for
them the ratio P_ps/P_rot is 0.3-2.
