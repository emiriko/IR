We present inclusive charged hadron elliptic flow v_2 measured over the
pseudorapidity range |\eta| < 0.35 in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV.
Results for v_2 are presented over a broad range of transverse momentum (p_T =
0.2-8.0 GeV/c) and centrality (0-60%). In order to study non-flow effects that
are not correlated with the reaction plane, as well as the fluctuations of v_2,
we compare two different analysis methods: (1) event plane method from two
independent sub-detectors at forward (|\eta| = 3.1-3.9) and beam (|\eta| > 6.5)
pseudorapidities and (2) two-particle cumulant method extracted using
correlations between particles detected at midrapidity. The two event-plane
results are consistent within systematic uncertainties over the measured p_T
and in centrality 0-40%. There is at most 20% difference of the v_2 between the
two event plane methods in peripheral (40-60%) collisions. The comparisons
between the two-particle cumulant results and the standard event plane
measurements are discussed.
