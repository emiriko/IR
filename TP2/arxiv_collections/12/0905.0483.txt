The observations in many applications consist of counts of discrete events,
such as photons hitting a dector, which cannot be effectively modeled using an
additive bounded or Gaussian noise model, and instead require a Poisson noise
model. As a result, accurate reconstruction of a spatially or temporally
distributed phenomenon (f) from Poisson data (y) cannot be accomplished by
minimizing a conventional l2-l1 objective function. The problem addressed in
this paper is the estimation of f from y in an inverse problem setting, where
(a) the number of unknowns may potentially be larger than the number of
observations and (b) f admits a sparse approximation in some basis. The
optimization formulation considered in this paper uses a negative Poisson
log-likelihood objective function with nonnegativity constraints (since Poisson
intensities are naturally nonnegative). This paper describes computational
methods for solving the constrained sparse Poisson inverse problem. In
particular, the proposed approach incorporates key ideas of using quadratic
separable approximations to the objective function at each iteration and
computationally efficient partition-based multiscale estimation methods.
