A functional approach to the concept of pulse shape synthesis introduced
here. This paper reviews some of the mechanisms influencing the process of
signal induction, and the solution of electric field and charge carriers drift
phenoma are considered for abritrary crystal geometries. Then, preforming some
well known principles and a set of simple techniques provides an open way to
the implementation of pulse shape analysis algorithms.
