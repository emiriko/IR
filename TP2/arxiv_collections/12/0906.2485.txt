In this exploratory study the spectrum of tetraquarks of type $c \bar c s
\bar s$ is calculated within a simple quark model with chromomagnetic
interaction and effective quark masses extracted from meson and baryon spectra.
It is tempting to see if this spectrum can accommodate the resonance Y(4140),
observed by the CDF collaboration, but not yet confirmed. The results seem to
favour the J$^{PC}$ = 1$^{++}$ sector where the coupling to the VV channel is
nearly as small as that of X(3872), when described as a $c \bar c q \bar q$
tetraquark. This suggests that Y(4140) could possibly be the strange partner of
X(3872), in a tetraquark interpretation. However the sector J$^{PC}$ = 0$^{++}$
cannot entirely be excluded. This work questions the practice of extracting
effective quark masses containing spin independent contributions, from mesons
and baryons, to be used in multiquark systems as well.
