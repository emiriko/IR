The fundamental assumption of the Event Calculus is overly simplistic when it
comes to organizations in which time-varying properties have to be actively
maintained and managed in order to continue to hold and termination by another
action is not required for a property to no longer hold. I.e., if active
measures are not taken then things will go haywire by default. Similarly
extension and revision is required for Grounding Checking properties of systems
based on a set of ground inferences. Previously Model Checking as been
performed using the model of nondeterministic automata based on states
determined by time-points. These nondeterministic automata are not suitable for
iOrgs, which are highly structured and operate asynchronously with only loosely
bounded nondeterminism. iOrgs Information Systems have been developed as a
technology in which organizations have people that are tightly integrated with
information technology that enables them to function organizationally. iOrgs
formalize existing practices to provide a framework for addressing issues of
authority, accountability, scalability, and robustness using methods that are
analogous to human organizations. In general -iOrgs are a natural extension Web
Services, which are the standard for distributed computing and software
application interoperability in large-scale Organizational Computing. -iOrgs
are structured by Organizational Commitment that is a special case of Physical
Commitment that is defined to be information pledged. iOrgs norms are used to
illustrate the following: -Even a very simple microtheory for normative
reasoning can engender inconsistency In practice, it is impossible to verify
the consistency of a theory for a practical domain. -Improved Safety in
Reasoning. It is not safe to use classical logic and probability theory in
practical reasoning.
