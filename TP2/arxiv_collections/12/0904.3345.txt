Using a ladder-rainbow kernel previously established for light quark hadron
physics, we explore the extension to masses and electroweak decay constants of
ground state pseudoscalar and vector quarkonia and heavy-light mesons in the c-
and b-quark regions. We make a systematic study of the effectiveness of a
constituent mass concept as a replacement for a heavy quark dressed propagator
for such states. The difference between vector and axial vector current
correlators is explored within the same model to provide an estimate of the
four quark chiral condensate and the leading distance scale for the onset of
non-perturbative phenomena in QCD.
