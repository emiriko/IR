We report a calculation of the baryon magnetic moments using covariant chiral
perturbation theory within the extended-on-mass-shell renormalization scheme
including intermediate octet and decuplet contributions. By fitting the two
available low-energy constants, we improve the Coleman-Glashow description of
the data when we include the leading SU(3) breaking effects coming from the
lowest-order loops. We compare with previous attempts at the same order using
heavy-baryon and covariant infrared chiral perturbation theory, and discuss the
source of the differences.
