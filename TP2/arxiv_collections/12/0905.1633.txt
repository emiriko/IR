We present data of multi harmonic magneto-dynamic experiments. In particular,
we performed ac magnetic susceptibility experiments on layered pnictide-oxide
quaternary compound NdOFeAs doped with fluorine. The experiments allow measure
the critical temperature and probe the flux dynamic behavior using the third
harmonic component of the ac susceptibility of a NdF0.16FeAsO0.84 bulk sample
as a function of temperature and frequency of the applied ac magnetic fields.
Measured signals are connected with the non-linear superconducting flux dynamic
behavior and are characterized by a flux critical states sustaining a
superconducting critical current. In this framework the irreversibility line
that describes the stable superconducting state has been extracted from the
onset of the third harmonic signal vs. frequency. Finally we present also the
analysis of the flux dynamic dimensionality in the investigated sample.
