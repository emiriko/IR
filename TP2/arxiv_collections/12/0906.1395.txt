Langevin equation with a multiplicative stochastic force is considered. That
force is uncorrelated, it has the L\'evy distribution and the power-law
intensity. The Fokker-Planck equations, which correspond both to the It\^o and
Stratonovich interpretation of the stochastic integral, are presented. They are
solved for the case without drift and for the harmonic oscillator potential.
The variance is evaluated; it is always infinite for the It\^o case whereas for
the Stratonovich one it can be finite and rise with time slower that linearly,
which indicates subdiffusion. Analytical results are compared with numerical
simulations.
