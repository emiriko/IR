Population protocols have been introduced as a model of sensor networks
consisting of very limited mobile agents with no control over their own
movement: A collection of anonymous agents, modeled by finite automata,
interact in pairs according to some rules.
  Predicates on the initial configurations that can be computed by such
protocols have been characterized under several hypotheses.
  We discuss here whether and when the rules of interactions between agents can
be seen as a game from game theory. We do so by discussing several basic
protocols.
