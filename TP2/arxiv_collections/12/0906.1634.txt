We study the electronic properties of M\"{o}bius graphene strip with a zigzag
edge. We show that such graphene strip behaves as a topological insulator with
a gapped bulk and a robust metallic surface, which enjoys some features due to
its nontrivial topology of the spatial configuration, such as the existence of
edge states and the non-Abelian induced gauge field. We predict that the
topological properties of the M\"{o}bius graphene strip can be experimentally
displayed by the destructive interference in the transmission spectrum, and the
robustness of edge states under certain perturbations.
