In this note we search for large distance solutions of Horava gravity. In the
case of the "detailed balance" action, gravity solutions asymptote to IR only
above the cosmological constant ($\sim$horizon) scale. However, if one adds IR
dominant terms $\alpha R^{(3)}+\beta \Lambda_W$, one can recover general
relativity solutions on usual scales in the real Universe, provided one
fine-tunes the cosmological constant, reobtaining the usual cosmological
constant problem. We comment on pp wave solutions, in order to gain insight
into the relativistic properties of the theory.
