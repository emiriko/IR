Domain phases in ultrathin Fe/Ni/W(110) films with perpendicular anisotropy
have been studied using the ac magnetic susceptibility. Dynamics on time scales
of minutes to hours were probed by quenching the system from high temperature
to the stripe phase region, and varying the constant rate of temperature
increase as the susceptibility traces were measured. The entire susceptibility
peak is observed to relax slowly along the temperature axis, with the peak
temperature increasing as the rate of heating is decreased. This is precisely
opposite to what would happen if this slow relaxation was driven by changes in
the domain density within the stripe phase. The data are instead consistent
with a simple model for the removal of a significant density of pattern defects
and curvature trapped in the quench from high temperature. A quantitative
analysis confirms that the relaxation dynamics are consistent with the
mesoscopic rearrangement of domains required to remove pattern defects, and
that the experiment constitutes a "dynamical" observation of the phase
transition from a high temperature, positionally disordered phase to the low
temperature, ordered stripe phase.
