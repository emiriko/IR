The displacement- and frequency-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is a multiple
laser interferometer array for gravitational wave detection free from both the
displacement noise of optics and laser frequency noise. So far, partial
experimental demonstrations of DFI have been done in 2-D table top experiments.
In this paper, we report the complete demonstration of a 3-D DFI. The DFI
consists of four Mach-Zehnder interferometers with four mirrors and two
beamsplitters. The displacement noises both of mirrors and beamsplitters were
suppressed by up to 40 dB. The non-vanishing DFI response to a gravitational
wave was successfully confirmed using multiple electro-optic modulators and
computing methods.
