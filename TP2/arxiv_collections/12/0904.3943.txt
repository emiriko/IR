We report measurements of the fluctuations in atmospheric emission
(atmospheric noise) above Mauna Kea recorded with Bolocam at 143 and 268 GHz
from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). The 143 GHz data were
collected during a 40 night observing run in late 2003, and the 268 GHz
observations were made in early 2004 and early 2005 over a total of 60 nights.
Below 0.5 Hz, the data time-streams are dominated by atmospheric noise in all
observing conditions. The atmospheric noise data are consistent with a
Kolmogorov-Taylor (K-T) turbulence model for a thin wind-driven screen, and the
median amplitude of the fluctuations is 280 mK^2 rad^(-5/3) at 143 GHz and 4000
mK^2 rad^(-5/3) at 268 GHz. Comparing our results with previous ACBAR data, we
find that the normalization of the power spectrum of the atmospheric noise
fluctuations is a factor of 80 larger above Mauna Kea than above the South Pole
at millimeter wavelengths. Most of this difference is due to the fact that the
atmosphere above the South Pole is much drier than the atmosphere above Mauna
Kea. However, the atmosphere above the South Pole is slightly more stable as
well: the fractional fluctuations in the column depth of precipitable water
vapor are a factor of sqrt(2) smaller at the South Pole compared to Mauna Kea.
Based on our atmospheric modeling, we developed several algorithms to remove
the atmospheric noise, and the best results were achieved when we described the
fluctuations using a low-order polynomial in detector position over the 8
arcmin field of view (FOV). However, even with these algorithms, we were not
able to reach photon-background-limited instrument photometer (BLIP)
performance at frequencies below 0.5 Hz in any observing conditions.
