A double-Gaussian model and the Schmidt modes are found for the biphoton wave
function characterizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion with the
degenerate collinear phase-matching of the type I and with a pulsed pump. The
obtained results are valid for all durations of the pump pulses, short, long
and intermediately long.
