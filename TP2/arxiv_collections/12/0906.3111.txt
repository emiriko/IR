We predict the acceleration of the Local Group generated by the 2MASS
Redshift Survey within the framework of LambdaCDM and the halo model of
galaxies. We show that as the galaxy fluctuations derived from the halo model
have more power on small scales compared with the mass fluctuations, the
misalignment angle between the CMB velocity vector and the 2MRS dipole is in
reasonable agreement with the observed 21 degrees. This statistical analysis
suggests that it is not necessary to invoke a hypothetical nearby galaxy or a
distant cluster to explain this misalignment.
