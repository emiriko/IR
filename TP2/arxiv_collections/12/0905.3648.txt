The ATLAS BPTX stations are comprised of electrostatic button pick-up
detectors, located 175 m away along the beam pipe on both sides of ATLAS. The
pick-ups are installed as a part of the LHC beam instrumentation and used by
ATLAS for timing purposes.
  The usage of the BPTX signals in ATLAS is twofold: they are used both in the
trigger system and for LHC beam monitoring. The BPTX signals are discriminated
with a constant-fraction discriminator to provide a Level-1 trigger when a
bunch passes through ATLAS. Furthermore, the BPTX detectors are used by a
stand-alone monitoring system for the LHC bunches and timing signals. The BPTX
monitoring system measures the phase between collisions and clock with a
precision better than 100 ps in order to guarantee a stable phase relationship
for optimal signal sampling in the subdetector front-end electronics. In
addition to monitoring this phase, the properties of the individual bunches are
measured and the structure of the beams is determined.
  On September 10, 2008, the first LHC beams reached the ATLAS experiment.
During this period with beam, the ATLAS BPTX system was used extensively to
time in the read-out of the sub-detectors. In this paper, we present the
performance of the BPTX system and its measurements of the first LHC beams.
