The dielectric environment of thin semiconductor nanowires can affect the
charge transport properties inside the wire. In this work, it is shown that
Coulomb impurity scattering inside thin nanowires can be damped strongly by
coating the wire with a high-k dielectric. This will lead to an increase in the
mobility of free charges inside the wire.
