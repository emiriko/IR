The BH masses and the Eddington ratios for a sample of 65 young radio
galaxies [27 GPS and 38 CSS sources] are estimated by various methods. We find
that the average BH mass of these young radio galaxies is <log M_bh>=8.3, which
is less than that of radio loud QSOs and low redshift radio galaxies(<log
M_bh>=9.0). The CSS/GPS sources have relatively high Eddington ratios with
average ratio <log L_bol/L_Edd>=-0.56, which are similar to those of narrow
line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). It suggests that the CSS/GPS sources may not
only be in the early stage of radio activities, but also in the early stage of
their accretion activities.
  We find that the young radio galaxies as a class deviate systematically from
the M_bh-\sigma_* relation defined by nearby inactive galaxies, when using
\sigma_[O III] as a surrogate for the stellar velocity dispersion \sigma_*.
There is no significant correlation between the deviation of the [O III]
emission line width, $\Delta\sigma$=\sigma_[O III]-\sigma_[pred], and the
jet/accretion power, where \sigma_[pred] are calculated from the Tremaine et
al. relation using the estimated BH masses. However, we find that the deviation
$\Delta\sigma$ in young radio galaxies is well correlated with the Eddington
ratio, and this correlation is found to be similar to that of radio quiet AGN
(QSOs/NLS1s) where the radio jet is absent or weak. We suggest that the
accretion activities may still play an important role in shaping the kinematics
of [O III] narrow line in these young radio galaxies.
