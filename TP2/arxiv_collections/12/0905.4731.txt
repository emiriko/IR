We present a new technique for measuring the abundance of europium, a
representative r-process element, in solar-metallicity stars. Our algorithm
compares LTE synthetic spectra with high-resolution observational spectra using
a chi-square-minimization routine. The analysis is fully automated, and
therefore allows consistent measurement of blended lines even across very large
stellar samples. We compare our results with literature europium abundance
measurements and find them to be consistent; we also find our method generates
smaller errors.
