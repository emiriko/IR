We investigate the properties of circumplanetary discs formed in
three-dimensional, self-gravitating radiation hydrodynamical models of gas
accretion by protoplanets. We determine disc sizes, scaleheights, and density
and temperature profiles for different protoplanet masses, in solar nebulae of
differing grain opacities.
  We find that the analytical prediction of circumplanetary disc radii in an
evacuated gap (R_Hill/3) from Quillen & Trilling (1998) yields a good estimate
for discs formed by high mass protoplanets. The radial density profiles of the
circumplanetary discs may be described by power-laws between r^-2 and r^-3/2.
We find no evidence for the ring-like density enhancements that have been found
in some previous models of circumplanetary discs. Temperature profiles follow a
~r^-7/10 power-law regardless of protoplanet mass or nebula grain opacity. The
discs invariably have large scaleheights (H/r > 0.2), making them thick in
comparison with their encompassing circumstellar discs, and they show no
flaring.
