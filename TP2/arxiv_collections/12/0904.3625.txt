Thermally activated flux flow and vortex glass transition of recently
discovered SmFeAsO$_{0.9}$F$_{0.1}$ superconductor are studied in magnetic
fields up to 9.0 T. The thermally activated energy is analyzed in two analytic
methods, of which one is conventional and generally used, while the other is
closer to the theoretical description. The thermally activated energy values
determined from both methods are discussed and compared. In addition, several
critical magnetic fields determined from resistivity measurements are presented
and discussed.
