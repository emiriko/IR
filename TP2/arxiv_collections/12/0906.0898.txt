A critical re-examination of the double-slit experiment and its variants is
presented to clarify the nature of what Feynmann called the ``central mystery''
and the ``only mystery'' of quantum mechanics, leading to an interpretation of
complementarity in which a `wave {\em and} particle' description rather than a
`wave {\em or} particle' description is valid for the {\em same} experimental
set up, with the wave culminating in the particle sequentially in time. This
interpretation is different from Bohr's but is consistent with the von Neumann
formulation as well as some more recent interpretations of quantum mechanics.
