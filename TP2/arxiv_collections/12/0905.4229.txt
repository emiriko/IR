We compute the entropy density of the confined phase of QCD without quarks on
the lattice to very high accuracy. The results are compared to the entropy
density of free glueballs, where we include all the known glueball states below
the two-particle threshold. We find that an excellent, parameter-free
description of the entropy density between 0.7Tc and Tc is obtained by
extending the spectrum with the exponential spectrum of the closed bosonic
string.
