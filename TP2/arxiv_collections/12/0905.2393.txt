Generalizing the work by Cherkis and Schwarz [1], we carry out the double
dimensional reduction of supersymmetric M5 brane on K3 to obtain the
supersymmetric action of heterotic string in 7-dimensional flat space-time.
Motivated by this result, we propose the supersymmetric heterotic action in
10-dimensional flat space-time where the current algebra is realized in a novel
way. We explicitly verify the kappa-symmetry of the proposed action.
