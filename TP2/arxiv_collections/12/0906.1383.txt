We theoretically study a circuit QED architecture based on a superconducting
flux qubit directly coupled to the center conductor of a coplanar waveguide
transmission-line resonator. As already shown experimentally [Abdumalikov et
al. Phys. Rev. B 78, 180502 (2008)], the strong coupling regime of cavity QED
can readily be achieved by optimizing the local inductance of the resonator in
the vicinity of the qubit. In addition to yielding stronger coupling with
respect to other proposals for flux qubit based circuit QED, this approach
leads to a qubit-resonator coupling strength g which does not scale as the area
of the qubit but is proportional to the total inductance shared between the
resonator and the qubit. Strong coupling can thus be attained while still
minimizing sensitivity to flux noise. Finally, we show that by taking advantage
of the the large kinetic inductance of a Josephson junction in the center
conductor of the resonator can lead to coupling energies of several tens of
percent of the resonator frequency, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime of
cavity QED where the rotating-wave approximation breaks down. This should allow
an on-chip implementation of the E x B Jahn-Teller model.
