Following a recent paper by X. Tolsa and A. Ruiz de Villa [Non existence of
principal values of signed Riesz transforms of non integer dimension,
preprint], we show that the finiteness of square function associated with the
Riesz transforms with respect to Hausdorff measure $H^s$ implies that $s$ is
integer.
