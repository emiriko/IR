Using data collected on the psi(3770) resonance and near the Ds*+ Ds- peak
production energy by the CLEO-c detector, we study the decays of the possible
D->PP modes and report measurements of or upper limits on all branching
fractions for Cabibbo-favored, singly-Cabibbo-suppressed, and
doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed D->PP decays except modes involving K0L (and except
D0->K+ pi-). We normalize with respect to the Cabibbo-favored D modes, D0->K-
pi+, D+->K- pi+ pi+, and Ds+->K+ K0S.
