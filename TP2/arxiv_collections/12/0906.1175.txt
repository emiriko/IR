Laser pulses with stable electric field waveforms establish the opportunity
to achieve coherent control on attosecond timescales. We present experimental
and theoretical results on the steering of electronic motion in a
multi-electron system. A very high degree of light-waveform control over the
directional emission of C+ and O+ fragments from the dissociative ionization of
CO was observed. Ab initio based model calculations reveal contributions to the
control related to the ionization and laser-induced population transfer between
excited electronic states of CO+ during dissociation.
