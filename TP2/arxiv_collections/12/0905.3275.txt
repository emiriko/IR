We prove that the electromagnetic material parameters are uniquely determined
by boundary measurements for the time-harmonic Maxwell equations in certain
anisotropic settings. We give a uniqueness result in the inverse problem for
Maxwell equations on an admissible Riemannian manifold, and a uniqueness result
for Maxwell equations in Euclidean space with admissible matrix coefficients.
The proofs are based on a new Fourier analytic construction of complex
geometrical optics solutions on admissible manifolds, and involve a proper
notion of uniqueness for such solutions.
