In this work we study the detection of weak stimuli by spiking neurons in the
presence of certain level of noisy background neural activity. Our study has
focused in the realistic assumption that the synapses in the network present
activity-dependent processes, such as short-term synaptic depression and
facilitation. Employing mean-field techniques as well as numerical simulations,
we found that there are two possible noise levels which optimize signal
transmission. This new finding is in contrast with the classical theory of
stochastic resonance which is able to predict only one optimal level of noise.
We found that the complex interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of the
neuron threshold and the activity-dependent synaptic mechanisms is responsible
for this new phenomenology. Our results are confirmed by employing a more
realistic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model, which displays threshold variability,
as well as by considering more realistic synaptic models. We support our
findings with recent experimental data of stochastic resonance in the human
tactile blink reflex.
