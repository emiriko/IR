The most sensitive method to measure the CKM angle gamma is to exploit
interference in B(+/-)->DK(+/-) decays, with the D-meson decaying to a hadronic
final state. The analysis of quantum-correlated decays of the psi(3770) at
CLEO-c provides invaluable information on the strong-phase difference between
the D0 and D0bar across the Dalitz plane. Results from analyses of the decays
D->K0PiPi and D->K0KK will be presented.
