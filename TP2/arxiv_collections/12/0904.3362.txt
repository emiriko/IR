Locally conformally Kahler (LCK) manifolds with potential are those which
admit a Kahler covering with a proper, automorphic Kaehler potential. Existence
of a potential can be characterized cohomologically as a vanishing of a certain
cohomology class, called the Bott-Chern class. Compact LCK manifolds with
potential are stable at small deformations and admit holomorphic embeddings
into Hopf manifolds. This class strictly includes the Vaisman manifolds. We
show that every compact LCK manifold with potential can be deformed into a
Vaisman manifold. Therefore, every such manifold is diffeomorphic to a smooth
elliptic fibration over a Kahler orbifold. We show that the pluricanonical
condition on LCK manifolds introduced by G. Kokarev is equivalent to vanishing
of the Bott-Chern class. This gives a simple proof of some of the results on
topology of pluricanonical LCK-manifolds, discovered by Kokarev and Kotschick.
