We consider a holographic model constructed through using the D4/D8-$\bar{\rm
D8}$ brane configuration with a background field. We study some properties of
the effective field theory in this intersecting brane construction, and
calculate the effects of this NS-NS background field on some underlying
dynamics. We also discuss some other general brane configurations.
