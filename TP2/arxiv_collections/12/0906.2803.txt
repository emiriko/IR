Gluon field configurations with nonzero topological charge induce P- and
CP-odd effects. Such configurations are likely to be produced during heavy ion
collisions. In this article, I will argue that in the intense (electromagnetic)
magnetic field produced in non-central heavy ion collisions, topological charge
creates an electromagnetic current in the direction of the magnetic field. This
is the Chiral Magnetic Effect. It leads to separation of positive from negative
charge along the direction of the magnetic field. I will point out that this
effect can be investigated experimentally with a charge correlation study and
will refer to interesting data from the STAR collaboration.
