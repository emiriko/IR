General relativity postulates the Minkowski space-time to be the standard
flat geometry against which we compare all curved space-times and the
gravitational ground state where particles, quantum fields and their vacuum
states are primarily conceived. On the other hand, experimental evidences show
that there exists a non-zero cosmological constant, which implies in a deSitter
space-time, not compatible with the assumed Minkowski structure. Such
inconsistency is shown to be a consequence of the lack of a application
independent curvature standard in Riemann's geometry, leading eventually to the
cosmological constant problem in general relativity.
  We show how the curvature standard in Riemann's geometry can be fixed by
Nash's theorem on locally embedded Riemannian geometries, which imply in the
existence of extra dimensions. The resulting gravitational theory is more
general than general relativity, similar to brane-world gravity, but where the
propagation of the gravitational field along the extra dimensions is a
mathematical necessity, rather than being a a postulate. After a brief
introduction to Nash's theorem, we show that the vacuum energy density must
remain confined to four-dimensional space-times, but the cosmological constant
resulting from the contracted Bianchi identity is a gravitational contribution
which propagates in the extra dimensions. Therefore, the comparison between the
vacuum energy and the cosmological constant in general relativity ceases to be.
Instead, the geometrical fix provided by Nash's theorem suggests that the
vacuum energy density contributes to the perturbations of the gravitational
field.
