We comment on the calculational mistake in the paper "Modeling galaxy halos
using dark matter with pressure" by Somnath Bharadwaj and Sayan Kar. The
authors made a mistake while calculating the metric, which led to an
overestimate of the deflection angle of light passing through the halos for
-1<w_r<-0.5 and an underestimate of the deflection angle for -0.5<w_r<0. In
addition, solution for w_r>0 should not exist. Although the Bharadwaj-Kar
solution should be corrected, it appears that the characteristics of the
deflection angle under the supposed non-conventional non-ideal fluid equation
of state for the dark matter halo remain sensitive to the impact parameter and
may be verifiable through observations.
