We present the first report of the synchronization regimes in both
unidirectionally and bidirectionally-coupled multiple time delay chaotic laser
diodes subject to incoherent optical feedbacks and incoherent optical
injection. We derive the existence conditions and numerically study the
stability for lag, complete, and anticipating synchronization regimes and
cascaded synchronization. We also study in detail the effect of parameter
mismatches and noise on the synchronization quality. It is emphasized that
sensitivity of the synchronization quality to parameter mismatches can lead to
a high level of security due to the difficulty to replicate the receiver laser.
We show that the injection current and feedback delay times are highly
important parameters from this point of view.
