One of the remaining issues concerning the spin-triplet superconductivity of
Sr2RuO4 is the strong limit of the in-plane upper critical field Hc2 at low
temperatures. In this study, we clarified the dependence of Hc2 on the angle
theta between the magnetic field and the ab plane at various temperatures, by
precisely and accurately controlling the magnetic field direction. We revealed
that, although the temperature dependence of Hc2 for |theta| > 5 is well
explained by the orbital pair-breaking effect, Hc2(T) for |theta| < 5 is
clearly limited at low temperatures. We also revealed that the Hc2 limit for
|theta| < 5 is present not only at low temperatures, but also at temperatures
close to Tc. These features may provide additional hints for clarifying the
origin of the Hc2 limit. Interestingly, if the anisotropic ratio in Sr2RuO4 is
assumed to depend on temperature, the observed angular dependence of Hc2 is
reproduced better at lower temperature with an effective-mass model for an
anisotropic three-dimensional superconductor. We discuss the observed behavior
of Hc2 based on existing theories.
