The aim of this study is to assess the performances of the global
optimisation (GO) method (Bone position estimation from skin marker
co-ordinates using GO with joint constraints. Journal of Biomechanics 32,
129-134) within the upper limb kinematics analysis. First the model of the
upper limb is presented. Then we apply GO method in order to reduce skin
movement artefacts that imply relative movement between markers and bones. The
performances of the method are then evaluated with the help of simulated
movements of the upper limb. Results show a significant reduction of the errors
and of the variability due to skin movement.
