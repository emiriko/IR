We suggest pump-probe spectroscopy to study pair correlations that determine
the many-body dynamics in weakly interacting, dilute ultracold gases. A
suitably chosen, short laser pulse depletes the pair density locally, creating
a 'hole' in the electronic ground state. The dynamics of this non-stationary
pair density is monitored by a time-delayed probe pulse. The resulting
transient signal allows to spectrally decompose the 'hole' and to map out the
pair correlation functions.
