The shear/laminar flow of liquids/gas/plasma/biological cells (BC), etc. is
equivalent to dislocation-like shear of solids. The turbulent flow is the next
stage of deformation/ multiplication of dislocation-like defects and their
ordering in sub-grains and grain-boundaries, then grains slip-rotation in the
direction approximately perpendicular to the shear flow. It is shown that phase
transitions are governed by unified deformation hardening/softening under
hydrostatic pressure, particle irradiation and impurity (isotope) chemical
pressure, hard confining conditions and cooling, etc. thus changing electric,
magnetic, ferroelectric, thermal, optical properties.1-2 Dislocation-like work
hardening, DWH, is determined by non-monotonous properties of dislocation
double edge-cross-jog slip, and ultrastrong DWH gives the lowest drag for any
dislocation-like plasticity at phase transitions. This provides the same
micromechanisms of the ultimate stage of conventional deformation
(superfluidity) of ordinary liquids, i.e., water, kerosene and glycerin, liquid
and solid He, quasi-particle condensates. The key role of DWH is confirmed for
superconductivity, integer and fractional quantum Hall effects and the
enhancement of ultimate strain and diffusion under deformation down to
nanostructures, etc. Phase transformations in biological cells (explosive
events of diversity and population of species and diseases - for example,
locust and plaque bacteria, evolution, aging and cancer,2 bursts in the
development of human intellectual possibilities (languages, culture, arts and
sciences, history, etc.) depend on the same deformation effects in biological
evolution.
