Using molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the structure of neutron
star crust made of rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis material. We find a
regular body centered cubic lattice, even with the large number of impurities
that are present. Low charge $Z$ impurities tend to occupy interstitial
positions, while high $Z$ impurities tend to occupy substitutional lattice
sites. We find strong attractive correlations between low $Z$ impurities that
could significantly increase the rate of pycnonuclear (density driven) nuclear
reactions. The thermal conductivity is significantly reduced by electron
impurity scattering. Our results will be used in future work to study the
effects of impurities on mechanical properties such as the shear modulus and
breaking strain.
