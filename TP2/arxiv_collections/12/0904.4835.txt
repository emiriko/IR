During the attempt to line up into a dense traffic people have necessarily to
share a limited space under turbulent conditions. From the statistical point
view it generally leads to a probability distribution of the distances between
the traffic objects (cars or pedestrians). But the problem is not restricted on
humans. It comes up again when we try to describe the statistics of distances
between perching birds or moving sheep herd. Our aim is to demonstrate that the
spacing distribution is generic and independent on the nature of the object
considered. We show that this fact is based on the unconscious perception of
space that people share with the animals. We give a simple mathematical model
of this phenomenon and prove its validity on the real data that include the
clearance distribution between: parked cars, perching birds, pedestrians, cars
moving in a dense traffic and the distances inside a sheep herd.
