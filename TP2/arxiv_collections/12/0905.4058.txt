AIMS. In this paper we present the chemical abundance analysis from high
resolution UVES spectra of seventeen bright giant stars of the Globular Cluster
M~22. RESULTS. We obtained an average iron abundance of [Fe/H]=-1.76\pm0.02
(internal errors only) and an \alpha enhancement of 0.36\pm0.04 (internal
errors only). Na and O, and Al and O follow the well known anti-correlation
found in many other GCs. We identified two groups of stars with significantly
different abundances of the s-process elements Y, Zr and Ba. The relative
numbers of the two group members are very similar to the ratio of the stars in
the two SGBs of M22 recently found by Piotto (2009). Y and Ba abundances do not
correlate with Na, O and Al. The s-element rich stars are also richer in iron
and have higher Ca abundances. The results from high resolution spectra have
been further confirmed by lower resolution GIRAFFE spectra of fourteen
additional M22 stars. GIRAFFE spectra show also that the Eu -- a pure r-process
element -- abundance is not related to the iron content. We discuss the
chemical abundance pattern of M22 stars in the context of the multiple stellar
populations in GC scenario.
