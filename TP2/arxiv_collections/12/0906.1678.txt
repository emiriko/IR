Modelling the process of recombination leads to a large coupled nonlinear
dynamical system. Here, we consider a particular case of recombination in {\em
discrete} time, allowing only for {\em single crossovers}. While the analogous
dynamics in {\em continuous} time admits a closed solution, this no longer
works for discrete time. A more general model (i.e. without the restriction to
single crossovers) has been studied before and was solved algorithmically by
means of Haldane linearisation. Using the special formalism introduced by Baake
and Baake (2003), we obtain further insight into the single-crossover dynamics
and the particular difficulties that arise in discrete time. We then transform
the equations to a solvable system in a two-step procedure: linearisation
followed by diagonalisation. Still, the coefficients of the second step must be
determined in a recursive manner, but once this is done for a given system,
they allow for an explicit solution valid for all times.
