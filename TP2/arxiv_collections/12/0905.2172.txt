We report on the propagation of spin waves in permalloy microstripes. By
means of scanning Kerr microscopy combined with continuous microwave
excitation, we detect the time evolution of spin-wave interference patterns in
an external magnetic field. Assuming transverse spin-wave quantization we can
directly measure the amplitude, phase velocity and damping for the
corresponding transversal wave mode numbers m. We find that the spin-wave
interference pattern is dominated by m=0 and m=2 with phase velocities v_0=71
km/s and v_2=47 km/s, respectively.
