We calculate the nucleon parameters in nuclear matter using the QCD sum rules
method. The radiative corrections to the leading operator product expansion
terms are included, with the corrections of the order \alpha_s beyond the
logarithmic approximation taken into account. The density dependence of the
influence of radiative corrections on the nucleon parameters is obtained. At
saturation density the radiative corrections increase the values of vector and
scalar self-energies by about 40 MeV, and 30 MeV correspondingly. The results
appear to be stable with respect to possible variations of the value of
\Lambda_{QCD}.
