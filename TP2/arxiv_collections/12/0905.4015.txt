We present a unified description of heat flow in two-terminal hybrid quantum
systems. Using simple models, we analytically study nonlinear aspects of heat
transfer between various reservoirs: metals, solids, and spin baths, mediated
by the excitation/relaxation of a central (subsystem) mode. We demonstrate rich
nonlinear current-temperature characteristics, originating from either the
molecular anharmonicity, or the reservoirs (complex) energy spectra. In
particular, we establish sufficient conditions for thermal rectification in
two-terminal junctions. We identify two classes of rectifiers. In type-A
rectifiers the density of states of the reservoirs are dissimilar. In type-B
rectifiers the baths are identical, but include particles whose statistics
differ from that of the subsystem, to which they asymmetrically couple.
Nonlinear heat flow, and specifically thermal rectification, are thus
ubiquitous effects that could be observed in a variety of systems, phononic,
electronic, and photonic.
