In this paper we present the full theoretical model of a modified
Ives-Stillwell experiment where counter propagating lasers are used to form a
narrow interference fringe when the lasers form a double resnonance. This
narrow resoannce can be as small as 1 Hz wide and therefore provides a
connection between the atomic resonance in its rest frame and the laser
frequency in the lab frame. The current paper builds on a simplified approach
suggested recently and presents a fully developed theory of the interaction
within the Lorentz vilating electrodynamics of the Standard Model Extension.
