We propose to apply to the detection of Gravitational Waves a new method
developed for the spectral analysis of noisy time-series of damped oscillators.
  From the Pad\'e Approximations of the time-series Z-transform, a Jacobi
Matrix (J-Matrix) is constructed. We show that the J-Matrix has bound states
with eigenvalues strictly inside the unit circle. Each bound state can be
identified with one precise damped oscillator. Beside these bound states, there
is an essential spectrum sitting on the unit circle which represents the noise.
In this picture, signal and noise are clearly separated and identified in the
complex plane. Furthermore, we show that the J-transform enjoys the exceptional
feature of lossless undersampling. We take advantage of the above properties of
the J-transform to develop a procedure for the search of Gravitational Wave
bursts in interferometric data series such as those of LIGO and VIRGO projects.
Successful application of our procedure to simulated data having a poor signal
to noise ratio, highlights the power of our method.
