Requirement volatility is an issue in software engineering in general, and in
Web-based clinical applications in particular, which often originates from an
incomplete knowledge of the domain of interest. With advances in the health
science, many features and functionalities need to be added to, or removed
from, existing software applications in the biomedical domain. At the same
time, the increasing complexity of biomedical systems makes them more difficult
to understand, and consequently it is more difficult to define their
requirements, which contributes considerably to their volatility. In this
paper, we present a novel agent-based approach for analyzing and managing
volatile and dynamic requirements in an ontology-driven laboratory information
management system (LIMS) designed for Web-based case reporting in medical
mycology. The proposed framework is empowered with ontologies and formalized
using category theory to provide a deep and common understanding of the
functional and nonfunctional requirement hierarchies and their interrelations,
and to trace the effects of a change on the conceptual framework.
