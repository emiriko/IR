Light transmission through circular subwavelength apertures in metallic films
with surrounding nanostructures is investigated numerically. Numerical results
are obtained with a frequency-domain finite-element method. Convergence of the
obtained observables to very low levels of numerical error is demonstrated.
Very good agreement to experimental results from the literature is reached, and
the utility of the method is demonstrated in the investigation of the influence
of geometrical parameters on enhanced transmission through the apertures.
