A temporal analysis of the noise is performed, and non linearities are taken
into account. We then extend the correlation method to groups of several pixels
to derive the interpixel capacitance of a detector, found to be x = -0.0263 +/-
0.0020 (stat) +/- 0.0040 (syst). All measurements are consistent to a
sub-percent accuracy.
