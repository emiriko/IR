Transport properties of progressively reduced graphene oxide (GO) are
described. Evolution of the electronic properties reveals that as-synthesized
GO undergoes insulator-semiconductor-semi-metal transitions with reduction. The
apparent transport gap ranges from 10 ~ 50 meV and approaches zero with
extensive reduction. Measurements at varying degrees of reduction reveal that
transport in reduced GO occurs via variable-range hopping and further reduction
leads to increased number of available hopping sites.
