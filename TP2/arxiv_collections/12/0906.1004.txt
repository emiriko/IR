Consider the collection of all binary matrices having a specific sequence of
row and column sums and consider sampling binary matrices uniformly from this
collection. Practical algorithms for exact uniform sampling are not known, but
there are practical algorithms for approximate uniform sampling. Here it is
shown how dynamic programming and recent asymptotic enumeration results can be
used to simplify and improve a certain class of approximate uniform samplers.
The dynamic programming perspective suggests interesting generalizations.
