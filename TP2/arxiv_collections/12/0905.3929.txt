Supersymmetry implies that stable non-topological solitons, Q-balls, could
form in the early universe and could make up all or part of dark matter. We
show that the relic Q-balls passing through Earth can produce a detectable
neutrino flux. The peculiar zenith angle dependence and a small annual
modulation of this flux can be used as signatures of dark-matter Q-balls.
