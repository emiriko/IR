We review the properties of reduced density matrices for free fermionic or
bosonic many-particle systems in their ground state. Their basic feature is
that they have a thermal form and thus lead to a quasi-thermodynamic problem
with a certain free-particle Hamiltonian. We discuss the derivation of this
result, the character of the Hamiltonian and its eigenstates, the
single-particle spectra and the full spectra, the resulting entanglement and in
particular the entanglement entropy. This is done for various one- and
two-dimensional situations, including also the evolution after global or local
quenches.
