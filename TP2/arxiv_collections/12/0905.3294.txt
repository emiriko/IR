The problem of the equilibrium state of the charged many-particle system
above dielectric surface is formulated.We consider the case of the presence of
the external attractive pressing field and the case of its absence. The
equilibrium distributions of charges and the electric field, which is generated
by these charges in the system in the case of ideally plane dielectric surface,
are obtained. The solution of electrostatic equations of the system under
consideration in case of small spatial heterogeneities caused by the dielectric
surface, is also obtained. These spatial inhomogeneities can be caused both by
the inhomogeneities of the surface and by the inhomogeneous charge distribution
upon it. In particular, the case of the .wavy. spatially periodic surface is
considered taking into account the possible presence of the surface charges.
