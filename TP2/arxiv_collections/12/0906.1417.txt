We consider a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation governing the evolution of the
density of interacting and diffusive matter in the space of positions and
velocities. We use a probabilistic interpretation to obtain convergence towards
equilibrium in Wasserstein distance with an explicit exponential rate. We also
prove a propagation of chaos property for an associated particle system, and
give rates on the approximation of the solution by the particle system.
Finally, a transportation inequality for the distribution of the particle
system leads to quantitative deviation bounds on the approximation of the
equilibrium solution of the equation by an empirical mean of the particles at
given time.
