Electronic processes in a semiconductor system consisting of some Resonant
Tunnelling Structures, built in the depletion region of a Schottky barrier, are
investigated. It is shown that the Schottky barrier can block or unblock the
resonant tunnelling current effectively. Tunnelling processes do reveal the
coherent character. Sharp nonlinear current-voltage characteristics are
observed on both of the forward and the reverse branches.
