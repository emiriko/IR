Higgs boson searches are commonly considered one of the main objectives of
particle physics nowadays. The latest results obtained by the CDF and D0
collaborations are presented here when searching for Higgs boson decaying into
a W-boson pair, currently the most sensitive channel for masses greater than
130 GeV. The presented results are based on an integrated luminosity that
ranges from 3.0 to 4.2 fb^-1. No significant excess over expected background is
observed and the 95% CL limits are set for a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson
for different mass hypotheses ranging from 100 GeV to 200 GeV. The combination
of CDF and D0 results is also presented, which exclude for the first time a SM
Higgs boson in the 160 < mH < 170 GeV mass range.
