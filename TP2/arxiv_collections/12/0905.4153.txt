We present a phenomenological theory of quasiparticle scattering and
transport relaxation in the normal state of iron pnictides based on the
simplified two-band model coupled via spin fluctuations. In analogy with
anomalous properties of cuprates it is shown that a large and anomalous
normal-state resistivity and thermopower can be interpreted as the consequence
of strong coupling to spin fluctuations. The generalization to the
superconducting phase is also discussed.
