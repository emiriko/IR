We study different realisations of the first order deconfinement phase
transition inside a compact star by comparing the Gibbs and Maxwell
construction for the mixed phase. The hadronic sector is described within the
relativistic mean field model including hyperons. The quark sector is described
by the MIT Bag model. We find that these two realisations lead to very
different star properties, in particular, the composition of the stellar
matter. We also find that for the Maxwell construction there is a sharp
discontinuity in the baryon density and the electron chemical potential. We
argue that a sharp jump in the elctron chemical potential should lead to the
redistribution of electrons and formation of strong electric fields around the
discontinuity surface.
