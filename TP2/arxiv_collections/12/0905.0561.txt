We study the size of the largest clique $\omega(G(n,\alpha))$ in a random
graph $G(n,\alpha)$ on $n$ vertices which has power-law degree distribution
with exponent $\alpha$. We show that for `flat' degree sequences with
$\alpha>2$ whp the largest clique in $G(n,\alpha)$ is of a constant size, while
for the heavy tail distribution, when $0<\alpha<2$, $\omega(G(n,\alpha))$ grows
as a power of $n$. Moreover, we show that a natural simple algorithm whp finds
in $G(n,\alpha)$ a large clique of size $(1+o(1))\omega(G(n,\alpha))$ in
polynomial time.
