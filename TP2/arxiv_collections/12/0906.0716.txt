It is shown that a real novel shares many characteristic features with a null
model in which the words are randomly distributed throughout the text. Such a
common feature is a certain translational invariance of the text. Another is
that the functional form of the word-frequency distribution of a novel depends
on the length of the text in the same way as the null model. This means that an
approximate power-law tail ascribed to the data will have an exponent which
changes with the size of the text-section which is analyzed. A further
consequence is that a novel cannot be described by text-evolution models like
the Simon model. The size-transformation of a novel is found to be well
described by a specific Random Book Transformation. This size transformation in
addition enables a more precise determination of the functional form of the
word-frequency distribution. The implications of the results are discussed.
