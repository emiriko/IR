We present a microscopic picture of quantum transport in quantum antidots in
the quantum Hall regime taking electron interactions into account. We discuss
the edge state structure, energy level evolution, charge quantization and
linear-response conductance as the magnetic field or gate voltage is varied.
Particular attention is given to the conductance oscillations due to
Aharonov-Bohm interference and their unexpected periodicity. To explain the
latter we propose the mechanisms of scattering by point defects and Coulomb
blockade tunneling. They are supported by self-consistent calculations in the
Hartree approximation, which indicate pinning and correlation of the
single-particle states at the Fermi energy as well as charge oscillation when
antidot-bound states depopulate. We have also found interesting phenomena of
anti-resonance reflection of the Fano type.
