C++QED is a framework for simulating open quantum dynamics in general.
Historically, it has in the first place been developed for problems in
moving-particle cavity QED, but since then has been applied in other fields as
well. It is known to be able to simulate full Master equation up to several
thousand, and quantum trajectories up to several hundred thousand dimensions.
The basic idea of the framework is to allow users to build arbitrarily complex
interacting quantum systems from elementary free subsystems and interactions
between them, and simulate their time evolution with a number of available
time-evolution drivers. Apart from providing a number of elements out of the
box, there are several tools which facilitate the implementation of new
elements. These are being added continuously, on demand.
