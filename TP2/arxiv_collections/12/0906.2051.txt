We assume that the level spectra of quantum systems in the initial phase of
transition from integrability to chaos are approximated by superpositions of
independent sequences. Each individual sequence is modeled by a random matrix
ensemble. We obtain analytical expressions for the level spacing distribution
and level number variance for such a system. These expressions are successfully
applied to the analysis of the resonance spectrum in a nearly integrable
microwave billiard.
