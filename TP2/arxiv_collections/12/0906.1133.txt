The upgrade of the DA$\Phi$NE machine layout requires a modification of the
size and position of the inner focusing quadrupoles of KLOE-2 thus asking for
the realization of two new calorimeters covering the quadrupoles area. To
improve the reconstruction of $K_L\to 2\pi^0$ events with photons hitting the
quadrupoles a calorimeter with high efficiency to low energy photons (20-300
MeV), time resolution of less than 1 ns and space resolution of few cm, is
needed. To match these requirements, we are designing a tile calorimeter,
QCALT, where each single tile is readout by mean of SiPM for a total
granularity of 2400 channels. We show first tests of the different calorimeter
components.
