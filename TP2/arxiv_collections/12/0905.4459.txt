Progress in extracting the spectrum of excited hadron resonances in lattice
QCD Monte Carlo calculations is reviewed and the key issues and challenges in
such computations are outlined. The importance of multi-hadron states as
simulations with lighter pion masses are done is discussed, and the need for
all-to-all quark propagators is emphasized.
