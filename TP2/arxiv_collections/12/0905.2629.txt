Propagation of solitary waves in the presence of autocatalysis, diffusion,
and symmetry breaking (differential) advection, is being studied. The focus is
on drifting (propagating with advection) pulses that form via a convective
instability at lower reaction rates of the autocatalytic activator, i.e. the
advective flow overcomes the fast excitation and induces a drifting fluid type
behavior. Using spatial dynamics analysis of a minimal case model, we present
the properties and the organization of such pulses. The insights underly a
general understanding of localized transport in simple
reaction-diffusion-advection models and thus provide a background to potential
chemical and biological applications.
