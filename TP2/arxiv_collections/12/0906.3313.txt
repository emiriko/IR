Future wireless communication systems should be flexible to support different
waveforms (WFs) and be cognitive to sense the environment and tune themselves.
This has lead to tremendous interest in software defined radios (SDRs).
Constraints like throughput, latency and low energy demand high implementation
efficiency. The tradeoff of going for a highly efficient implementation is the
increase of porting effort to a new hardware (HW) platform. In this paper, we
propose a novel concept for WF development, the Nucleus concept, that exploits
the common structure in various wireless signal processing algorithms and
provides a way for efficient and portable implementation. Tool assisted WF
mapping and exploration is done efficiently by propagating the implementation
and interface properties of Nuclei. The Nucleus concept aims at providing
software flexibility with high level programmability, but at the same time
limiting HW flexibility to maximize area and energy efficiency.
