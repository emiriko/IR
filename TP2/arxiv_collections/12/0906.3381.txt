We studied the nonlinear time-resolved luminescence signals due to
multiexciton recombination processes in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
using femtosecond excitation correlation (FEC) spectroscopy. From theoretical
analysis of the FEC signals, we found that the FEC signals in the long time
range are dominated by the single exciton decay in SWNTs, where the
exciton-exciton annihilation process is efficient. Our results provide a simple
method to clarify the single exciton decay dynamics in low-dimensional
materials.
