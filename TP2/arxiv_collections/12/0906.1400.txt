We present Submillimeter Array observations of the 880 micron continuum
emission from three circumstellar disks around young stars in Orion that lie
several arcminutes (> 1-pc) north of the Trapezium cluster. Two of the three
disks are in the binary system 253-1536. Silhouette disks 216-0939 and
253-1536a are found to be more massive than any previously observed Orion
disks, with dust masses derived from their submillimeter emission of 0.045 Msun
and 0.066 Msun, respectively. The existence of these massive disks reveals the
disk mass distribution in Orion does extend to high masses, and that the
truncation observed in the central Trapezium cluster is a result of
photoevaporation due to the proximity of O-stars. 253-1536b has a disk mass of
0.018 Msun, making the 253-1536 system the first optical binary in which each
protoplanetary disk is massive enough to potentially form Solar systems.
