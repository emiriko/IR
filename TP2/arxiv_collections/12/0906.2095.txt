An effective field theory of BCS quark pairs is derived from an ordinary QCD
type path integral with SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields. We consider the BCS
quark pairs as constituents of nuclei and as the remaining degrees of freedom
in a coset decomposition SO(M,M)/U(M)xU(M) of a corresponding total
self-energy. The underlying dimension 'M=24' is determined by the product of
'2' isospin degrees of freedom, by the 4x4 Dirac gamma matrices with factor '4'
and the '3' colour degrees of freedom. Finally, we can compare the derived
actions of BCS quark pairs with the ordinary Skyrme Lagrangian and attain the
astonishing result that our derived effective actions of BCS quark pairs are
more closely related to the Skyrme-Faddeev field theory with the nontrivial
Hopf mapping.
