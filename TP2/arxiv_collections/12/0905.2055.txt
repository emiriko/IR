Adopting the strong field limit approach, we studied the properties of strong
field gravitational lensing in the deformed H\v{o}rava-Lifshitz black hole and
obtained the angular position and magnification of the relativistic images.
Supposing that the gravitational field of the supermassive central object of
the galaxy described by this metric, we estimated the numerical values of the
coefficients and observables for gravitational lensing in the strong field
limit. Comparing with the Reissner-Norstr\"{om} black hole, we find that with
the increase of parameter $\alpha$, the angular position $\theta_{\infty}$
decreases more slowly and $r_m$ more quickly, but angular separation $s$
increases more rapidly. This may offer a way to detect the effects of to
distinguish a deformed H\v{o}rava-Lifshitz black hole from a
Reissner-Norstr\"{om} black hole by the astronomical instruments in the future.
