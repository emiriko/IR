We present a search for standard model Higgs boson production in association
with a W boson in proton-antiproton collisions at a center of mass energy of
1.96 TeV. The search employs data collected with the CDF II detector that
correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1.9 inverse fb. We
select events consistent with a signature of a single charged lepton, missing
transverse energy, and two jets. Jets corresponding to bottom quarks are
identified with a secondary vertex tagging method, a jet probability tagging
method, and a neural network filter. We use kinematic information in an
artificial neural network to improve discrimination between signal and
background compared to previous analyses. The observed number of events and the
neural network output distributions are consistent with the standard model
background expectations, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the
production cross section times branching fraction ranging from 1.2 to 1.1 pb or
7.5 to 102 times the standard model expectation for Higgs boson masses from 110
to $150 GeV/c^2, respectively.
