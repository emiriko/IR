The accelerated expansion of the universe is ascribed to the existence of
dark energy. Black holes accretion of dark energy induces a mass change
proportional to the energy density and pressure of the background dark energy
fluid. The time scale during which the mass of black holes changes considerably
is too long relative to the age of the universe, thus beyond detection
possibilities. We propose to take advantage of the modified black hole masses
for exploring the equation of state $w[z]$ of dark energy, by investigating the
evolution of supermassive black hole binaries on a dark energy background.
Deriving the signatures of dark energy accretion on the evolution of binaries,
we find that dark energy imprints on the emitted gravitational radiation and on
the changes in the orbital radius of the binary can be within detection limits
for certain supermassive black hole binaries. In this talk I describe how
binaries can provide a useful tool in obtaining complementary information on
the nature of dark energy, based on the work done with A.Kelleher.
