Photonic circuits can be much faster than their electronic counterparts, but
they are difficult to miniaturize below the optical wavelength scale. Nanoscale
photonic circuits based on surface plasmon polaritons (SPs) are a promising
solution to this problem because they can localize light below the diffraction
limit. However, there is a general tradeoff between the localization of an SP
and the efficiency with which it can be detected with conventional far-field
optics. Here we describe a new all-electrical SP detection technique based on
the near-field coupling between guided plasmons and a nanowire field-effect
transistor. We use the technique to electrically detect the plasmon emission
from an individual colloidal quantum dot coupled to an SP waveguide. Our
detectors are both nanoscale and highly efficient (0.1 electrons/plasmon), and
a plasmonic gating effect can be used to amplify the signal even higher (up to
50 electrons/plasmon). These results enable new on-chip optical sensing
applications and are a key step towards "dark" optoplasmonic nanocircuits in
which SPs can be generated, manipulated, and detected without involving
far-field radiation.
