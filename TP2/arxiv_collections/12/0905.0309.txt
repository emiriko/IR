Self-assembled quantum dots have remarkable optical, electronic and
spintronic properties that make them leading candidates for quantum information
technologies. Their characterization requires rapid and local determination of
both charge and spin degrees of freedom. We present a way to probe the
capacitance of small ensembles of quantum dots at microwave frequencies. The
technique employs a capacitance sensor based on a microwave microstrip
resonator with sensitivity ~10^(-19) F/rt(Hz), high enough to probe single
electrons. The integration of this design in a scanning microscope will provide
an important tool for investigating single charge and spin dynamics in
self-assembled quantum dot systems.
