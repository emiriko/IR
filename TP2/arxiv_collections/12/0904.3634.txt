VISP (Virtual Internet Service Provider) is an IST-STREP project, which is
conducting research in the field of these new technologies, targeted to
telecom/ISP companies. One of the first tasks of the VISP project is to
identify the most appropriate technologies in order to construct the VISP
platform. This paper presents the most significant results in the field of
choreography and orchestration, two key domains that must accompany process
modeling in the construction of a workflow environment.
