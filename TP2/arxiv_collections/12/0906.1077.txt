Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy has been performed on silver nanoparticles
in a scanning electron microscopy setup. Peaks appearing in the visible range
for particles fabricated on silicon substrate are shown to arrive from
excitation of out of plane eigenmodes by the electron beam. Monochromatic
emission maps have been shown to resolve spatial field variation of resonant
plasmon mode on length scale smaller than 25nm. Finite-difference time-domain
numerical simulations are performed for both the cases of light excitation and
electron excitation. The results of radiative emission under electron
excitation show an excellent agreement with experiments. A complete vectorial
description of induced field is given, which complements the information
obtained from experiments.
