We map narrow-line regions (NLRs) of 11 nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies with the
optical integral-field spectrograph OASIS mounted at CFHT. We model
emission-line profiles of 5 forbidden-line doublets and 2 Balmer lines,
correcting for the underlying stellar absorption by reconstructing stellar
spectra with synthetic evolutionary stellar population models. For each of the
11 targets, we present 2D maps of surface brightness in the observed emission
lines, diagnostic line intensity ratios, gas kinematics (mean line-of-sight
velocity and velocity dispersion), electron density, and interstellar
reddening, and we plot spatially resolved spectral-diagnostic diagrams. The
stellar data are represented by maps of mean line-of-sight (LOS) velocities and
of the relative mass fractions of the young stellar populations. The gas
velocity fields in 80% of the sample exhibit twisted S-shaped isovelocity
contours, which are signatures of non-circular orbits and indicate
non-axisymmetric gravitational potentials, gas motions out of the galactic
plane, or possible outflows and inflows. Based on the kinematic measurements,
we identified a possible nuclear ring or radial gas flow in NGC 262 (Mrk 348),
not reported before. Eight of the eleven observed objects exhibit strongly
asymmetric or multi-component emission-line profiles, in most cases confined to
an elongated region passing through the galactic centre, perpendicular to the
major axis of emission.
