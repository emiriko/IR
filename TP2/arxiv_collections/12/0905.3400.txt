Aims. We search for transiting circumbinary (CB) planets around eclipsing
binaries (EBs).
  Methods. CB-BLS is a recently-introduced algorithm for the detection of
transiting CB planets around EBs.We describe progress in search sensitivity,
generality and capability of CB-BLS, and detection tests of CB-BLS on simulated
data. We also describe an analytical approach for the determination of CB-BLS
detection limits, and a method for the correct detrending of
intrinsically-variable stars.
  Results. We present some blind-tests with simulated planets injected to real
CoRoT data. The presented upgrades to CB-BLS allowed it to detect all the blind
tests successfully, and these detections were in line with the detection limits
analysis. We also correctly detrend bright eclipsing binaries from observations
by the TrES planet search, and present some of the first results of applying
CB-BLS to multiple real light curves from a wide-field survey.
  Conclusions. CB-BLS is now mature enough for its application to real data,
and the presented processing scheme will serve as the template for our future
applications of CB-BLS to data from wide-field surveys such as CoRoT. Being
able to put constraints even on non-detection will help to determine the
correct frequency of CB planets, contributing to the understanding of planet
formation in general. Still, searching for transiting CB planets is still a
learning experience, similarly to the state of transiting planets around single
stars only a few years ago. The recent rapid progress in this front, coupled
with the exquisite quality of space-based photometry, allows to realistically
expect that if transiting CB planets exist - then they will soon be found.
