We present a new optoelectronic architecture intended for chaotic optical
intensity generation. The principle relies on an electro-optic non-linear delay
dynamics, which non linearity is performed by a 4-waves integrated optics
interferometer involving 2 independent electro-optic modulation inputs. The
setup allows both to have an ultra-fast dynamics up to several GHz frequencies,
and potentially high dimensional chaos intended for encryption of optical data
at the physical layer. We have built a mathematical model of the system and
analyzed a number of its possible solutions: stable steady states, periodic and
chaotic regimes. The experimental observations allowed to validate the
dynamical model, through good qualitative agreements with the numerical
simulations.
