In this paper we analyse the vacuum polarization effects associated with
massive scalar quantum fields in a higher-dimensional de Sitter space in the
presence of a global monopole. Because this analysis has been developed in a
pure de Sitter space, here we are mainly interested on the effects induced by
the presence of the global monopole. So, in order to achieve this objective we
calculate the corresponding Wightman function, which is expressed in an
integral representation and explicitly depends on the parameters associated
with the presence of the monopole and the cosmological constant. Admitting that
the former is closed to the unity, which corresponds to a realistic value
predicted by Grand Unified Theories, it is possible to express this function as
the sum of two terms: the first one corresponds to the Wightman function on the
bulk where the global monopole is absent, and the second one is a contribution
induced by the presence of the monopole.
