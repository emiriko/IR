The modification on kaon and antikaon properties of in the interior of
(proto-)neutron stars is investigated using a chiral SU(3) model. The
parameters of the model are fitted to nuclear matter saturation properties,
baryon octet vacuum masses, hyperon optical potentials and low energy a
kaon-nucleon scattering lengths. We study the kaon/antikaon medium modification
and explore the possibility of antikaon condensation in (proto-)neutron star
matter at zero as well as finite temperature/entropy and neutrino content. The
effect of hyperons on kaon and antikaon optical potentials is also investigated
at different stages of the neutron star evolution.
