The asymmetrically mounted flat plasma actuator is studied using a
self-consistent 2-DIM fluid model at atmospheric pressure. The computational
model use the drift-diffusion approximation and a simple plasma
phenomenological kinetic model. It is investigated its electrical and kinetic
properties, and calculated the charged species concentrations, surface charge
density, electrohydrodynamic forces and gas speed. The present computational
model contributes to understand the main physical mechanisms and methods to
improve its performance.
