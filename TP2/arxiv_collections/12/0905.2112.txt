One unexpected recent result from heavy-ion collisions is the large
suppression and elliptic flow of electrons from heavy flavor decay. Further
measurements of properties of electrons from heavy flavor decay are crucial to
understanding the origin of this suppression and its implications for the
properties of the hot matter produced at RHIC. Two particle correlations have
been used extensively to study the propagation of hard partons through the
produced matter in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements in p+p collisions are
important both as reference for heavy ion measurements and to study heavy
flavor production and fragmentation in the vacuum. Preliminary results of
correlations between electrons from heavy flavor decay with charged hadrons
from p+p collisions are shown.
