We considerably extend our previous analysis of the implementation of an
absorptive boundary condition, which mimics saturation effects, on the linear
CCFM evolution. We present detailed results for the evolution of the
unintegrated gluon density in the presence of saturation and extract the energy
dependence of the emerging saturation momentum. We show that CCFM and BFKL
evolution lead to almost identical predictions after including the effects of
gluon saturation and of the running of the coupling. We moreover elucidate
several important and subtle aspects of the CCFM formalism, such as its
relation to BFKL, the structure of the angular ordered cascade, and the
derivation of more inclusive versions of CCFM. We also propose non--leading
modifications of the standard CCFM evolution which may play an important role
for phenomenological studies.
