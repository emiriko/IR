We define and explore the concept of ideal stabilization. The program is
ideally stabilizing if its every state is legitimate. Ideal stabilization
allows the specification designer to prescribe with arbitrary degree of
precision not only the fault-free program behavior but also its recovery
operation. Specifications may or may not mention all possible states. We
identify approaches to designing ideal stabilization to both kinds of
specifications. For the first kind, we state the necessary condition for an
ideally stabilizing solution. On the basis of this condition we prove that
there is no ideally stabilizing solution to the leader election problem. We
illustrate the utility of the concept by providing examples of well-known
programs and proving them ideally stabilizing. Specifically, we prove ideal
stabilization of the conflict manager, the alternator, the propagation of
information with feedback and the alternating bit protocol.
