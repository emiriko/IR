Generalised Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for QCD is considered at finite
temperatures in the framework of a real-time formalism. The proposed approach
allows one to study various properties of the model at T>0, such as chiral
symmetry breaking and restoration, properties of the bound-state spectrum, and
so on.
