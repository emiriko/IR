We present an interferometric scheme producing orbital entanglement in a
quantum Hall system upon electron-hole pair emission via tunneling. The
proposed setup is an electronic version of the optical interferometer proposed
by Cabello et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 040401 (2009)], and is feasible with
present technology. It requires single-channel propagation and a single primary
source. We discuss the creation of entanglement and its detection by the
violation of a Bell inequality.
