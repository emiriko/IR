Electron magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) turbulence in two dimensions is studied
via high-resolution numerical simulations with a normal diffusivity. The
resulting energy spectra asymptotically approach a $k^{-5/2}$ law with
increasing $R_B$, the ratio of the nonlinear to linear timescales in the
governing equation. No evidence is found of a dissipative cutoff, consistent
with non-local spectral energy transfer. Dissipative cutoffs found in previous
studies are explained as artificial effects of hyperdiffusivity. Relatively
stationary structures are found to develop in time, rather than the variability
found in ordinary or MHD turbulence. Further, EMHD turbulence displays
scale-dependent anisotropy with reduced energy transfer in the direction
parallel to the uniform background field, consistent with previous studies.
Finally, the governing equation is found to yield an inverse cascade, at least
partially transferring magnetic energy from small to large scales.
