This paper presents a methodology to stabilize some kind of Nonlinear Control
system known as Driftless, utilizing the concept of \textit{Pseudo-Kinetic
Energy} introduced in this work. Once this controller is applied to the
Unicycle-type robot, stability is guaranteed with the salient property that the
structure of the controller allows to solve in closed-form the trajectories of
the vehicle.
  While the proposed controller only ensures stability (not asymptotic
stability) the obtained closed-form solutions will show a path to obtain in
closed form the solutions for the general control problem of the unicycle.
  Some conclusions and future directions for research are also depicted.
