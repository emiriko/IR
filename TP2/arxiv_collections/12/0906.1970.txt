Mozambique has been proposed as a host for one of the future Square Kilometre
Array stations in Southern Africa. However, Mozambique does not possess a
university astronomy department and only recently has there been interest in
developing one. South Africa has been funding students at the MSc and PhD
level, as well as researchers. Additionally, Mozambicans with Physics degrees
have been funded at the MSc level. With the advent of the International Year of
Astronomy, there has been a very strong drive, from these students, to
establish a successful astronomy department in Mozambique. The launch of the
commemorations during the 2008 World Space Week was very successful and
Mozambique is to be used to motivate similar African countries who lack funds
but are still trying to take part in the International Year of Astronomy. There
hare been limited resources and funding, however there is a strong will to
carry this momentum into 2009 and, with this, influence the Government to
introduce Astronomy into its national curriculum and at University level.
Mozambique's motto for the International Year of Astronomy is "Descobre o teu
Universo".
