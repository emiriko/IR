We delineate, as an analog of two-flavor dense quark matter, the phase
structure of a many-body mixture of atomic bosons and fermions in two internal
states with a tunable boson-fermion attraction. The bosons b correspond to
diquarks, and the fermions f to unpaired quarks. For weak b-f attraction, the
system is a mixture of a Bose-Einstein condensate and degenerate fermions,
while for strong attraction composite b-f fermions N, analogs of the nucleon,
are formed, which are superfluid due to the N-N attraction in the spin-singlet
channel. We determine the symmetry breaking patterns at finite temperature as a
function of the b-f coupling strength, and relate the phase diagram to that of
dense QCD.
