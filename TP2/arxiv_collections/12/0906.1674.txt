Pulsating variable stars can be powerful tools to study the structure,
formation and evolution of galaxies. I discuss the role that the Magellanic
Clouds' pulsating variables play in our understanding of the whole Magellanic
System, in light of results on pulsating variables produced by extensive
observing campaigns like the MACHO and OGLE microlensing surveys. In this
context, I also briefly outline the promise of new surveys and astrometric
missions which will target the Clouds in the near future.
