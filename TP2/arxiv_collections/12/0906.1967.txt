We extend to curved backgrounds all flat-space scalar field models that obey
purely second-order equations, while maintaining their second-order dependence
on both field and metric. This extension simultaneously restores to second
order the, originally higher derivative, stress tensors as well. The process is
transparent and uniform for all dimensions.
