We present a study of the correlation between the direction of the symmetry
axis of the circumstellar material around intermediate mass young stellar
objects and that of the interstellar magnetic field. We use CCD polarimetric
data on 100 Herbig Ae/Be stars. A large number of them shows intrinsic
polarization, which indicates that their circumstellar envelopes are not
spherical. The interstellar magnetic field direction is estimated from the
polarization of field stars. There is an alignment between the position angle
of the Herbig Ae/Be star polarization and that of the field stars for the most
polarized objects. This may be an evidence that the ambient interstellar
magnetic field plays a role in shaping the circumstellar material around young
stars of intermediate mass and/or in defining their angular momentum axis.
