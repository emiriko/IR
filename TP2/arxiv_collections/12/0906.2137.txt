A nearly omni-directional THz absorber for both transverse electric (TE) and
transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations is proposed. Through the excitation of
magnetic polariton in a metal-dielectric layer, the incident light is perfectly
absorbed in a thin thickness which is about 25 times smaller than the resonance
wavelength. By simply stacking several such structural layers with different
geometrical dimensions, the bandwidth of this strong absorption can be
effectively enhanced due to the hybridization of magnetic polaritons in
different layers.
