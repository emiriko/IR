A new quark-field smearing algorithm is defined which enables efficient
calculations of a broad range of hadron correlation functions. The technique
applies a low-rank operator to define smooth fields that are to be used in
hadron creation operators. The resulting space of smooth fields is small enough
that all elements of the reduced quark propagator can be computed exactly at
reasonable computational cost. Correlations between arbitrary sources,
including multi hadron operators can be computed a posteriori without requiring
new lattice Dirac operator inversions. The method is tested on realistic
lattice sizes with light dynamical quarks.
