The dynamics of two spins coupled to bosonic baths at different temperatures
is studied. The analytical solution for the reduced density matrix of the
system in the Markovian and Post-Markovian case with exponential memory kernel
is found. The dynamics and temperature dependence of spin-spin entanglement is
analyzed.
