We present here the preliminary design of ARIES-Devasthal Faint Object
Spectrograph and Camera (ADFOSC), which is a multi-mode instrument for both
imaging and spectroscopy. ADFOSC is the first-generation instrument to be
mounted at the axial port of the Cassegrain focus on our new 3.6m optical
telescope to be installed at Devasthal, Nainital. The main design goals of the
instrument are : the instrument will have capability of broad- and narrow-band
imaging, low-medium resolution spectroscopy, and imaging polarimetry. The
operating wavelength range will be from 360 to 1000 nm and the instrument will
have remote-control capability.
