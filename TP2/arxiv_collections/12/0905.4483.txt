When a shell collapses through its horizon, semiclassical physics suggests
that information cannot escape from this horizon. One might hope that
nonperturbative quantum gravity effects will change this situation and avoid
the `information paradox'. We note that string theory has provided a set of
states over which the wavefunction of the shell can spread, and that the number
of these states is large enough that such a spreading would significantly
modify the classically expected evolution. In this article we perform a simple
estimate of the spreading time, showing that it is much shorter than the
Hawking evaporation time for the hole. Thus information can emerge from the
hole through the relaxation of the shell state into a linear combination of
fuzzballs.
