In extra-dimensional scenarios oscillations between active and sterile
neutrinos can be governed by a new resonance in the oscillation amplitude. This
resonance results when cancelation occurs between two phase differences, the
usual kinematic one coming from the neutrino mass-squared difference, and a
geometric one coming from the difference in travel times of the sterile
neutrino through the bulk relative to the active neutrino confined to the
brane. In this work we introduce a specific metric for the brane-bulk system,
from which we explicitly derive extra-dimensional geodesics for the sterile
neutrino, and ultimately the oscillation probability of the active-sterile
two-state system. We find that for an asymmetrically-warped metric, the
resonance condition involves both the neutrino energy E and the travel distance
L on the brane. In other words, the resonant energy may be viewed as
baseline-dependent. We show that to a good approximation, the resonance
condition is not on E or on L, but rather on the product LE. The model is rich
in implications, including the possibility of multiple solutions to the
resonance condition, with ramifications for existing data sets, e.g., LSND and
MiniBooNE. Some phenomenology with these brane-bulk resonances is discussed.
