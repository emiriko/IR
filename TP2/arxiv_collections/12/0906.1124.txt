The chapter begins with a description of the annulus model of rotationg
convection. The basic equations for the spherical problem are then introduced
and the onset of columnar convection in spherical shells is discussed. The
onset of inertial mode convection is described which prevails at very low
Prandtl numbers. The properties of finite amplitude convection are outlined for
a wide range of Prandtl numbers. Equatorially attached convection is considered
which evolves from inertial mode convection.
