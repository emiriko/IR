The description of the heavy baryons as heavy-meson--soliton bound systems is
reviewed. We outline how such bound systems arise from effective lagrangians
that respect both chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry. Effects due to
finite heavy quark masses are also discussed, and the resulting heavy baryon
spectra are compared with existing quark model and empirical results. Finally,
we address some issues related to a possible connection between the usual bound
state approach to strange hyperons and that for heavier baryons.
