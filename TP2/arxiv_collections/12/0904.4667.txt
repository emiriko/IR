We introduce a family of states, the fPEPS, which describes fermionic systems
on lattices in arbitrary spatial dimensions. It constitutes the natural
extension of another family of states, the PEPS, which efficiently approximate
ground and thermal states of spin systems with short-range interactions. We
give an explicit mapping between those families, which allows us to extend
previous simulation methods to fermionic systems. We also show that fPEPS
naturally arise as exact ground states of certain fermionic Hamiltonians. We
give an example of such a Hamiltonian, exhibiting criticality while obeying an
area law.
