We explore liquid crystal order in a cell with a "dirty" substrate imposing a
random surface pinning. Modeling such systems by a random-field xy-model with
surface heterogeneity, we find that orientational order in the
three-dimensional system is marginally unstable to such surface pinning. We
compute the Larkin length scale, and the corresponding surface and bulk
distortions. On longer scales we calculate correlation functions using the
functional renormalization group and matching methods, finding a universal
logarithmic and double-logarithmic roughness in two and three dimensions,
respectively. For a finite thickness cell, we explore the interplay of
homogeneous-heterogeneous substrate pair and detail crossovers as a function of
disorder strength and cell thickness.
