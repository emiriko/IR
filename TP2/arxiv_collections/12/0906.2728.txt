In this work, we study the possible unparticle signatures through tau pair
production e+e- -> tau+tau- process at the low energy particle factories. We
take into account lepton flavor conserving (s-channel) and violating
(t-channel) couplings for the unparticle leptonic interactions. For different
values of the scaling parameter d we extract upper limits on the scalar
unparticle couplings at the integrated luminosities of 100/fb.yr and 1
ab/fb.yr.
