The last 30 years have seen the creation of a variety of electronic
collaboration tools for science and business. Some of the best-known
collaboration tools support text editing (e.g., wikis). Wikipedia's success
shows that large-scale collaboration can produce highly valuable content.
Meanwhile much structured data is being collected and made publicly available.
We have never had access to more powerful databases and statistical packages.
Is large-scale collaborative data analysis now possible? Using a quantitative
analysis of Web 2.0 data visualization sites, we find evidence that at least
moderate open collaboration occurs. We then explore some of the limiting
factors of collaboration over data.
