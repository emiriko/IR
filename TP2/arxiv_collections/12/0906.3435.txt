The subject of satellite formation is strictly linked to the one of planetary
formation. Giant planets strongly shape the evolution of the circum-planetary
disks during their formation and thus, indirectly, influence the initial
conditions for the processes governing satellite formation. In order to fully
understand the present features of the satellite systems of the giant planets,
we need to take into account their formation environments and histories and the
role of the different physical parameters. In particular, the pressure and
temperature profiles in the circum-planetary nebulae shaped their chemical
gradients by allowing the condensation of ices and noble gases. These chemical
gradients, in turn, set the composition of the satellitesimals, which represent
the building blocks of the present regular satellites.
