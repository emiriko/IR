Multi-normal-mode splitting peaks are experimentally observed in a system
with Doppler-broadened two-level atoms inside a relatively long optical cavity.
In this system, the atoms-cavity interaction can reach the ``superstrong
coupling" condition with atoms-cavity coupling strength $g\sqrt{N}$ to be near
or larger than the cavity free-spectral range $\Delta_{FSR}$. In such case,
normal-mode splitting can occur in many cavity longitudinal modes to generate
the multi-normal-mode splitting peaks, which can be well explained by the
linear dispersion enhancement due to the largely increased atomic density in
the cavity. Many new interesting phenomena might come out of this superstrong
atoms-cavity coupling regime.
