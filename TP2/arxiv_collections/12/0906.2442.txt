In this paper we study the effect of single non-magnetic impurity in two-band
s-wave superconductors where the two s-wave order parameters have relative
phase $\delta\neq0$ between them. We show that in-gap bound states are always
induced by non-magnetic impurities when $\delta=\pi$ ($s_{\pm}$-wave
superconductors). The bound state is a consequence of the topological nature of
the corresponding Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation.
