Almost all the "Voyages Extraordinaires" written by Jules Verne refer to
astronomy. In some of them, astronomy is even the leading theme. However, Jules
Verne was basically not learned in science. His knowledge of astronomy came
from contemporaneous popular publications and discussions with specialists
among his friends or his family. In this article, I examine, from the text and
illustrations of his novels, how astronomy was perceived and conveyed by Jules
Verne, with errors and limitations on the one hand, with great respect and
enthusiasm on the other hand. This informs us on how astronomy was understood
by an "honn\^ete homme" in the late 19th century.
