We develop a framework based on microeconomic theory from which the ideal gas
like market models can be addressed. A kinetic exchange model based on that
framework is proposed and its distributional features have been studied by
considering its moments. Next, we derive the moments of the CC model (Eur.
Phys. J. B 17 (2000) 167) as well. Some precise solutions are obtained which
conform with the solutions obtained earlier. Finally, an output market is
introduced with global price determination in the model with some necessary
modifications.
