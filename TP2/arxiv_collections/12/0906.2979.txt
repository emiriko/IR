We propose a scheme for dispersive readout of stored energy in one mode of a
nonlinear superconducting microwave ring resonator by detection of the
frequency shift of a second mode coupled to the first via a Kerr nonlinearity.
Symmetry is used to enhance the device responsivity while minimizing self
nonlinearity of each mode. Assessment of the signal to noise ratio indicates
that the scheme will function at the single photon level, allowing quantum
non-demolition measurement of the photon number state of one mode. Experimental
data from a simplified version of the device demonstrating the principle of
operation are presented.
