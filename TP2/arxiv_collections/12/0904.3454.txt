The Jaynes-Cummings model provides a well established theoretical framework
for single electron two level systems in a radiation field. Similar exactly
solvable models for semiconductor light emitters such as quantum dots dominated
by many particle interactions are not known. We access these systems by a
generalized cluster expansion, the photon-probability-cluster-expansion: a
reliable approach for few photon dynamics in many body electron systems. As a
first application, we discuss vacuum Rabi flopping and show that their
amplitude determines the number of electrons in the quantum dot.
