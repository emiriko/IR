We study the one-dimensional Bose gas in spatially correlated disorder at
zero temperature, using an extended density-phase Bogoliubov method. We analyze
in particular the decay of the one-body density matrix and the behaviour of the
Bogoliubov excitations across the phase boundary. We observe that the
transition to the Bose glass phase is marked by a power-law divergence of the
density of states at low energy. A measure of the localization length displays
a power-law energy dependence in both regions, with the exponent equal to -1 at
the boundary. We draw the phase diagram of the superfluid-insulator transition
in the limit of small interaction strength.
