We consider Lorentzian correlation functions in theories with
non-relativistic Schrodinger symmetry. We employ the method developed by
Skenderis and van Rees in which the contour in complex time defining a given
correlation function is associated holographically with the gluing together of
Euclidean and Lorentzian patches of spacetimes. This formalism extends
appropriately to geometries with Schrodinger isometry.
