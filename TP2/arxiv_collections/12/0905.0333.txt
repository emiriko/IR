We analyze the recently released Fermi-LAT data on the sum of electrons and
positrons. Compared to a conventional, pre-Fermi, background model, a
surprising excess in the several hundred GeV range is found and here we analyze
it in terms of dark matter models. We also compare with newly published results
from PAMELA and HESS, and find models giving very good fits to these data sets
as well. If this dark matter interpretation is correct, we also predict the
possibility of a sharp break in the diffuse gamma ray spectrum coming from
final state radiation.
