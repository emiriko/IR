Quantum algorithms require less operations than classical algorithms. The
exact reason of this has not been pinpointed until now. Our explanation is that
quantum algorithms know in advance 50% of the solution of the problem they will
find in the future. In fact they can be represented as the sum of all the
possible histories of a respective "advanced information classical algorithm".
This algorithm, given the advanced information (50% of the bits encoding the
problem solution), performs the operations (oracle's queries) still required to
identify the solution. Each history corresponds to a possible way of getting
the advanced information and a possible result of computing the missing
information. This explanation of the quantum speed up has an immediate
practical consequence: the speed up comes from comparing two classical
algorithms, with and without advanced information, with no physics involved.
This simplification could open the way to a systematic exploration of the
possibilities of speed up.
