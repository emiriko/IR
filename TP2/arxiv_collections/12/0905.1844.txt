Our aim is to investigate and analyze the radio surface brightness to
diameter ($\Sigma-D$) relation for recently detected, bright radio-continuum
planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Magellanic Clouds (MC). We apply a Monte Carlo
analysis in order to account for sensitivity selection effects on measured
$\Sigma-D$ relation slopes for bright radio PNe in the MCs. In the $\Sigma-D$
plane these radio MCs PNe are positioned among the brightest of the nearby
Galactic PNe, and are close to the $D^{-2}$ sensitivity line of the MCs radio
maps. The fitted Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) data slope appears to be
influenced with survey sensitivity. This suggests the MCs radio PN sample
represents just the "tip of the iceberg" of the actual luminosity function.
Specifically, our results imply that sensitivity selection tends to flatten the
slope of the $\Sigma-D$ relation. Although MCs PNe appear to share the similar
evolution properties as Galactic PNe, small number of data points prevented us
to further constrain their evolution properties.
