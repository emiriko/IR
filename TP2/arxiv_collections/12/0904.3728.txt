We construct a discrete analogue of the integrable two-dimensional Dirac
operator and describe the spectral properties of its eigenfunctions. We
construct an integrable discrete analogue of the modified Novikov-Veselov
hierarchy. We derive the first two equations of the hierarchy and give explicit
formulas for the eigenfunctions in terms of the theta-functions of the
associated spectral curve.
