Light harvesting components of photosynthetic organisms are complex, coupled,
many-body quantum systems, in which electronic coherence has recently been
shown to survive for relatively long time scales despite the decohering effects
of their environments. Within this context, we analyze entanglement in
multi-chromophoric light harvesting complexes, and establish methods for
quantification of entanglement by presenting necessary and sufficient
conditions for entanglement and by deriving a measure of global entanglement.
These methods are then applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein to
extract the initial state and temperature dependencies of entanglement. We show
that while FMO in natural conditions largely contains bipartite entanglement
between dimerized chromophores, a small amount of long-range and multipartite
entanglement exists even at physiological temperatures. This constitutes the
first rigorous quantification of entanglement in a biological system. Finally,
we discuss the practical utilization of entanglement in densely packed
molecular aggregates such as light harvesting complexes.
