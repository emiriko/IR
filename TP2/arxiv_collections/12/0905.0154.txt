We present the first high angular resolution observation of the B[e]
star/X-ray transient object CI Cam, performed with the two-telescope Infrared
Optical Telescope Array (IOTA), its upgraded three-telescope version (IOTA3T)
and the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI). Visibilities and closure phases
were obtained using the IONIC-3 integrated optics beam combiner. CI Cam was
observed in the near-infrared H and K spectral bands, wavelengths well suited
to measure the size and study the geometry of the hot dust surrounding CI Cam.
The analysis of the visibility data over an 8 year period from soon after the
1998 outburst to 2006 shows that the dust visibility has not changed over the
years. The visibility data shows that CI Cam is elongated which confirms the
disc-shape of the circumstellar environment and totally rules out the
hypothesis of a spherical dust shell. Closure phase measurements show direct
evidence of asymmetries in the circumstellar environment of CI Cam and we
conclude that the dust surrounding CI Cam lies in an inhomogeneous disc seen at
an angle. The near-infrared dust emission appears as an elliptical skewed
Gaussian ring with a major axis a = 7.58 +/- 0.24 mas, an axis ratio r = 0.39
+/- 0.03 and a position angle theta = 35 +/- 2 deg.
