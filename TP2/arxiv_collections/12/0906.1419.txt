We investigate the influence of atomic motion on precision Rabi spectroscopy
of ultracold fermionic atoms confined in a deep, one dimensional (1D) optical
lattice. We analyze the spectral components of longitudinal sideband spectra
and present a model to extract information about the transverse motion and
sample temperature from their structure. Rabi spectroscopy of the clock
transition itself is also influenced by atomic motion in the weakly confined
transverse directions of the optical lattice. By deriving Rabi flopping and
Rabi lineshapes of the carrier transition, we obtain a model to quantify trap
state dependent excitation inhomogeneities. The inhomogeneously excited
ultracold fermions become distinguishable, which allows s-wave collisions. We
derive a detailed model of this process and explain observed density shift data
in terms of a dynamic mean field shift of the clock transition.
