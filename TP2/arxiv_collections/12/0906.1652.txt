Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics predict the
existence of charged Higgs bosons with substantial couplings to SM particles,
which would render them observable both directly at the LHC and indirectly at
B-factories. For example, the charged Higgs boson couplings to fermions in two
doublet Higgs models of type II, are proportional to the ratio of the two Higgs
doublet vacuum expectation values (tan(beta)) and fermionic mass factors and
could thus be substantial at large tan(beta) and/or for heavy fermions. In this
work we perform a model-independent study of the charged Higgs boson couplings
at the LHC and at B-factories for large values of tan(beta). We have shown that
at high luminosity it is possible to measure the couplings of a charged Higgs
boson to the third generation of quarks up to an accuracy of 10%. We further
argue that by combining the possible measurements of the LHC and the
B-factories, it is possible to perform a universality test of charged Higgs
boson couplings to quarks.
