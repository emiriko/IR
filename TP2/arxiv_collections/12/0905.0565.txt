We investigate the nature of the innermost regions of seven circumstellar
disks around pre-main-sequence stars. Our object sample contains disks
apparently at various stages of their evolution. Both single stars and
spatially resolved binaries are considered. In particular, we search for inner
disk gaps as proposed for several young stellar objects. When analyzing the
underlying dust population in the atmosphere of circumstellar disks, the shape
of the 10um feature is investigated. We performed interferometric observations
in N band 8-13um with MIDI using baseline lengths of between 54m and 127m. The
data analysis is based on radiative-transfer simulations using the Monte Carlo
code MC3D by modeling simultaneously the SED, N band spectra, and
interferometric visibilities. Correlated and uncorrelated N band spectra are
compared to investigate the radial distribution of the dust composition of the
disk atmosphere. Spatially resolved mid-infrared emission was detected in all
objects. For four objects, the observed N band visibilities and corresponding
SEDs could be simultaneously simulated using a parameterized active disk-model.
For the more evolved objects of our sample, a purely passive disk-model
provides the closest fit. The visibilities inferred for one source allow the
presence of an inner disk gap. For another object, one of two visibility
measurements could not be simulated by our modeling approach. All uncorrelated
spectra reveal the 10um silicate emission feature. In contrast to this, some
correlated spectra of the observations of the more evolved objects do not show
this feature, indicating a lack of small silicates in the inner versus the
outer regions of these disks. We conclude from this observational result that
more evolved dust grains can be found in the more central disk regions.
