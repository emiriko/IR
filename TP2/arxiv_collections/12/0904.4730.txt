We consider a trapped two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC),
where each atom with three energy-levels is coupled to an optical cavity field
and an external classical optical field as well as a microwave field to form
the so-called $\Delta$-type configuration. After adiabatically eliminating the
atomic excited state, an extended JC-Dicke model is derived under the
rotating-wave approximation. The scaled ground-state energy and the phase
diagram of this model Hamiltonian are investigated in the framework of
mean-field approach. A new phase transition is revealed when the amplitude of
microwave field changes its sign.
