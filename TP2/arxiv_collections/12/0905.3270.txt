Axion Like Particles (ALPs) are predicted to couple with photons in the
presence of magnetic fields. This effect may lead to a significant change in
the observed spectra of gamma-ray sources such as AGNs. Here we carry out a
detailed study that for the first time simultaneously considers in the same
framework both the photon/axion mixing that takes place in the gamma-ray source
and that one expected to occur in the intergalactic magnetic fields. An
efficient photon/axion mixing in the source always means an attenuation in the
photon flux, whereas the mixing in the intergalactic medium may result in a
decrement and/or enhancement of the photon flux, depending on the distance of
the source and the energy considered. Interestingly, we find that decreasing
the value of the intergalactic magnetic field strength, which decreases the
probability for photon/axion mixing, could result in an increase of the
expected photon flux at Earth if the source is far enough. We also find a 30%
attenuation in the intensity spectrum of distant sources, which occurs at an
energy that only depends on the properties of the ALPs and the intensity of the
intergalactic magnetic field, and thus independent of the AGN source being
observed. Moreover, we show that this mechanism can easily explain recent
puzzles in the spectra of distant gamma-ray sources... [ABRIDGED] The
consequences that come from this work are testable with the current generation
of gamma-ray instruments, namely Fermi (formerly known as GLAST) and imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes like CANGAROO, HESS, MAGIC and VERITAS.
