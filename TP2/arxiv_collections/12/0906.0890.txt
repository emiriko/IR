We study effective models of chiral fields and Polyakov loop expected to
describe the dynamics responsible for the phase structure of two-flavor QCD. We
consider chiral sector described either using linear sigma model or
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and study how these models, on the mean-field level
when coupled with the Polyakov loop, behave as a function of increasing bare
quark (or pion) mass. We find qualitatively similar behaviors for the cases of
linear sigma model and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and, relating to existing
lattice data, show that one cannot conclusively decide which or the two
approximate symmetries drives the phase transitions near the physical point.
