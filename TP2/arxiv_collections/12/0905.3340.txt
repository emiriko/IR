HgMn Chemically Peculiar stars are among the quietest stars of the
main-sequence. However, according to theoretical predictions, these stars could
have pulsations related to the very strong overabundances of iron peak
elements, which are produced by atomic diffusion in upper layers. Such
pulsations have never been detected from ground based observations.
  Our aim is to search for signatures of pulsations in HgMn stars using the
high quality lightcurves provided by the CoRoT satellite.
  We identified three faint stars (V>12), from VLT-GIRAFFE multiobject
spectrograph survey in a field which was planned for observation by CoRoT. They
present the typical characteristics of HgMn stars. They were observed by the
CoRoT satellite during the long run (131 days) which started from the 24th of
October 2007, with the exoplanets CCD's (Additional Programme). In the present
work, we present the analysis of the ground based spectra of these three stars
and the analysis of the corresponding CoRoT lightcurves.
  Two of these three HgMn candidates show low amplitude (less than 1.6 mmag)
periodic variations (4.3 and 2.53 days respectively, with harmonics) which are
compatible with periods predicted by theoretical models.
