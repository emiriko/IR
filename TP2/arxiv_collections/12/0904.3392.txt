A search for excited quarks is performed using the full ep data sample
collected by the H1 experiment at HERA, corresponding to a total integrated
luminosity of 475 pb^-1. The electroweak decays of excited quarks q* -> q
gamma, q* -> q Z and q* -> q W with subsequent hadronic or leptonic decays of
the W and Z bosons are considered. No evidence for first generation excited
quark production is found. Mass dependent exclusion limits on q* production
cross sections and on the ratio f/Lambda of the coupling to the compositeness
scale are derived within gauge mediated models. These limits extend the
excluded region compared to previous excited quark searches.
