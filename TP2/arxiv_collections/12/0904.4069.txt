Motivated by recent experiments, we develop a model for DNA toroids under
external tension. We find that tori are the equilibrium states for our model up
to a critical tension, above which they become only metstable. Above this
tension, we find a cascade of transitions between discrete toroid states that
successively lowers the winding number, until the ground state (rod) is
reached. In this process, this model predicts a nearly constant force plateau
as a function of extension, in agreement with experiment.
