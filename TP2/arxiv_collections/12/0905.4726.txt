Cool cores of galaxy clusters are thought to be heated by low-power active
galactic nuclei (AGN), whose accretion is regulated by feedback. However, the
interaction between the hot gas ejected by the AGN and the ambient intracluster
medium is extremely difficult to simulate as it involves a wide range of
spatial scales and gas that is Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) unstable. Here we present a
series of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a self-regulating AGN
in a galaxy cluster. Our adaptive-mesh simulations include prescriptions for
radiative cooling, AGN heating and a subgrid model for RT-driven turbulence,
which is crucial to simulate this evolution. AGN heating is taken to be
proportional to the rest-mass energy that is accreted onto the central region
of the cluster. For a wide range of feedback efficiencies, the cluster
regulates itself for at least several $10^9$ years. Heating balances cooling
through a string of outbursts with typical recurrence times of around 80 Myrs,
a timescale that depends only on global cluster properties. Under certain
conditions we find central dips in the metallicity of the intracluster medium.
Provided the sub-grid model used here captures all its key properties,
turbulence plays an essential role in the AGN self-regulation in cluster cores.
