X-ray observations reveiled a group of radio-silent isolated neutron stars
(INSs) at the centre of young supernova remnants (SNRs), dubbed central compact
objects or CCOs, with properties different from those of classical
rotation-powered pulsars. In at least three cases, evidence points towards CCOs
being low-magnetized INSs, born with slow rotation periods, and possibly
accreting from a debris disc of material formed out of the supernova event.
Understanding the origin of the diversity of the CCOs can shed light on
supernova explosion and neutron star formation models. Optical/infrared (IR)
observations are crucial to test different CCO interpretations. The aim of our
work is to perform a deep optical investigation of the CCO RX J0822.0-4300 in
the Puppis A SNR, one of the most poorly understood in the CCO family. By using
as a reference the Chandra X-ray coordinates of RX J0822.0-4300, we performed
deep optical observations in the B, V and I bands with the Very Large Telescope
(VLT). We found no candidate optical counterpart within 3 sigma of the computed
Chandra X-ray position down to 5 sigma limits of B~27.2, V~26.9, and I~25.6,
the deepest obtained in the optical band for this source. These limits confirm
the non-detection of a companion brighter than an M5 dwarf. At the same time,
they do not constrain optical emission from the neutron star surface, while
emission from the magnetosphere would require a spectral break in the
optical/IR.
