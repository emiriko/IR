Instrument simulators are becoming ever more useful for planning and
analysing large astronomy survey data. In this paper we present a simulator for
the Herschel-SPIRE photometer. We describe the models it uses and the form of
the input and output data. The SPIRE photometer simulator is a software package
which uses theoretical models, along with flight model test data, to perform
numerical simulations of the output time-lines from the instrument in operation
on board the Herschel space observatory. A description of the types of uses of
the simulator are given, along with information on its past uses. These include
example simulations performed in preparation for a high redshift galaxy survey,
and a debris disc survey. These are presented as a demonstration of the sort of
outputs the simulator is capable of producing.
