We report the first realization of columnar defects in Co-doped
BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ single crystals by heavy-iron irradiation. The columnar
defects are confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and their density is
about 40 % of the irradiation dose. Magneto-optical imaging and bulk
magnetization measurements reveal that the critical current density is strongly
enhanced in the irradiated region. We also find that vortex creep rates are
strongly suppressed by the columnar defects. We compare the effect of heavy-ion
irradiation into Co-doped BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and cuprate superconductors.
