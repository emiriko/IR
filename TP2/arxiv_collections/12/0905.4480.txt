Recently Horava proposed a renormalizable gravity theory in four dimensions
which reduces to Einstein gravity with a non-vanishing cosmological constant in
IR but with improved UV behaviors. Here, I study an IR modification which
breaks "softly" the detailed balance condition in Horava model and allows the
asymptotically flat limit as well. I obtain the black hole and cosmological
solutions for "arbitrary" cosmological constant that represent the analogs of
the standard Schwartzschild-(A)dS solutions which can be asymptotically (A)dS
as well as flat and I discuss some thermodynamical properties. I also obtain
solutions for FRW metric with an arbitrary cosmological constant. I study its
implication to the dark energy and find that it seems to be consistent with
current observational data.
