In this paper we present the equations of motion of a moving screw
dislocation in the framework of the translation gauge theory of dislocations.
In the gauge field theoretical formulation, a dislocation is a massive gauge
field. We calculate the gauge field theoretical solutions of a uniformly moving
screw dislocation. We give the subsonic and supersonic solutions. Thus,
supersonic dislocations are not forbidden from the field theoretical point of
view. We show that the elastic divergences at the dislocation core are removed.
We also discuss the Mach cones produced by supersonic screw dislocations.
