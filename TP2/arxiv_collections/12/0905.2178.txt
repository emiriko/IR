Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, we numerically simulate steady state
accretion discs for Cataclysmic Variable Dwarf Novae systems that have a
secondary-to-primary mass ratio (0.35 \le q \le 0.55). After these accretion
discs have come to quasi-equilibrium, we rotate each disc out of the orbital
plane by (\delta = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,) or (20)^{o}) to induce negative superhumps.
For accretion discs tilted $5^{o}$, we generate light curves and associated
Fourier transforms for an atlas on negative superhumps and retrograde
precession. Our simulation results suggest that accretion discs need to be
tilted more than three degrees for negative superhumps to be statistically
significant. We also show that if the disc is tilted enough such that the gas
stream strikes a disc face, then a dense cooling ring is generated near the
radius of impact.
  In addition to the atlas, we study these artificially tilted accretion discs
to find the source to negative superhumps. Our results suggest that the source
is additional light from innermost disc annuli, and this additional light waxes
and wanes with the amount of gas stream overflow received as the secondary
orbits. The nodes, where the gas stream transitions from flowing over to under
the disc rim (and vice versa), precess in the retrograde direction.
