An unconstrained minimal supersymmetric standard model with the superpartners
of the strongly interacting particles very heavy (close to the kinematic reach
of the LHC or even beyond it) and a relatively light electroweak sector is
considered. Using the event generator Pythia it is shown that the 1$\tau$-jet
(tagged) + 2$l$ and 2$\tau$-jets (tagged) + 1$l$ signals with a reasonably hard
$\etslash$ spectrum either by themselves or in combination with the
conventional $3l$ signal, which is known to be of rather modest size with a
soft $\etslash$ spectrum, may appreciably extend the reach of
chargino-neutralino search at the LHC with 10 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated
luminosity. This is especially so if the lighter chargino and the second
lightest neutralino decays via two body leptonic modes with large BRs. The
theoretical motivation of this scenario, yielding large values of the
fine-tuning parameters but consistent with various indirect constraints
including the dark matter relic density, is briefly discussed. It is shown that
in the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model with an universal scalar mass at the
GUT scale, the signals involving $\tau$-jets are not viable. Theoretically
well-motivated variations of these boundary conditions are, however, adequate
for reviving these signals.
