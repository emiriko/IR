In investigating the properties of a certain class of homogeneous
polynomials, we discovered an identity satisfied by their coefficients which
involves simple 2F1 Gauss hypergeometric functions. This result appears to be
new and we supply a direct proof. The simplicity of the identity is suggestive
of a deeper result.
