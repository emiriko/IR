We investigate a momentum-resolved Raman spectroscopy technique which is able
to probe the one-body spectral function and the quasi-particle states of a gas
of strongly interacting ultracold atoms. This technique is inspired by
Angle-Resolved Photo-Emission Spectroscopy, a powerful experimental probe of
electronic states in solid-state systems. Quantitative examples of
experimentally accessible spectra are given for the most significant regimes
along the BEC-BCS crossover. When the theory is specialized to RF spectroscopy,
agreement is found with recent experimental data. The main advantages of this
Raman spectroscopy over existing techniques are pointed out.
