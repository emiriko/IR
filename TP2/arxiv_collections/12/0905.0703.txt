We study the quantum kicked rotor in resonance subjected to an unitary noise
defined through Kraus operators, we show that this type of decoherence does
not, in general, lead to the classical diffusive behavior. We find exact
analytical expressions for the density matrix and the variance in the primary
resonances. The variance does not loose its ballistic behavior, however the
coherence decays as a power law. The secondary resonances are treated
numerically, obtaining a power-law decay for the variance and an exponential
law decay for the coherence.
