We present a new approach to Hamilton's theory of turns for the groups
  SO(3) and SU(2) which renders their properties, in particular their
composition law, nearly trivial and immediately evident upon inspection.
  We show that the entire construction can be based on binary rotations rather
than mirror reflections.
