The independent analysis of the published data on the intensities of the
primary gamma-quanta following resonance neutron capture in $^{236}U$ has been
performed. Distribution of these intensities about the mean value was
approximated in different energy intervals of the primary gamma-transitions and
neutrons. Extrapolation of the obtained functions to the zero registration
threshold of the primary gamma-transition intensity allowed us to estimate
(independently on the other experimental methods) expected level number of both
parities for spin values J=1/2, 3/2 and sum of radiative widths for both
electric and magnetic dipole gamma-transitions to levels with excitation energy
up to $\approx 2.3$ MeV.
