In the classical relativistic regime, the accretion of phantom energy onto a
black hole reduces the mass of the black hole. In this context, we have
investigated the evolution of a Schwarzschild black hole in the standard model
of cosmology using the phantom-like modified variable Chaplygin gas and the
viscous generalized Chaplygin gas. The corresponding expressions for accretion
time scale and evolution of mass have been derived. Our results indicate that
mass of the black hole will decrease if the accreting phantom Chaplygin gas
violates the dominant energy condition and will increase in the opposite case.
Thus our results are in agreement with the results of Babichev \textit{et al}
\cite{Babi1} who first proposed this scenario.
