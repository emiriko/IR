In recent years, the CKM picture of flavor and CP violation has been
confirmed, mainly due to B decay data. Yet, it is likely that there are small
corrections to this picture. We expect to find new physics not much above the
weak scale. This new physics could modify flavor changing processes compared to
their SM expectations. Much larger B decay data sets, which are expected from
LHCb and super-$B$-factories, will be used to search for these deviations with
much improved sensitivity. The combination of low and high energy data will be
particularly useful to probe the structure of new physics.
