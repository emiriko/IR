We present analyses of variability in the red giant stars in the metal-poor
globular cluster NGC6397, based on data obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope. We use an non-standard data reduction approach to turn a 23-day
observing run originally aimed at imaging the white dwarf population, into
time-series photometry of the cluster's highly saturated red giant stars. With
this technique we obtain noise levels in the final power spectra down to 50
parts per million, which allows us to search for low amplitude solar-like
oscillations. We compare the observed excess power seen in the power spectra
with estimates of the typical frequency range, frequency spacing and amplitude
from scaling the solar oscillations. We see evidence that the detected
variability is consistent with solar-like oscillations in at least one and
perhaps up to four stars. With metallicities two orders of magnitude lower than
of the Sun, these stars present so far the best evidence of solar-like
oscillations in such a low metallicity environment.
