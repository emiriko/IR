There has been much debate over the form of the quantum area spectrum for a
black hole horizon, with the evenly spaced conception of Bekenstein having
featured prominently in the discourse. In this letter, we refine a very
recently proposed method for calibrating the Bekenstein form of the spectrum.
Our refined treatment predicts, as did its predecessor, a uniform spacing
between adjacent spectral levels of $8\pi$ in Planck units; notably, an outcome
that already has a pedigree as a proposed ``universal'' value for this
intrinsically quantum-gravitational measure. Although the two approaches are
somewhat similar in logic and quite agreeable in outcome, we argue that our
version is conceptually more elegant and formally simpler than its precursor.
Moreover, our rendition is able to circumvent a couple of previously unnoticed
technical issues and, as an added bonus, translates to generic theories of
gravity in a very direct manner.
