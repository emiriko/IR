We calculate several neutron star properties, for static and/or rotating
stars, using equations of state based on different microscopic models. These
include our Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock model and others derived from the
non-relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach implemented with microscopic
three-body forces. The model dependence is discussed.
