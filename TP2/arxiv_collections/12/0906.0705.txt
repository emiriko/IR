Radio observations of very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources are
fundamental to identify and reveal their nature, as well as to understand the
physics behind these energetic sources. I will comment on some characteristics
of extragalactic sources detected at TeV energies and radio wavelengths, and
galactic sources such as gamma-ray binaries, supernova remnants (SNRs), or
pulsar wind nebulae (PWNs). Special emphasis will be put on unidentified
extended TeV sources, in which deep radio observations can severely constrain
the proposed models and shed light on the possible sources powering the TeV
emission.
