We briefly review how light meson resonances are described within one and
two-loop Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory amplitudes and how, close to
Nc=3, light vectors follow the Nc behavior of $q\bar q$ mesons whereas light
scalars do not. This supports the hypothesis that the lightest scalar is not
predominantly a $q\bar q$ meson, although a subdominant $q\bar q$ component is
suggested around 1 GeV at somewhat larger Nc. In contrast, when Nc is very far
from 3, like in the Nc --> infinity limit, we explain again in detail why
unitarization is not, a priori, reliable nor robust and why this limit should
not be used to drag any conclusions about the dominant nature of physical light
scalar mesons.
