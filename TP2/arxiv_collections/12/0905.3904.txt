In a recent article Tran et al. [Phys. Rev.B 78, 172505 (2008)] report on the
result of the muon-spin rotation (\muSR) measurements of Mo_3Sb_7
superconductor. Based on the analysis of the temperature and the magnetic field
dependence of the Gaussian relaxation rate \sigma_{sc} they suggest that
Mo_3Sb_7 is the superconductor with two isotropic s-wave like gaps. An
additional confirmation was obtained from the specific heat data published
earlier by partly the same group of authors in [Acta Mater. 56, 5694 (2008)].
The purpose of this Comment is to point out that from the analysis made by Tran
et al. the presence of two superconducting energy gaps in Mo_3Sb_7 can not be
justified. The analysis of \muSR data does not account for the reduction of
\sigma_{sc} with increasing temperature, and, hence, yields inaccurate
information on the magnetic penetration depth. The specific heat data can be
satisfactory described within the framework of the one-gap model with the small
residual specific heat component. The experimental data of Tran et al., as well
as our earlier published \muSR data [Phys. Rev. B 78, 014502 (2008)] all seem
to be consistent with is the presence of single isotropic superconducting
energy gap in Mo_3Sb_7.
