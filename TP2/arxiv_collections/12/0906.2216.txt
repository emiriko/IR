Large-scale practical applications of fullerene (C60) in nanodevices could be
significantly facilitated if the commercially-available micrometer-scale raw
C60 powder were further processed into a one-dimensional (1D) nanowire-related
polymer displaying covalent bonding as molecular interlinks and resembling
traditional important conjugated polymers. However, there has been little study
thus far in this area despite the abundant literature on fullerene. Here we
report the synthesis and characterization of such a C60-based nanowire polymer,
(-C60TMB-)n, where TMB=1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, which displays a well-defined
crystalline structure, exceptionally large length-to-width ratio and excellent
thermal stability. The material is prepared by first growing the corresponding
nanowire through a solution phase of C60 followed by a topochemical
polymerization reaction in the solid state. Gas chromatography, mass
spectrometry and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance evidence is provided for the
nature of the covalent bonding mode adopted by the polymeric chains.
Theoretical analysis based on detailed calculations of the reaction energetics
and structural analysis provides an in-depth understanding of the
polymerization pathway. The nanopolymer promises important applications in
biological fields and in the development of optical, electrical, and magnetic
nanodevices.
