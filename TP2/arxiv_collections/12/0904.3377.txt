We investigate the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) equations
for cold plasma around the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Applying 3+1
spacetime split we linearize the perturbed equations for
non-magnetized/magnetized plasma in both rotating and non-rotating background.
By Fourier analyze we then derive dispersion relations and investigate the
existence of waves with positive angular frequency in the vicinity of the black
hole horizon. The analysis finds propagation of negative phase and group
velocities for rotating magnetized surroundings.
