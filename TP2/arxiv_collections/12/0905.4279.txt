We report the first observation of single top quark production using ppbar
collision data with sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV collected by the CDF II and D0 detectors
at Fermilab. The significance of both the observed CDF and D0 data is 5.0
standard deviations, and the expected sensitivity is in excess of 5.9 and equal
to 4.5 standard deviations, respectively. The single top production cross
section and the CKM matrix element value |V_{tb}| have been measured.
