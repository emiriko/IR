The transverse momentum of electroweak bosons in a Drell-Yan process is an
important quantity for the experimental program at the LHC. The new model of
non-perturbative gluon emission in an initial state parton shower presented in
this note gives a good description of this quantity for the data taken in
previous experiments over a wide range of CM energy. The model's prediction for
the transverse momentum distribution of Z bosons for the LHC is presented and
used for a comparison with other approaches.
