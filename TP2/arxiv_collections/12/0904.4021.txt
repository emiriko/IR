The wave-particle duality of the vacuum states of quantum fields is
considered and the particle-like property of the vacuum state of a quantum
field is proposed as a vacuum-particle which carries the vacuum-energy and the
vacuum-momentum of this field. The vacuum-particles can be introduced into the
quantum field theory (QFT) naturally without disturbing its mathematical
structures and calculation results, but makes the QFT more self-consistent. For
instance, the interactions between charged particles and vacuum state of
electromagnetic field appears automatically in the Feynman diagrams of the
quantum electrodynamics (QED), with which the atomic spontaneous emission and
the Casimir effect of quantum optics can be interpreted directly by the QED
perturbation theory. Besides, the relation between vacuum-particles and
spontaneous symmetry breaking is also discussed.
