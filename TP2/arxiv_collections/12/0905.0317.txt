This paper presents the design and the realization of a 60 GHz wireless
Gigabit Ethernet communication system. A differential encoded binary phase
shift keying modulation (DBPSK) and differential demodulation schemes are
adopted for the IF blocks. The Gigabit Ethernet interface allows a high speed
transfer of multimedia files via a 60 GHz wireless link. First measurement
results are shown for 875 Mbps data rate.
