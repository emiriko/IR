A recent analysis of $B \to \pi K$ decays concludes that present data do not
clearly indicate whether (i) the standard model (or $\Delta I=0$ new physics)
is sufficient, or (ii) $\Delta I=1$ new physics is needed. We show that these
two possibilities can be distinguished by whether a sum rule relating the CP
asymmetries of the four $B \to \pi K$ decays is valid. If case (i) is favored,
the sum rule holds, and one predicts $A_{CP}(\pi^0 K^0) = -0.15$, while in case
(ii) fits to new physics involving large values of a color-suppressed tree
amplitude entail $A_{CP}(\pi^0 K^0) = -0.03$. The current experimental average
$A_{CP}(\pi^0 K^0) = -0.01 \pm 0.10$ must be measured a factor of at least
three times more precisely in order to distinguish between the two cases.
