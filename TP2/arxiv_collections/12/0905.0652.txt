A long-lived decaying dark matter as a resolution to Fermi, PAMELA and ATIC
anomalies is investigated in the framework of split supersymmetry (SUSY)
without R-parity, where the neutralino is regarded as the dark matter and the
extreme fine-tuned couplings for the long-lived neutralino are naturally evaded
in the usual approach.
