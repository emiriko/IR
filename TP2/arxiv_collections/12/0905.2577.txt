When the neutrino density is very high, as in core-collapse supernovae,
neutrino-neutrino interactions are not negligible and can appreciably affect
the evolution of flavour. The physics of these phenomena is briefly
highlighted, and their effects are shown on observable energy spectra from a
future galactic supernova within two-neutrino and three-neutrino frameworks.
Detection of such effects could provide a handle on two unknowns: the neutrino
mass hierarchy, and the mixing angle theta(13).
