We call "quiet laser" a stationary laser that generates in detectors regular
photo-electrons (sub-Poisson statistics). It follows from the law of
conservation of energy that this is so when the laser power supply does not
fluctuate. Various configurations are analyzed on the basis of the Planck
(1907) semi-classical concept: "I am not seeking the meaning of light quanta in
the vacuum but rather in places where emission and absorption occur, and I
assume that what happens in the vacuum is rigorously described by Maxwell's
equations". Exact agreement with Quantum Optics results is noted. Comments
welcome!
