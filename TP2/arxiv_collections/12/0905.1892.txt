Classical escape in 2D Hamiltonian systems with the mixed state has been
studied numerically and analytically. The wide class of potentials with the
mixed state is presented by polinomial potentials. In potentials, where the
mixed state could be realized, i.e. the phase space contains regions of both
regular and chaotic motion, escape problem has a number of new features. In
particular, some local minima become a trap with number of particles depending
on energy and other values that characterize the ensemble of particles.
Choosing the form of initial ensemble one chooses the set of parameters that
determine the number of trapped particles.
