We propose stable exotic nuclei bound with $\bar{D}$ and $B$ mesons with
respecting heavy quark symmetry. We indicate that an approximate degeneracy of
$\bar{D}$($B$) and $\bar{D}^{*}$($B^{*}$) mesons plays an important role, and
discuss the stability of $\bar{D}N$ and $BN$ bound states. We find the binding
energies 1.4 MeV and 9.4 MeV for each state in the $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ with I=0
channel. We discuss also possible existence of exotic nuclei $\bar{D}NN$ and
$BNN$.
