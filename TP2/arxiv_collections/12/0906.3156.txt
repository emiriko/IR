In this paper, we study the propagation of cosmic-ray nuclei and protons. We
emphasize the influence of the source composition on the expected spectrum and
composition on Earth as well as on the phenomenology of the transition from
Galactic to extragalactic cosmic-rays and the interpretation of the ankle. We
point out that the different source composition models cannot be distinguished
on the sole basis of the cosmic-ray spectrum but that the the energy evolution
of $<X_{\max}>$ should remove this degeneracy. Finally, we compare the
predictions for the different source composition models with the available data
and discuss the implications of our results.
