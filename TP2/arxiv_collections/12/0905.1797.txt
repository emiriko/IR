We have identified the existence of globally clustered chimera states in
delay coupled oscillator populations and find that these states can breathe
periodically, aperiodically and become unstable depending upon the value of
coupling delay. We also find that the coupling delay induces frequency
suppression in the desynchronized group. We provide numerical evidence and
theoretical explanations for the above results and discuss possible
applications of the observed phenomena.
