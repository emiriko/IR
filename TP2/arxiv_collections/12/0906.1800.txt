A two-nucleon potential and consistent electromagnetic currents are derived
in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) at, respectively, $Q^{2}$ (or
N$^2$LO) and $e Q$ (or N$^3$LO), where $Q$ generically denotes the low-momentum
scale and $e$ is the electric charge. Dimensional regularization is used to
renormalize the pion-loop corrections. A simple expression is derived for the
magnetic dipole ($M1$) operator associated with pion loops, consisting of two
terms, one of which is determined, uniquely, by the isospin-dependent part of
the two-pion-exchange potential. This decomposition is also carried out for the
$M1$ operator arising from contact currents, in which the unique term is
determined by the contact potential. Finally, the low-energy constants (LEC's)
entering the N$^2$LO potential are fixed by fits to the $np$ S- and P-wave
phase shifts up to 100 MeV lab energies.
