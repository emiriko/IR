This paper introduces the notion of fuzzy process as a formalism for the idea
of fuzzy contact between a device and its environment. The notions of absolute
correctness and relative correctness are defined. In order to work with
concurrency it has been built an approach to manipulate the interactive
processes as a single process and the resulted behavior has been observed.
