This short note shows that many of the results derived by Pravda et al
(Class. Quant. Grav. 24 4407-4428) for higher-dimensional Type D Einstein
spacetimes can be generalized to all Einstein spacetimes admitting a multiple
WAND; the main new result being the extension to include the Type II case.
Examples of Type D Einstein spacetimes admitting non-geodesic multiple WANDs
are given in all dimensions greater than 4.
