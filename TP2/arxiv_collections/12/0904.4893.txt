The reactions of fullerene C60 with atomic fluorine have been studied by
unrestricted broken spin-symmetry Hartree-Fock (UBS HF) approach implemented in
semiempirical codes based on AM1 technique. The calculations were focused on a
sequential addition of fluorine atom to the fullerene cage following indication
of the cage atom highest chemical susceptibility that is calculated at each
step. The effectively-non-paired-electron concept of the fullerene atoms
chemical susceptibility lays the foundation of the suggested computational
synthesis. The obtained results are analyzed from energetic, symmetry, and the
composition abundance viewpoints. A good fitting of the data to experimental
findings proves a creative role of the suggested synthesis methodology.
