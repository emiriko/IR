According to general relativity a perturbed black hole will settle to a
stationary configuration by the emission of gravitational radiation. Such a
perturbation will occur, for example, in the coalescence of a black hole
binary, following their inspiral and subsequent merger. At late times the
waveform is a superposition of quasi-normal modes, which we refer to as the
ringdown. The dominant mode is expected to be the fundamental mode, l=m=2.
Since this is a well-known waveform, matched filtering can be implemented to
search for this signal using LIGO data. We present a search for gravitational
waves from black hole ringdowns in the fourth LIGO science run S4, during which
LIGO was sensitive to the dominant mode of perturbed black holes with masses in
the range of 10 Msun to 500 Msun, the regime of intermediate-mass black holes,
to distances up to 300 Mpc. We present a search for gravitational waves from
black hole ringdowns using data from S4. No gravitational wave candidates were
found; we place a 90%-confidence upper limit on the rate of ringdowns from
black holes with mass between 85 Msun and 390 Msun in the local universe,
assuming a uniform distribution of sources, of 3.2 x 10^{-5} yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} =
1.6 x 10^{-3}yr^{-1} L_{10}^{-1}, where L_{10} is 10^{10} times the solar
blue-light luminosity.
