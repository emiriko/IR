The magnetization relaxation of Mn12 single-molecule magnets (SMMs) does not
follow a simple Arrhenius law, even for data collected at low frequencies
(5-1500 Hz) due to contributions from relaxation pathways via excited states
with larger thermal barriers, but much faster attempt rates. A modified
Arrhenius equation is presented as a means to overcome this problem and obtain
a more reliable limiting value for the barrier to magnetization relaxation
associated with the ground S=10 state.
