A simple Kronig-Penney model for one-dimensional (1D) mesoscopic systems with
$\delta $ peak potentials is used to study numerically the influence of a
spatial disorder on the conductance fluctuations and distribution at different
regimes. We use the Levy laws to investigate the statistical properties of the
eigenstates. We found the possibility of an Anderson transition even in 1D
meaning that the disorder can also provide constructive quantum interferences.
We found at this transition that the conductance probability distribution has a
system-size independent shape with large fluctuations in good agreement with
previous works. In these 1D systems, the metallic phase is well characterized
by a Gaussian conductance distribution. Indeed, the results for the conductance
distribution are in good agreement with the previous works in 2D and 3D systems
for other models.
