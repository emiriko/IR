We study functions f(z) holomorphic in the upper half plane and having no
zeros when the imaginary part of z is between 0 and 1, and we obtain a lower
bound for the modulus of f(z) in this strip. In our analysis we deal with
scalar functions f(z) as well as with operator valued holomorphic functions
I+A(z) assuming that A(z) is a trace class operator in the upper half plane and
I+A(z) is invertible in the same strip and is unitary on the real line.
