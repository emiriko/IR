We observe the dynamics of pulse trapping in a microstructured fiber.
Few-cycle pulses create a system of two pulses: a Raman shifting soliton traps
a pulse in the normal dispersion regime. When the soliton approaches a
wavelength of zero group velocity dispersion the Raman shifting abruptly
terminates and the trapped pulse is released. In particular, the trap is less
than 4ps long and contains a 1ps pulse. After being released, this pulse
asymmetrically expands to more than 10ps. Additionally, there is no disturbance
of the trapping dynamics at high input pulse energies as the supercontinuum
develops further.
