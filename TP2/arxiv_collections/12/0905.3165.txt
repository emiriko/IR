Low-noise temperature measurements at frequencies in the milli-Hertz range
are needed in the LISA and LISA PathFinder (LPF). The required temperature
stability for LISA is around 10 uK/sqrt(Hz) at frequencies down to 0.1 mHz. In
this paper we focus on the identification and reduction of a source of excess
noise detected when measuring time-varying temperature signals. This is shown
to be due to non-idealities in the ADC transfer curve, and degrades the
measurement by about one order of magnitude in the measurement bandwidth when
the measured temperature exhibits drifts of uK/s. In a suitable measuring
system for the LISA mission, this noise needs to be reduced. Two different
methods based on the same technique have been implemented, both consisting in
the addition of dither signals out of band to mitigate the ADC non-ideality
errors. Excess noise of this nature has been satisfactorily reduced by using
these methods when measuring temperature ramps up to 10 uK/s .
