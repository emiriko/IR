We present conditions on families of diffeomorphisms that guarantee
statistical stability and SRB entropy continuity. They rely on the existence of
horseshoe-like sets with infinitely many branches and variable return times. As
an application we consider the family of Henon maps within the set of
Benedicks-Carleson parameters.
