By interpreting various experimental data for the new high temperature FeAs
type superconductors in terms of lattice mediated multi gap superconductivity,
it is shown that these systems strongly resemble MgB2, however, with the
distinction that local polaronic lattice effects exist. This fact establishes a
connection to cuprate high temperature superconductors where polaron formation
is essential for the pseudogap phase and the unconventional isotope effects
observed there. However, similar to MgB2 and in contrast to cuprates the two
superconducting gaps in the Fe-As based materials are isotropic s-wave gaps.
