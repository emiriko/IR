This article is a very basic introduction to supersymmetry. It introduces the
two kinds of superfields needed for supersymmetric extensions of the Standard
Model, the chiral superfield and the vector superfield, and discusses in detail
how to construct supersymmetric, gauge invariant Lagrangians. The main ideas on
how to break supersymmetry spontaneously are also covered. The article is meant
to provide a platform for further reading.
