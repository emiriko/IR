We discuss how the electrons in relativistic GRB shocks can reach
near-equipartition in energy with the protons. We emphasize the non-Fermi
origin of such acceleration. We argue that the dynamics of the electrons in the
foreshock region and at the shock front plays an important role. We also
demonstrate that PIC simulations can directly probe this physics in the regimes
relevant to GRBs.
