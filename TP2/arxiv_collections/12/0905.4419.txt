The asymptotic time derivative of the total dipole signal is proposed as an
useful observable to study Isospin equilibration phenomenon in
multi-fragmentation processes. The study proceeds through the investigation of
the $^{40}Cl+^{28}Si$ system at 40 MeV/nucleon by means of semiclassical
microscopic many-body calculations based on the CoMD-II model. In particular,
the study has been developed to describe charge/mass equilibration processes
involving the gas and liquid "phases" of the total system formed during the
early stage of a collision. Through the investigation of dynamical many-body
correlations, it is also shown how the proposed observable is rather sensitive
to different parameterizations of the isospin dependent interaction.
