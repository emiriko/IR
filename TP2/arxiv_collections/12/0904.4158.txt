We present AKARI/IRC and Spitzer/IRS observations of a selected sample of
galactic IRAS sources considered to be heavily obscured AGB/post-AGB stars
based on their characteristic IRAS colours. All of them are completely
invisible in the optical range but extremely bright in the infrared. Based on
AKARI and Spitzer spectroscopy and using DUSTY we are able to determine the
dominant chemistry of their circumstellar shells as well as the properties of
the dust grains contained in these shells. Most of the sources are found to be
C-rich (being the reddest C-rich stars observed so far). We find only molecular
absorptions (and no PAH features) such as acetylene (C2H2) at 13.7 micron,
indicative of an early post-AGB stage. We shortly discuss our findings in the
context of stellar evolution during the hidden "transition phase" from AGB
stars to Planetary Nebulae.
