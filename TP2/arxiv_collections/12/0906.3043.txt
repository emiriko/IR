Compact stars made of quark matter rather than confined hadronic matter, are
expected to form a color superconductor. This superconductor ought to be
threaded with rotational vortex lines, within which the star's interior
magnetic field is at least partially confined. The vortices (and thus magnetic
flux) would be expelled from the star during stellar spin-down, leading to
magnetic reconnection at the surface of the star and the prolific production of
thermal energy. In this paper, we show that this energy release can re-heat
quark stars to exceptionally high temperatures, such as observed for Soft Gamma
Repeaters (SGRs), Anomalous X-Ray pulsars (AXPs), and X-ray dim isolated
neutron stars (XDINs). Moreover, our numerical investigations of the
temperature evolution, spin-down rate, and magnetic field behavior of such
superconducting quark stars suggest that SGRs, AXPs, and XDINs may be linked
ancestrally. Finally, we discuss the possibility of a time delay before the
star enters the color superconducting phase, which can be used to estimate the
density at which quarks deconfine. From observations, we find this density to
be of the order of five times that of nuclear saturation.
