The supergiant fast X-ray transient source IGR J16479-4514 was observed in
outburst two times with Swift. Its quiescent state was investigated in-depth
only once in 2008 through a relatively long pointed observation with
XMM-Newton. The latter observation was taken about 1.7 days after the outburst
in 2008, and showed an X-ray eclipse-like event, likely caused by the
supergiant companion. At present, this is the only supergiant fast X-ray
transient that displayed an evidence for an X-ray eclipse. Here we carry out a
comparison between the most recent outburst of IGRJ16479-4514, caught by Swift
on 29 January 2009 and those detected previously from this source. The decay
from the outbursts in 2005, 2008 and 2009 presents many similarities, and
suggests a common mechanism that modulates the mass accretion rate onto the
neutron star in IGRJ16479-4514.
