In Run 8 at RHIC, STAR significantly enhanced its forward acceptance relative
to previous years with the commissioning of a new detector, the Forward Meson
Spectrometer (FMS). The large geometrical acceptance of the FMS allows us to
extend the forward reach of the data beyond inclusive pions accessed by modular
calorimeters. The spin-1 omega is accessible to the FMS through its decay to a
neutral pion and a photon. Such events can help disentangle the dynamical
origins of observed large analyzing powers in the forward region, and can
contribute to our knowledge of the nuclear medium by comparisons of p+p to
d+Au. Here we report on the status of this analysis.
