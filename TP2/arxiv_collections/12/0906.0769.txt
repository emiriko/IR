The discovery of transiting extrasolar planets has enabled us a number of
interesting stduies. Transit photometry reveals the radius and the orbital
inclination of transiting planets, and thereby we can learn the true mass and
the density of respective planets by the combined information of radial
velocity measurements. In addition, follow-up observations of transiting
planets such as secondary eclipse, transit timing variations, transmission
spectroscopy, and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect provide us information of
their dayside temperature, unseen bodies in systems, planetary atmospheres, and
obliquity of planetary orbits. Such observational information, which will
provide us a greater understanding of extrasolar planets, is available only for
transiting planets. Here I briefly summarize what we can learn from transiting
planets and introduce previous studies.
