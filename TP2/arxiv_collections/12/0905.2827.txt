We determined the crystal-field split Hund's rule ground state of the
non-centrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductor CePt3Si with polarization
dependent soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and polarized neutron
scattering. We are also able to give the sequence of the crystal-field states
from the temperature evolution of the linear dichroic signal in the XAS. The
quantitative analysis of the XAS temperature dependence together with the
neutron transition energies complete the identification of the crystal-field
level scheme.
