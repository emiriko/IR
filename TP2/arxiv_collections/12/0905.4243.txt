The static potentials for quark-antiquark-gluon and 3-gluon systems are
computed with lattice QCD methods. For the quark-antiquark-gluon hybrid meson
the static potential is obtained for different values of the angle between the
quark-gluon and antiquark-gluon segments. The simulations support the formation
of an adjoint string for small angles, while for large angles, the adjoint
string is replaced by two fundamental strings connecting the gluon and the
quarks. For the 3-gluon glueball, we discuss the corresponding Wilson loops and
show that the gluons are connected by fundamental strings when the gluons are
far apart.
