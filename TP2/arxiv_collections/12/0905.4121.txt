Fully relativistic coordinates have been proposed for (relativistically)
running a "GPS" system. These coordinates are the arrival times of the light
signals emitted by four "satellites" (clocks). Replacing the signals emitted by
four controlled clocks by the signals emitted by four pulsars defines a
coordinate system with lower accuracy, but valid across the whole Solar System.
We here precisely define this new coordinate system, by choosing four
particular pulsars and a particular event as the origin of the coordinates.
