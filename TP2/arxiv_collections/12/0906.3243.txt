We propose a new model for explaining the observations of more than mass
proportional heating of heavy ions in the polar solar corona. We point out that
a large number of small scale intermittent shock waves can be present in the
solar corona. The energization mechanism is, essentially, the ion reflection
off supercritical quasi-perpendicular collisionless shocks in the corona and
the subsequent acceleration by the motional electric field ${\bf E} = - (1/c)
{\bf V} \times {\bf B}$. The acceleration due to ${\bf E}$ is perpendicular to
the magnetic field, in agreement with observations, and is more than mass
proportional with respect to protons, because the heavy ion orbit is mostly
upstream of the quasi-perpendicular shock foot. The observed temperature ratios
between O$^{5+}$ ions and protons in the polar corona, and between $\alpha$
particles and protons in the solar wind are easily recovered.
