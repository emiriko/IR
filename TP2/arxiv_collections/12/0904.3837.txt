Quark meson coupling (QMC) models can be successfully applied to the
description of compact star properties in nuclear astrophysics as well as to
nuclear matter. In the regime of hot hadronic matter very few calculations
exist using the QMC model, in particular when applied to particle yields in
heavy ion collisions. In the present work, we identify the free energy of the
bag with the effective mass of the baryons and we calculate the particle
production yields on a Au+Au collision at RHIC with the QMC model and compare
them with results obtained previously with other relativistic models. A smaller
temperature for the fireball, T=132 MeV, is obtained due to the smaller
effective baryon masses predicted by QMC. QMC was also applied to the
description of particle yields at SPS in Pb+Pb collisions.
