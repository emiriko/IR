We investigate the transport of a single excitation through a chain of weakly
coupled subunits. At both ends the chain is exposed to baths which are
incorporated by means of a master equation in Lindblad form. This master
equation is solved by the use of stochastic unraveling in order to obtain
excitation profile and current in the steady state. Completely diffusive
transport is found for a range of model parameters, whereas signatures of
ballistic behavior are observed outside this range. In the diffusive regime the
conductivity is rather independent from the strength of the bath coupling and
quantitatively agrees with the diffusion coefficient which has been derived
from an investigation of the same model without baths. Also the ballistic
behavior in the non-diffusive regime is in accord with results from this
alternative approach.
