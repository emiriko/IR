Gas and dust disks are common objects in the universe and can be found around
various objects, e.g. young stars, cataclysmic variables, active galactic
nuclei, or white dwarfs. The light that we receive from disks provides us with
clues about their composition, temperature, and density. In order to better
understand the physical and chemical dynamics of these disks, self-consistent
radiative transfer simulations are inevitable. Therefore, we have developed a
1+1D radiative transfer code as an extension to the well-established model
atmosphere code \verb!PHOENIX!. We will show the potential of the application
of our code to model the spectra of white dwarf debris disks.
