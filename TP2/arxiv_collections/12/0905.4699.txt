We use spin torque ferromagnetic resonance to measure the spectral properties
of dipole-exchange spin waves in permalloy nanowires. Our measurements reveal
that geometric confinement has a profound effect on the damping of spin waves
in the nanowire geometry. The damping parameter of the lowest-energy quantized
spin wave mode depends on applied magnetic field in a resonant way and exhibits
a maximum at a field that increases with decreasing nanowire width. This
enhancement of damping originates from a nonlinear resonant three-magnon
confluence process allowed at a particular bias field value determined by
quantization of the spin wave spectrum in the nanowire geometry.
