When a strong magnetic field is applied perpendicularly (along z) to a sheet
confining electrons to two dimensions (x-y), highly correlated states emerge as
a result of the interplay between electron-electron interactions, confinement
and disorder. These so-called fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids form a
series of states which ultimately give way to a periodic electron solid that
crystallizes at high magnetic fields. This quantum phase of electrons has been
identified previously as a disorder-pinned two-dimensional Wigner crystal with
broken translational symmetry in the x-y plane. Here, we report our discovery
of a new insulating quantum phase of electrons when a very high magnetic field,
up to 45T, is applied in a geometry parallel (y-direction) to the
two-dimensional electron sheet. Our data point towards this new quantum phase
being an electron solid in a "quasi-3D" configuration induced by orbital
coupling with the parallel field.
