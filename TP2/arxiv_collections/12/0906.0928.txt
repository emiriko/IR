Jefferson Lab experiment E01-012 measured the He-3 spin-structure functions
and virtual photon asymmetries in the resonance region in the momentum transfer
range 1.0<Q**2<4.0(GeV/c)**2. Our data, when compared with existing deep
inelastic scattering data, were used to test quark-hadron duality in g_1 and
A_1 for He-3 and the neutron. In addition, preliminary results on the He-3
spin-structure function g_2, on the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule and on higher
twist effects through the x**2-weighted moment d_2 of the neutron were
presented.
