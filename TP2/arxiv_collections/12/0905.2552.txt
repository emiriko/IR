Applying a novel non-perturbative functional method framework to a
two-dimensional bosonic sigma model with tachyon, dilaton and graviton
backgrounds we construct exact (non perturbative in the Regge slope)
inflationary solutions, consistent with world-sheet Weyl Invariance. The
mechanism for inflation entails a (partial) "alignment" between tachyon and
dilaton backgrounds in the solution space. Some cosmological solutions which
contain inflationary eras for a short period and interpolate between flat
universes in the far past and far future are also discussed. These solutions
are characterized by the absence of cosmological horizons, and therefore have
well-defined scattering amplitudes. This makes them compatible with a
perturbative string framework, and therefore it is these solutions that we
consider as self-consistent in our approach. Within the context of the
interpolating solutions, string production at the end of inflation (preheating)
may also be studied. The advantage of our method is that the solutions are
valid directly in four target-space-time dimensions, as a result of the non
trivial dilaton configurations.
