We propose a scheme to dynamically create a supersolid state in an optical
lattice, using an attractive mixture of mass-imbalanced bosons. Starting from a
"molecular" quantum crystal, supersolidity is induced dynamically as an
out-of-equilibrium state. When neighboring molecular wavefunctions overlap,
both bosonic species simultaneously exhibit quasi-condensation and long-range
solid order, which is stabilized by their mass imbalance. Supersolidity appears
in a perfect one-dimensional crystal, without the requirement of doping. Our
model can be realized in present experiments with bosonic mixtures that feature
simple on-site interactions, clearing the path to the observation of
supersolidity.
