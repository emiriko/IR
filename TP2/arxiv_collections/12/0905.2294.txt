On the basis of a model we capture the role of strong attractive interaction
in suppressing the rotational degrees of freedom of the system and volume
exclusion in keeping microscopic symmetry-breaking intact to result in
super-diffusive transport of small systems in a thermal atmosphere over a large
time scale. Our results, characterize such systems on the basis of having a
super-diffusive intermediate regime in between a very small and large time
scales of diffusive regimes. Although, the Brownian ratchet model fails to
account for the origin of motility in actin polymerization propelled
directional motion of bacterium like Listeria Monocytogene (LM) and similar
bio-mimetic systems due to the presence of strong attractive forces, our model
can account for the origin of directional transport in such systems on the
basis of the same interactions.
