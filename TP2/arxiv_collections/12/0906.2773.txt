We present two epochs of coordinated X-ray-optical timing observations of the
black hole candidate Swift J1753.5-0127 during its 2005 outburst. The first
epoch in July occurred at outburst peak. Two consecutive nights of observations
using the McDonald Observatory Argos camera with the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer show a consistent correlation with an immediate response and an
extended tail lasting ~5s. The properties of the variability and the
correlation are consistent with thermal reprocessing in an accretion disk. The
shortness of the lag suggests a short orbital period consistent with that
recently claimed. The second epoch in August used the VLT FORS2 HIT mode again
in conjunction with RXTE. Again a repeatable correlation is seen between two
independent subsets of the data. In this case, though, the cross-correlation
function has an unusual structure comprising a dip followed by a double-peak.
We suggest that this may be equivalent to the dip plus single peak structure
seen by Kanbach et al. (2001) in XTE J1118+480 and attributed there to
synchrotron emission; a similar structure was seen during later activity of
Swift J1753.5-0127 by Durant et al. (2008).
