The soft X-ray emission in obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) is dominated
by emission lines, produced in a gas photoionized by the nuclear continuum and
likely spatially coincident with the optical narrow line region (NLR). However,
a fraction of the observed soft X-ray flux appears like a featureless power law
continuum. If the continuum underlying the soft X-ray emission lines is due to
Thomson scattering of the nuclear radiation, it should be very highly
polarized. We calculated the expected amount of polarization assuming a simple
conical geometry for the NLR, combining these results with the observed
fraction of the reflected continuum in bright obscured AGN.
