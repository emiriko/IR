We present a global fit to the structure function F_2 measured in
lepton-proton experiments at small values of Bjorken-x, x< 0.01, for all
experimentally available values of Q^2, 0.045< Q^2 < 800 GeV^2, using the
Balitsky -Kovchegov equation including running coupling corrections. Using our
fits to F_2, we reproduce available data for F_L and perform predictions,
parameter-free and completely driven by small-x evolution, to the kinematic
range relevant for the LHeC.
