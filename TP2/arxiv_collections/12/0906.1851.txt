We give an account of the current state of the approch to quantum field
theory via Hopf algebras and Hochschild cohomology. We emphasize the
versatility and mathematical foundation of this algebraic structure, and
collect algebraic structures here in one place which are either scattered over
the literature, or only implicit in previous writings. In particular we point
out mathematical structures which can be helpful to farther develop our
mathematical understanding of quantum fields.
