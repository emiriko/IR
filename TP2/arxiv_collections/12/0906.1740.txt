Starting with the heavy fermion compound CeNi$_9$Ge$_4$, the substitution of
nickel by copper leads to a dominance of the RKKY interaction in competition
with the Kondo and crystal field interaction. Consequently, this results in an
antiferromagnetic phase transition in CeNi$_{9-x}$Cu$_x$Ge$_4$ for $x>0.4$,
which is, however, not fully completed up to a Cu-concentration of $x=1$. To
study the influence of single-ion effects on the AFM ordering by shielding the
$4f$-moments, we analyzed the spin diluted substitution series
La$_{0.5}$Ce$_{0.5}$Ni$_{9-x}$Cu$_x$Ge$_4$ by magnetic susceptibility $\chi$
and specific heat $C$ measurements. For small Cu-amounts $x\leq 0.4$ the data
reveal single-ion scaling with regard to the Ce-concentration, while for larger
Cu-concentrations the AFM transition (encountered in the
CeNi$_{9-x}$Cu$_x$Ge$_4$ series) is found to be completely depressed.
Calculation of the entropy reveal that the Kondo-effect still shields the
4$f$-moments of the Ce$^{3+}$-ions in CeNi$_8$CuGe$_4$.
