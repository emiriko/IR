A series of benchmark tests of slow light in saturable absorbers is proposed.
Stage I concerns experimental tests of saturable absorption, which can mimic
slow light in saturable media. Stage II outlines the more demanding
requirements for practical observation of spectral hole-burning in the
absorption line, which is responsible for the reduction in group velocity.
