The Sun encompasses planet Earth, supplies the heat that warms it, and even
shakes it. The United Nation Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
assumed that solar influence on our climate is limited to changes in solar
irradiance and adopted the consensus opinion of a Hydrogen-filled Sun, the
Standard Solar Model (SSM). They did not consider the alternative solar model
and instead adopted another consensus opinion: Anthropogenic greenhouse gases
play a dominant role in climate change. The SSM fails to explain the solar
wind, solar cycles, and the empirical link of solar surface activity with Earth
changing climate. The alternative solar model, that was molded from an
embarrassingly large number of unexpected observations revealed by space-age
measurements since 1959, explains not only these puzzles but also how closely
linked interactions between the Sun and its planets and other celestial bodies
induce turbulent cycles of secondary solar characteristics that significantly
affect Earth climate.
