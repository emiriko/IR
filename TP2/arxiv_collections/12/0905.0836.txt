Recently a new four-dimensional non relativistic renormalizable theory of
gravity was proposed by Horava. This gravity reduces to Einstein gravity at
large distances. In this paper by using the new action for gravity we present
different toroidal solutions to the equations of motion. Our solutions describe
the near horizon geometry with slow rotating parameter.
