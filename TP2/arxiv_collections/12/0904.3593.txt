Quasi-Riemannian theories of gravity have smaller gauge groups acting on the
tangent spacetime than the full Lorentz group. Among others, the spatial
rotation group can be gauged to obtain spacetime asymmetric gravity with
general covariance. We may introduce `spatial' higher-derivative interactions
exclusively to improve ultraviolet behavior with unitarity.
