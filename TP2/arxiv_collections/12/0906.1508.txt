Magnetic resonant X ray scattering experiments have been performed on a
single crystal of EuFe_2As_2 at the Eu L_3 absorption edge. This has permitted
us to determine for the first time the orientation of Eu magnetic moments in
the antiferromagnetic ordered phase below T_N=19 K as parallel to the a-axis.
In addition, non-resonant magnetic X ray measurements indicate that Fe magnetic
moments align along the same direction in the spin density wave phase
(T<T_S~190 K). Temperature dependences indicate that the onset of the Eu AFM
phase barely affects the Fe magnetic sublattice.
