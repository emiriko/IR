We report on a campaign of X-ray and soft gamma-ray observations of the black
hole candidate H 1743-322 (also named IGR J17464-3213), performed with the
RXTE, INTEGRAL and Swift satellites. The source was observed during a short
outburst between 2008 October 03 and 2008 November 16. The evolution of the
hardness-intensity diagram throughout the outburst is peculiar, in that it does
not follow the canonical pattern through all the spectral states (the so called
q-track pattern) seen during the outburst of black-hole transients.
  On the contrary, the source only makes a transition from the Hard State to
the Hard-Intermediate State. After this transition, the source decreases in
luminosity and its spectrum hardens again. This behaviour is confirmed both by
spectral and timing analysis. This kind of outburst has been rarely observed
before in a transient black hole candidate.
