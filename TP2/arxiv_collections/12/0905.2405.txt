In 1995, Chapman et al. (1995 Phys. Rev. Lett. 75 2783) showed experimentally
that the interference contrast in a three-grating atom interferometer does not
vanish under the presence of scattering events with photons, as required by the
complementarity principle. In this work we provide an analytical study of this
experiment, determining the evolution of the atom wave function along the
three-grating Mach-Zehnder interferometer under the assumption that the atom is
hit by a photon after passing through the first grating. The consideration of a
transverse wave function in momentum representation is essential in this study.
As is shown, the number of atoms transmitted through the third grating is given
by a simple periodic function of the lateral shift along this grating, both in
the absence and in the presence of photon scattering. Moreover, the relative
contrast (laser on/laser off) is shown to be a simple analytical function of
the ratio d_p/\lambda_i, where d_p is the distance between atomic paths at the
scattering locus and \lambda_i the scattered photon wavelength. We argue that
this dependence, being in agreement with experimental results, can be regarded
to show compatibility of the wave and corpuscle properties of atoms.
