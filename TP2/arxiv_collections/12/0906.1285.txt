A new method for the determination of electric signal time-shifts is
introduced. As the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, it is based on the comparison of
the cumulative distribution functions of the reference signal with the test
signal. This method is very fast and thus well suited for on-line applications.
It is robust to noise and its performances in terms of precision are excellent
for time-shifts ranging from a fraction to several sample durations.
