Sparse coding networks, which utilize unsupervised learning to maximize
coding efficiency, have successfully reproduced response properties found in
primary visual cortex \cite{AN:OlshausenField96}. However, conventional sparse
coding models require that the coding circuit can fully sample the sensory data
in a one-to-one fashion, a requirement not supported by experimental data from
the thalamo-cortical projection. To relieve these strict wiring requirements,
we propose a sparse coding network constructed by introducing synaptic learning
in the framework of compressed sensing. We demonstrate that the new model
evolves biologically realistic spatially smooth receptive fields despite the
fact that the feedforward connectivity subsamples the input and thus the
learning has to rely on an impoverished and distorted account of the original
visual data. Further, we demonstrate that the model could form a general scheme
of cortical communication: it can form meaningful representations in a
secondary sensory area, which receives input from the primary sensory area
through a "compressing" cortico-cortical projection. Finally, we prove that our
model belongs to a new class of sparse coding algorithms in which recurrent
connections are essential in forming the spatial receptive fields.
