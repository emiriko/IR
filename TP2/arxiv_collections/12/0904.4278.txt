We present new mid-infrared spectra for a sample of 15 targets (1 FU Orionis
object, 4 Herbig Ae stars, 5 T Tauri stars and 5 Vega type stars), obtained
with the TIMMI2 camera at La Silla Observatory (ESO). Three targets are members
of the beta Pic moving group (HD 155555, HD 181296 and HD 319139). PAH bands
are observed towards the T Tauri star HD 34700 and the Herbig Ae star PDS 144
N. For HD 34700, the band profiles indicate processed PAHs. The spectrum of the
Vega-type object eta Corvi (HD 109085), for which a resolved disk at sub-mm
wavelengths is known, is entirely stellar between 8--13 micron. Similarly, no
indication for circumstellar matter at mid-infrared wavelengths is found
towards the Vega-like stars HD 3003, HD 80951, HD 181296 and, surprisingly, the
T Tauri system HD 155555.
  The silicate emission features of the remaining eight sources are modelled
with a mixture of silicates of different grain sizes and composition.
Unprocessed dust dominates FU Ori, HD 143006 and CD-43 344. Large amorphous
grains are the main dust component around HD 190073, HD 319139, KK Oph and PDS
144 S. Both small grains and crystalline dust is found for the Vega-type HD
123356, with a dominance of small amorphous grains. We show that the infrared
emission of the binary HD 123356 is dominated by its late-type secondary, but
optical spectroscopy is still required to confirm the age of the system and the
spectral class of the companion. For most targets this is their first
mid-infrared spectroscopic observation. We investigate trends between stellar,
disk and silicate properties and confirm correlations of previous studies.
Several objects present an exciting potential for follow-up high-resolution
disk studies.
