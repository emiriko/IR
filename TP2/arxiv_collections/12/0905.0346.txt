Investigation of general-relativistic spherically symmetric steady accretion
of self-gravitating perfect fluid onto compact objects reveals the existence of
two weakly accreting regimes. In the first (corresponding to the test fluid
approximation) the mass of the central object is much larger than the mass of
the accreting fluid; in the second the mass of the fluid dominates. The
stability of the solutions belonging to the first regime has been proved by
Moncrief. In this work we report the results of a series of numerical studies
demonstrating stability of massive solutions, i.e., belonging to the second of
the aforementioned regimes. It is also shown that a formal analogy between
"sonic horizons" in the accretion picture and event horizons in general
relativity is rather limited. The notion of a "sonic horizon" is only valid in
a linear regime of small hydrodynamical perturbations. Strong perturbations can
still escape from beneath the "sonic horizon."
