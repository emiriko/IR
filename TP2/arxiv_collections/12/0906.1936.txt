Motivated by our recent work \cite{set1}, we generalize this work to the
interacting non-flat case. Therefore in this paper we deal with canonical,
phantom and quintom models, with the various fields being non-minimally coupled
to gravity, within the framework of interacting holographic dark energy. We
employ the holographic model of interacting dark energy to obtain the equation
of state for the holographic energy density in non-flat (closed) universe
enclosed by the event horizon measured from the sphere of horizon named $L$.
