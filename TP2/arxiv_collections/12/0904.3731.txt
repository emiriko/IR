We study the 5D Rarita-Schwinger fields to describe spin 3/2 baryons in
AdS/QCD. We calculate the spectrum of spin 3/2 baryons (Delta resonances) and
their form factors, together with meson-baryon couplings from AdS/QCD. The
transition form-factors between Delta and nucleon are evaluated. Both pion and
rho meson couplings have the same origin in the bulk and hence unified. The
numerical values for the meson-baryon transition couplings are consistent with
the values obtained from other methods. We also predict the numerical values of
some new couplings associated with Delta resonances.
