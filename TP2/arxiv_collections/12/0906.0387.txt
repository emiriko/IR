In this work we study the production and decay of two CP-even Higgs bosons in
the general CP-conserving two-Higgs doublet model at the LHC. We also study the
limiting case of the decoupling scenario. For each Yukawa version of the model,
we look for the region of the parameter space where a signal would be seen at
the LHC. Taking into account theoretical and experimental constraints on the
two Higgs doublet model parameters, we show that the cross section can be two
orders of magnitude above the corresponding Standard Model cross section. We
have also studied in detail the decay profile of the Higgs bosons and showed
that interesting signatures may emerge for some particular values of the
parameters. In some scenarios, specific triple Higgs could be measured.
