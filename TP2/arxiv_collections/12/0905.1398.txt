The time evolution of the out-of-equilibrium Mott insulator is investigated
numerically through calculations of space-time resolved density and entropy
profiles resulting from the release of a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms from
an optical trap. For adiabatic, moderate and sudden switching-off of the
trapping potential, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the Mott insulator is
found to differ profoundly from that of the band insulator and the metallic
phase, displaying a self-induced stability that is robust within a wide range
of densities, system sizes and interaction strengths. The connection between
the entanglement entropy and changes of phase, known for equilibrium
situations, is found to extend to the out-of-equilibrium regime. Finally, the
relation between the system's long time behavior and the thermalization limit
is analyzed.
