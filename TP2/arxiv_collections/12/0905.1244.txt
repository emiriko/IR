Classical and quantum perturbations can be described in terms of marginal
distribution functions in the framework of tomographic cosmology. In
particular, the so called Radon transformation and the mode-parametric quantum
oscillator description can give rise to links between quantum and classical
regimes. The approach results a natural scheme to discuss the transition from
the quantum to the classical perturbations and then it could be a workable
scheme to connect primordial fluctuations with the today observed large scale
structure.
