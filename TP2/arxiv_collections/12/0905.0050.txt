In the last fifteen years, a great progress has been made in the
understanding of the nonlinear resonance dynamics of water waves. Notions of
scale- and angle-resonances have been introduced, new type of energy cascade
due to nonlinear resonances in the gravity water waves have been discovered,
conception of a resonance cluster has been much and successful employed, a
novel model of laminated wave turbulence has been developed, etc. etc. Two
milestones in this area of research have to be mentioned: a) development of the
$q$-class method which is effective for computing integer points on the
resonance manifolds, and b) construction of the marked planar graphs, instead
of classical resonance curves, representing simultaneously all resonance
clusters in a finite spectral domain, together with their dynamical systems.
Among them, new integrable dynamical systems have been found that can be used
for explaining numerical and laboratory results. The aim of this paper is to
give a brief overview of our current knowledge about nonlinear resonances among
water waves, and formulate three most important open problems at the end.
