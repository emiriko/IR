We couple Chern-Simons gauge theory to 3-dimensional topological gravity with
the aim of investigating its quantum topological invariance. We derive the
relevant BRST rules and Batalin-Vilkovisky action. Standard BRST
transformations of the gauge field are modified by terms involving both its
anti-field and the super-ghost of topological gravity. Beyond the obvious
couplings to the metric and the gravitino, the BV action includes hitherto
neglected couplings to the super-ghost. We use this result to determine the
topological anomalies of certain higher ghost deformations of SU(N)
Chern-Simons theory, introduced years ago by Witten. In the context of
topological strings these anomalies, which generalize the familiar framing
anomaly, are expected to be cancelled by couplings of the closed string sector.
We show that such couplings are obtained by dressing the closed string field
with topological gravity observables.
