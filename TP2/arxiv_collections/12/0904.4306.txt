A new approach to analyzing visual images is proposed, based on the idea of
converting an optical image into a spatially varying pattern of polarized
squeezed light, which is then used to produce a pattern of chiral edge currents
in a thin film topological insulator. Thin films of Bi or Bi doped with Sb
which are punctured with an array of sub-micron holes may be a way of realizing
this kind of optical quantum information processing.
