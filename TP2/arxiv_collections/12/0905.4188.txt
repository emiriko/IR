In the context of spinfoam models for quantum gravity, we investigate the
asymptotical behavior of the 6j-symbol at next-to-leading order. We compute it
analytically and check our results against numerical calculations. The
6j-symbol is the building block of the Ponzano-Regge amplitudes for 3d quantum
gravity, and the present analysis is directly relevant to deriving the quantum
corrections to gravitational correlations in the spinfoam formalism.
