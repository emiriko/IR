Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) have unique properties that make them intriguing
targets for gravitational wave (GW) searches. They are nearby, their burst
emission mechanism may involve neutron star crust fractures and excitation of
quasi-normal modes, and they burst repeatedly and sometimes spectacularly. A
recent LIGO search for transient GW from these sources placed upper limits on a
set of almost 200 individual SGR bursts. These limits were within the
theoretically predicted range of some models. We present a new search strategy
which builds upon the method used there by "stacking" potential GW signals from
multiple SGR bursts. We assume that variation in the time difference between
burst electromagnetic emission and burst GW emission is small relative to the
GW signal duration, and we time-align GW excess power time-frequency tilings
containing individual burst triggers to their corresponding electromagnetic
emissions. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm that gains in GW energy
sensitivity of N^{1/2} are possible, where N is the number of stacked SGR
bursts. Estimated sensitivities for a mock search for gravitational waves from
the 2006 March 29 storm from SGR 1900+14 are also presented, for two GW
emission models, "fluence-weighted" and "flat" (unweighted).
