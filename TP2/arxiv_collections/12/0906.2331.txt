New exactly solvable rationally-extended radial oscillator and Scarf I
potentials are generated by using a constructive supersymmetric quantum
mechanical method based on a reparametrization of the corresponding
conventional superpotential and on the addition of an extra rational
contribution expressed in terms of some polynomial $g$. The cases where $g$ is
linear or quadratic are considered. In the former, the extended potentials are
strictly isospectral to the conventional ones with reparametrized couplings and
are shape invariant. In the latter, there appears a variety of extended
potentials, some with the same characteristics as the previous ones and others
with an extra bound state below the conventional potential spectrum.
Furthermore, the wavefunctions of the extended potentials are constructed. In
the linear case, they contain $(\nu+1)$th-degree polynomials with
$\nu=0,1,2,...$, which are shown to be $X_1$-Laguerre or $X_1$-Jacobi
exceptional orthogonal polynomials. In the quadratic case, several extensions
of these polynomials appear. Among them, two different kinds of
$(\nu+2)$th-degree Laguerre-type polynomials and a single one of
$(\nu+2)$th-degree Jacobi-type polynomials with $\nu=0,1,2,...$ are identified.
They are candidates for the still unknown $X_2$-Laguerre and $X_2$-Jacobi
exceptional orthogonal polynomials, respectively.
