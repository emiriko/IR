In virtual worlds, objects fall straight down. By replacing a few lines of
code to include Newton's gravity, virtual world software can become an N-body
simulation code with visualization included where objects move under their
mutual gravitational attraction as stars in a cluster. We report on our recent
experience of adding a gravitational N-body simulator to the OpenSim virtual
world physics engine. OpenSim is an open-source, virtual world server that
provides a 3D immersive experience to users who connect using the popular
"Second Life" client software from Linden Labs. With the addition of the N-body
simulation engine, which we are calling NEO, short for N-Body Experiments in
OpenSim, multiple users can collaboratively create point-mass gravitating
objects in the virtual world and then observe the subsequent gravitational
evolution of their "stellar" system. We view this work as an experiment
examining the suitability of virtual worlds for scientific visualization, and
we report on future work to enhance and expand the prototype we have built. We
also discuss some standardization and technology issues raised by our unusual
use of virtual worlds.
