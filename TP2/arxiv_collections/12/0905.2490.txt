The use of adiabatic passage techniques to mediate particle transport through
real space, rather than phase space is becoming an interesting possibility. We
have investigated the properties of Coherent Tunneling Adiabatic Passage (CTAP)
with alternating tunneling matrix elements. This geometry, not previously
considered in the donor in silicon paradigm, provides an interesting route to
long-range quantum transport. We introduce simplified coupling protocols, and
transient eigenspectra as well as a realistic gate design for this transport
protocol. Using a pairwise treatment of the tunnel couplings for a 5 donor
device with 30nm donor spacings, 120nm total chain length, we estimate the time
scale required for adiabatic operation to be ~70ns, a time well within measured
electron spin and estimated charge relaxation and times for phosphorus donors
in silicon.
