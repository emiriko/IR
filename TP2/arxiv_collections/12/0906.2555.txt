A quantum protocol for sharing an arbitrary two-qubit state between N parties
is introduced. Any of the members, can retrieve the state, only with
collaboration of the other parties. We will show that in terms of resources,
i.e. the number of classical bits, the number of Bell pairs shared, and also
the type of measurements, our protocol is more efficient. For achieving this,
we introduce the basic technique of secure passing of an unknown two qubit
state among a sequence of parties, none of which can retrieve the state without
authorization of the sender and the other members of the group.
