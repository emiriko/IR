Axisymmetric resistive MHD simulations for radially self-similar initial
conditions are performed, using the NIRVANA code. The magnetic diffusivity
could occur in outflows above an accretion disk, being transferred from the
underlying disk into the disk corona by MHD turbulence (anomalous turbulent
diffusivity), or as a result of ambipolar diffusion in partially ionized flows.
We introduce, in addition to the classical magnetic Reynolds number Rm, which
measures the importance of resistive effects in the induction equation, a new
number Rb, which measures the importance of the resistive effects in the energy
equation. We find two distinct regimes of solutions in our simulations. One is
the low-resistivity regime, in which results do not differ much from ideal-MHD
solutions. In the high-resistivity regime, results seem to show some
periodicity in time-evolution, and depart significantly from the ideal-MHD
case. Whether this departure is caused by numerical or physical reasons is of
considerable interest for numerical simulations and theory of astrophysical
outflows and is currently investigated.
