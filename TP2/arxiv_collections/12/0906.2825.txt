We consider quantum walks on a finite graphs to which infinite tails are
attached. We explore how the propagating and bound states depend on the
structure of the finite graph. The S-matrix for such graphs is defined. Its
unitarity is proved as well as some other of its properties such as its
transformation under time reversal. A spectral decomposition of the identity
for the Hamiltonian of the graph is derived using its eigenvectors. We derive
formulas for the S-matrix of a graph under certain operation such as cutting a
tail, attaching a tail or connecting two tails to form an edge.
