We study the routing of quantum information in qubit chains. This task is
achieved by suitably chosen time-dependent local fields acting on the qubits.
Employing the physics of coherent destruction of tunneling, we demonstrate that
a driving-induced renormalization of the coupling between neighboring qubits
provides the key for controlling the transduction of quantum information
between permanently coupled qubits. We employ this idea for building a quantum
router. Moreover, we discuss the experimental implementation with Penning
traps, and study the robustness of our protocol under realistic experimental
conditions, such as fabrication uncertainties and decoherence.
