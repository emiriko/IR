Human interaction introduces two main constraints: Safety and Comfort.
Therefore service robot manipulator can't be controlled like industrial robotic
manipulator where personnel is isolated from the robot's work envelope. In this
paper, we present a soft motion trajectory planner to try to ensure that these
constraints are satisfied. This planner can be used on-line to establish visual
and force control loop suitable in presence of human. The cubic trajectories
build by this planner are good candidates as output of a manipulation task
planner. The obtained system is then homogeneous from task planning to robot
control. The soft motion trajectory planner limits jerk, acceleration and
velocity in cartesian space using quaternion. Experimental results carried out
on a Mitsubishi PA10-6CE arm are presented.
