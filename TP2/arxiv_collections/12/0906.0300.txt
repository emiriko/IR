A superconducting double spin valve device is proposed. Its operation takes
advantage of the interplay between the spin-filtering effect of ferromagnetic
insulators and superconductivity-induced out-of-equilibrium transport.
Depending on the degree of nonequilibrium, extraordinary large tunnel
magnetoresistance as large as 10^2...10^6% can be obtained for realistic
material parameters, and it can be tuned over several orders of magnitude under
proper voltage biasing and temperature. The relevance of this setup for
low-temperature applications is further discussed.
