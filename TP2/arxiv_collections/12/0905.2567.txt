We report transport experiments on graphene quantum dots. We focus on excited
state spectra in the near vicinity of the charge neutrality point and
signatures of the electron-hole crossover as a function of a perpendicular
magnetic field. Coulomb blockade resonances of a 50 nm wide and 80 nm long dot
are visible at all gate voltages across the transport gap ranging from hole to
electron transport. The magnetic field dependence of more than 40 states as a
function of the back gate voltage can be interpreted in terms of the unique
evolution of the diamagnetic spectrum of a graphene dot including the formation
of the E = 0 Landau level, situated in the center of the transport gap, and
marking the electron-hole crossover.
