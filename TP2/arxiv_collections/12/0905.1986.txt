In order to attract and retain excellent researchers and diverse individuals
in astrophysics, we recommend action be taken in several key areas impacting
young scientists: (1) Maintain balance between large collaborations and
individual projects through distribution of funding; encourage public releases
of observational and simulation data for use by a broader community. (2)
Improve the involvement of women, particularly at leading institutions. (3)
Address the critical shortage of child care options and design reasonable
profession-wide parental leave policies. (4) Streamline the job application and
hiring process. We summarize our reasons for bringing these areas to the
attention of the committee, and we suggest several practical steps that can be
taken to address them.
