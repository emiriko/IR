We study the effect of soft gluon resummation on the gaps-between-jets
cross-section at the LHC. We review the theoretical framework that enables one
to sum logarithms of the hard scale over the veto scale to all orders in
perturbation theory. We then present a study of the phenomenological impact of
Coulomb gluon contributions and super-leading logarithms on the gaps between
jets cross-section at the LHC.
