Among the various alkali oxides the sesquioxides Rb4O6 and Cs4O6 are of
special interest. Electronic structure calculations using the local
spin-density approximation predicted that Rb4O6 should be a half-metallic
ferromagnet, which was later contradicted when an experimental investigation of
the temperature dependent magnetization of Rb4O6 showed a low-temperature
magnetic transition and differences between zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and
field-cooled (FC) measurements. Such behavior is known from spin glasses and
frustrated systems. Rb4O6 and Cs4O6 comprise two different types of dioxygen
anions, the hyperoxide and the peroxide anions. The nonmagnetic peroxide anions
do not contain unpaired electrons while the hyperoxide anions contain unpaired
electrons in antibonding pi*-orbitals. High electron localization (narrow
bands) suggests that electronic correlations are of major importance in these
open shell p-electron systems. Correlations and charge ordering due to the
mixed valency render p-electron-based anionogenic magnetic order possible in
the sesquioxides. In this work we present an experimental comparison of Rb4O6
and the related Cs4O6. The crystal structures are verified using powder x-ray
diffraction. The mixed valency of both compounds is confirmed using Raman
spectroscopy, and time-dependent magnetization experiments indicate that both
compounds show magnetic frustration, a feature only previously known from d-
and f-electron systems.
