Equations describing the complete series of image charges for a system of
conducting spheres are presented. The method of image charges, originally
described by J. C. Maxwell in 1873, has been and continues to be a useful
method for solving many three dimensional electrostatic problems. Here we
demonstrate that as expected when the series is truncated to any finite order
N, the electric field resulting from the truncated series becomes qualitatively
more similar to the correct field as N increases. A method of charge
normalization is developed which provides significant improvement for truncated
low order solutions. The formulation of the normalization technique and its
solution via a matrix inversion has similarities to the method of moments,
which is a numerical solution of Poisson's equation, using an integral equation
for the unknown charge density with a known boundary potential. The last
section of this paper presents a gradient search method to optimize a set of L
point charges for M spheres. This method may use the image charge series to
initialize the gradient search. We demonstrate quantitatively how the metric
can be optimized by adjusting the locations and amounts of charge for the set
of points, and that an optimized set of charges generally performs better than
truncated normalized image charges, at the expense of gradient search iteration
time.
