Fullerene functionalized carbon nanotubes -- NanoBuds -- form a novel class
of hybrid carbon materials, which possesses many advantageous properties as
compared to the pristine components. Here, we report a theoretical study of the
electronic transport properties of these compounds. We use both ab initio
techniques and tight-binding calculations to illustrate these materials'
transmission properties, and give physical arguments to interpret the numerical
results. Specifically, above the Fermi energy we find a strong reduction of
electron transmission due to localized states in certain regions of the
structure while below the Fermi energy all considered structures exhibit a
high-transmission energy band with a geometry dependent width.
