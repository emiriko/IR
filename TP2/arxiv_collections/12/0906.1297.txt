We construct a family of bipartite states of arbitrary dimension whose
eigenvalues of the partially transposed matrix can be inferred directly from
the block structure of the global density matrix. We identify from this several
subfamilies in which the PPT criterion is both necessary and sufficient. A
sufficient criterion of separability is obtained, which is fundamental for the
discussion. We show how several examples of states known to be classifiable by
the PPT criterion indeed belong to this general set. Possible uses of these
states in numerical analysis of entanglement and in the search of PPT bound
entangled states are briefly discussed.
