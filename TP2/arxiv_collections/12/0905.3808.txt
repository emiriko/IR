Recent trends in Agent Computational Economics research, envelop a government
agent in the model of the economy, whose decisions are based on learning
algorithms. In this paper we try to evaluate the performance of simulated
annealing in this context, by considering a model proposed earlier in the
literature, which has modeled an artificial economy consisting of
geographically dispersed companies modeled as agents, that try to maximize
their profit, which is yielded by selling an homogeneous product in different
cities, with different travel costs. The authors have used an evolutionary
algorithm there, for modeling the agents' decision process. Our extension
introduces a government agent that tries to affect supply and demand by
different taxation coefficients in the different markets, in order to equate
the quantities sold in each city. We have studied the situation that occurs
when a simulated annealing algorithm and a simple search algorithm is used as
the government's learning algorithm, and we have evaluated the comparative
performance of the two.
