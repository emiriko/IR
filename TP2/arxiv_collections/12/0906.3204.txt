We consider variable selection in high-dimensional linear models where the
number of covariates greatly exceeds the sample size. We introduce the new
concept of partial faithfulness and use it to infer associations between the
covariates and the response. Under partial faithfulness, we develop a
simplified version of the PC algorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000), the PC-simple
algorithm, which is computationally feasible even with thousands of covariates
and provides consistent variable selection under conditions on the random
design matrix that are of a different nature than coherence conditions for
penalty-based approaches like the Lasso. Simulations and application to real
data show that our method is competitive compared to penalty-based approaches.
We provide an efficient implementation of the algorithm in the R-package pcalg.
