At low energy, electrons in doped graphene sheets behave like massless Dirac
fermions with a Fermi velocity which does not depend on carrier density. Here
we show that modulating a two-dimensional electron gas with a long-wavelength
periodic potential with honeycomb symmetry can lead to the creation of isolated
massless Dirac points with tunable Fermi velocity. We provide detailed
theoretical estimates to realize such artificial graphene-like system and
discuss an experimental realization in a modulation-doped GaAs quantum well.
Ultra high-mobility electrons with linearly-dispersing bands might open new
venues for the studies of Dirac-fermion physics in semiconductors.
