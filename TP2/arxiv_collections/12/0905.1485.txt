We present a theoretical interpretation of the recently revealed features of
temperature evolution in the ultracold plasma clouds released from a
magneto-optical trap, namely: (a) its independence at the sufficiently large
times on the initial plasma parameters and (b) the asymptotics close to t^{-1}
instead of t^{-2}, expected for a rarefied ideal gas. It is shown that both
these properties can be well explained by the model of virialization of the
charged particle velocities in the regime of strong electron-ion correlations,
while heating due to inelastic processes (e.g. three-body recombination) should
be of secondary importance. These conclusions are confirmed also by the results
of ab initio computer simulations.
