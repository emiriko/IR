Software obfuscation or obscuring a software is an approach to defeat the
practice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality
illegally in the development of another software. Java applications are more
amenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such
as decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied
form called byte codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java
class files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two
level obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it
more resilient to reverse engineering attacks . But source code obfuscation is
much more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope
of the different variables used in the program and only very little progress
has been made on this front. We in this paper are proposing a framework named
JConstHide for hiding constants, especially integers in the java source codes,
to defeat reverse engineering through decompilation. To the best of our
knowledge, no data hiding software are available for java source code constant
hiding.
