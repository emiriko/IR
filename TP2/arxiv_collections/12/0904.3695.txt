A model of self-interacting quantum non-local Dirac's electron has been
proposed. Its dynamics was revealed by the projective representation of
operators corresponding to spin/charge degrees of freedom. Energy-momentum
field is described by the system of quasi-linear "field-shell" PDE's following
from the conservation law expressed by the affine parallel transport of the
energy momentum vector field in CP(3). I discuss here travel-wave solutions of
these equations and the "off-shell" dispersion law asymptotically coinciding
with the "on-shell" de Broglie dispersion law.
