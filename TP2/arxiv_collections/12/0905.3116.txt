The emergent model in the context of loop quantum cosmology with a tachyon
scalar field is studied. We find that there is a center equilibrium point in
the semiclassical region and a saddle point in the classical region. If the
potential of the tachyon field satisfies some conditions, the universe can stay
at the center equilibrium point past-eternally and then oscillate infinitely
around this point with the tachyon climbing up its potential. Once the
potential reaches a critical value, these two equilibrium points coincide with
each other and the oscillation phase is broken by an emergent inflation. In
order to obtain a successful emergent tachyon inflation, a constraint on
$\dot{\phi}^2$ of tachyon is required.
