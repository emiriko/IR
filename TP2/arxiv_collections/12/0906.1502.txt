On the basis of a variant of the EPR-Bohm example, we show that the
no-signaling condition can be employed as a useful tool for deriving a
constraint on a suitably defined measure of the `nonidealness' of a
Stern-Gerlach(SG) setup. In this demonstration, a key ingredient is provided by
the characteristics of the exact solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation as applied to a most general SG setup.
