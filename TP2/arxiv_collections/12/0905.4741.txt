The Dirac equation provides a description of spin 1/2 particles, consistent
with both the principles of quantum mechanics and of special relativity. Often
its presentation to students is based on mathematical propositions that may
hide the physical meaning of its contents. Here we show that Dirac spinors
provide the quantum description of two unit classical vectors: one whose
components are the speed of an elementary particle and the rate of change of
its proper time and a second vector which fixes the velocity direction. In this
context both the spin degree of freedom and antiparticles can be understood
from the rotation symmetry of these unit vectors. Within this approach the
Dirac Lagrangian acquires a direct physical meaning as the quantum operator
describing the total time-derivative.
