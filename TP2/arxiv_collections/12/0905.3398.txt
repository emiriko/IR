The detection of the quantum dot charge state using a quantum point contact
charge detector has opened a new exciting route for the investigation of
quantum dot devices in recent years. In particular, time-resolved charge
detection allowed the precise measurement of quantum dot shot noise at
sub-femtoampere current levels, and the full counting statistics of the
current. The technique can be applied to different material systems and holds
promise for the future application in quantum dot based quantum information
processing implementations. We review recent experiments employing this charge
detection technique, including the self-interference of individual electrons
and back-action phenomena.
