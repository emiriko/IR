We compare the results of capacitance measurements in the lens-plane and
sphere-plane configurations with theoretical predictions from various models of
a spherical surface. It is shown that capacitance measurements are incapable of
discriminating between models of perfect and modified spherical surfaces in an
experiment demonstrating the anomalous scaling law for the electric force.
Claims to the contrary in the recent literature are explained by the use of
irregular comparison. The data from capacitance measurements in an experiment
measuring the Casimir force using a micromechanical torsional oscillator are
shown to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions using the model
of a perfect spherical surface.
