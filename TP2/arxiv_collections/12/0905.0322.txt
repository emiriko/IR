We have investigated the phase transition in the Heisenberg spin glass using
massive numerical simulations to study larger sizes, 48x48x48, than have been
attempted before at a spin glass phase transition. A finite-size scaling
analysis indicates that the data is compatible with the most economical
scenario: a common transition temperature for spins and chiralities.
