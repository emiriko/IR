The basic model of the non-equilibrium low dimensional physics the so-called
totally asymmetric exclusion process is related to the 'crystalline limit'
($q\to\infty$) of the $SU_q(2)$ quantum algebra. Using the quantum inverse
scattering method we obtain the exact expression for the time-dependent
stationary correlation function of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion
process on a one dimensional lattice with the periodic boundary conditions.
