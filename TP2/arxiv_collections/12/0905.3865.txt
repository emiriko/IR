We present a modified version of Buczolich and Mauldin's proof that the
sequence of square numbers is universally L^1-bad. We extend this result to a
large class of sequences, including the dth powers and the set of primes;
furthermore, we show that any subsequence of the averages taken along these
sequences is also universally L^1-bad.
