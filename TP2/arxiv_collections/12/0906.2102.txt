The paper deals with the extension of the Weak Isolated Horizon (WIH)
formulation to the non- minimally coupled Holst action. In the first part of
the paper, we introduce the non- minimal scalar coupling of the Holst action
and construct the covariant phase space of the theory. Using the covariant
phase space, we prove the laws of black hole mechanics and show that with a
gauge fixing, the symplectic structure on the horizon reduces to that of a U(1)
Chern-Simons theory. The level of the Chern- Simons theory is shown to depend
on the non-minimally coupled scalar field.
