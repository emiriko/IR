We investigate electron spin relaxation in $p$-type GaAs quantum wells from a
fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach, with all the relevant
scatterings, such as the electron-impurity, electron-phonon, electron-electron
Coulomb, electron-hole Coulomb and electron-hole exchange (the Bir-Aronov-Pikus
mechanism) scatterings explicitly included. From this approach, we examine the
relative importance of the D'yakonov-Perel' and Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanisms in
wide ranges of temperature, hole density, excitation density and impurity
density, and present a phase-diagram--like picture showing the parameter regime
where the D'yakonov-Perel' or Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is more important. By
including more hole subbands and bands in our model, we are able to study spin
dynamics at high hole density. It is shown that the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism
can surpass the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism in some temperature regime with
sufficiently high hole density for various impurity and excitation densities.
We also discover that in the impurity-free case the temperature regime where
the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is more efficient than the D'yakonov-Perel' one
is around the hole Fermi temperature for high hole density, regardless of
excitation density. However, in the high impurity density case with the
impurity density being identical to the hole density, this regime is roughly
from the electron Fermi temperature to the hole Fermi temperature.
Particularly, the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism can dominate the spin relaxation
in the {\em whole} temperature regime of the investigation (from 5 K to 300 K)
in the case with high impurity and very low excitation densities, since the
electron (hole) Fermi temperature is... (The remaining is omitted due to the
limit of the space)
