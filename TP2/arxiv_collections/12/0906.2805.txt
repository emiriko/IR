The way galaxies assemble their mass to form the well-defined Hubble sequence
is amongst the most debated topic in modern cosmology. One difficulty is to
link distant galaxies to those at present epoch. We aim at establishing how
were the galaxies of the Hubble sequence, 6 Gyrs ago. We intend to derive a
past Hubble sequence that can be causally linked to the present-day one. We
selected samples of nearby galaxies from the SDSS and of distant galaxies from
the GOODS survey. We verified that each sample is representative of galaxies.
We further showed that the observational conditions necessary to retrieve their
morphological classification are similar in an unbiased way. Morphological
analysis has been done in an identical way for all galaxies in the two samples.
We found an absence of number evolution for elliptical and lenticular galaxies,
which strikingly contrasts with the strong evolution of spiral and peculiar
galaxies. Spiral galaxies were 2.3 times less abundant in the past, that is
exactly compensated by the strong decrease by a factor 5 of peculiar galaxies.
It strongly suggests that more than half of the present-day spirals had
peculiar morphologies, 6 Gyrs ago, and this has to be accounted by any scenario
of galactic disk evolution and formation. The past Hubble sequence can be used
to test these scenarios as well as to test evolution of fundamental planes for
spirals and bulges.
