We report measurements of AC susceptibility and hence the in-plane London
penetration depth on the same samples of Bi:2212 and Bi(Y):2212 for many values
of the planar hole concentration/CuO2 unit (p). These support the scenario in
which the pseudogap weakens the superconducting response only for p less than
approximately 0.19.
