In this paper I define certain interesting 2-functors from the Khovanov-Lauda
2-category which categorifies quantum sl(k), for any k>1, to a 2-category of
universal sl(3) foams with corners. For want of a better name I use the term
"foamation" to indicate those 2-functors. I conjecture the existence of similar
2-functors to the 2-category of sl(n) foams with corners, for any n>1.
