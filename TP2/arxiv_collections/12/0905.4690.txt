The measurement of Standard Model processes will be an important first step
towards exploiting the discovery potential of the Large Hadron Collider, the
highest energy accelerator ever built that will begin operation in the fall
2009. This paper presents a summary of the early physics analyses for
understanding the performance of the detector as well as the Standard Model at
the ATLAS experiment at 14 TeV centre of mass energy.
