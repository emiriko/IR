Itinerant metamagnetism transition is observed and studied in perovskite
La1-xCaxMn0.90Cu0.10O3 system for x = 0.30. At a constant low temperature, 10 K
< T < 150 K, there is a continuous second-order metamagnetism jump from a low
magnetic state to a high one with the magnetic field H increasing. However, at
an exceeding low temperature, T = 2.5 K, the metamagnetism jump at H = 3.5 T
becomes to be a robust first-order transition, and another metamagnetism
transition occurs at a higher field H = 7.0 T. Since there is no charge
ordering sign in the present system, it can not be understood by using the
phase separation model or the prior martensite/austenitic phase transition
scenario. A theoretical electronic nematic order phase formation is evidenced
to answer for the two consecutive metamagnetic transitions, which separate the
nematic phase from the low-field (H < 3.5 T) and high-field (H > 7.0 T)
isotropic phases.
