In fractional quantum Hall systems, quasiparticles of fractional charge can
tunnel between the edges at a quantum point contact. Such tunneling (or
backscattering) processes contribute to charge transport, and provide
information on both the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles involved.
Here we study quasiparticle tunneling in the Moore-Read state, in which
quasiparticles of charge e/4 (non-Abelian) and e/2 (Abelian) may co-exist and
both contribute to edge transport. On a disk geometry, we calculate the matrix
elements for e/2 and e/4 quasiholes to tunnel through the bulk of the
Moore-Read state, in an attempt to understand their relative importance. We
find the tunneling amplitude for charge e/2 quasihole is exponentially smaller
than that for charge e/4 quasihole, and the ratio between them can be
(partially) attributed to their charge difference. We find that including
long-range Coulomb interaction only has a weak effect on the ratio. We discuss
briefly the relevance of these results to recent tunneling and interferometry
experiments at filling factor nu=5/2.
