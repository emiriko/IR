Some facts of the theory of the Lorentz group are specified for looking at
the problems of light polarization optics in the frames of vector
Stokes-Mueller and spinor Jones formalism. In view of great differences between
properties of isotropic and time-like vectors in Special Relativity we should
expect principal differences in describing completely polarized and partly
polarized light. In particular, substantial differences are revealed when
turning to spinor techniques in the context of the polarized light. Because
Jones complex formalism has close relation to spinor objects of the Lorentz
group, within the field of the light polarization we could have physical
realizations on the optical desk of some subtle topological distinctions
between orthogonal L_{+}^{\uparrow} =SO_{0}(3.1) and spinor SL(2.C) groups.
These topological differences of the groups find their corollaries in the
problem of the so-called spinor structure of physical space-time, some new
points are considered.
