We construct dynamical black ring solutions in the five dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell system with a positive cosmological constant and investigate
the geometrical structure. The solutions describe the physical process such
that a thin black ring at early time shrinks and changes into a single black
hole as time increase. We also discuss the multi-black rings and the
coalescence of them.
