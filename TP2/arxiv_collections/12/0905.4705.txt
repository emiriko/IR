IceCube is a km^3 scale neutrino detector being constructed deep in the
Antarctic ice. When complete, IceCube will consist of 4800 optical modules
deployed on 80 strings between 1450 and 2450 m of depth. During the 2007-2008
data taking season, 22 strings were operational. This configuration is already
much larger than previous neutrino telescopes and provides better sensitivity
to point sources of high energy (>1 TeV) neutrino emission. Such astrophysical
objects are leading candidates for the acceleration of cosmic rays. We describe
the IceCube detector and present the methods and results of several recent
searches for steady (e.g. AGN) and transient (GRB) point sources.
