We present an oriented numerical summarizer algorithm, applied to producing
automatic summaries of scientific documents in Organic Chemistry. We present
its implementation named Yachs (Yet Another Chemistry Summarizer) that combines
a specific document pre-processing with a sentence scoring method relying on
the statistical properties of documents. We show that Yachs achieves the best
results among several other summarizers on a corpus of Organic Chemistry
articles.
