The Coulomb distortion effects have been for a long time neglected in deep
inelastic scattering for the good reason that the incident energies were very
high. But for energies in the range of earlier data from SLAC or at JLab, the
Coulomb distortion could have the potential consequence of affecting the
A-dependence of the EMC effect and of the longitudinal to transverse virtual
photon absorption cross section ratio $R(x,Q^2)$.
