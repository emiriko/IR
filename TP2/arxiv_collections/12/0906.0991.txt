The LAT instrument on the Fermi mission will reveal the rich spectral and
temporal gamma-ray burst phenomena in the > 100 MeV band. The synergy with
Fermi's GBM detectors will link these observations to those in the well
explored 10-1000 keV range; the addition of the > 100 MeV band observations
will resolve theoretical uncertainties about burst emission in both the prompt
and afterglow phases. Trigger algorithms will be applied to the LAT data both
onboard the spacecraft and on the ground. The sensitivity of these triggers
will differ because of the available computing resources onboard and on the
ground. Here we present the LAT's burst detection methodologies and the
instrument's GRB capabilities.
