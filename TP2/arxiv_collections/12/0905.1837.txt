We report on observation and determination of rotational periods of ten
weak-line T Tauri stars in the Cepheus-Cassiopeia star-forming region.
Observations were carried out with the Cassegrain-Teleskop-Kamera (CTK) at
University Observatory Jena between 2007 June and 2008 May. The periods
obtained range between 0.49 d and 5.7 d, typical for weak-line and post T Tauri
stars.
