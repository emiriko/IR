Recent results obtained using the data sample of 23.6 fb^-1 collected on the
Y(5S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+ e-
collider are discussed. Measurements of several B_s^0 decay branching fractions
are reported. Studies of the Y(5S) decays to the channels with B^+ and B^0
mesons or bottomonium states are discussed.
