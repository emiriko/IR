We present the design of the simulation package Pluto, aimed at the study of
hadronic interactions at SIS and FAIR energies. Its main mission is to offer a
modular framework with an object-oriented structure, thereby making additions
such as new particles, decays of resonances, new models up to modules for
entire changes easily applicable. Overall consistency is ensured by a plugin-
and distribution manager. Particular features are the support of a modular
structure for physics process descriptions, and the possibility to access the
particle stream for on-line modifications. Additional configuration and
self-made classes can be attached by the user without re-compiling the package,
which makes Pluto extremely configurable.
