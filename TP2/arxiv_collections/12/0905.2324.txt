We discuss several similarities and differences between the concepts of
electric and magnetic dipoles. We then consider the relation between the
magnetic dipole and a current loop and show that in the limit of a pointlike
circuit, their magnetic fields coincide. The presentation is accessible to
undergraduate students with a knowledge of the basic ideas of classical
electromagnetism.
