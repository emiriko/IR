We investigate apparent internal structure of kiloparsec scale jets of AGNs
arising from the energy dependent cooling of accelerated electrons and light
travel time effect for relativistically moving sources. Using a simple
cylindrical shell model, we find that the offsets between the peaks of X-ray,
optical and radio brightness distributions observed for many cases are
basically explained with this model. Assuming that electrons in the moving
shell are instantaneously accelerated, X-rays are emitted for a shorter time
scale and observed at the side nearer to the nucleus, while radio emission
continues to the far side of the nucleus because of longer cooling time. The
resultant offset turns out to be order of the jet diameter owing to the light
travel time effect.
