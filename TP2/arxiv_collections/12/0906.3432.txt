Aims.We study the photometric and structural properties of the star cluster
system in the late type Sc spiral NGC 3370. Methods. BVI observations from the
Advanced Camera for Surveys on board of HST are used to analyse in detail the
colours, magnitudes and spatial properties of cluster candidates. The final
catalogue of sources used for the study is composed by 277 objects. Results.
The colour distributions of cluster candidates appear multi-modal. Although
firm age constraints need the use of more age sensitive indicators, the
comparison of cluster candidate colours with the colours of Galactic and
Magellanic Clouds star clusters, suggests an age difference between the various
sub-peaks, with a red old sub-system, a rich population of intermediate age (~1
Gyr), and a blue tail of very young (below ~100 Myr) clusters. The luminosity
functions appear normal for this type of galaxy, as for the distribution of
cluster effective radii (Reff). Our analysis suggests the presence of a peak in
the Reff distribution at ~3.0 pc, with blue (likely young) cluster candidates
showing smaller radii respect to red (likely old) objects. Finally, inspecting
the properties of candidate globular clusters, we find a colour distribution
matching with Galactic Globulars, with a median [Fe/H] -1.5 dex, though a non
negligible tail towards lower metallicities is also present.
