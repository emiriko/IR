We develop the hydrodynamical theory of collinear spin currents coupled to
magnetization dynamics in metallic ferromagnets. The collective spin density
couples to the spin current through a U(1) Berry-phase gauge field determined
by the local texture and dynamics of the magnetization. We determine
phenomenologically the dissipative corrections to the equation of motion for
the electronic current, which consist of a dissipative spin-motive force
generated by magnetization dynamics and a magnetic texture-dependent
resistivity tensor. The reciprocal dissipative, adiabatic spin torque on the
magnetic texture follows from the Onsager principle. We investigate the effects
of thermal fluctuations and find that electronic dynamics contribute to a
nonlocal Gilbert damping tensor in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the
magnetization. Several simple examples, including magnetic vortices, helices,
and spirals, are analyzed in detail to demonstrate general principles.
