In string realizations of the Randall-Sundrum scenario, the higher-spin Regge
excitations of Standard Model states localized near the IR brane are warped
down to close to the TeV scale. We argue that, as a consequence of the
localization properties of Randall-Sundrum models of flavour, the lightest such
resonance is the spin-3/2 excitation of the right-handed top quark over a
significant region of parameter space. A mild accidental cancellation allows
this resonance to be as light or lighter than the Kaluza-Klein excitations of
the Standard Model states. We consider from a bottom-up effective theory point
of view the production and possible observability of such a spin-3/2 excitation
at the LHC and Tevatron. Current limits are weaker than might be expected
because of the excess of WWjj events at the Tevatron reported by CDF for an
invariant mass of 400-500 GeV.
