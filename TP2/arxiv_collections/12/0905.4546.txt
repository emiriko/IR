In this article we explore the aspect of the F ring with respect to the
anti-alignment configuration between the ring and Prometheus. We focus our
attention on the shape of the F ring's azimuthal channels which were first
reported by Porco et al. (2005) and numerically explored by Murray et al.
(2005), who found excellent agreement between Cassini's ISS reprojected images
and their numerical model via a direct comparison. We find that for
anti-alignment the channels are wider and go deeper inside the ring material.
  From our numerical model we find a new feature, an island in the middle of
the channel. This island is made up of the particles that have been perturbed
the most by Prometheus and only appears when this satellite is close to
apoapsis. In addition, plots of the anti-alignment configuration for different
orbital stages of Prometheus are obtained and discussed here.
