De Concini, Kac and Procesi defined a family of subalgebras U^w_+ of a
quantized universal enveloping algebra U_q(g), associated to the elements of
the corresponding Weyl group W. They are deformations of the universal
enveloping algebras U(n_+ \cap Ad_w(n_-)) where n_\pm are the nilradicals of a
pair of dual Borel subalgebras. Based on results of Gorelik and Joseph and an
interpretation of U^w_+ as quantized algebras of functions on Schubert cells,
we construct explicitly the H invariant prime ideals of each U^w_+ and show
that the corresponding poset is isomorphic to W^{\leq w}, where H is the group
of group-like elements of U_q(g). Moreover, for each H-prime of U^w_+ we
construct a generating set in terms of Demazure modules related to fundamental
representations.
