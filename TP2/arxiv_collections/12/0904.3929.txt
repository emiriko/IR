In a crisis of public finances, France bases all its hopes on the "evaluation
of performance" to moderate the effects of a complex crisis. Under the banner
of "modernization of the State", a new "financial constitution" called the
Organic Law on finance laws (LOLF) became the main lever of reform of public
management. Fully applied to the Cultural Affairs since 2006, the LOLF is based
on a set of performance indicators and sets the public performance arts
institutions specific targets. This article defines and analyzes the pattern of
the design and the course of these indicators and targets. It also examines the
controversy generated by this new mode of governance.
