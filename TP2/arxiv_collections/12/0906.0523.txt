The first observation of electroweak single top quark production was recently
reported by the the D0 and CDF collaborations based on 2.3 and 3.2 fb-1 of
ppbar collision data collected at \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV from the Fermilab Tevatron
collider. Several multivariate techniques are used to separate the single top
signal from backgrounds, and both collaborations present measurements of the
single top cross section and the CKM matrix element |Vtb|.
