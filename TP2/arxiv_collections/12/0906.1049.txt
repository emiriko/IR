With molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate very obvious thermal
rectification in large temperature range from 200 to 400 K in nanocone. We also
observe that the rectification of nanocone does not depend on the length very
sensitively, which is in stark contrast with the nanotube thermal rectifier in
which the rectification decreases dramatically as the length increases. Our
work demonstrates that carbon nanocone is a promising practical phononic
device.
