We study the effects of mesonic final state interactions on the Hanbury Brown
and Twiss (HBT) intensity interferometry for mesons in ultra-relativistic heavy
ion collisions. Modification of the one-body amplitude of emitted mesons while
going through a cloud of other mesons is estimated in the semiclassical
approximation with a mesonic optical potential which incorporates both coherent
forward scattering with other mesons and the absorption due to the incoherent
scattering in the meson clouds. We show how these effects results in the
distortion of the HBT images.
