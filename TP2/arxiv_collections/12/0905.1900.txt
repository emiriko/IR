The overlap of a large quantum state with its image, under tiny translations,
oscillates swiftly. We here show that complete orthogonality occurs generically
at isolated points. Decoherence, in the Markovian approximation, lifts the
correlation minima from zero much more quickly than the Wigner function is
smoothed into a positive phase space distribution. In the case of a
superposition of coherent states, blind spots depend strongly on positions and
amplitudes of the components, but they are only weakly affected by relative
phases and the various degrees and directions of squeezing. The blind spots for
coherent state triplets are special in that they lie close to an hexagonal
lattice: Further superpositions of translated triplets, specified by nodes of
one of the sublattices, are quasi-orthogonal to the original triplet and to any
state, likewise constructed on the other sublattice.
