Optically bright Galactic stars (V < 13 mag) having fv(24 um) > 1 mJy are
identified in Spitzer mid-infrared surveys within 8.2 square degrees for the
Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey and within 5.5 square degrees
for the First Look Survey (FLS). 128 stars are identified in Bootes and 140 in
the FLS, and their photometry is given. (K-[24]) colors are determined using K
magnitudes from the 2MASS survey for all stars in order to search for excess 24
um luminosity compared to that arising from the stellar photosphere. Of the
combined sample of 268 stars, 141 are of spectral types F, G, or K, and 17 of
these 141 stars have 24 um excesses with (K-[24]) > 0.2 mag. Using limits on
absolute magnitude derived from proper motions, at least 8 of the FGK stars
with excesses are main sequence stars, and estimates derived from the
distribution of apparent magnitudes indicate that all 17 are main sequence
stars. These estimates lead to the conclusion that between 9% and 17% of the
main sequence FGK field stars in these samples have 24 um infrared excesses.
This result is statistically similar to the fraction of stars with debris disks
found among previous Spitzer targeted observations of much brighter, main
sequence field stars.
