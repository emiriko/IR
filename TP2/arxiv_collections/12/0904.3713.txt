The present status of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) in the strong mesonic
sector is discussed. A very short introduction to ChPT is followed by an
overview of existing two-loop calculations and the determination of the
Low-Energy-Constants (LECs). I discuss the case of $\eta\to\pi\pi\pi$ decays in
somewhat more detail and finish by mentioning some recent work on partially
quenched ChPT and on the renormalization group in ChPT.
