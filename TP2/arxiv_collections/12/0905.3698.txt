Context. We use Hubble Space Telescope photometry of six rich, compact star
clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with ages ranging from 0.01 to
1.0 Gyr, to derive the clusters' stellar mass functions (MFs) at their
half-mass radii.
  Aims. The LMC is an ideal environment to study stellar MFs, because it
contains a large population of compact clusters at different evolutionary
stages. We aim to obtain constraints on the initial MFs (IMFs) of our sample
clusters on the basis of their present-day MFs, combined with our understanding
of their dynamical and photometric evolution.
  Methods. We derive the clusters' present-day MFs below 1.0 Msun using deep
observations with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and updated stellar
population synthesis models.
  Results. Since the relaxation timescales of low-mass stars are very long,
dynamical evolution will not have affected the MFs below 1.0 Msun
significantly, so that - within the uncertainties - the derived MFs are
consistent with the solar-neighbourhood IMF, at least for the younger clusters.
  Conclusions. The IMF in the low-density, low-metallicity environment of the
LMC disk is not significantly different from that in the solar neighbourhood.
