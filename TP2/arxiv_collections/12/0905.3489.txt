We review our recent study of the pion mass dependence of the rho and sigma
resonances generated from one-loop SU(2) Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) with
the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM) which was modified to properly account for
the Adler zero. The method is based on analyticity, elastic unitarity and ChPT
at low energies, thus yielding the pion mass dependence of the resonance pole
positions from the ChPT series up to a given order. We find that the rho-pi-pi
coupling constant is almost m_pi independent and that our prediction compare
well with some recent lattice results for the rho mass. These findings may be
relevant for studies of the meson spectrum and form factors on the lattice.
