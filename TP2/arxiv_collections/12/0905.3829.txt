We present a MIR coronagraph to target the direct observation of extrasolar
planets for SPICA, in which a coronagraph is currently regarded as an option of
the focal plane instruments. The primary target of the SPICA coronagraph is the
direct observation of Jovian exo-planets. A strategy of the baseline survey and
the specifications for the coronagraph instrument for the survey are introduced
together. The main wavelengths and the contrast required for the observations
are 3.5-27um, and 10^{-6}, respectively.Laboratory experiments were performed
with a visible laser to demonstrate the principles of the coronagraphs. In an
experiment using binary-shaped pupil coronagraphs, a contrast of 6.7x10^{-8}
was achieved, as derived from the linear average in the dark region and the
core of the PSF. A coronagraph by a binary-shaped pupil mask is a baseline
solution for SPICA because of its feasibility and robustness. On the other
hand, a laboratory experiment of the phase induced amplitude
apodization/binary-mask hybrid coronagraph has been executed to obtain an
option of higher performance, and a contrast of 6.5x10^{-7} was achieved with
active wavefront control.Potentially important by-product of the instrument,
transit monitoring for characteization of exo-planets, is also described. We
also present recent progress of technology on a design of a binary-shaped pupil
mask for the actual pupil of SPICA, PSF subtraction, the development of
free-standing binary masks, a vacuum chamber, and a cryogenic deformable
mirror. Considering SPICA to be an essential platform for coronagraphs and the
progress of key technologies, we propose to develop a mid-infrared coronagraph
instrument for SPICA and to perform the direct observation of exo-planets with
it.
