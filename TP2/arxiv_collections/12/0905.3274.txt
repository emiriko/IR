The concept of "dyadotorus" was recently introduced to identify in the
Kerr-Newman geometry the region where vacuum polarization processes may occur,
leading to the creation of $e^--e^+$ pairs. This concept generalizes the
original concept of "dyadosphere" initially introduced for
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometries. The topology of the axially symmetric
dyadotorus is studied for selected values of the electric field and its
electromagnetic energy is estimated by using three different methods all giving
the same result. It is shown by a specific example the difference between a
dyadotorus and a dyadosphere. The comparison is made for a Kerr-Newman black
hole with the same total mass energy and the same charge to mass ratio of a
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. It turns out that the Kerr-Newman black hole
leads to larger values of the electromagnetic field and energy when compared to
the electric field and energy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m one. The
significance of these theoretical results for the realistic description of the
process of gravitational collapse leading to black hole formation as well as
the energy source of gamma ray bursts are also discussed.
