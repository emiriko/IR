The quantum versions of de Finetti's theorem derived so far express the
convergence of n-partite symmetric states, i.e., states that are invariant
under permutations of their n parties, towards probabilistic mixtures of
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) states. Unfortunately, these
theorems only hold in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and their direct
generalization to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces is known to fail. Here,
we address this problem by considering invariance under orthogonal
transformations in phase space instead of permutations in state space, which
leads to a new type of quantum de Finetti's theorem that is particularly
relevant to continuous-variable systems. Specifically, an n-mode bosonic state
that is invariant with respect to this continuous symmetry in phase space is
proven to converge towards a probabilistic mixture of i.i.d. Gaussian states
(actually, n identical thermal states).
