We develop a trap-size scaling theory for trapped particle systems at quantum
transitions. As a theoretical laboratory, we consider a quantum XY chain in an
external transverse field acting as a trap for the spinless fermions of its
quadratic Hamiltonian representation. We discuss trap-size scaling at the Mott
insulator to superfluid transition in the Bose-Hubbard model. We present exact
and accurate numerical results for the XY chain and for the low-density Mott
transition in the hard-core limit of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model.
Our results are relevant for systems of cold atomic gases in optical lattices.
