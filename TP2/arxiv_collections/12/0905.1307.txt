We show how to use the RSA one-way accumulator to realize an efficient and
dynamic authenticated dictionary, where untrusted directories provide
cryptographically verifiable answers to membership queries on a set maintained
by a trusted source. Our accumulator-based scheme for authenticated
dictionaries supports efficient incremental updates of the underlying set by
insertions and deletions of elements. Also, the user can optimally verify in
constant time the authenticity of the answer provided by a directory with a
simple and practical algorithm. We have also implemented this scheme and we
give empirical results that can be used to determine the best strategy for
systems implementation with respect to resources that are available. This work
has applications to certificate revocation in public key infrastructure and
end-to-end integrity of data collections published by third parties on the
Internet.
