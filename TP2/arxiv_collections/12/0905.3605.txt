The estimate of the energy deposition rate (EDR) for neutrino pair
annihilation has been carried out. The EDR for the neutrinos coming from the
equatorial plane of a rotating neutron star is calculated along the rotation
axis using the Cook-Shapiro-Teukolsky (CST) metric. The neutrino trajectories
and hence the neutrino emitted from the disk is affected by the redshift due to
disk rotation and gravitation. The EDR is very sensitive to the value of the
temperature and its variation along the disk. The rotation of the star has a
negative effect on the EDR; it decreases with increase in rotational velocity.
