We explore realizations of minimal flavour violation (MFV) for the lepton
sector. We find that it can be realized within those seesaw models where a
separation of the lepton number and lepton flavour violating scales can be
achieved, such as type II and inverse seesaw models. We present in particular a
simple implementation of the MFV hypothesis which differs in nature from those
previously discussed. It allows to reconstruct the flavour structure of the
model from the values of the light neutrino masses and mixing parameters, even
in the presence of CP-violating phases. Experimentally reachable predictions
for rare processes such as mu --> e gamma are given.
