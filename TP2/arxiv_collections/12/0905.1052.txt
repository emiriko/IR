For two states of opposite parity that cross as a function of an external
magnetic field, the addition of an electric field will break the symmetry and
induce an avoided crossing. A suitable arrangement of fields may be used to
create a conical intersection as a function of external spatial coordinates. We
consider the effect of the resulting geometric phase for ultracold polar
molecules. For a Bose-Einstein condensate in the mean-field approximation, the
geometric phase effect induces stable states of persistent superfluid flow that
are characterized by half-integer quantized angular momentum.
