It is shown that thermal fluctuations present in a simple non-degenerate
relativistic fluid satisfy a wave equation in the Euler regime. The
characteristic propagation speeds are calculated and the classical expression
for the speed of sound is recovered at the non relativistic limit. Implications
and generalizations of this work are analyzed.
