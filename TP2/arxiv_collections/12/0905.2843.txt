Many cortical areas increase in size considerably during postnatal
development, progressively displacing neuronal cell bodies from each other. At
present, little is known about how cortical growth affects the development of
neuronal circuits. Here, in acute and chronic experiments, we study the layout
of ocular dominance (OD) columns in cat primary visual cortex (V1) during a
period of substantial postnatal growth. We find that despite a considerable
size increase of V1, the spacing between columns is largely preserved. In
contrast, their spatial arrangement changes systematically over this period.
While in young animals columns are more band-like, layouts become more
isotropic in mature animals. We propose a novel mechanism of growth-induced
reorganization that is based on the `zigzag instability', a dynamical
instability observed in several inanimate pattern forming systems. We argue
that this mechanism is inherent to a wide class of models for the
activity-dependent formation of OD columns. Analyzing one member of this class,
the Elastic Network model, we show that this mechanism can account for the
preservation of column spacing and the specific mode of reorganization of OD
columns that we observe. We conclude that neurons systematically shift their
selectivities during normal development and that this reorganization is induced
by the cortical expansion during growth. Our work suggests that cortical
circuits remain plastic for an extended period in development in order to
facilitate the modification of neuronal circuits to adjust for cortical growth.
