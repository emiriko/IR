The recently introduced deflected mirage mediation (DMM) model is a
string-motivated paradigm in which all three of the major
supersymmetry-breaking transmission mechanisms are operative. We begin a
systematic exploration of the parameter space of this rich model context,
paying special attention to the pattern of gaugino masses which arise. In this
work we focus on the dark matter phenomenology of the DMM model as such signals
are the least influenced by the model-dependent scalar masses. We find that a
large portion of the parameter space in which the three mediation mechanisms
have a similar effective mass scale of 1 TeV or less will be probed by future
direct and indirect detection experiments. Distinguishing deflected mirage
mediation from the mirage model without gauge mediation will prove difficult
without collider input, though we indicate how gamma ray signals may provide an
opportunity for distinguishing between the two paradigms.
