We study the structural and homological properties of graded Artinian modules
over generalized Weyl algebras (GWAs), and this leads to a decomposition result
for the category of graded Artinian modules. Then we define and examine a
category of graded modules analogous to the BGG category O. We discover a
condition on the data defining the GWA that ensures O has a system of
projective generators. Under this condition, O has nice
representation-theoretic properties. There is also a decomposition result for
O. Next, we give a necessary condition for there to be a strongly graded Morita
equivalence between two GWAs. We define a new algebra related to GWAs, and use
it to produce some strongly graded Morita equivalences. Finally, we give a
complete answer to the strongly graded Morita problem for classical GWAs.
