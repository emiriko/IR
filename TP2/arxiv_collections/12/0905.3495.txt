The mid-infrared properties of pre-planetary disks are sensitive to the
temperature and flaring profiles of disks for the regions where planet
formation is expected to occur. In order to constrain theories of planet
formation, we have carried out a mid-infrared (wavelength 10.7 microns) size
survey of young stellar objects using the segmented Keck telescope in a novel
configuration. We introduced a customized pattern of tilts to individual mirror
segments to allow efficient sparse-aperture interferometry, allowing full
aperture synthesis imaging with higher calibration precision than traditional
imaging. In contrast to previous surveys on smaller telescopes and with poorer
calibration precision, we find most objects in our sample are partially
resolved. Here we present the main observational results of our survey of 5
embedded massive protostars, 25 Herbig Ae/Be stars, 3 T Tauri stars, 1 FU Ori
system, and 5 emission-line objects of uncertain classification. The observed
mid-infrared sizes do not obey the size-luminosity relation found at
near-infrared wavelengths and a companion paper will provide further modelling
analysis of this sample. In addition, we report imaging results for a few of
the most resolved objects, including complex emission around embedded massive
protostars, the photoevaporating circumbinary disk around MWC 361A, and the
subarcsecond binaries T Tau, FU Ori and MWC 1080.
