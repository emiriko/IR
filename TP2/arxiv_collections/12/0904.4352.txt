We study the electric dipole moment (EDM) and the anomalous magnetic dipole
moment (MDM) of the muon in the CP-violating Minimal Supersymmetric extension
of the Standard Model (MSSM). We take into account the contributions from the
chargino- and neutralino-mediated one-loop graphs and the dominant two-loop
Higgs-mediated Barr-Zee diagrams. We improve earlier calculations by
incorporating CP-violating Higgs-boson mixing effects and the resummed
threshold corrections to the Yukawa couplings of the charged leptons as well as
that of the bottom quark. The analytic correlation between the muon EDM and MDM
is explicitly presented at one- and two-loop levels and, through several
numerical examples, we illustrate its dependence on the source of the dominant
contributions. We have implemented the analytic expressions for the muon EDM
and MDM in an updated version of the public code CPsuperH2.0.
