Ultrashort laser pulse filaments in dispersive nonlinear Kerr media induce a
moving refractive index perturbation which modifies the space-time geometry as
seen by co-propagating light rays. We study the analogue geometry induced by
the filament and show that one of the most evident features of filamentation,
namely conical emission, may be precisely reconstructed from the geodesics. We
highlight the existence of favorable conditions for the study of analogue black
hole kinematics and Hawking type radiation.
