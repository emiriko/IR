The tremendous development of cold atom physics has opened up a whole new
opportunity to study novel states of matter which are not easily accessible in
solid state systems. Here we propose to realize the $f$-wave pairing
superfluidity of spinless fermions in the $p_{x,y}$-orbital bands of the two
dimensional honeycomb optical lattices. The non-trivial orbital band structure
rather than strong correlation effects gives rise to the unconventional pairing
with the nodal lines of the $f$-wave symmetry. With a confining harmonic trap,
zero energy Andreev bound states appear around the circular boundary with a
six-fold symmetry. The experimental realization and detection of this novel
pairing state are feasible.
