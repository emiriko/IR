We propose a Wigner function based parameter that can be used as an indicator
of quantum chaos. This parameter is defined as "entropy" from the
time-dependence of "non-classicallity" proposed in \cite{KZ04}. We perform our
considerations for the system of damped nonlinear (Kerr-like) oscillator
excited by a series of ultra-short external pulses.
