Although the vast majority of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors are
hole-doped, a small family of electron-doped compounds exists. Under
investigated until recently, there has been tremendous recent progress in their
characterization. A consistent view is being reached on a number of formerly
contentious issues, such as their order parameter symmetry, phase diagram, and
normal state electronic structure. Many other aspects have been revealed
exhibiting both their similarities and differences with the hole-doped
compounds. This review summarizes the current experimental status of these
materials, with a goal to providing a snapshot of our current understanding of
electron-doped cuprates. When possible we put our results in the context of the
hole-doped compounds. We attempt to synthesize this information into a
consistent view on a number of topics important to both this material class as
well as the overall cuprate phenomenology including the phase diagram, the
superconducting order parameter symmetry, phase separation, pseudogap effects,
the role of competing orders, the spin-density wave mean-field description of
the normal state, and electron-phonon coupling.
