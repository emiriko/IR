Various aspects of the C-metric representing two rotating charged black holes
accelerated in opposite directions are summarized and its limits are
considered. A particular attention is paid to the special-relativistic limit in
which the electromagnetic field becomes the "magic field" of two oppositely
accelerated rotating charged relativistic discs. When the acceleration vanishes
the usual electromagnetic magic field of the Kerr-Newman black hole with
gravitational constant set to zero arises. Properties of the accelerated discs
and the fields produced are studied and illustrated graphically. The charges at
the rim of the accelerated discs move along spiral trajectories with the speed
of light. If the magic field has some deeper connection with the field of the
Dirac electron, as is sometimes conjectured because of the same gyromagnetic
ratio, the "accelerating magic field" represents the electromagnetic field of a
uniformly accelerated spinning electron. It generalizes the classical Born's
solution for two uniformly accelerated monopole charges.
