In this article we present calculations of van der Waals/Casimir forces,
described by Lifshitz theory, for the solid-liquid-solid system using measured
dielectric functions of all involved materials for the wavelength range from
millimeters down to subnanometers. It is shown that even if the dielectric
function is known over all relevant frequency ranges, the scatter in the
dielectric data, can lead to very large scatter in the calculated van der
Waals/Casimir forces. Especially when the liquid dielectric function becomes
comparable in magnitude to the dielectric function of one of the interacting
solids, the associated variation in the force can be up to a factor of two for
plate-plate separations 5-500 nm. This corresponds to an uncertainty up to 100%
in the theory prediction for a specific system. As a result accuracy testing of
the Lifshitz theory under these circumstances is rather questionable. Finally
we discuss predictions of Lifshitz theory regarding multiple
repulsive-attractive transitions with separation distance, as well as
nontrivial scaling of the van der Waals/Casimir force with distance.
