We directly measured the angular diameters for 11 exoplanet host stars using
Georgia State University's CHARA Array interferometer and calculated their
linear radii and effective temperatures. The sample tends towards evolving or
evolved stars and includes one dwarf, four subgiants, and six giants. We then
estimated masses and ages for the stars using our effective temperatures
combined with metallicity measurements from the literature.
