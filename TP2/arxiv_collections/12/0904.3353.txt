In this paper we introduce a diagnostic for measuring the quantum-classical
difference for open quantum systems, which is the normalized size of the
quantum terms in the Master equation for Wigner function evolution. For a
driven Duffing oscillator, this measure shows remarkably precise scaling over
long time-scales with the parameter $\zeta_0=\hbar^2/D$. We also see that,
independent of $\zeta_0$ the dynamics follows a similar pattern. For small
$\zeta_0$ all of our curves collapses to essentially a single curve when scaled
by the maximum value of the quantum-classical difference. In both limits of
large and small $\zeta_0$ we see a saturation effect in the size of the
quantum-classical difference; that is, the instantaneous difference between
quantum and classical evolutions cannot be either too small or too large.
