We consider the decelerating shock instability of Vishniac for a finite layer
of constant density. This serves both to clarify which aspects of the Vishniac
instability mechanism depend on compressible effects away from the shock front
and also to incorporate additional effects of finite layer thickness. This work
has implications for experiments attempting to reproduce the essential physics
of astrophysical shocks, in particular their minimum necessary lateral
dimensions to contain all the relevant dynamics.
