We present an extension of the MSSM where the dominant decay channel of the
Higgs boson is a cascade decay into a four-gluon final state. In this model the
Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone boson of a broken global symmetry SU(3)-> SU(2).
Both the global symmetry breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking are
radiatively induced. The global symmetry breaking pattern also implies the
existence of a light (few GeV) pseudo-Goldstone boson eta which is a singlet
under the standard model gauge group. The h -> eta eta branching fraction is
large, and typically dominates over the standard h -> b b decay. The dominant
decay of eta is into two gluons, while the decays to photons, taus or lighter
standard model flavors are suppressed at the level of 10^(-4) or more. With h->
4 jets as the dominant decay, the Higgs could be as light as 78 GeV without
being detected at LEP, while detection at the LHC is extremely challenging.
However many of the super- and global symmetry partners of the standard model
particles should be easily observable at the LHC. Furthermore, the LHC should
be able to observe a "wrong Higgs" that is a 300-400 GeV heavy Higgs-like
particle with suppressed couplings to W and Z that by itself does not account
for electroweak precision observables and the unitarity of WW scattering. At
the same time, the true Higgs is deeply buried in the QCD background.
