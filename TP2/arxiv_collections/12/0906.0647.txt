It is shown that conventional "covariant" derivative of the Levi-Civita
tensor is not really covariant. Adding compensative terms, it is possible to
make it covariant and to be equal to zero. Then one can be introduced a
curvature in the pseudotensors space. There appears a curvature tensor which is
dissimilar to ordinary one by covariant term including the Levi-Civita density
derivatives hence to be equal zero. This term is a little bit similar to
Weylean one in the Weyl curvature tensor. There has been attempted to find a
curvature measure in the combined (tensor plus pseudotensor) tensors space.
Besides, there has been constructed some vector from the metric and the
Levi-Civita density which gives new opportunities in geometry.
