We use two-flavor heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory to investigate the
isovector axial charges of the spin one-half hyperons. Expressions for these
hyperon axial charges are derived at next-to-leading order in the chiral
expansion. We utilize phenomenological and lattice QCD inputs to assess the
convergence of the two-flavor theory, which appears to be best for cascades.
