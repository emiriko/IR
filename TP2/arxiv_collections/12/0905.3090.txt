We present an atomic-resolution observation and analysis of graphene
constrictions and ribbons with sub-nanometer width. Graphene membranes are
studied by imaging side spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron
microscopy at 80 kV. Holes are formed in the honeycomb-like structure due to
radiation damage. As the holes grow and two holes approach each other, the
hexagonal structure that lies between them narrows down. Transitions and
deviations from the hexagonal structure in this graphene ribbon occur as its
width shrinks below one nanometer. Some reconstructions, involving more
pentagons and heptagons than hexagons, turn out to be surprisingly stable.
Finally, single carbon atom chain bridges between graphene contacts are
observed. The dynamics are observed in real time at atomic resolution with
enough sensitivity to detect every carbon atom that remains stable for a
sufficient amount of time. The carbon chains appear reproducibly and in various
configurations from graphene bridges, between adsorbates, or at open edges and
seem to represent one of the most stable configurations that a few-atomic
carbon system accomodates in the presence of continuous energy input from the
electron beam.
