The relationship between the black hole mass and velocity dispersion
indicated with [O III] line width is investigated for a sample of 87
flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) selected from SDSS DR3 quasar catalogue. We
found the M_bh - sigma_[O III] relation is deviated from Tremaine et al.
relation for nearby inactive galaxies, with a larger black hole mass at given
velocity dispersion. There is no strong evidence of cosmology evolution in M_bh
- sigma_[O III] relation up to z~0.8. A significant correlation between the [O
III] luminosity and Broad Line Region (BLR) luminosity is found. When
transferring the [O III] luminosity to Narrow Line Region (NLR) luminosity, the
BLR luminosity is, on average, larger than NLR one by about one order of
magnitude. We found a strong correlation between the synchrotron peak
luminosity and NLR luminosity, which implies a tight relation between the jet
physics and accretion process.
