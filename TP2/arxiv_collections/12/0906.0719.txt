In this study we consider the nonlinear radial oscillations exciting in
LBV--stars with effective temperatures 1.5e4 K <= Teff <= 3e4 K, bolometric
luminosities 1.2e6 L_odot <= L <= 1.9e6 L_odot and masses 35.7 M_odot <= M <=
49.1 M_odot. Hydrodynamic computations were carried out with initial conditions
obtained from evolutionary sequences of population I stars (X=0.7, Z=0.02) with
initial masses from 70M_odot to 90 M_odot. All hydrodynamical models show
instability against radial oscillations with amplitude growth time comparable
with dynamical time scale of the star. Radial oscillations exist in the form of
nonlinear running waves propagating from the boundary of the compact core to
the upper boundary of the hydrodynamical model. The velocity amplitude of outer
layers is of several hundreds of km/s while the bolometric light amplitude does
not exceed 0.2 mag. Stellar oscillations are not driven by the kappa-mechanism
and are due to the instability of the gas with adiabatic exponent close to the
critical value Gamma_1 = 4/3 due to the large contribution of radiation in the
total pressure. The range of the light variation periods (6 day <= P <= 31 day)
of hydrodynamical models agrees with periods of microvariability observed in
LBV--stars.
