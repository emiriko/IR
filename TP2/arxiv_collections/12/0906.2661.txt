The possibility of realization of a superfluid state of bound electron-hole
pairs (magnetoexcitons) with spatially separated components in a graphene
double layer structure (two graphene layers separated by a dielectric layer)
subjected by a strong perpendicular to the layers magnetic field is analyzed.
We show that the superfluid state of magnetoexcitons may emerge only under
certain imbalance of filling factors of the layers. The imbalance can be
created by an electrostatic field (external gate voltage). The spectrum of
elementary excitations is found and the dependence of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature on the interlayer
distance is obtained. The advantages of use graphene double layer systems
instead of double quantum well GaAs heterostructures are discussed.
