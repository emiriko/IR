We present four estimators of the entanglement (or interdepency) of
ground-states in which the coefficients are all real nonnegative and therefore
can be interpreted as probabilities of configurations. Such ground-states of
hermitian and non-hermitian Hamiltonians can be given, for example, by
superpositions of valence bond states which can describe equilibrium but also
stationary states of stochastic models. We consider in detail the last case.
Using analytical and numerical methods we compare the values of the estimators
in the directed polymer and the raise and peel models which have massive,
conformal invariant and non-conformal invariant massless phases. We show that
like in the case of the quantum problem, the estimators verify the area law and
can therefore be used to signal phase transitions in stationary states.
