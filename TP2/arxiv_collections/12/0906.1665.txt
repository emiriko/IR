An on-shell renormalisation programme for the chargino/neutralino and the
sfermion sectors within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model as
implemented in a fully automated code, SloopS, for the calculation of one-loop
processes at the colliders and in astrophysics, is presented. This is a sequel
to our study in arXiv:0807.4668 [hep-ph] where an on-shell renormalisation of
the Higgs (and the gauge/fermion) sector is performed. The issue of mixing is
treated in a unified and coherent manner in all these sectors, in particular we
give some new insight into the renormalisation of the mixing angle in the
sfermion sector and like with the Higgs sector and the issue of tan(beta) we
discuss different schemes. We also perform numerical comparisons between our
code SloopS and different results found in the literature. In particular we
consider loop corrections to the neutralino and sfermion masses, chargino pair
production and stau pair production in e^{+}e^{-} colliders, as well as a few
decays of the heavier chargino. For all these observables, we analyse the
tan(beta) scheme dependence using different definitions of this parameter and
comment on the impact of using different renormalisation of the mixing
parameter in the sfermion sector.
