We report on double-differential inclusive cross-sections of the production
of secondary protons, charged pions, and deuterons, in the interactions with a
5% nuclear interaction length thick stationary tantalum target, of proton and
pion beams with momentum from +/-3 GeV/c to +/-15 GeV/c. Results are given for
secondary particles with production angles between 20 and 125 degrees. They are
of particular relevance for the optimization of the design parameters of the
proton driver of a neutrino factory.
