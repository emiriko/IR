We consider the production of heavy-quark pairs in the collisions of
polarized and unpolarized on-shell photons and present, in analytic form, the
fully integrated total cross sections for total photon spins $J_z=0, \pm 2$ at
next-to-leading-order in QCD. Phenomenological applications include $b\bar b$
production, which represents an irreducible background to standard-model
intermediate-mass Higgs-boson production, as well as $t\bar t$ production.
