The massive Dirac equation on a Kerr-Newman background may be solved by the
method of separation of variables. The radial and angular equations are coupled
via an angular eigenvalue, which is determined from the Chandrasekhar-Page (CP)
equation. Obtaining accurate angular eigenvalues is a key step in studying
scattering, absorption and emission of the fermionic field.
  Here we introduce a new method for finding solutions of the CP equation.
First, we introduce a novel representation for the spin-half spherical
harmonics. Next, we decompose the angular solutions of the CP equation (the
mass-dependent spin-half spheroidal harmonics) in the spherical basis. The
method yields a three-term recurrence relation which may be solved numerically
via continued-fraction methods, or perturbatively to obtain a series expansion
for the eigenvalues. In the case $\mu = \pm \omega$ (where $\omega$ and $\mu$
are the frequency and mass of the fermion) we obtain eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions in closed form. We study the eigenvalue spectrum, and the zeros
of the maximally co-rotating mode.
  We compare our results with previous studies, and uncover and correct some
errors in the literature. We provide series expansions, tables of eigenvalues
and numerical fits across a wide parameter range, and present plots of a
selection of eigenfunctions. It is hoped this study will be a useful resource
for all researchers interested in the Dirac equation on a rotating black hole
background.
