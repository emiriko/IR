In a many-quark model developed in our previous paper where two-body color
pairing and particle-hole type interactions are active, the exact energy
eigenstates are re-formed with physically clearer expressions than those
derived in our previous paper. By using the re-formed energy eigenstates, two
types of the eigenstates in which the pairing correlation and the quark triplet
formation separately appear definitely, are unified and this model can be
treated for both the strong color correlations and the quark triplet
formations.
