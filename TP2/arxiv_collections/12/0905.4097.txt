We use the harmonic maps ansatz to find exact solutions of the
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) equations. The solutions are harmonic
maps invariant to the symplectic real group in four dimensions
$Sp(4,\Rreal)\sim O(5)$. We find solutions of the EMDA field equations for the
one and two dimensional subspaces of the symplectic group. Specially, for
illustration of the method, we find space-times that generalise the
Schwarzschild solution with dilaton, axion and electromagnetic fields.
