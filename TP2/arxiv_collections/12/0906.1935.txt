Light-cone sum rules are used to investigate the electromagnetic form factors
of the $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ baryons by using the Ioffe type interpolating
currents. The sum rules are affected to some extent by the choice of the
interpolating currents from a comparison. Numerical calculations show that the
magnetic form factor can be well fitted by the dipole formula for $\Sigma$ but
not for $\Lambda$. The magnetic form factor of $\Lambda$ approaches zero with
the momentum transfer faster than the dipole formula estimation.
