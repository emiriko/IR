We present new results on the structure of the solar core, obtained with new
sets of frequencies of solar low-degree p modes obtained from the BiSON
network. We find that different methods used in extracting the different sets
of frequencies cause shifts in frequencies, but the shifts are not large enough
to affect solar structure results. We find that the BiSON frequencies show that
the solar sound speed in the core is slightly larger than that inferred from
data from MDI low-degree modes, and the uncertainties on the inversion results
are smaller. Density results also change by a larger amount, and we find that
solar models now tend to show smaller differences in density compared to the
Sun. The result is seen at all radii, a result of the fact that conservation of
mass implies that density differences in one region have to cancel out density
differences in others, since our models are constructed to have the same mass
as the Sun. The uncertainties on the density results are much smaller too. We
attribute the change in results to having more, and lower frequency, low-degree
mode frequencies available. These modes provide greater sensitivity to
conditions in the core.
