We have previously shown that the quantum Zeno effect can be used to
implement quantum logic gates for quantum computing applications, where the
Zeno effect was produced using a strong two-photon absorbing medium. Here we
show that the Zeno effect can also be used to implement classical logic gates
whose inputs and outputs are high-intensity fields (coherent states). The
operation of the devices can be understood using a quasi-static analysis, and
their switching times are calculated using a dynamic approach. The two-photon
absorption coefficient of rubidium vapor is shown to allow operation of these
devices at relatively low power levels.
