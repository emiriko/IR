The paper proposes an envelope soliton model of the electron that propagates
as a protuberance on a fictitious waveguide, which acts as trajectory. The
model is based on de Broglie's original electron wave-particle relativistic
theory, and on the observation that the Klein-Gordon equation governs the
propagation mode of a common microwave waveguide - with the Schroedinger
equation as a low group velocity approximation. This analogy opened for
practical physical models, including solitons. In the linear case a conceived
corpuscle zigzags within the fictitious waveguide - a zigzagging that resembles
Penrose's picture of Dirac's electron theory. The soliton envelope is defined
by a special nonlinear version of the Schroedinger equation. The nonlinearity
cancels the de Broglie/Bohm Quantum Potential of the envelope. The wavefunction
is confined by the envelope, and thus the concept of the collapse of the
wavefunction is eliminated. Since the electron model is based directly on the
Special theory of relativity it also illustrates that theory. The corpuscle,
incorporating spin and charge, which moves at the speed of light, needs further
study relating it to the photon. A model of the photon based on the mutual
coupling of two modes of an optical fiber at the Planck scale, is suggested.
One of these modes is thought to carry two orthogonal polarized electromagnetic
external fields, while the other, internal, mode carries a corpuscle that moves
helically and thus represents the spin. A single electron is considered to have
one polarization only, without any superposition possibility; hence, the
concept of collapse in a polarization measurement is eliminated.
