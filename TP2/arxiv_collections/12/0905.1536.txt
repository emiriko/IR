We consider renormalizability of topologically massive gravity in three
space-time dimensions. With a usual parametrization of the metric tensor, we
establish the statement that topologically massive gravity is in fact
renormalizable. In this proof, we make use of not only a recently found, new
infrared regularization method of scalar mode but also a covariant ultraviolet
regulator with a specific combination of higher derivative terms which is
motivated by the new massive gravity in three dimensions.
