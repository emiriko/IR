The Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) combines data from NASA's
Spitzer, Chandra, Hubble and GALEX observatories, together with ground-based
data into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 low
redshift Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs). The LIRGs are a complete subset of
the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS). The LIRGs targeted in GOALS span
the full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional optical
line-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. They provide an unbiased
picture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxies
in the local Universe. As an example of the analytic power of the
multi-wavelength GOALS dataset, we present data for the interacting system VV
340 (IRAS F14547+2449). Between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (or
about 5E11 solar luminosities) originates in VV 340 North. While the IRAC
colors of VV 340 North and South are consistent with star-forming galaxies,
both the Spitzer IRS and Chandra ACIS data indicate the presence of a buried
AGN in VV 340 North. The GALEX far and near-UV fluxes imply a extremely large
infrared "excess" (IRX) for the system (IR/FUV = 81) which is well above the
correlation seen in starburst galaxies. Most of this excess is driven by VV 340
N, which alone has an IR excess of nearly 400. The VV 340 system seems to be
comprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy
(VV 340 North) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system and
which hosts a buried AGN, and a face-on starburst (VV 340 South) that dominates
the short-wavelength emission.
