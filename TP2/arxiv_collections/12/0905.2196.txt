We present self-consistent cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
that simultaneously follow the formation of a galaxy cluster and the magnetic
field ejection by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find that the magnetic
fields ejected by the AGNs, though initially distributed in relatively small
volumes, can be transported throughout the cluster and be further amplified by
the intra-cluster medium (ICM) turbulence during the cluster formation process.
The ICM turbulence is shown to be generated and sustained by the frequent
mergers of smaller halos. Furthermore, a cluster-wide dynamo process is shown
to exist in the ICM and amplify the magnetic field energy and flux. The total
magnetic energy in the cluster can reach $\sim$ $10^{61}$ ergs while micro
Gauss ($\mu$G) fields can distribute over $\sim$ Mpc scales throughout the
whole cluster. This finding shows that magnetic fields from AGNs, being further
amplified by the ICM turbulence through small-scale dynamo processes, can be
the origin of cluster-wide magnetic fields.
