AGN feedback is now a major component of models of galaxy evolution. Using
near-infrared imaging spectroscopy on the VLT we identify kpc-sized outflows of
few x 10^10 M_s of ionized gas in powerful radio galaxies at z~2-3. Velocity
fields are consistent with bipolar outflows, with total velocity offsets of
~1000 km s-1. FWHMs ~1000 km s-1 suggest strong turbulence. IRAM follow-up
observations of parts of the sample suggest a remarkable deficit in cold
molecular relative to ionized gas, which may imply that significant fractions
of the interstellar medium of these galaxies are participating in the winds.
Kinetic energies of the gas correspond to ~0.2% of the rest-mass equivalent of
the mass of the supermassive black hole, roughly in agreement with model
predictions. We also report the detection of a massive reservoir of few x 10^10
M_s of cold molecular gas in the halo of the z=2.6 radio galaxy TXS0828+193
with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. The gas is at a distance of ~90
kpc from the radio galaxy, and does not appear associated with a significant
stellar mass > few x10^9 M_s. It is near one of the radio hot spots, and at a
very similar redshift to the diffuse, Mpc-sized halo of ionized gas surrounding
the radio galaxy. This may be the first sign that the jets of powerful radio
galaxies at z~2 may interact efficiently with the intracluster medium, somewhat
in analogy with the filaments of multiphase gas in nearby galaxy clusters which
are being heated by the powerful AGN of their central galaxies.
