We have clarified how the enhanced superconductivity, often referred to as
the 3-K phase superconductivity, develops in the Sr2RuO4-Ru eutectic system.
  From the detailed ac and dc susceptibility measurements on well-characterized
crystals, we revealed strongly anisotropic shielding, governed by the direction
of the screening current dominated within the RuO2 plane rather than by the
orientation of the Ru lamellae. The onset temperature of the 3-K phase
superconductivity probed by diamagnetic screening is as high as 3.5 K. The
temperature dependence of the diamagnetic shielding above around 2 K is well
ascribed by the interfacial screening around each Ru lamella. Below around 2 K,
the rapid development of the shielding fraction as well as its peculiar esponse
to ac and dc magnetic fields are explained by the formation of the Josephson
network consisting of inter-lamellar supercurrents.
