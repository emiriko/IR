Measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda in
superconductor Mo_3Sb_7 (T_c~2.1 K) were carried out by means of
muon-spin-rotation. The absolute values of \lambda, the Ginzburg-Landau
parameter \kappa, the first H_{c1} and the second H_{c2} critical fields at T=0
are \lambda(0)=720(100)nm, \kappa(0)=55(9), \mu_0H_{c1}(0)=1.8(3)mT, and
\mu_0H_{c2}(0)=1.9(2)T. The zero temperature value of the superconducting
energy gap \Delta(0) was found to be 0.35(1)meV corresponding to the ratio
2\Delta(0)/k_BT_c=3.83(10). At low temperatures \lambda^{-2}(T) saturates and
becomes constant below T~0.3T_c, in agreement with what is expected for s-wave
BCS superconductors. Our results suggest that Mo_3Sb_7 is a BCS superconductor
with the isotropic energy gap
