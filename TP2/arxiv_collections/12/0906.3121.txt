We present results of a {\bf comprehensive} asteroseismic modelling of the
$\beta$ Cephei variable $\theta$ Ophiuchi. {\bf We call these studies {\it
complex asteroseismology} because our goal is to reproduce both pulsational
frequencies as well as corresponding values of a complex, nonadiabatic
parameter, $f$, defined by the radiative flux perturbation.} To this end, we
apply the method of simultaneous determination of the spherical harmonic
degree, $\ell$, of excited pulsational mode and the corresponding nonadiabatic
$f$ parameter from combined multicolour photometry and radial velocity data.
Using both the OP and OPAL opacity data, we find a family of seismic models
which reproduce the radial and dipole centroid mode frequencies, as well as the
$f$ parameter associated with the radial mode. Adding the nonadiabatic
parameter to seismic modelling of the B-type main sequence pulsators yields
very strong constraints on stellar opacities. In particular, only with one
source of opacities it is possible to agree the empirical values of $f$ with
their theoretical counterparts. Our results for $\theta$ Oph point
substantially to preference for the OPAL data.
