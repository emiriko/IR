A holomorphic line bundle on a complex manifold is said to be power generated
when every positive integer m satisfies that any holomorphic section for the
m-th tensor power of the bundle is the m-th tensor power of some holomorphic
section for the bundle. A power generated holomorphic line bundle is very ample
if it is ample. A holomorphic line bundle is power generated if the base
manifold is paracompact and simply connected. As an application, it is obtained
that any Fano complex-contact manifold is biholomorphic to some kaehlerian
C-space of Boothby type, and that any positive quaternion-kaehler manifold is
equivalent to some Wolf space.
