We consider the full Boltzmann equations for standard and soft leptogenesis,
instead of the usual integrated Boltzmann equations which assume kinetic
equilibrium for all species. Decays and inverse decays may be inefficient for
thermalising the heavy-(s)neutrino distribution function, leading to
significant deviations from kinetic equilibrium. We analyse the impact of using
the full kinetic equations in the case of a previously generated lepton
asymmetry, and find that the washout of this initial asymmetry due to the
interactions of the right-handed neutrino is larger than when calculated via
the integrated equations. We also solve the full Boltzmann equations for soft
leptogenesis, where the lepton asymmetry induced by the soft SUSY-breaking
terms in sneutrino decays is a purely thermal effect, since at T=0 the
asymmetry in leptons cancels the one in sleptons. In this case, we obtain that
in the weak washout regime (K ~< 1) the final lepton asymmetry can change up to
a factor four with respect to previous estimates.
