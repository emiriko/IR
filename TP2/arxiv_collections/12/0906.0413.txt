A Schottky group in PSL(2, C) induces an open hyperbolic handlebody and its
ideal boundary is a closed orientable surface S whose genus is equal to the
rank of the Schottky group. This boundary surface is equipped with a (complex)
projective structure and its holonomy representation is an epimorphism from
pi_1(S) to the Schottky group. We will show that an arbitrary projective
structure with the same holonomy representation is obtained by (2 pi-)grafting
the basic structure described above.
