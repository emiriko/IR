We introduce a concept of the Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer by inserting a
cavity exhibiting Fano resonance into a conventional interferometer. By
employing the scattering-matrix approach, we demonstrate that the transmission
is sensitive to a position of the cavity such that an asymmetric structure
exhibits a series of narrow resonances with almost perfect reflection. We
discuss how to implement this novel geometry in two-dimensional photonic
crystals and use direct numerical simulations to demonstrate novel regimes of
the resonant transmission and reflection.
