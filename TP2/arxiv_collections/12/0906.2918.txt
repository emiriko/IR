The Cauchy problem of the vacuum Einstein's equations aims to find a
semi-metric $g_{\alpha\beta}$ of a spacetime with vanishing Ricci curvature
$R_{\alpha,\beta}$ and prescribed initial data. Under the harmonic gauge
condition, the equations $R_{\alpha,\beta}=0$ are transferred into a system of
quasi-linear wave equations which are called the reduced Einstein equations.
The initial data for Einstein's equations are a proper Riemannian metric
$h_{ab}$ and a second fundamental form $K_{ab}$. A necessary condition for the
reduced Einstein equation to satisfy the vacuum equations is that the initial
data satisfy Einstein constraint equations. Hence the data $(h_{ab},K_{ab})$
cannot serve as initial data for the reduced Einstein equations.
  Previous results in the case of asymptotically flat spacetimes provide a
solution to the constraint equations in one type of Sobolev spaces, while
initial data for the evolution equations belong to a different type of Sobolev
spaces. The goal of our work is to resolve this incompatibility and to show
that under the harmonic gauge the vacuum Einstein equations are well-posed in
one type of Sobolev spaces.
