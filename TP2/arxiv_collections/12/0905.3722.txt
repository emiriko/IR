We propose and analyze a scheme to interface individual neutral atoms with
nanoscale solid-state systems. The interface is enabled by optically trapping
the atom via the strong near-field generated by a sharp metallic nanotip. We
show that under realistic conditions, a neutral atom can be trapped with
position uncertainties of just a few nanometers, and within tens of nanometers
of other surfaces. Simultaneously, the guided surface plasmon modes of the
nanotip allow the atom to be optically manipulated, or for fluorescence photons
to be collected, with very high efficiency. Finally, we analyze the surface
forces and heating and decoherence rates acting on the trapped atom.
