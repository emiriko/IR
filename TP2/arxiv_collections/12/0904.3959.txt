We show how to produce algorithmically gravity solutions in massive IIA (as
infinitesimal first order perturbations in the Romans mass parameter) dual to
assigned conformal field theories. We illustrate the procedure on a family of
Chern--Simons--matter conformal field theories that we recently obtained from
the N=6 theory by waiving the condition that the levels sum up to zero.
