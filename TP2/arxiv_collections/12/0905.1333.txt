We consider the capture of dark matter in the Sun by inelastic scattering
against nuclei as in the inelastic dark matter scenario. We show that, assuming
a WIMP-nucleon cross-section of \sigma_n = 10^{-40}\cm^2 the resulting capture
rate and density are sufficiently high so that current bounds on the muon
neutrino flux from the Sun rule out any appreciable annihilation branching
ratio of WIMPs into W^+W^-, Z^0Z^0, \tau^+\tau^-, t\bar{t} and neutrinos.
Slightly weaker bounds are also available for annihilations into b\bar{b} and
c\bar{c}. Annihilations into lighter particles that may produce neutrinos, such
as \mu^+\mu^-, pions and kaons are unconstrained since those stop in the Sun
before decaying. Interestingly enough, this is consistent with some recent
proposals motivated by the PAMELA results for the annihilation of WIMPs into
light bosons which subsequently decay predominantly into light leptons and
pions.
