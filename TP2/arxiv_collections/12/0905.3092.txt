We have measured near normal incidence far infrared (FIR) reflectivity
spectra of a single crystal of TbMnO3 from 10K to 300K in the spectral range of
50 cm$^{-1}$ to 700 cm$^{-1}$. Fifteen transverse optic (TO) and longitudinal
optic (LO) modes are identified in the imaginary part of the dielectric
function $\epsilon_2$($\omega$) and energy loss function
Im(-1/$\epsilon$($\omega$)), respectively. Some of the observed phonon modes
show anomalous softening below the magnetic transition temperature T$_N$ (~
46K). We attribute this anomalous softening to the spin-phonon coupling caused
by phonon modulation of the super-exchange integral between the Mn$^{3+}$
spins. The effective charge of oxygen (Z$_O$) calculated using the measured
LO-TO splitting increases below T$_N$.
