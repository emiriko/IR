Depositions of amorphous Lennard-Jones clusters on a crystalline surface are
numerically investigated. From the results of the molecular dynamics
simulation, we found that the deposited clusters exhibit a transition from
multilayered adsorption to monolayered adsorption at a critical incident speed.
Employing the energy conservation law, we can explain the behavior of the ratio
of the number of atoms adsorbed on the substrate to the cluster size. The
boundary shape of the deposited cluster depends strongly on the incident speed
and some unstable modes grow during the spread of the deposited cluster on the
substrate. We also discuss the wettability between different Lennard-Jones
atoms.
