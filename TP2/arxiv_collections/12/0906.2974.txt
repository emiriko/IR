We investigated the in-plane angular magnetoresistivity (AMR) of $%
T^{^{\prime}}$-phase La$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (LCCO) thin films ($%
x=0.06-0.15$) fabricated by a pulsed laser deposition technique. The in-plane
AMR with $\mathbf{H}\parallel ab$ shows a twofold symmetry instead of the
fourfold behavior found in other electron-doped cuprates such as Pr$%
_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ and Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$. The twofold AMR
disappears above a certain temperature, $T_{D}$. The $T_{D}(x)$ is well above
$T_{c}(x)$ for $x=0.06$ ($\sim 110$ K), and decreases with increasing doping,
until it is no longer observed above $T_{c}(x)$ at $x=0.15$. This twofold AMR
below $T_{D}(x)$ is suggested to originate from an antiferromagnetic or spin
density wave order.
