The relationship between the operator norms of fractional integral operators
acting on weighted Lebesgue spaces and the constant of the weights is
investigated. Sharp boundsare obtained for both the fractional integral
operators and the associated fractional maximal functions. As an application
improved Sobolev inequalities are obtained. Some of the techniques used include
a sharp off-diagonal version of the extrapolation theorem of Rubio de Francia
and characterizations of two-weight norm inequalities.
