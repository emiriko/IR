In this paper, we investigate the ground state properties of the
$\rm{RMnO}_3/\rm{AMnO}_3$ ($\rm{RMO/AMO}$) heterostructures (R=trivalent
cation, and A=divalent cation) by using a two-orbital double-exchange model
supplemented by the Poisson's equation. We find that the state stabilized near
the interface of the heterostructure is similar to the state of the bulk
compound $\rm{(R,A)MO}$ at electronic density close to 0.5. Depending on the
bandwidth it will be a charge and orbital ordered CE state or an A-AF state
with $x^2-y^2$ orbital order. Our results can explain some properties of
long-period superlattices. As another interesting result, we find exotic
intermediate states stabilized in between the interface and the bulk-like
regimes of the heterostructure. For instance, a spin "canted CE" state and
others. They may not have an analog in experimentally known bulk phase
diagrams, but provide a natural interpolation between magnetically-ordered
states that are stable in the bulk at different electronic densities.
