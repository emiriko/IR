Astronomical observation of stellar rotation suggests that at least the
surface layers of the Sun have lost a substantial amount of the angular
momentum that they possessed at the beginning of the main-sequence phase of
evolution; and solar-wind observations indicate that magnetic coupling is still
draining angular momentum from the Sun today. In addition, helioseismological
analysis has shown that the specific angular momentum at the top of the almost
uniformly rotating radiative interior is approximately (although not exactly)
the same as the spherically averaged value at the base of the (differentially
rotating) convection zone, suggesting that angular momentum is being
transported through the tachocline. The mechanism by which that transport is
taking place is not understood. Nor is there a consensus of opinion. I review
some of the suggestions that have been put forward, biassing my discussion, no
doubt, according to my own opinions.
