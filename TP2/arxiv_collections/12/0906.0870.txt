A p-group is called powerful if every commutator is a product of pth powers
when p is odd and a product of fourth powers when p=2. In the group algebra of
a group G of p-power order over a finite field of characteristic p, the group
of normalized units is always a p-group. We prove that it is never powerful
except, of course, when G is abelian.
