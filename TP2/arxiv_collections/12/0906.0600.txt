Explicit generators are found for the group $G_2$ of automorphisms of the
algebra $\mS_2$ of one-sided inverses of a polynomial algebra in two variables
over a field of characteristic zero. Moreover, it is proved that $$ G_2\simeq
S_2\ltimes \mT^2\ltimes \Z\ltimes ((K^*\ltimes E_\infty
(\mS_1))\boxtimes_{\GL_\infty (K)}(K^*\ltimes E_\infty (\mS_1)))$$ where $S_2$
is the symmetric group, $\mT^2$ is the 2-dimensional torus, $E_\infty (\mS_1)$
is the subgroup of $\GL_\infty (\mS_1)$ generated by the elementary matrices.
In the proof, we use and prove several results on the index of operators, and
the final argument in the proof is the fact that ${\rm K}_1 (\mS_1) \simeq K^*$
proved in the paper. The algebras $\mS_1$ and $\mS_2$ are noncommutative,
non-Noetherian, and not domains. The group of units of the algebra $\mS_2$ is
found (it is huge).
