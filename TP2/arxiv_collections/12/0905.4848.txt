The electric dipole response of $^{140}$Ce is investigated using the fully
consistent relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation. By analyzing
the isospin structure of the E1 response, it is shown that the low-energy
(pygmy) strength separates into two segments with different isospin character.
The more pronounced pygmy structure at lower energy is composed of
predominantly isoscalar states with surface-peaked transition densities. At
somewhat higher energy the calculated E1 strength is primarily of isovector
character, as expected for the low-energy tail of the giant dipole resonance.
The results are in qualitative agreement with those obtained in recent
$(\gamma,\gamma')$ and $(\alpha,\alpha'\gamma)$ experiments, and provide a
simple explanation for the splitting of low-energy E1 strength into two groups
of states with different isospin structure and radial dependence of the
corresponding transition densities.
