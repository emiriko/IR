Variational data assimilation technique applied to the identification of the
optimal discretization of interpolation operators and derivatives in the nodes
adjacent to the boundary of the domain is discussed in frames of the linear
shallow water model. The advantage of controlling the discretization of
operators near boundary rather than boundary conditions is shown. Assimilating
data produced by the same model on a finer grid in a model on a coarse grid, we
have shown that optimal discretization allows us to correct such errors of the
numerical scheme as under-resolved boundary layer and wrong wave velocity.
