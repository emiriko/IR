We argue that the recent BaBar data on $\gamma \to \pi$ e.m. transition form
factor at large photon virtuality supports the idea that pion distribution
amplitude (DA) is close to unity with $\phi_\pi^\prime(0)/6\gg 1$ at a
normalization point of $\mu=0.6\div 0.8$ GeV. Such pion DA can be obtained in
the effective chiral quark model. The possible flat shape of the pion DA
implies that the standard expansion of the DA in Gegenbauer polynomials can be
divergent.
  On basis of chiral models we predict that the two-pion DA should exhibit
anomalous endpoint behaviour for pions in the S-wave and that such feature is
absent for higher partial waves. The latter implies that the $\rho, f_2$, etc.
meson DAs have no anomalous endpoint behaviour. Possible implications of such
pion DA for other hard exclusive processes are shortly discussed.
