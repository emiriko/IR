In 1977, Baillon and Haddad proved that if the gradient of a convex and
continuously differentiable function is nonexpansive, then it is actually
firmly nonexpansive. This result, which has become known as the Baillon-Haddad
theorem, has found many applications in optimization and numerical functional
analysis. In this note, we propose short alternative proofs of this result and
strengthen its conclusion.
