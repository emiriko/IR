We present a mathematical proof of theoretical predictions made by Arguin and
Saint-Aubin, as well as by Bauer, Bernard, and Kytola, about certain non-local
observables for the two-dimensional Ising model at criticality by combining
Smirnov's recent proof of the fact that the scaling limit of critical Ising
interfaces can be described by chordal SLE(3) with Kozdron and Lawler's
configurational measure on mutually avoiding chordal SLE paths. As an extension
of this result, we also compute the probability that an SLE(k) path, k in
(0,4], and a Brownian motion excursion do not intersect.
