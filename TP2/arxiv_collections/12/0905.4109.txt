A comparative measurement of timing properties of magnetic-resistant fine
mesh R7761-70 and ordinary fast R2083 photomultipliers is presented together
with preliminary results on the operation of R7761-70 PMs in magnetic field up
to 1100 Gauss. The results were obtained using the proton beam of the MC50
Cyclotron of Korea Institute of Radilogical and Medical Sciences.
  The ratio of the effective R7761-70 and R2083 TOF (or timing) resolutions was
extracted by using two different methods. The results are $1.05\pm 0.066$ and
$1.07\pm 0.062$. The gain of R7761-70 PMs is not affected by magnetic field.
The R7761-70 TOF/timing resolution becomes $\sim 8%$ better at 1100 Gauss if
the external field is oriented parallel to the PM axis. The results prove the
advantages of the design of the CLAS12 Central Time-of-flight system with
fine-mesh photomultipliers in comparison with the "conservative" design based
on ordinary R2083 PMs and long bent light guides.
