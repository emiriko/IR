We have theoretically studied propagation of exciton-polaritons in
deterministic aperiodic multiple-quantum-well structures, particularly, in the
Fibonacci and Thue-Morse chains. The attention is concentrated on the
structures tuned to the resonant Bragg condition with two-dimensional
quantum-well exciton. The superradiant or photonic-quasicrystal regimes are
realized in these structures depending on the number of the wells. The
developed theory based on the two-wave approximation allows one to describe
analytically the exact transfer-matrix computations for transmittance and
reflectance spectra in the whole frequency range except for a narrow region
near the exciton resonance. In this region the optical spectra and the
exciton-polariton dispersion demonstrate scaling invariance and self-similarity
which can be interpreted in terms of the ``band-edge'' cycle of the trace map,
in the case of Fibonacci structures, and in terms of zero reflection
frequencies, in the case of Thue-Morse structures.
