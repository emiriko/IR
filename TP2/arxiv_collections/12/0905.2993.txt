We consider the family of two-sided Bernoulli initial conditions for TASEP
which, as the left and right densities ($\rho_-,\rho_+$) are varied, give rise
to shock waves and rarefaction fans---the two phenomena which are typical to
TASEP. We provide a proof of Conjecture 7.1 of [Progr. Probab. 51 (2002)
185--204] which characterizes the order of and scaling functions for the
fluctuations of the height function of two-sided TASEP in terms of the two
densities $\rho_-,\rho_+$ and the speed $y$ around which the height is
observed. In proving this theorem for TASEP, we also prove a fluctuation
theorem for a class of corner growth processes with external sources, or
equivalently for the last passage time in a directed last passage percolation
model with two-sided boundary conditions: $\rho_-$ and $1-\rho_+$. We provide a
complete characterization of the order of and the scaling functions for the
fluctuations of this model's last passage time $L(N,M)$ as a function of three
parameters: the two boundary/source rates $\rho_-$ and $1-\rho_+$, and the
scaling ratio $\gamma^2=M/N$. The proof of this theorem draws on the results of
[Comm. Math. Phys. 265 (2006) 1--44] and extensively on the work of [Ann.
Probab. 33 (2005) 1643--1697] on finite rank perturbations of Wishart ensembles
in random matrix theory.
