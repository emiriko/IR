Arguments based on general principles of quantum mechanics suggest that a
minimum length or time associated with Planck-scale unification may entail a
new kind of observable uncertainty in the transverse position of
macroscopically separated bodies. Transverse positions vary randomly about
classical geodesics in space and time by about the geometric mean of the Planck
scale and separation, on a timescale corresponding to their separation. An
effective theory based on a Planck information flux limit, and normalized by
the black hole entropy formula, is developed to predict measurable
correlations, such as the statistical properties of noise in interferometer
signals. A connection with holographic unification is illustrated by
representing Matrix theory position operators with a Schr\"odinger wave
equation, interpreted as a paraxial wave equation with a Planck frequency
carrier. Solutions of this equation are used to derive formulas for the
spectrum of beamsplitter position fluctuations and equivalent strain noise in a
Michelson interferometer, determined by the Planck time, with no other
parameters. The spectral amplitude of equivalent strain derived here is a
factor of \sqrt{\pi} smaller than previously published estimates. Signals in
two nearly-collocated interferometers are predicted to be highly correlated, a
feature that may provide convincing evidence for or against this interpretation
of holography.
