The recent report by the PAMELA team of the observed rise in the cosmic-ray
positron fraction above a few GeV and the report of an excess of cosmic-ray
electrons around a few hundred GeV by the ATIC collaboration has resulted in a
flurry of publications interpreting these observations either as a possible
signature from the decay of dark matter or as a contribution from isolated
astrophysical sources. While those interpretations are scientifically exciting,
the possibility that measurements are contaminated by misidentified cosmic ray
protons can not be ignored.
