We revisit the Faulkner construction of metric 3-Leibniz algebras admitting
an embedding Lie (super)algebra. In the case of positive-definite signature, we
relate the various notions of simplicity: of the 3-algebra, of the
representation and of the embedding Lie (super)algebra. This reduces their
classification to the extant classifications of simple Lie (super)algebras.
