The electric dipole polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities for the
lithium isotopes $^6$Li and $^7$Li in the ground state $2^2S$ and the excited
states $2^2P$ and $3^2D$, as well as the leading resonance and dispersion
long-range coefficients for the Li($2^2S$)--Li($2^2S$) and
Li($2^2S$)--Li($2^2P$) systems, are calculated nonrelativistically using
variational wave functions in Hylleraas basis sets. Comparisons are made with
published results, where available. We find that the value of the second
hyperpolarizability of the $2^2S$ state is sensitive to the isotopic mass due
to a near cancellation between two terms. For the $3^2D$ state polarizability
tensor the calculated components disagree with those measured in the sole
experiment and with those calculated semi-empirically.
