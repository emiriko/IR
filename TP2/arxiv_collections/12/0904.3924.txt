Employing oval shaped quantum billiards connected by quantum wires as the
building blocks of a linear quantum dot array, we calculate the ballistic
magnetoconductance in the linear response regime. Optimizing the geometry of
the billiards, we aim at a maximal finite- over zero-field ratio of the
magnetoconductance. This switching effect arises from a relative phase change
of scattering states in the oval quantum dot through the applied magnetic
field, which lifts a suppression of the transmission characteristic for a
certain range of geometry parameters. It is shown that a sustainable switching
ratio is reached for a very low field strength, which is multiplied by
connecting only a second dot to the single one. The impact of disorder is
addressed in the form of remote impurity scattering, which poses a temperature
dependent lower bound for the switching ratio, showing that this effect should
be readily observable in experiments.
