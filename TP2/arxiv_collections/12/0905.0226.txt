For binary mixtures of fluids without chemical reactions, but with components
having different temperatures, the Hamilton principle of least action is able
to produce the equation of motion for each component and a balance equation of
the total heat exchange between components. In this nonconservative case, a
Gibbs dynamical identity connecting the equations of momenta, masses, energy
and heat exchange allows to deduce the balance equation of energy of the
mixture. Due to the unknown exchange of heat between components, the number of
obtained equations is less than the number of field variables. The second law
of thermodynamics constrains the possible expression of a supplementary
constitutive equation closing the system of equations. The exchange of energy
between components produces an increasing rate of entropy and creates a
dynamical pressure term associated with the difference of temperature between
components. This new dynamical pressure term fits with the results obtained by
classical thermodynamical arguments and confirms that the Hamilton principle
can afford to obtain the equations of motions for multi-temperature mixtures of
fluids.
