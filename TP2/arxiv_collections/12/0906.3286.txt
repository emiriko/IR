We review the concept of the number wall as an alternative to the traditional
linear complexity profile (LCP), and sketch the relationship to other topics
such as linear feedback shift-register (LFSR) and context-free Lindenmayer
(D0L) sequences. A remarkable ternary analogue of the Thue-Morse sequence is
introduced having deficiency 2 modulo 3, and this property verified via the
re-interpretation of the number wall as an aperiodic plane tiling.
