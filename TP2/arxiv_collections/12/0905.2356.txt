We give a short introduction to the Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT) and
its generalization to Fractional powers -- FAPT. We describe how to treat
heavy-quark thresholds in FAPT and then show how to resum perturbative series
in both the one-loop APT and FAPT. As an application we consider FAPT
description of the Higgs boson decay $H^0\to b\bar{b}$.
