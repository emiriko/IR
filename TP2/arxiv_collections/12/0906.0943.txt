Using the Ehrenfest urn model we illustrate the subtleties of error
estimation in Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss how the smooth results of
correlated sampling in Markov chains can fool one's perception of the accuracy
of the data, and show (via numerical and analytical methods) how to obtain
reliable error estimates from correlated samples.
