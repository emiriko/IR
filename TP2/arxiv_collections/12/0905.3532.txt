We formulate Horava-Lifshitz cosmology with an additional scalar field that
leads to an effective dark energy sector. We find that, due to the inherited
features from the gravitational background, Horava-Lifshitz dark energy
naturally presents very interesting behaviors, possessing a varying
equation-of-state parameter, exhibiting phantom behavior and allowing for a
realization of the phantom divide crossing. In addition, Horava-Lifshitz dark
energy guarantees for a bounce at small scale factors and it may trigger the
turnaround at large scale factors, leading naturally to cyclic cosmology.
