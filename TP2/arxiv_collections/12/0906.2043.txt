In this paper, we establish sharp inequalities for four kinds of classical
eigenvalues on a bounded domain of a Riemannian manifold. We also establish
asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues of the buckling and clamped plate
problems. In addition, we give a negative answer to the Payne conjecture for
the one-dimensional case.
