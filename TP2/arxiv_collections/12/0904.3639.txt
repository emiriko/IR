In the theory of the Dirac equation and in the standard model, the neutrino
is massless. Both these theories use Lorentz invariance. In modern approaches
however, spacetime is no longer smooth, and this modifies special relativity.
We show how such a modification throws up the mass of the (electron) neutrino.
