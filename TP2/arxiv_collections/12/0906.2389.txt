In a recent Letter, Serbyn et al. [A] investigated thermomagnetic effects
above the superconducting transition and generalized previous works for
arbitrary magnetic fields and temperatures. While the results of [A] have been
confirmed in [B], we have strong objections: (i) According to our results [C],
the linear response calculation does not require any correction from the
magnetization currents; (ii) The result of [A,B] is giant, because unlike the
normal Fermi liquid, it is of zero order in the particle-hole asymmetry.
Changing the interaction constant in the Cooper channel leads to ridiculously
large results even for nonsuperconducting metals; (iii)Derived in [A] the
Einstein-type relation for thermomagnetic coefficient contradicts to text-book
results.
