The differential and total cross sections for the d+p->3He+eta reaction have
been measured at COSY-ANKE at excess energies of 19.5, 39.4, and 59.4 MeV over
the full angular range. The results are in line with trends apparent from the
detailed near-threshold studies and also agree with those from CELSIUS, though
the present data have higher precision. While at 19.5 MeV the results can be
described in terms of s- and p-wave production, by 59.4 MeV higher partial
waves are required. Including the 19.5 MeV point together with the
near-threshold data in a global s- and p-wave fit gives a poorer overall
description of the data though the position of the pole in the 3He scattering
amplitude, corresponding to the quasi-bound or virtual state, is hardly
changed.
