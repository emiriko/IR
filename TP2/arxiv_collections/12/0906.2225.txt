We present numerical solutions of the semi-classical Boltzmann-Vlasov
equation for fermion particle-antiparticle production by strong electric fields
in boost-invariant coordinates in (1+1) and (3+1) dimensional QED. We compare
the Boltzmann-Vlasov results with those of recent quantum field theory
calculations and find good agreement. We conclude that extending the
Boltzmann-Vlasov approach to the case of QCD should allow us to do a thorough
investigation of how back-reaction affects recent results on the dependence of
the transverse momentum distribution of quarks and anti-quarks on a second
Casimir invariant of color SU(3).
