In a recent paper, Alfonsi, Fruth and Schied (AFS) propose a simple order
book based model for the impact of large orders on stock prices. They use this
model to derive optimal strategies for the execution of large orders. We apply
these strategies to an agent-based stochastic order book model that was
recently proposed by Bovier, \v{C}ern\'{y} and Hryniv, but already the
calibration fails. In particular, from our simulations the recovery speed of
the market after a large order is clearly dependent on the order size, whereas
the AFS model assumes a constant speed. For this reason, we propose a
generalization of the AFS model, the GAFS model, that incorporates this
dependency, and prove the optimal investment strategies. As a corollary, we
find that we can derive the ``correct'' constant resilience speed for the AFS
model from the GAFS model such that the optimal strategies of the AFS and the
GAFS model coincide. Finally, we show that the costs of applying the optimal
strategies of the GAFS model to the artificial market environment still differ
significantly from the model predictions, indicating that even the improved
model does not capture all of the relevant details of a real market.
