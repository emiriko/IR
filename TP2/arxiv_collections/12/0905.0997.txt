During the last two decades Alain Connes developed Noncommutative Geometry
(NCG), which allows to unify two of the basic theories of modern physics:
General Relativity (GR) and the Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics as
classical field theories. In the noncommutative framework the Higgs boson,
which had previously to be put in by hand, and many of the ad hoc features of
the standard model appear in a natural way.
  The aim of this presentation is to motivate this unification from basic
physical principles and to give a flavour of its derivation. One basic
prediction of the noncommutative approach to the SM is that the mass of the
Higgs Boson should be of the order of 170 GeV if one assumes the Big Desert.
This mass range is with reasonable probability excluded by the Tevatron and
therefore it is interesting to investigate models beyond the SM that are
compatible with NCG. Going beyond the SM is highly non-trivial within the NCG
approach but possible extensions have been found and provide for
phenomenologically interesting models. We will present in this article a short
introduction into the NCG framework and describe one of these extensions of the
SM. This model contains new scalar bosons (and fermions) which constitute a
second Higgs-like sector mixing with theordinary Higgs sector and thus
considerably modifying the mass eigenvalues.
