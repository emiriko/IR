We report on spin valve devices that incorporate both an out-of-plane
polarizer (OPP) to quickly excite spin torque (ST) switching and an in-plane
polarizer/analyzer (IPP). For pulses < 200 ps we observe reliable precessional
switching due largely to ST from the OPP. Compared to a conventional spin
valve, for a given current in the short pulse regime the addition of the OPP
can decrease the pulse width necessary for switching by a factor of 10 or more.
The influence of the IPP is most obvious at longer, smaller pulses, but also
has beneficial ST consequences for short pulse switching.
