An explicit lattice realization of a non-Abelian topological memory is
presented. The correspondence between logical and physical states is seen
directly by use of the stabilizer formalism. The resilience of the encoded
states against errors is studied and compared to that of other memories. A set
of non-topological operations are proposed to manipulate the encoded states,
resulting in universal quantum computation. This work provides insight into the
non-local encoding non-Abelian anyons provide at the microscopical level, with
an operational characterization of the memories they provide.
