The evolution of a probe D-brane in the p-brane background has been
considered. The anisotropic evolution of the world-volume of the D-brane with a
given topology of a world-volume in a form of a direct product of a
n-dimensional flat space and (3-n)-dimensional sphere has been obtained. In
this case the anisotropy is described with the aid of two parameters (Hubble
parameters). The special case of this evolution, namely the isotropic evolution
corresponds to equality of these two parameters. In the latter case the masses
and charges of the background p-branes have been derived.
