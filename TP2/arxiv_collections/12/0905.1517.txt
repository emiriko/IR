Photon Astronomy ruled the last four centuries while wider photon band ruled
last radio-X-Gamma century of discovery. Present decade may see the rise and
competition of UHECR and UHE Neutrino Astronomy. Tau Neutrino may win and be
the first flavor revealed. It could soon rise at horizons in AUGER at EeV
energies, if nucleons are the main UHECR currier. If on the contrary UHECR are
Lightest nuclei (He, Li. B) UHE tau neutrino maybe suppressed at EeV and
enhanced at tens -hundred PeV. Detectable in AMIGA and HEAT denser sub-array in
AUGER. Within a few years.
