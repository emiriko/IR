We detail an innovative new technique for measuring the 2-D velocity moments
(rotation velocity, velocity dispersion and Gauss-Hermite coefficients h$_3$
and h$_4$) of the stellar populations of galaxy halos using spectra from Keck
DEIMOS multi-object spectroscopic observations. The data are used to
reconstruct 2-D rotation velocity maps.
  Here we present data for five nearby early-type galaxies to ~3 effective
radii. We provide significant insights into the global kinematic structure of
these galaxies, and challenge the accepted morphological classification in
several cases. We show that between 1-3 effective radii the velocity dispersion
declines very slowly, if at all, in all five galaxies. For the two galaxies
with velocity dispersion profiles available from planetary nebulae data we find
very good agreement with our stellar profiles. We find a variety of rotation
profiles beyond 1 effective radius, i.e rotation speed remaining constant,
decreasing \emph{and} increasing with radius. These results are of particular
importance to studies which attempt to classify galaxies by their kinematic
structure within one effective radius, such as the recent definition of fast-
and slow- rotator classes by the SAURON project. Our data suggests that the
rotator class may change when larger galacto-centric radii are probed. This has
important implications for dynamical modeling of early-type galaxies. The data
from this study are available on-line.
