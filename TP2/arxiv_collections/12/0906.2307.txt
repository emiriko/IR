We conducted a qualitative user study with 77 consumers to investigate what
social aspects are relevant when supporting customers during their shopping
activities and particularly in situations when they are undecided. Twenty-five
respondents (32%) reported seeking extra information on web pages and forums,
in addition to asking their peers for advice (related to the nature of the item
to be bought). Moreover, from the remaining 52 subjects, only 6 (8%) were
confident enough to make prompt comparisons between items and an immediate
purchasing choice, while 17 respondents (22%) expressed the need for being away
from persuasive elements. The remaining 29 respondents (38%) reported having a
suboptimal strategy for making their shopping decisions (i.e. buying all items,
not buying, or choosing randomly). Therefore, the majority of our participants
(70% = 32% + 38%) had social and information needs when making purchasing
decisions. This result motivates the development of applications that would
allow consumers to ask shopping questions to their social network while
on-the-go.
