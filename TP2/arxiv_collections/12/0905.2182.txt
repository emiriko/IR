Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics is discussed in the
context of other physics disputes and other proposed kinds of parallel
universes. We find that only a small fraction of the usual objections to
Everett's theory are specific to quantum mechanics, and that all of the most
controversial issues crop up also in settings that have nothing to do with
quantum mechanics.
