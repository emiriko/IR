Recent experimental results demonstrated the generation of a quantum
superpositon (MQS), involving a number of photons in excess of 5x10^4, which
showed a high resilience to losses. In order to perform a complete analysis on
the effects of de-coherence on this multiphoton fields, obtained through the
Quantum Injected Optical Parametric Amplifier (QIOPA), we invesigate
theoretically the evolution of the Wigner functions associated to these states
in lossy conditions. Recognizing the presence of negative regions in the
W-representation as an evidence of non-classicality, we focus our analysis on
this feature. A close comparison with the MQS based on coherent states allows
to identify differences and analogies.
