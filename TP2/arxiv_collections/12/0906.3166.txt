The usual transformations (UT) of the 3-vectors E and B that are found by
Lorentz, Poincar\'{e} and independently by Einstein in 1905. are generally
considered to be the Lorentz transformations (LT) of E and B. According to the
UT E in one frame is 'seen' as E' and B' in a relatively moving frame. In
Minkowski's last paper, in 1908. in section 11.6, he defined the vectors (with
four components) of the electric $\Phi $ and magnetic $\Psi $ fields and
discovered that, e.g., $\Phi $ correctly transforms by the LT again to $\Phi
^{\prime}$. His correct LT are reinvented in, e.g., [11] ([11] Ivezi\'{c} T
2005 Found. Phys. Lett. 18 301). In this paper we show the essential similarity
and some differences between Minkowski's relations in section 11.6 and the
results obtained in [11]. The low-velocity limit of the UT and the LT is
briefly examined. A short discussion of the comparison with the Trouton-Noble
experiment is presented.
