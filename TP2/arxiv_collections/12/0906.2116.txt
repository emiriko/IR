In this work, we use inelastic scattering of light to study the response of
inhomogeneous Mott-insulator gases to external excitations. The experimental
setup and procedure to probe the atomic Mott states are presented in detail. We
discuss the link between the energy absorbed by the gases and accessible
experimental parameters as well as the linearity of the response to the
scattering of light. We investigate the excitations of the system in multiple
energy bands and a band-mapping technique allows us to identify band and
momentum of the excited atoms. In addition the momentum distribution in the
Mott states which is spread over the entire first Brillouin zone enables us to
reconstruct the dispersion relation in the high energy bands using a single
Bragg excitation with a fixed momentum transfer.
