We present results from our simulations of biopolymer translocation in a
solvent which explain the main experimental findings. The forced translocation
can be described by simple force balance arguments for the relevant range of
pore potentials in experiments and biological systems. Scaling of translocation
time with polymer length varies with pore force and friction. Hydrodynamics
affects this scaling and significantly reduces translocation times.
