In this work we use genetic algorithm to search for the gravitational wave
signal from the inspiralling massive Black Hole binaries in the simulated LISA
data. We consider a single signal in the Gaussian instrumental noise. This is a
first step in preparation for analysis of the third round of the mock LISA data
challenge. We have extended a genetic algorithm utilizing the properties of the
signal and the detector response function. The performance of this method is
comparable, if not better, to already existing algorithms.
