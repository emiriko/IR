We discuss and generalize multi-particle entanglement based on statistical
correlations using Ursell-Mayer type of cluster coefficients. Cluster
coefficients are used to distinguish different, independent entangled systems
as well as those which are connected through local unitary transformations. We
propose a genuinely and maximally entangled five-particle state for efficient
information processing. The physical realization of entangled states and
information processing protocols are analyzed using quantum gates and circuit
diagrams. We show that the direct as well as controlled communication can be
achieved using the state proposed here with certainty in the case of
teleportation and with a high degree of optimity in the case of dense coding.
In the case of dense coding the amount of information transferred from the
sender to the receiver is always a maximum irrespective of the measurement
basis used by the controller.
