We develop the necessary ingredients for the construction of realistic models
with warped universal extra dimensions. Our investigations are based on the
seven dimensional (7D) spacetime AdS_5 x T^2 and we derive the Kaluza-Klein
(KK) spectra for gravitons, bulk vectors and the TeV brane localized Higgs
boson. We show that, starting with a massive 7D fermion, one may obtain a
single chiral massless mode whose profile is readily localized towards the
Planck or TeV brane. This allows one to place the standard model fermions in
the bulk and construct models of flavor as in Randall-Sundrum models. Our
solution also admits the familiar KK parity of UED models so that the lightest
odd KK state is stable and may be a dark matter (DM) candidate. As an
additional feature the AdS_5 warping ensures that the excited modes on the
torus, including the DM candidate, appear at TeV energies (as is usually
assumed in UED models) even though the Planck scale sets the dimensions for the
torus.
