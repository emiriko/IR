In this talk we shall show a perfect fluid cosmological model and its
properties. The model possesses an orthogonally transitive abelian
two-dimensional group of isometries that corresponds to cylindrical symmetry.
The matter content is a stiff fluid that satisfies the energy and generic
conditions. The metric is not separable in comoving coordinates for the fluid.
The curvature invariants are shown to be regular everywhere in the coordinate
chart and also indicate that the spacetime is asymptotically flat. Furthermore
the causal geodesics are studied in order to determine that they are complete
and that the model is globally hyperbolic. The model goes through an initial
contracting epoch that is followed by an expanding era.
