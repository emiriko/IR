Let $L$ be the divergence form elliptic operator with complex bounded
measurable coefficients, $\omega$ the positive concave function on $(0,\infty)$
of strictly critical lower type $p_\oz\in (0, 1]$ and
$\rho(t)={t^{-1}}/\omega^{-1}(t^{-1})$ for $t\in (0,\infty).$ In this paper,
the authors study the Orlicz-Hardy space $H_{\omega,L}({\mathbb R}^n)$ and its
dual space $\mathrm{BMO}_{\rho,L^\ast}({\mathbb R}^n)$, where $L^\ast$ denotes
the adjoint operator of $L$ in $L^2({\mathbb R}^n)$. Several characterizations
of $H_{\omega,L}({\mathbb R}^n)$, including the molecular characterization, the
Lusin-area function characterization and the maximal function characterization,
are established. The $\rho$-Carleson measure characterization and the
John-Nirenberg inequality for the space $\mathrm{BMO}_{\rho,L}({\mathbb R}^n)$
are also given. As applications, the authors show that the Riesz transform
$\nabla L^{-1/2}$ and the Littlewood-Paley $g$-function $g_L$ map
$H_{\omega,L}({\mathbb R}^n)$ continuously into $L(\omega)$. The authors
further show that the Riesz transform $\nabla L^{-1/2}$ maps
$H_{\omega,L}({\mathbb R}^n)$ into the classical Orlicz-Hardy space
$H_{\omega}({\mathbb R}^n)$ for $p_\omega\in (\frac{n}{n+1},1]$ and the
corresponding fractional integral $L^{-\gamma}$ for certain $\gamma>0$ maps
$H_{\omega,L}({\mathbb R}^n)$ continuously into
$H_{\widetilde{\omega},L}({\mathbb R}^n)$, where $\widetilde{\omega}$ is
determined by $\omega$ and $\gamma$, and satisfies the same property as
$\omega$. All these results are new even when $\omega(t)=t^p$ for all $t\in
(0,\infty)$ and $p\in (0,1)$.
