We present XMM and Suzaku observations of the Broad-Line Radio Galaxy (BLRG)
3C390.3. The Fe Ka line has a width FWHM ~ 8,800 km/s, consistent within a
factor two with the width of the double-peaked H_alpha line, suggesting an
origin from the Broad Line Region. The data show for the first time a weak,
broad bump extending from 5 to 7 keV. When fitted with a Gaussian, its centroid
energy is 6.6 keV in the source's rest-frame with FWHM of 43,000 km/s and EW of
50 eV; its most likely interpretation is emission from He-like Fe (Fe XXV),
suggesting the presence of an ionized medium in the inner regions of 3C390.3.
The broad-band 0.5-100 keV continuum is well described by a single power law
with photon index Gamma=1.6 and cutoff energy 157 keV, plus cold reflection
with strength R=0.5. In addition, ionized reflection is required to account for
the 6.6 keV bump in the broad-band continuum, yielding an ionization parameter
xi ~ 2700 ergs cm s^-1; the inner radius of the ionized reflector is
constrained to be larger than 20 r_G, although this result depends on the
assumed emissivity profile of the disk. If true, we argue that the lack of
broad Fe K emission from within 20 r_G indicates that the innermost regions of
the disk in 3C390.3 are obscured and/or poorly illuminated. While the SED of
3C390.3 is generally dominated by accretion-related continuum, during accretion
low states the jet can significantly contribute in the optical to X-ray bands
via synchrotron self-Compton emission. (Abridged)
