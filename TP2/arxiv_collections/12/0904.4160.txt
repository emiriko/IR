We summarize the analytic model and numerical simulations of stochastically
forced planets in a turbulent disk presented in a recent paper by Rein and
Papaloizou. We identify two modes of libration in systems with planets in mean
motion resonance which react differently to random forces. The slow mode, which
mostly corresponds to motion of the angle between the apsidal lines of the two
planets, is converted to circulation more readily than the fast mode which is
associated with oscillations of the semi-major axes.
  We therefore conclude that stochastic forcing due to disk turbulence may have
played an important role in shaping the configuration of observed systems in
mean motion resonance. For example, it naturally provides a mechanism for
accounting for the HD128311 system for which the fast mode librates and the
slow mode does not.
