The configuration-fixed constrained triaxial relativistic mean-field approach
is extended by including time-odd fields and applied to study the candidate
multiple chiral doublets (MKiD) nucleus 106Rh. The energy contribution from
time-odd fields and microscopical evaluation of center-of-mass correction as
well as the modification of triaxial deformation parameters beta, gamma due to
the time-odd fields are investigated. The contributions of the time-odd fields
to the total energy are 0.1-0.3 MeV and they modify slightly the gamma values.
However, the previously predicted multiple chiral doublets still exist.
