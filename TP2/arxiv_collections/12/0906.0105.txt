The successful use of picosecond-pulse free-electron-laser (FEL) radiation
for the continuous-wave THz-range electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy
has been demonstrated. The combination of two linac-based FELs (covering the
wavelength range of 4 - 250 $\mu$m) with pulsed magnetic fields up to 70 T
allows for multi-frequency ESR spectroscopy in a frequency range of 1.2 - 75
THz with a spectral resolution better than 1%. The performance of the
spectrometer is illustrated with ESR spectra obtained in the
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and the low-dimensional organic material
(C$_6$H$_9$N$_2$)CuCl$_3$.
