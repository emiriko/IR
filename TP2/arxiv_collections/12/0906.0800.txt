We present simulated results of quasi-periodic flares generated by the
inelastic collisions of a star bound to a super-massive black hole (SMBH) and
its attendant accretion disc. We show that the behavior of the
quasi-periodicity is affected by the mass and spin of the black hole and the
orbital elements of the stellar orbit. We also evaluate the possibility of
extracting useful information on these parameters and verifying the character
of the Kerr metric from such quasi-periodic signals. Comparisons are made with
the observed optical outbursts of OJ287, infrared flares from the Galactic
center and X-ray variability in RE J1034+396.
