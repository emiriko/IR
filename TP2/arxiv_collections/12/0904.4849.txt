We revisit the discovery outburst of the X-ray transient XTE J1550-564 during
which relativistic jets were observed in 1998 September, and review the radio
images obtained with the Australian Long Baseline Array, and lightcurves
obtained with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the Australia
Telescope Compact Array. Based on HI spectra, we constrain the source distance
to between 3.3 and 4.9 kpc. The radio images, taken some two days apart, show
the evolution of an ejection event. The apparent separation velocity of the two
outermost ejecta is at least 1.3c and may be as large as 1.9c; when
relativistic effects are taken into account, the inferred true velocity is
>0.8c. The flux densities appear to peak simultaneously during the outburst,
with a rather flat (although still optically thin) spectral index of -0.2.
