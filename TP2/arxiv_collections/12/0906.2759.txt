We propose to search for new wave phenomena in the brain by using
interference effects in analogy to the well-known double slit (Young)
experiment. This method is able to extend the range of oscillation frequencies
to much higher values than currently accessible. It is argued that such
experiments may test the hypothesis of the wave nature of information coding.
