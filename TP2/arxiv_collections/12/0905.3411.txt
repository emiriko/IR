We have designed a threshold Cherenkov detector at the Rutherford-Appleton
Laboratory to identify muons with momenta between 230 and 350 MeV/c. We
investigated the properties of three aerogels for the design. The nominal
indexes of refraction were n = 1.03, 1.07, 1.12, respectively. Two of the
samples are of high density aerogel not commonly used for Cherenkov light
detection. We present results of an examination of some optical properties of
the aerogel samples and present basic test beam results.
