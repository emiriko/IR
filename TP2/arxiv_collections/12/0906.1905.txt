The auroras on Jupiter and Saturn can be studied with a high sensitivity and
resolution by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet (UV) and
far-ultraviolet (FUV) Space Telescope spectrograph (STIS) and Advanced Camera
for Surveys (ACS) instruments. We present results of automatic detection and
segmentation of Jupiter's auroral emissions as observed by HST ACS instrument
with VOronoi Image SEgmentation (VOISE). VOISE is a dynamic algorithm for
partitioning the underlying pixel grid of an image into regions according to a
prescribed homogeneity criterion. The algorithm consists of an iterative
procedure that dynamically constructs a tessellation of the image plane based
on a Voronoi Diagram, until the intensity of the underlying image within each
region is classified as homogeneous. The computed tessellations allow the
extraction of quantitative information about the auroral features such as mean
intensity, latitudinal and longitudinal extents and length scales. These
outputs thus represent a more automated and objective method of characterising
auroral emissions than manual inspection.
