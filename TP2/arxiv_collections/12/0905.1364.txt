For prime power $q=p^d$ and a field $F$ containing a root of unity of order
$q$ we show that the Galois cohomology ring $H^*(G_F,\dbZ/q)$ is determined by
a quotient $G_F^{[3]}$ of the absolute Galois group $G_F$ related to its
descending $q$-central sequence. Conversely, we show that $G_F^{[3]}$ is
determined by the lower cohomology of $G_F$. This is used to give new examples
of pro-$p$ groups which do not occur as absolute Galois groups of fields.
