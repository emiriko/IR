We investigate the stability of Bloch waves for a Bose-Einstein condensate
moving through a periodic lattice created by another condensate modulated by an
optical lattice. We show that the coupling of phonon-antiphonon modes of the
two species give rise to a very rich structure of the regimes for dynamical
instability, with significant differences with respect to the case of a single
condensate in an optical lattice. We characterize the relative weight of each
condensate in the mixing and discuss an analytic limit that accounts for the
bare structure of the instability diagrams.
