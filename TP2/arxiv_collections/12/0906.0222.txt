We have studied the \phi(1020)f_0(980) S-wave scattering at energies around
threshold employing chiral Lagrangians coupled to vector mesons through minimal
coupling. The interaction kernel is obtained by considering the f_0(980) as a
K\bar{K} bound state. The Y(2175) resonance is generated in this approach by
the self-interactions between the \phi(1020) and the f_0(980) resonances. We
are able to describe the e^+e^-\to \phi(1020)f_0(980) recent scattering data to
test experimentally our scattering amplitudes, concluding that the Y(2175)
resonance has a large \phi(1020)f_0(980) meson-meson component.
