Given a set of images, whose pixel values can be considered as the components
of a vector, it is interesting to estimate the modulus of such a vector in some
localised areas corresponding to a compact signal. For instance, the
detection/estimation of a polarized signal in compact sources immersed in a
background is relevant in some fields like astrophysics. We develop two
different techniques, one based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma, the Neyman-Pearson
filter (NPF), and another based on prefiltering-before-fusion, the filtered
fusion (FF), to deal with the problem of detection of the source and estimation
of the polarization given two or three images corresponding to the different
components of polarization (two for linear polarization, three including
circular polarization). For the case of linear polarization, we have performed
numerical simulations on two-dimensional patches to test these filters
following two different approaches (a blind and a non-blind detection),
considering extragalactic point sources immersed in cosmic microwave background
(CMB) and non-stationary noise with the conditions of the 70 GHz \emph{Planck}
channel. The FF outperforms the NPF, especially for low fluxes. We can detect
with the FF extragalactic sources in a high noise zone with fluxes >=
(0.42,0.36) Jy for (blind/non-blind) detection and in a low noise zone with
fluxes >= (0.22,0.18) Jy for (blind/non-blind) detection with low errors in the
estimated flux and position.
