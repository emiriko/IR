Superconductivity in the cuprate oxide is studied by Kondo-lattice theory
based on the t-J model with the el-ph interaction arising from the modulation
of the superexchange interaction by phonons. The self-energy of electrons is
decomposed into the single-site and multisite ones. It is proved by using the
mapping of the single-site one in the t-J model to its corresponding one in the
Anderson model that the single-site self-energy is that of a normal Fermi
liquid, even if a superconducting (SC) order parameter appears or the multisite
one is anomalous. The electron liquid characterized by the single-site
self-energy is a normal Fermi liquid. The Fermi liquid is further stabilized by
the RVB mechanism. The stabilized Fermi liquid is a relevant unperturbed state
that can be used to study superconductivity and anomalous Fermi-liquid
behaviors. The so-called spin-fluctuation-mediated exchange interaction, which
includes the superexchange interaction as a part, is the attractive interaction
that binds d-wave Cooper pairs. An analysis of the spin susceptibility implies
that, because of the el-ph interaction, the imaginary part of the exchange
interaction has a sharp peak or dip at \pm\omega^*, where \omega^*\simeq
\omega_ph in the normal state and \epsilon_G/2 \lessim \omega^* \lessim
\epsilon_G /2+ \omega_ph in the SC state, where \omega_ph is the energy of
relevant phonons and \epsilon_G is the SC gap. If the imaginary part has a
sharp peak or dip at \pm\omega^*, the dispersion relation of quasi-particles
has kink structures near \pm\omega^* above and below the chemical potential,
the density of states has dip-and-hump structures near \pm \omega^* outside the
coherence peaks in the SC state, and the anisotropy of the gap deviates from
the simple d-wave anisotropy.
