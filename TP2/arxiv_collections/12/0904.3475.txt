By conducting axisymmetrical hydrodynamical numerical simulations (2.5
dimensional code) we show that slow, massive, wide jets can reproduce the
morphology of the huge X-ray deficient bubble pair in the cluster of galaxies
MS0735+7421. The total energy of the jets, composed of the energy in the bubble
pair and in the shock wave, is constraint by observations conducted by McNamara
et al. (2009) to be ~10^{62}erg. We show that two opposite jets that are active
for ~100Myr, each with a launching half opening angle of ~70 degrees, an
initial velocity of ~0.1c, and a total mass loss rate of the two jets of ~100
Mo/year, can account for the observed morphology. Rapidly precessing narrow
jets can be used instead of wide jets. In our model the cluster suffered from a
cooling catastrophe ~100Myr ago. Most of the mass that cooled, ~10^{10} Mo, was
expelled back to the intracluster medium (ICM) by the AGN activity and is
inside the bubbles now, ~10% formed stars, and ~10% of the cold gas was
accreted by the central black hole and was the source of the outburst energy.
This type of activity is similar to that expected to occur in galaxy formation.
