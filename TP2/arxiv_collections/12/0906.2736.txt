We present an analysis of the FUSE spectra of eight high-declination dwarf
novae obtained from a Cycle 7 FUSE survey. These DN systems have not been
previously studied in the UV and little is known about their white dwarfs (WDs)
or accretion disks. We carry out the spectral analysis of the FUSE data using
synthetic spectra generated with the codes TLUSTY and SYNSPEC. For two faint
objects (AQ Men, V433 Ara) we can only assess a lower limit for the WD
temperature or mass accretion rate. NSV 10934 was caught in a quiescent state
and its spectrum is consistent with a low mass accretion rate disk. For 5
objects (HP Nor, DT Aps, AM Cas, FO Per and ES Dra) we obtain WD temperatures
between 34,000K and 40,000K and/or mass accretion rates consistent with
intermediate to outburst states. These temperatures reflect the heating of the
WD due to on-going accretion and are similar to the temperatures of other DNs
observed on the rise to, and in decline from outburst. The WD Temperatures we
obtain should therefore be considered as upper limits, and it is likely that
during quiescence AM Cas, FO Per and ES Dra are near the average WD Teff for
catalcysmic variables above the period gap (30,000K), similar to U Gem, SS Aur
and RX And.
