We have measured the magnetotransport properties of a strained metallic V2O3
thin film. Most of the properties are similar to V2O3 single crystals that have
been submitted to a large pressure. In addition, resistance noise analysis
indicates that conductivity fluctuations are freezing out at T\approx 10K.
Examination of a range of measurements leads to the conclusion that
spins-configuration fluctuations dominate in the low temperature regime.
