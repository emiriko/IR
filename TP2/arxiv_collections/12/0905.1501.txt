Spin foam models for quantum gravity are derived from lattice path integrals.
The setting involves variables from both lattice BF theory and Regge calculus.
The action consists in a Regge action, which depends on areas, dihedral angles
and includes the Immirzi parameter. In addition, a measure is inserted to
ensure a consistent gluing of simplices, so that the amplitude is dominated by
configurations which satisfy the parallel transport relations. We explicitly
compute the path integral as a sum over spin foams for a generic measure. The
Freidel-Krasnov and Engle-Pereira-Rovelli models correspond to a special choice
of gluing. In this case, the equations of motion describe genuine geometries,
where the constraints of area-angle Regge calculus are satisfied. Furthermore,
the Immirzi parameter drops out of the on-shell action, and stationarity with
respect to area variations requires spacetime geometry to be flat.
