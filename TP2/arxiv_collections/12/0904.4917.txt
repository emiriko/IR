We summarize briefly the CKM picture of flavour and CP violation that governs
the models with minimal flavour violation (MFV). We then describe how this
framework can be efficiently tested through particle-antiparticle mixing and
rare $K$ and B decays. In particular we provide a list of theoretically clean
tests that the simplest version of the MFV framework, the constrained MFV
hypothesis, has to face in the coming years. Finally we offer a brief look at
the most popular SM extensions that go beyond the CKM framework like the
general MSSM, Little Higgs model with T-parity and Randall-Sundrum models with
bulk fermions.
