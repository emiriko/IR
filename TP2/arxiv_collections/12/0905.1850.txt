Charmed mesons in hot and dense matter are studied within a self-consistent
coupled-channel approach for the experimental conditions of density and
temperature expected at the CBM experiment at FAIR/GSI. The $D$ meson spectral
function broadens with increasing density with an extended tail towards lower
energies due to $\Lambda_c(2593) N^{-1}$ and $\Sigma_c(2800) N^{-1}$
excitations. The in-medium $\bar D$ meson mass increases with density. We also
discuss the consequences for the renormalized properties in nuclear matter of
the charm scalar $D_{s0}(2317)$ and D(2400), and the predicted hidden charm
X(3700) resonances at FAIR energies.
