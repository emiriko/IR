Self diffusion coefficients and binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients
were determined by equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with the
Green-Kubo method. The study covers five pure fluids: neon, argon, krypton,
xenon, and methane and three binary mixtures: argon+krypton, argon+xenon, and
krypton+xenon. The fluids are modeled by spherical Lennard-Jones
air-potentials, with parameters which were determined solely on the basis of
vapor-liquid equilibria data. The predictions of the self diffusion
coefficients agree within 5% for gas state points and about 10% for liquid
state points. The Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients are predicted within
10%. A test of Darken's model shows good agreement.
