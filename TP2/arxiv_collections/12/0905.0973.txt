We study the interaction of vector mesons with the octet of stable baryons in
the framework of the local hidden gauge formalism using a coupled channels
unitary approach. We examine the scattering amplitudes and their poles, which
can be associated to known J^P=1/2^-,3/2^- baryon resonances, in some cases, or
give predictions in other ones. The formalism employed produces doublets of
degenerate J^P=1/2^-,3/2^- states, a pattern which is observed experimentally
in several cases. The findings of this work should also be useful to guide
present experimental programs searching for new resonances, in particular in
the strange sector where the current information is very poor.
