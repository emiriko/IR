We construct partitions of rectangles into smaller rectangles from an input
consisting of a planar dual graph of the layout together with restrictions on
the orientations of edges and junctions of the layout. Such an
orientation-constrained layout, if it exists, may be constructed in polynomial
time, and all orientation-constrained layouts may be listed in polynomial time
per layout.
