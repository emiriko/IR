This letter provides the first prediction of the probability density function
(PDF) of flux $R$ in plasma sheath sheath region in magnetic fusion devices
which is characterized by dynamical equations with exponential non-linearities.
By using a non-perturbative statistical theory (instantons), the PDF tails of
first moment are shown to be modified Gumbel distribution which represents a
frequency distribution of the extreme values of the ensemble. The non-Gaussian
PDF tails that are enhanced over Gaussian predictions are the result of
intermittency caused by short lived coherent structures (instantons).
