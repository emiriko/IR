The form of the quantum Yang-Mills action, under a longitudinal rescaling is
determined using a Wilsonian renormalization group. The high-energy limit, is
the extreme limit of such a rescaling. We compute the anomalous dimensions and
discuss the validity of the high-energy limit. This thesis is an expanded
version of joint work with P. Orland, which appeared in arXiv:0901.2955.
