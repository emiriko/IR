The supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 has long been inferred to contain a central
energetic pulsar. In observations with the NRAO Green Bank Telescope at 2 GHz,
we have detected radio pulsations from PSR J1747-2809. The pulsar has a
rotation period of 52 ms, and a spin-down luminosity of 4.3e37 erg/s, the
second largest among known Galactic pulsars. With a dispersion measure of 1133
pc/cc, PSR J1747-2809 is distant, at ~13 kpc according to the NE2001 electron
density model, although it could be located as close as the Galactic center.
The pulse profile is greatly scatter-broadened at a frequency of 2 GHz, so that
it is effectively undetectable at 1.4 GHz, and is very faint, with
period-averaged flux density of 40 uJy at 2 GHz.
