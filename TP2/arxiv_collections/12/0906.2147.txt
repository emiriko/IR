Discriminating between orthogonal quantum systems without destroying their
entanglement is of interest to quantum computation and communication. In this
paper, we explicate the schemes for the non-destructive discrimination (NDD) of
16 orthogonal four qubit cluster states and 32 orthogonal five qubit cluster
states respectively. This technique will find its applications in various
branches of quantum information theory.
