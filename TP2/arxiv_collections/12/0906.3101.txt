Very old people accumulate the "handicaps": social, physical, psychological
or cognitive. Various research thus developed to determine there waiting and
needs and also to see the benefit possibly produced by technologies (called
?gerontechnology?) on their living conditions. The object of this article is to
present the numerical service offer to very old perople and to see how it takes
part in a social justice according to the definition of Rawls (principle of
equal freedom, principle of equal opportunity in the access). The adoption, the
use and the benefit of technology are analyzed in a theoretical way through a
state of the art and in an experimental way through a qualitative and
quantitative investigation carried out with a population of very old people. We
propose to identify dynamic technological acceptance of old people according to
the TAM'S (Technology Acceptance Model) of Davis adapted by (Hamner and Qazi,
2008).
