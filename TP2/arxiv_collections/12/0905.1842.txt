We report on observations of several transit events of the transiting planet
TrES-2 obtained with the Cassegrain-Teleskop-Kamera at the University
Observatory Jena. Between March 2007 and November 2008 ten different transits
and almost a complete orbital period were observed. Overall, in 40 nights of
observation 4291 exposures (in total 71.52 h of observation) of the TrES-2
parent star were taken. With the transit timings for TrES-2 from the 34 events
published by the TrES-network, the Transit Light Curve project and the
Exoplanet Transit Database plus our own ten transits, we find that the orbital
period is P=(2.470614 +/- 0.000001) d, a slight change by ~0.6 s compared to
the previously published period. We present new ephemeris for this transiting
planet. Furthermore, we found a second dip after the transit which could either
be due to a blended variable star or occultation of a second star or even an
additional object in the system. Our observations will be useful for future
investigations of timing variations caused by additional perturbing planets
and/or stellar spots and/or moons.
