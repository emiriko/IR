It is well known, and easy to see, that not each nondeterministic Buchi
automaton on infinite words can be simulated by a nondeterministic co-Buchi
automaton. We show that in the cases when such a simulation is possible, the
number of states needed for it can grow nonlinearly. More precisely, we show a
sequence of - as we believe, simple and elegant - languages which witness the
existence of a nondeterministic Buchi automaton with n states, which can be
simulated by a nondeterministic co-Buchi automaton, but cannot be simulated by
any nondeterministic co-Buchi automaton with less than c*n^{7/6} states for
some constant c. This improves on the best previously known lower bound of
3(n-1)/2.
