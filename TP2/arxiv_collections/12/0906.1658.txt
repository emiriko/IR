In order to assess the contribution of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman
alpha emitters (LAEs) at redshifts 3<z<7 to the ionization of intergalactic
medium (IGM), we investigate the escape fractions of ionizing photons from
supernova-dominated primordial galaxies by solving the three-dimensional
radiative transfer. The model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution
chemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori & Umemura (2006),which
well reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of
model galaxy is 10^{11}M_sun. We solve not only photo-ionization but also
collisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according to the chemical
enrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking the size
distributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction
reduces the escape fractions by a factor 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a
factor 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks
increases the escape fractions by a factor ~ 2. The resultant escape fractions
are 0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the LBG phase. These results
are well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at
1500 angstrom to 900 angstrom of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the resultant escape
fractions with the luminosity functions of LAEs and LBGs, we find that high-z
LAEs and LBGs can ionize the IGM at z=3-5. However, ionizing radiation from
LAEs as well as LBGs falls short to ionize the IGM at z>6. That implies that
additional ionization sources may required at z>6.
