Recently dispersion relations have been applied to hard exclusive processes
such as deeply virtual Compton scattering, and a holographic principle was
proposed that maps out the generalized parton distributions entering the soft
matrix elements for the processes from their values on a given kinematical
ridge. We examine possible pitfalls associated with the implicit, direct
identification in this approach of the physical hadronic states with colored
partons, and suggest an improved treatment of this assumption.
