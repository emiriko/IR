Spatial coordinate transformation is used as a reliable tool to control
electromagnetic fields. In this paper, we derive the permeability and
permittivity tensors of a metamaterial able to transform an isotropically
radiating source into a compact ultradirective antenna in the microwave domain.
We show that the directivity of this antenna is competitive with regard to
conventional directive antennas horn and reflector antennas, besides its
dimensions are smaller. Numerical simulations using finite element method are
performed to illustrate these properties. A reduction in the electromagnetic
material parameters is also proposed for an easy fabrication of this antenna
from existing materials. Following that, the design of the proposed antenna
using a layered metamaterial is presented. The different layers are all
composed of homogeneous and uniaxial anisotropic metamaterials, which can be
obtained from simple metal-dielectric structures. When the radiating source is
embedded in the layered metamaterial, a highly directive beam is radiated from
the antenna
