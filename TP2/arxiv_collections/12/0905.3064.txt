To ensure homogeneous conditions within the complete area of perfused
microfluidic bio-reactors, we develop a general design of a continuously feed
bio-reactor with uniform perfusion flow. This is achieved by introducing a
specific type of perfusion inlet to the reaction area. The geometry of these
inlets are found using the methods of topology optimization and shape
optimization. The results are compared with two different analytic models, from
which a general parametric description of the design is obtained and tested
numerically. Such a parametric description will generally be beneficial for the
design of a broad range of microfluidic bioreactors used for e.g. cell
culturing and analysis, and in feeding bio-arrays.
