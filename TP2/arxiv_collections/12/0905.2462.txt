We present a scheme for entanglement macroscopic atomic ensembles which are
four spatially separate regions of an atomic cloud using cluster-correlated
beams. We show that the cluster-type polarization-encoded entanglement could be
mapped onto the long-lived collective ground state of the atomic ensembles, and
the stored entanglement could be retrieved based on the technique of
electromagnetically induced transparency. We also discuss the efficiency of,
the lifetime of, and some quantitative restrictions to the proposed quantum
memory.
