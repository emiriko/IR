Previous studies have described the concept of peptide strings in qualitative
terms and illustrated it by applying its corrolaries in order to elucidate
basic questions in oncology and rheumatology. The present investigation is the
first to quantify these potential sub- and transcellular phenomena.
Accordingly, the propagation of peptide strings is proposed here to occur by
way of waves that in turn are subject to the energy equation established by
Planck. As a result of these insights, widespread future applications can now
be envisaged for peptide strings both in molecular medicine and quantum optics.
