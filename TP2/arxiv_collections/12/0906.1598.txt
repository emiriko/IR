Recent developments in jet clustering are reviewed. We present a list of fast
and infrared and collinear safe algorithms, and also describe new tools like
jet areas. We show how these techniques can be applied to the study of
underlying event or, more generally, of any background which can be considered
distributed in a sufficiently uniform way.
