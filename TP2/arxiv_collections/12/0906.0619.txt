The process of fracture in ductile metals involves the nucleation, growth,
and linking of voids. This process takes place both at the low rates involved
in typical engineering applications and at the high rates associated with
dynamic fracture processes such as spallation. Here we study the growth of a
void in a single crystal at high rates using molecular dynamics (MD) based on
Finnis-Sinclair interatomic potentials for the body-centred cubic (bcc) metals
V, Nb, Mo, Ta, and W. The use of the Finnis-Sinclair potential enables the
study of plasticity associated with void growth at the atomic level at room
temperature and strain rates from 10^9/s down to 10^6/s and systems as large as
128 million atoms. The atomistic systems are observed to undergo a transition
from twinning at the higher end of this range to dislocation flow at the lower
end. We analyze the simulations for the specific mechanisms of plasticity
associated with void growth as dislocation loops are punched out to accommodate
the growing void. We also analyse the process of nucleation and growth of voids
in simulations of nanocrystalline Ta expanding at different strain rates. We
comment on differences in the plasticity associated with void growth in the bcc
metals compared to earlier studies in face-centred cubic (fcc) metals.
