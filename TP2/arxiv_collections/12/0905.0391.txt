An ab initio study of magnetic exchange interactions in antiferromagnetic and
strongly correlated 3d transition metal monoxides is presented. Their
electronic structure is calculated using the local self-interaction correction
approach, implemented within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker band structure method,
which is based on multiple scattering theory. The Heisenberg exchange constants
are evaluated with the magnetic force theorem. Based on these the corresponding
Neel temperatures T_N and spin wave dispersions are calculated. The Neel
temperatures are obtained using mean field approximation, random phase
approximation and Monte Carlo simulations. The pressure dependence of T_N is
investigated using exchange constants calculated for different lattice
constants. All the calculated results are compared to experimental data.
