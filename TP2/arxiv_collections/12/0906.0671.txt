We study the influence of hadron interaction features on the high-energy
atmospheric neutrino spectrum. The 1D calculation is performed with use of the
known high-energy hadronic models, SIBYLL 2.1, QGSJET-II, Kimel and Mokhov, for
the parameterizations of primary cosmic ray spectra issued from the measurement
data. The results are compared with the Frejus data and AMANDA-II measurements
as well as with other calculations. Sizable difference of the neutrino fluxes
(up to the factor of 1.8 at 1 TeV) that are obtained with the SIBYLL and
QGSJET-II appears to be rather unexpected keeping in mind the hadron and muon
flux calculations in the same energy region.
