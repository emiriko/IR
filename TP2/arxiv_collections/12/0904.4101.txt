The solar gravity modes are the best probes to improve our knowledge on the
solar interior, as they spend most of their time in the radiative zone, which
represents 98% of the solar mass. Many attempts have been led to observe them
using different techniques: either individually, then adding some statistical
approach or more recently, globally leading to the detection of the signature
of asymptotical properties of these modes. Then, several theoretical works have
been done to quantify the effect of detecting g-mode on solar modeling and on
the rotation profile. We will give here an update on the g-mode detection.
Then, we will study an example of a theoretical work showing how their
detection would improve our knowledge on the dynamics of the solar core as well
as an application on the detection of the global properties to infer some
physical inputs in solar models.
