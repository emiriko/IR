We present 5 to 15 micron Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) low resolution
spectral data of a candidate debris disk around an M4.5 star identified as a
likely member of the ~40 Myr old cluster NGC2547. The IRS spectrum shows a
silicate emission feature, indicating the presence of warm, small,
(sub)micron-sized dust grains in the disk. Of the fifteen previously known
candidate debris disks around M-type stars, the one we discuss in this paper is
the first to have an observed mid-infrared spectrum and is also the first to
have measured silicate emission. We combined the IRS data with ancillary data
(optical, JHKs, and Spitzer InfraRed Array Camera and 24 micron data) to build
the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source. Monte Carlo radiation
transfer modeling of the SED characterized the dust disk as being very flat
(h100=2AU) and extending inward within at least 0.13AU of the central star. Our
analysis shows that the disk is collisionally dominated and is likely a debris
disk.
