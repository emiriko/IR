This paper presents a modeling of intelligent sensors based on a
representation of the sensor by services it uses or it proposes, and by its
USer Operating Modes (USOMs). This modeling is used for the definition of the
reactive layer of distributed agent based intelligent sensors. Our area of
interest is the agent-level layer in which the concept of IIC (Intelligent
Instrument Cluster) is defined. An application that uses fuzzy-based
intelligent sensors is presented in order to illustrate the concepts.
