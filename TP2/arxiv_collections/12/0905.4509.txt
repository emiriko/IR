We investigate the impact of the tau and bottom Yukawa couplings on the
transport dynamics for electroweak baryogenesis in supersymmetric extensions of
the Standard Model. Although it has generally been assumed in the literature
that all Yukawa interactions except those involving the top quark are
negligible, we find that the tau and bottom Yukawa interaction rates are too
fast to be neglected. We identify an illustrative "lepton-mediated electroweak
baryogenesis" scenario in which the baryon asymmetry is induced mainly through
the presence of a left-handed leptonic charge. We derive analytic formulae for
the computation of the baryon asymmetry that, in light of these effects, are
qualitatively different from those in the established literature. In this
scenario, for fixed CP-violating phases, the baryon asymmetry has opposite sign
compared to that calculated using established formulae.
