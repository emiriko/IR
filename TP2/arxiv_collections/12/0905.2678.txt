We investigate several aspects of exact black hole solutions in
asymptotically Lifshitz spacetime, which were proposed in 0812.0530. Firstly,
we calculate the tidal forces and find that in the near horizon region of such
black hole backgrounds, the tidal forces diverge in the near extremal limit.
Secondly, we evaluate the Wilson loops in both extremal and finite temperature
cases. Finally, we obtain the corresponding shear viscosity and square of the
sound speed and find that the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density takes
the universal value $1/4\pi$ in arbitrary dimensions while the square of the
speed of sound saturates the conjectured bound 1/3 in five dimensions.
