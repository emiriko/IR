We study the non-stationary dynamics of an elastic interface in a disordered
medium at the depinning transition. We compute the two-time response and
correlation functions, found to be universal and characterized by two
independent critical exponents. We find a good agreement between two-loop
Functional Renormalization Group calculations and molecular dynamics
simulations for the scaling forms, and for the response aging exponent
$\theta_R$. We also describe a dynamical dimensional crossover, observed at
long times in the relaxation of a finite system. Our results are relevant for
the non-steady driven dynamics of domain walls in ferromagnetic films and
contact lines in wetting.
