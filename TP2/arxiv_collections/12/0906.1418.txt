In this paper we address practical aspects of the implementation of the 0-1
test for chaos in deterministic systems. In addition, we present a new
formulation of the test which significantly increases its sensitivity. The test
can be viewed as a method to distill a binary quantity from the power spectrum.
The implementation is guided by recent results from the theoretical
justification of the test as well as by exploring better statistical methods to
determine the binary quantities. We give several examples to illustrate the
improvement.
