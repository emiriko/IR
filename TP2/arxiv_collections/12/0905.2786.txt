Recently Ho$\breve{r}$ava proposed a non-relativistic renormalisable theory
of gravitation. When restricted to satisfy the condition of detailed balance,
this theory is intimately related to topologically massive gravity in three
dimensions, and the geometry of the Cotton tensor. At long distances, this
theory is expected to flow to the relativistic value $\lambda = 1$, and could
therefore serve as a possible candidate for a UV completion of Einstein general
relativity or an infrared modification thereof. In this paper under allowing
the lapse function to depend on the spatial coordinates $x^i$ as well as $t$,
we obtain the spherically symmetric solutions. And then by analyzing the
behavior of the effective potential for the particle, we investigate the
timelike geodesic motion of particle in the Ho$\breve{r}$ava-Lifshitz
spacetime. We find that the nonradial particle falls from a finite distance to
the center along the timelike geodesics when its energy is in an appropriate
range. However, we find that it is complexity for radial particle along the
timelike geodesics. There are follow different cases due to the energy of
radial particle: 1) When the energy of radial particle is higher than a
critical value $E_{C}$, the particle will fall from infinity to the singularity
directly; 2) When the energy of radial particle equals to the critical value
$E_{C}$, the particle orbit is unstable at $r=r_{C}$, i.e. the particle will
escape from $r=r_{C}$ to the infinity or to the singularity, which is
determined by the initial conditions of the particle; 3) When the energy of
radial particle is in a proper range, the particle will rebound to the infinity
or plunge to the singularity from a infinite distance, which is also determined
by the initial conditions of the particle.
