We confirm the UHECR horizon established by the Pierre Auger Observatory
using the heterogeneous Veron-Cetty Veron (VCV) catalog of AGNs, by performing
a redshift-angle-IR luminosity scan using PSCz galaxies having infrared
luminosity greater than 10^{10}L_sun. The strongest correlation -- for z <
0.016, psi = 2.1 deg, and L_ir > 10^{10.5}L_sun -- arises in fewer than 0.3% of
scans with isotropic source directions. When we apply a penalty for using the
UHECR energy threshold that was tuned to maximize the correlation with VCV, the
significance degrades to 1.1%. Since the PSCz catalog is complete and
volume-limited for these parameters, this suggests that the UHECR horizon
discovered by the Pierre Auger Observatory is not an artifact of the
incompleteness and other idiosyncrasies of the VCV catalog. The strength of the
correlation between UHECRs and the nearby highest-IR-luminosity PSCz galaxies
is stronger than in about 90% percent of trials with scrambled luminosity
assignments for the PSCz galaxies. If confirmed by future data, this result
would indicate that the sources of UHECRs are more strongly associated with
luminous IR galaxies than with ordinary, lower IR luminosity galaxies.
