Employing the quantum R\'enyi $\alpha$-entropies as a measure of
entanglement, we numerically find the violation of the strong superadditivity
inequality for a system composed of four qubits and $\alpha>1$. This violation
gets smaller as $\alpha\rightarrow 1$ and vanishes for $\alpha=1$ when the
measure corresponds to the Entanglement of Formation (EoF). We show that the
R\'enyi measure aways satisfies the standard monogamy of entanglement for
$\alpha = 2$, and only violates a high order monogamy inequality, in the rare
cases in which the strong superadditivity is also violated. The sates
numerically found where the violation occurs have special symmetries where both
inequalities are equivalent. We also show that every measure satisfing monogamy
for high dimensional systems also satisfies the strong superadditivity
inequality. For the case of R\'enyi measure, we provide strong numerical
evidences that these two properties are equivalent.
