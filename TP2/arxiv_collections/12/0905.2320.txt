A formal symmetry between generalized coordinates and momenta is postulated
to formulate classical and quantum theories of a particle coupled to an Abelian
gauge field. It is shown that the symmetry (a) requires the field to have
dynamic degrees of freedom and to be a connection in a non-flat space-time
manifold, and (b) leads to a quantum theory free of the measurement problem. It
is speculated that gravitomagnetism could be a possible source of the gauge
field.
