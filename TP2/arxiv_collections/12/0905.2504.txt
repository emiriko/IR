This article describes new polar angle-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR)
measurements in the overdoped cuprate Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ over an
expanded range of temperatures and azimuthal angles. These detailed
measurements re-affirm the analysis of earlier data taken over a more
restricted temperature range and at a single azimuthal orientation, in
particular the delineation of the intraplane scattering rate into isotropic and
anisotropic components. These new measurements also reveal additional features
in the temperature and momentum dependence of the scattering rate, including
anisotropy in the $T^2$ component and the preservation of both the $T$-linear
and $T^2$ components up to 100 K. The resultant form of the scattering rate
places firm constraints on the development of any forthcoming theoretical
framework for the normal state charge response of high temperature
superconducting cuprates.
