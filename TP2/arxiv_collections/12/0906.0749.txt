A scheme for an X-ray free electron laser is proposed, based on a Raman
process occurring during the interaction between a moderately relativistic
bunch of free electrons, and twin intense short pulse lasers interfering to
form a transverse standing wave along the electron trajectories. In the high
intensity regime of the Kapitza-Dirac effect, the laser ponderomotive potential
forces the electrons into a lateral oscillatory motion, resulting in a Raman
scattering process. I show how a parametric process is triggered, resulting in
the amplification of the Stokes component of the Raman-scattered photons.
Experimental operating parameters and implementations, based both on LINAC and
Laser Wakefield Acceleration techniques, are discussed.
