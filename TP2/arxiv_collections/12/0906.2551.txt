It is well known that the supersolid form of matter can arise in a single
species of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice due to long range
interactions. We present a scenario where a supersolid is induced in one of the
components of a mixture of two species bosonic atoms where there is no long
range interactions. We study a system of normal and hardcore boson mixture with
only the former possessing long range interactions. We consider three cases:
the first where the total density is commensurate and the other two where they
are incommensurate . By suitable choices of the densities and the interaction
strengths of the atoms, we predict that the charge density wave and the
supersolid orders can be induced in the hardcore species as a result of the
competing interatomic interactions.
