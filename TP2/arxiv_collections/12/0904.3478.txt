In this paper we give the stable classification of ordered, pointed, oriented
multi-component curves on surfaces with minimal crossing number less than or
equal to 2 such that any equivalent curve has no simply closed curves in its
components. To do this, we use the theory of words and phrases which was
introduced by V. Turaev. Indeed we give the homotopy classification of
nanophrases with less than or equal to 4 letters. It is an extension of the
classification of nanophrases of length 2 with less than or equal to 4 letters
which was given by the author in a previous paper. This is a corrected version
of Hokkaido University Preprint Series in Mathematics #921. I corrected the
subsection 5.3 and added proofs of propositions.
