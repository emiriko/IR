The effects of pressure generated in a liquid medium, clamp, pressure cell on
the in-plane and c-axis resistance, temperature-dependent Hall coefficient and
low temperature, magnetoresistance in CaFe2As2 are presented. The T - P phase
diagram, including the observation of a complete superconducting transition in
resistivity, delineated in earlier studies is found to be highly reproducible.
The Hall resistivity and low temperature magnetoresistance are sensitive to
different states/phases observed in CaFe2As2. Auxiliary measurements under
uniaxial, c-axis, pressure are in general agreement with the liquid medium
clamp cell results with some difference in critical pressure values and
pressure derivatives. The data may be viewed as supporting the potential
importance of non-hydrostatic components of pressure in inducing
superconductivity in CaFe2As2.
