Using a sheaf-theoretic extension of conventional principal bundle theory,
the Dirac monopole is formulated as a spherically symmetric model free of
singularities outside the origin such that the charge may assume arbitrary real
values. For integral charges, the construction effectively coincides with the
usual model. Spin structures and Dirac operators are also generalised by the
same technique.
