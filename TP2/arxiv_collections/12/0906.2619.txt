Holographic gratings with topological defects (branching of one or more
fringes) are widely used for generating light beams with optical vortices (OV).
This work presents an analysis of OV beams produced by binary
computer-generated holograms enlightened by Gaussian beams centered at the
fringe bifurcation point. Usually such beams are considered as analogs of the
standard solutions of paraxial wave equation - Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes
representing classical examples of OVs. However, the intensity profile and the
whole process of their spatial evolution show important differences from the LG
prototypes. In the case of integer topological charge, a created OV beam can be
described by the special Kummer function, which allows referring to these beams
as to "Kummer beams". Properties of Kummer beams are studied numerically and
analytically. Main distinctions from the corresponding LG modes are much slower
intensity decay at the beam periphery and much higher beam divergence;
differences between the Kummer and LG beams grow with the OV topological
charge.
