The equation of state and composition of matter are calculated for conditions
typical for pre-collapse and early collapse stages in core collapse supernovae.
The composition is evaluated under the assumption of nuclear statistical
equilibrium, when the matter is considered as an `almost' ideal gas with
corrections due to thermal excitations of nuclei, to free nucleon degeneracy,
and to Coulomb and surface energy corrections. The account of these corrections
allows us to obtain the composition for densities a bit below the nuclear
matter density. Through comparisons with the equation of state (EOS) developed
by Shen et al. we examine the approximation of one representative nucleus used
in most of recent supernova EOS's. We find that widely distributed compositions
in the nuclear chart are different, depending on the mass formula, while the
thermodynamical quantities are quite close to those in the Shen's EOS.
