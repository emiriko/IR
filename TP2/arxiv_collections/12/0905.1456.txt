We investigate an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game among self-driven
agents, where collective motion of biological flocks is imitated through
averaging directions of neighbors. Depending on the temptation to defect and
the velocity at which agents move, we find that cooperation can not only be
maintained in such a system but there exists an optimal size of interaction
neighborhood, which can induce the maximum cooperation level. When compared
with the case that all agents do not move, cooperation can even be enhanced by
the mobility of individuals, provided that the velocity and the size of
neighborhood are not too large. Besides, we find that the system exhibits
aggregation behavior, and cooperators may coexist with defectors at
equilibrium.
