Thermal transport measurements have been performed on single-crystalline
Co-doped BaFe2As2 down to 0.1 K and under magnetic fields up to 7 T.
Significant peak anomalies are observed in both thermal conductivity and
thermal Hall conductivity below Tc as an indication of the enhancement of the
quasiparticle mean-free path. Moreover, we find a sizable residual T-linear
term in thermal conductivity, possibly due to a finite quasiparticle density of
states in the superconducting gap induced by impurity pair breaking. Our
findings support a pairing symmetry compatible with the theoretically predicted
sign-reversing s-wave state.
