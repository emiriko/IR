Propagation of the alternating electromagnetic field in a system of zigzag
carbon nanotubes in the case of low temperatures and applied external electric
fields are considered. The electronic system of the carbon nanotubes is
investigated microscopically nonmetering an interaction with a phonon subsystem
by the fact that the electromagnetic pulse is critically short. An efficient
equation for the vector-potential amplitude of the alternating electromagnetic
field is obtained. Solutions of solitons analogs which correspond to solitons
in the case of cosine dispersion law for the electronic subsystem have been
elicited. The dependences of obtained nonlinear solutions on problem parameters
and the applied external electric fields were analyzed. The possibility to
control the shape of optical pulse in wide range was shown.
