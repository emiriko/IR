We develop an architecture for distributed quantum computation using quantum
bus of plasmonic circuits and spin qubits in self-assembled quantum dots.
Deterministic quantum gates between two distant spin qubits can be reached by
using an adiabatic approach in which quantum dots couple with highly detuned
plasmon modes in a metallic nanowire. Plasmonic quantum bus offers a robust and
scalable platform for quantum optics experiments and the development of on-chip
quantum networks composed of various quantum nodes, such as quantum dots,
molecules and nanoparticles.
