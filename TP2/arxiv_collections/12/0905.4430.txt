Mathematical educational soft explore, investigating in a dynamical way, some
algebraically, geometrically problems, the expected results being used to
involve a lot of mathematical results. One such software soft is GeoGebra. The
software is free and multi-platform dynamic mathematics software for learning
and teaching, awards in Europe and the USA. This paper describes some critical
but constructive investigation using the platform for graph functions and
dynamic geometry.
