Reduction operators (called often nonclassical symmetries) of variable
coefficient semilinear reaction-diffusion equations with power nonlinearity
$f(x)u_t=(g(x)u_x)_x+h(x)u^m$ ($m\neq0,1,2$) are investigated using the
algorithm suggested in [O.O. Vaneeva, R.O. Popovych and C. Sophocleous, Acta
Appl. Math., 2009, V.106, 1-46; arXiv:0708.3457].
