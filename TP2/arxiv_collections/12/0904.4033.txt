We study Landau-gauge gluon and ghost propagators in Yang-Mills theories at
lattice parameter beta = 0, considering relatively large lattice volumes for
the case of the SU(2) gauge group in three and four space-time dimensions. We
compare the lattice data to the so-called massive and conformal-scaling
solutions, examining the requirements for a good description of the propagators
over various ranges of momenta and discussing possible systematic errors. Our
analysis strongly supports the massive solution, i.e. a finite gluon propagator
and an essentially free ghost propagator in the infrared limit, in disagreement
with Ref. [1]. Moreover, we argue that discretization effects play no role in
the analysis of these propagators.
