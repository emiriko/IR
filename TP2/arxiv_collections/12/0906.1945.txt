The renormalization, finiteness and off-shellness of short distance power
like singular interactions is discussed. We show analytically that the
renormalizability of the off-shell scattering amplitude relies completely on
the corresponding on-shell amplitude without proliferation of new counterterms.
We illustrate the result by complementary calculations both in coordinate as
well as in momentum space in the simplest 1S0 channel for chiral np
interactions including Two Pion Exchange.
