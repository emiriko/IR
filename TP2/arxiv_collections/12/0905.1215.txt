We analyze the (computational) complexity distribution of sphere-decoding
(SD) for random infinite lattices. In particular, we show that under fairly
general assumptions on the statistics of the lattice basis matrix, the tail
behavior of the SD complexity distribution is solely determined by the inverse
volume of a fundamental region of the underlying lattice. Particularizing this
result to NxM, N>=M, i.i.d. Gaussian lattice basis matrices, we find that the
corresponding complexity distribution is of Pareto-type with tail exponent
given by N-M+1. We furthermore show that this tail exponent is not improved by
lattice-reduction, which includes layer-sorting as a special case.
