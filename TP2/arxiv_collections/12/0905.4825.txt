We obtain the Pairwise Summation Approximation (PSA) of the Casimir energy
from first principles in the soft dielectric and soft diamagnetic limit, so we
find that the PSA is an asymptotic approximation of the Casimir energy valid
for large distances between the objects. We also obtain the PSA for the
electromagnetic coupling part of the Casimir energy, so we are able to complete
the PSA limit at a first time for the complete electromagnetic field.
