This note describes some cryptographic issues related to multi-located
parties. In general, multi-located parties make it difficult for the
eavesdropper to mount the man-in-the-middle attack. Conversely, they make it
easier to address problems such as joint encryption and error correction
coding. It is easier to implement the three-stage quantum cryptography
protocol.
