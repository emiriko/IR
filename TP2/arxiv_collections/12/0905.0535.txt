We construct a matrix model equivalent (exactly, not asymptotically), to the
random plane partition model, with almost arbitrary boundary conditions.
Equivalently, it is also a random matrix model for a TASEP-like process with
arbitrary boundary conditions. Using the known solution of matrix models, this
method allows to find the large size asymptotic expansion of plane partitions,
to ALL orders. It also allows to describe several universal regimes.
