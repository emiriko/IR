In this paper we use N-body simulations to study the effects of primordial
mass segregation on the early and long-term evolution of star clusters. Our
simulations show that in segregated clusters early mass loss due to stellar
evolution triggers a stronger expansion than for unsegregated clusters. Tidally
limited, strongly segregated clusters may dissolve rapidly as a consequence of
this early expansion, while segregated clusters initially underfilling their
Roche lobe can survive the early expansion and have a lifetime similar to that
of unsegregated clusters. Long-lived initially segregated clusters tend to have
looser structure and reach core collapse later in their evolution than
initially unsegregated clusters. We have also compared the effects of dynamical
evolution on the global stellar mass function (MF) of low-mass main sequence
stars. In all cases the MF flattens as the cluster loses stars. The amount of
MF flattening induced by a given amount of mass loss in a rapidly dissolving
initially segregated cluster is less than for an unsegregated cluster. The
evolution of the MF of a long-lived segregated cluster, on the other hand, is
very similar to that of an initially unsegregated cluster.
