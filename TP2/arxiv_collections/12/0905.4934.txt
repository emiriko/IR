We study the decay of a prepared state into non-flat continuum. We find that
the survival probability $P(t)$ might exhibit either stretched-exponential or
power-law decay, depending on non-universal features of the model. Still there
is a universal characteristic time $t_0$ that does not depend on the functional
form. It is only for a flat continuum that we get a robust exponential decay
that is insensitive to the nature of the intra-continuum couplings. The
analysis highlights the co-existence of perturbative and non-perturbative
features in the local density of states, and the non-linear dependence of
$1/t_0$ on the strength of the coupling.
