In frames of the Ising model, we analyze self-organization of aqueous acetone
(AC) and tetramethyl urea (TMU), caused by lyotropic phase transformations.
Using the lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we confirmed the statements by Koga
and co-workers on the tree content dependent mixing schemes in AC and TMU and
found the values of molar fractions of surfactants, corresponding to the
transitions between the mesophases of these mixing schemes. So we may compare
these results with another concepts on the water structures.
