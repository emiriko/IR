Considering the fundamental origins of Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations,
Thomas precession, and the photon spin, it is clear that the origin of spin
angular momentum refers to relativity than quantum theory; so, when introducing
spin, it is better to know it as rest angular momentum than as an intrinsic
quantum quantity.
