We exactly calculate the quasinormal frequencies of the electromagnetic and
Klein-Gordon perturbations propagating in a five-dimensional dilatonic black
hole. Furthermore we exactly find the quasinormal frequencies of the massive
Dirac field. Using these results we study the linear stability of this black
hole. We compare our results for the quasinormal frequencies and for the linear
stability of the five-dimensional black hole with those already published.
