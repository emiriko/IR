Motivation: Many biochemical pathways are known, but the numerous parameters
required to correctly explore the dynamics of the pathways are not known. For
this reason, algorithms that can make inferences by looking at the topology of
a network are desirable. In this work, we are particular interested in the
question of whether a given pathway can potentially harbor multiple stable
steady states. In other words, the challenge is to find the set of parameters
such that the dynamical system defined by a set of ordinary differential
equations will contain multiple stable steady states. Being able to find
parameters that cause a network to be bistable may also be benefitial for
engineering synthetic bistable systems where the engineer needs to know a
working set of parameters.
  Result: We have developed an algorithm that optimizes the parameters of a
dynamical system so that the system will contain at least one saddle or
unstable point. The algorithm then looks at trajectories around this saddle or
unstable point to see whether the different trajectories converge to different
stable points. The algorithm returns the parameters that causes the system to
exhibit multiple stable points. Since this is an optimization algorithm, it is
not quaranteed to find a solution. Repeated runs are often required to find a
solution for systems where only a narrow set of parameters exhibit bistability.
