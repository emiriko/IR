This article reviews the recent theoretical and experimental advances in the
study of ultracold gases made of bosonic particles interacting via the
long-range, anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction, in addition to the
short-range and isotropic contact interaction usually at work in ultracold
gases. The specific properties emerging from the dipolar interaction are
emphasized, from the mean-field regime valid for dilute Bose-Einstein
condensates, to the strongly correlated regimes reached for dipolar bosons in
optical lattices.
