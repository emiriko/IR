In the standard solar flare scenario, a large number of particles are
accelerated in the corona. Nonthermal electrons emit both X-rays and radio
waves. Thus, correlated signatures of the acceleration process are predicted at
both wavelengths, coinciding either close to the footpoints of a magnetic loop
or near the coronal X-ray source. We attempt to study the spatial connection
between coronal X-ray emission and decimetric radio spikes to determine the
site and geometry of the acceleration process. The positions of radio-spike
sources and coronal X-ray sources are determined and analyzed in a
well-observed limb event. Radio spikes are identified in observations from the
Phoenix-2 spectrometer. Data from the Nan\c{c}ay radioheliograph are used to
determine the position of the radio spikes. RHESSI images in soft and hard
X-ray wavelengths are used to determine the X-ray flare geometry. Those
observations are complemented by images from GOES/SXI. We find that decimetric
spikes do not originate from coronal X-ray flare sources contrary to previous
expectations. However, the observations suggest a causal link between the
coronal X-ray source, related to the major energy release site, and
simultaneous activity in the higher corona.
