We present a modified version of the two-player "tug-of-war" game introduced
by Peres, Schramm, Sheffield, and Wilson. This new tug-of-war game is identical
to the original except near the boundary of the domain $\partial \Omega$, but
its associated value functions are more regular. The dynamic programming
principle implies that the value functions satisfy a certain finite difference
equation. By studying this difference equation directly and adapting techniques
from viscosity solution theory, we prove a number of new results. We show that
the finite difference equation has unique maximal and minimal solutions, which
are identified as the value functions for the two tug-of-war players. We
demonstrate uniqueness, and hence the existence of a value for the game, in the
case that the running payoff function is nonnegative. We also show that
uniqueness holds in certain cases for sign-changing running payoff functions
which are sufficiently small. In the limit $\epsilon \to 0$, we obtain the
convergence of the value functions to a viscosity solution of the normalized
infinity Laplace equation. We also obtain several new results for the
normalized infinity Laplace equation $-\Delta_\infty u = f$. In particular, we
demonstrate the existence of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for any bounded
continuous $f$, and continuous boundary data, as well as the uniqueness of
solutions to this problem in the generic case. We present a new elementary
proof of uniqueness in the case that $f>0$, $f< 0$, or $f\equiv 0$. The
stability of the solutions with respect to $f$ is also studied, and an explicit
continuous dependence estimate from $f\equiv 0$ is obtained.
