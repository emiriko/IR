We report on experimental and theoretical study of the nonlinear Faraday
effect under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency at the
5$S_{1/2} \to 5P_{3/2} \to 5D_{5/2}$ two-photon transition in rubidium vapors.
These transitions realize the inverted Y model which combines the $\Lambda$ and
ladder systems. Strong nonlinearity allowing for large rotation angles of a
probe beam tuned to the $S\to P$ transition was obtained by creation of quantum
superpositions of magnetic sublevels (Zeeman coherences) in the rubidium ground
state ($\Lambda$ scheme). Additionally, electromagnetically induced
transparency was accomplished in a ladder scheme by acting with an additional
strong coupling laser on the $P\to D$ transition. Under conditions of a
two-photon resonance the rotation was significantly reduced, which is
interpreted as a competition between the two processes. The effect was observed
in sub-Gauss magnetic fields and could be used for efficient coherent control
of generation of the ground-state coherences, e.g. for controlling the
polarization state of the probe light.
