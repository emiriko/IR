The unusual magnetic behaviour of helimagnet MnSi, noticed in recent years,
prompted the suspicion that the magnetic states arising in such crystals are of
topological nature. Recent experiments based on the topological Hall effect
confirmed such topologically nontrivial states as the skyrmions, located on a
plane perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. We present here a
theoretical model for chiral magnets with competing exchange and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interaction, which leads to an exact skyrmionic
soliton with integer topological charge. Such topologically stable spin states
with analytic solution on a two-dimensional plane show helical structures of
partial order, without inversion and circular symmetry. These exact
N-skyrmions, though represent higher excited states, correspond to the lowest
energy stable configuration in each topological sector and are likely to appear
in MnSi under suitable experimental conditions.
