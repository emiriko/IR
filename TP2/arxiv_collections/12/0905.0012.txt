We point out that a geometric measure of quantum entanglement is related to
the matrix permanent when restricted to permutation invariant states. This
connection allows us to interpret the permanent as an angle between vectors. By
employing a recently introduced permanent inequality by Carlen, Loss and Lieb,
we can prove explicit formulas of the geometric measure for permutation
invariant basis states in a simple way.
