We compute the production of gluons from Glasma color flux tubes. We
calculate the probability distribution of gluon multiplicities arising from the
distribution of color electric and color magnetic flux tubes found in the
Glasma. We show that the result corresponds to the negative binomial
probability distribution observed in experiments. The parameter k that
characterizes this distribution is proportional to the number of colors N_c^2-1
and to the number of flux tubes. For one gluon color and one flux tube, the
multiplicity distribution is close to a Bose-Einstein distribution. We call
this decay process "Glitter", a term that is explained below.
