Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension n \geq 3. The
Compactness Conjecture asserts that the set of constant scalar curvature
metrics in the conformal class of g is compact unless (M,g) is conformally
equivalent to the round sphere. In this paper, we construct counterexamples to
this conjecture in dimensions n \geq 52.
