This paper studies the mean angular momentum associated with the collision of
two celestial objects in the earliest stages of planet formation. Of primary
concern is the scenario of two rarefied preplanetesimals (RPPs) in circular
heliocentric orbits. The theoretical results are used to develop models of
binary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that
a greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of
RPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can
have two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc
around the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by
that the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the
critical angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the
primary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc
at any separation less than the Hill radius. The first scenario can explain a
system such as 2001 QW322 where the two components have similar masses but are
separated by a great distance. In general, any values for the eccentricity and
inclination of the mutual orbit are possible. Among discovered binaries, the
observed angular momenta are smaller than the typical angular momenta expected
for identical RPPs having the same total mass as the discovered binary and
encountering each other in circular heliocentric orbits. This suggests that the
population of RPPs underwent some contraction before mergers became common.
