We review a new form of entropy suggested by us, with origin in mixing of
states of systems due to interactions and deformations of phase cells. It is
demonstrated that this nonextensive form also leads to asymmetric maximal
entropy configurations unlike Shannon entropy. We discuss how, beginning with
quantum entanglement of microsystems with one another and with the environment,
one can obtain classical stochasticity for our form of entropy.
