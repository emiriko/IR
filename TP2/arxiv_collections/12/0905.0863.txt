The introduction of a Flavour Symmetry can represent an interesting way in
which one can try to find an answer to some intriguing problems in Flavour
Physics, like the hierarchy between the fermion masses or the particular values
of mixing angles. In the meantime the necessity to set this symmetry in a
realistic context grows up; this context should be able to enlarge our
incomplete knowledge of fundamental interactions as described in the framework
of the Standard Model. Following this direction a merging between A(4) and
SU(5) can be possible.
