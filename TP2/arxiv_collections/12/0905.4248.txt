A generalization of the Davenport constant is investigated. For a finite
abelian group $G$ and a positive integer $k$, let $D_k(G)$ denote the smallest
$\ell$ such that each sequence over $G$ of length at least $\ell$ has $k$
disjoint non-empty zero-sum subsequences. For general $G$, expanding on known
results, upper and lower bounds on these invariants are investigated and it is
proved that the sequence $(D_k(G))_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ is eventually an
arithmetic progression with difference $\exp(G)$, and several questions arising
from this fact are investigated. For elementary 2-groups, $D_k(G)$ is
investigated in detail; in particular, the exact values are determined for
groups of rank four and five (for rank at most three they were already known).
