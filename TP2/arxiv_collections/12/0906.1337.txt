We have created an analogue of a black hole in a Bose-Einstein condensate. In
this sonic black hole, sound waves, rather than light waves, cannot escape the
event horizon. A step-like potential accelerates the flow of the condensate to
velocities which cross and exceed the speed of sound by an order of magnitude.
The Landau critical velocity is therefore surpassed. The point where the flow
velocity equals the speed of sound is the sonic event horizon. The effective
gravity is determined from the profiles of the velocity and speed of sound. A
simulation finds negative energy excitations, by means of Bragg spectroscopy.
