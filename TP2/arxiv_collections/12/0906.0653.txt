This paper looks at the early theory of phase transitions. It considers a
group of related concepts derived from condensed matter and statistical
physics. The key technical ideas here go under the names of "singularity",
"order parameter", "mean field theory", and "variational method".
  In a less technical vein, the question here is how can matter, ordinary
matter, support a diversity of forms. We see this diversity each time we
observe ice in contact with liquid water or see water vapor, "steam", come up
from a pot of heated water. Different phases can be qualitatively different in
that walking on ice is well within human capacity, but walking on liquid water
is proverbially forbidden to ordinary humans. These differences have been
apparent to humankind for millennia, but only brought within the domain of
scientific understanding since the 1880s.
  A phase transition is a change from one behavior to another. A first order
phase transition involves a discontinuous jump in a some statistical variable
of the system. The discontinuous property is called the order parameter. Each
phase transitions has its own order parameter that range over a tremendous
variety of physical properties. These properties include the density of a
liquid gas transition, the magnetization in a ferromagnet, the size of a
connected cluster in a percolation transition, and a condensate wave function
in a superfluid or superconductor. A continuous transition occurs when that
jump approaches zero. This note is about statistical mechanics and the
development of mean field theory as a basis for a partial understanding of this
phenomenon.
