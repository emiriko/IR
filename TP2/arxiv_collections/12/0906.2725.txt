This review provides a gentle introduction to one-way quantum computing in
distributed architectures. One-way quantum computation shows significant
promise as a computational model for distributed systems, particularly those
architectures which rely on probabilistic entangling operations. We review the
theoretical underpinnings of one-way quantum computation and discuss the
practical issues related to exploiting the one-way model in distributed
architectures.
