We report the discovery of a brown dwarf on an eccentric orbit and with a
semimajor axis that places it in the brown dwarf desert region around the star
HD191760. The star has a spectral type of G3IV/V and a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of
0.29 dex. HD191760 adds to the small number of metal-rich stars with brown
dwarf companions. The brown dwarf (HD191760b) is found to have an orbital
period of 505.57+/-0.40 days and semimajor axis of 1.35+/-0.01 AU, placing it
firmly in the brown dwarf desert. The eccentricity of HD191760b is found to be
0.63+/-0.01, meaning it reaches as close as 0.5 AU from the host star.
Dynamical simulations indicate that no inner planets could reside at
separations beyond ~0.17 AU due to the disastrous gravity imposed by HD191760b.
In addition to these first results we also refine the orbits found for the
exoplanets around the stars HD48265, HD143361 and HD154672. All 1-planet
solutions are in agreement with those previously published by the Magellan
Planet Search.
