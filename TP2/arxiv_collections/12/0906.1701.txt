Graphene, the two-dimensional form of carbon presents outstanding electronic
and transport properties. This gives hope for the development of applications
in nanoelectronics. However, for industrial purpose, graphene has to be
supported by a substrate. We focus here on the graphene-on-SiC system to
discuss how the SiC substrate interacts with the graphene layer and to show the
effect of the interface on graphene atomic and electronic structures.
