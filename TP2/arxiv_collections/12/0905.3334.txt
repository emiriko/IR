We continue studying long-ranged quantum correlations of surface charge
densities on the interface between two media of distinct dielectric functions
which are in thermal equilibrium with the radiated electromagnetic field. Two
regimes are considered: the non-retarded one with the speed of light $c$ taken
to be infinitely large and the retarded one with finite value of $c$. The
analysis is based on results obtained by using fluctuational electrodynamics in
[L. \v{S}amaj and B. Jancovici, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 78}, 051119 (2008)]. Using an
integration method in the complex plane and the general analytic properties of
dielectric functions in the frequency upper half-plane, we derive explicit
forms of prefactors to the long-range decay of the surface charge correlation
functions for all possible media (conductor, dielectric, vacuum)
configurations. The main result is that the time-dependent quantum prefactor in
the retarded regime takes its static classical form, for any temperature.
