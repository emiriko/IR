In this research, we propose an architectural solution to implement the voice
over IP (VoIP) service in campus environment network. Voice over IP (VoIP)
technology has become a discussion issue for this time being. Today, the
deployment of this technology on an organization truly can give a great
financial benefit over traditional telephony. Therefore, this study is to
analyze the VoIP Codec selection and investigate the Mean Opinion Score (MOS)
performance areas evolved with the quality of service delivered by soft phone
and IP phone. This study focuses on quality of voice prediction such as i)
accuracy of MOS between automated system and human perception and ii) different
types of codec performance measurement via human perception using MOS
technique. In this study, network management system (NMS) is used to monitor
and capture the performance of VoIP in campus environment. In addition, the
most apparent of implementing soft phone and IP phone in campus environment is
to define the best codec selection that can be used in operational environment.
Based on the finding result, the MOS measurement through automated and manual
system is able to predict and evaluate VoIP performance. In addition, based on
manual MOS measurement, VoIP conversations over LAN contribute more reliability
and availability performance compare to WAN.
