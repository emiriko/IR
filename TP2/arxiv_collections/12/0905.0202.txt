Millimeter size single crystals of double perovskite La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) were
grown by the High Temperature Solution Growth Method. The magnetic measurements
and polarized Raman spectra between 5 and 350K provide evidence that the
crystals have high degree of Ni(2+)/Mn(4+)ordering, small amount of lattice
defects and highest Tc = 288K reported so far for ferromagnetic double
perovskites. At a microscopic level the crystals are heavily twinned and the
effect of twinning on the Raman spectra is analyzed in detail.
