We introduce a randomized algorithm for computing the minimal-norm solution
to an underdetermined system of linear equations. Given an arbitrary full-rank
m x n matrix A with m<n, any m x 1 vector b, and any positive real number
epsilon less than 1, the procedure computes an n x 1 vector x approximating to
relative precision epsilon or better the n x 1 vector p of minimal Euclidean
norm satisfying Ap=b. The algorithm typically requires O(mn
log(sqrt(n)/epsilon) + m**3) floating-point operations, generally less than the
O(m**2 n) required by the classical schemes based on QR-decompositions or
bidiagonalization. We present several numerical examples illustrating the
performance of the algorithm.
