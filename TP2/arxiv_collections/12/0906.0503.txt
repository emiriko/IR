We discuss the multipolar expansion of the electromagnetic field with an
emphasis on the radiated field. We investigate if the employment of Jefimenko's
equations brings a new insight into the calculation of the radiation field. We
show that the affirmation is valid if one finds an interesting example in which
inverting the order between spatial derivatives and integration is not allowed.
Further, we consider the generalization of the multipolar expansion of the
power radiated by a confined system of charges and currents to a higher
arbitrary order.
