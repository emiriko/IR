We study the effect of soft gluon emission in the hadroproduction of
gluino-gluino and squark-antisquark pairs at the next-to-leading logarithmic
(NLL) accuracy within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric model. We
present the calculation of the one-loop soft anomalous dimension matrices
controlling the colour evolution of the underlying hard-scattering processes.
The numerical results for resummed cross sections for proton-proton collisions
at the Large Hadron Collider are discussed in detail.
