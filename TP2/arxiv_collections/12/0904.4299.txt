The equivalence principle suggests to consider gravity as an infra-red
phenomenon, whose effects are visible only outside Einstein's free-falling
elevator. By curving spacetime, General Relativity leaves the smallest systems
free of classical gravitational effects. However, according to the standard
semi-classical treatment, indirect effects of gravity can be experienced inside
the elevator through the well-known mechanism of quantum particle production.
Here we try a different path than the one historically followed: rather than
imposing field quantization on top of a curved manifold, we attempt to upgrade
the equivalence principle and extend it to the quantum phenomena. Therefore, we
consider, and try to realize in a theoretical framework, a stronger version of
the equivalence principle, in which all the effects of gravity are definitely
banned from the elevator and confined to the infra-red. For this purpose, we
introduce infra-red modified commutation relations for the global field
operators (Fourier modes) that allow to reabsorb the time-dependent quadratic
divergence of the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor. The
proposed modification is effective on length scales comparable to the inverse
curvature and, therefore, does no add any dimensional parameter to the theory.
