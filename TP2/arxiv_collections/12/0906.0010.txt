Through the analysis of a set of numerical simulations of major mergers
between initially non-rotating, pressure supported progenitor galaxies with a
range of central mass concentrations, we have shown that: (1) it is possible to
generate elliptical-like galaxies, with v/sigma > 1 outside one effective
radius, as a result of the conversion of orbital- into internal-angular
momentum; (2) the outer regions acquire part of the angular momentum first; (3)
both the baryonic and the dark matter components of the remnant galaxy acquire
part of the angular momentum, the relative fractions depend on the initial
concentration of the merging galaxies. For this conversion to occur the initial
baryonic component must be sufficiently dense and/or the encounter should take
place on a orbit with high angular momentum. Systems with these hybrid
properties have been recently observed through a combination of stellar
absorption lines and planetary nebulae for kinematic studies of early-type
galaxies. Our results are in qualitative agreement with such observations and
demonstrate that even mergers composed of non-rotating, pressure-supported
progenitor galaxies can produce early-type galaxies with significant rotation
at large radii.
