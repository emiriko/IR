The photon plus heavy-flavour quark (b, c) final state provides a unique and
valuable window into both the sea quark content of the proton and the splitting
of gluons into heavy-flavour quark pairs. A new combination of experimental
techniques has provided the basis for the first measurements of the
differential gamma + c + X and gamma + b + X production cross sections at
sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. The measurements use ~1 fb-1 of data from p-pbar collisions
collected with the D0 detector.
