We report detailed measurements of composition as well as temperature
dependence of the phonon density-of-states in a new series of FeAs compounds
with composition CaFe1\_{1-x}Co\_{x}AsF (x = 0, 0.06, 0.12). The composition as
well as temperature dependence of phonon spectra for CaFe\_{1-x}Co\_{x}AsF (x =
0, 0.06, 0.12) compounds have been measured using time of flight IN4C and IN6
spectrometers at ILL, France. The comparison of phonon spectra at 300 K in
these compounds shows that acoustic phonon modes up to 12 meV harden in the
doped compounds in comparison to the parent CaFeAsF. While intermediate energy
phonon modes from 15 meV to 25 meV are also found to shift towards high
energies only in the 12 % Co doped CaFeAsF compound. The experimental results
for CaFe\_{1-x}Co\_{x}AsF (x = 0, 0.06, 0.12) are quite different from our
previous phonon studies on parent and superconducting MFe2As2 (M=Ba, Ca, Sr)
where low-energy acoustic phonon modes do not react with doping, while the
phonon spectra in the intermediate range from 15 to 25 K are found to soften in
these compounds. We argue that stronger spin phonon interaction play an
important role for the emergence of superconductivity in these compounds. The
lattice dynamics of CaFe\_{1-x}Co\_{x}AsF (x = 0, 0.06, 0.12) compounds is also
investigated using the ab-initio as well as shell model phonon calculations. We
show that the nature of the interaction between the Ca and the Fe-As layers in
CaFeAsF compounds is quite different compared with our previous studies on
CaFe2As2.
