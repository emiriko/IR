Data on B+ --> J/psi phi K+ and the Y(4140) enhancement recently reported by
the CDF collaboration [arxiv:0903.2229] are analysed. The threshold behaviour,
as well as traces of the X(4260) enhancement, the known c-cbar resonances
psi(2D), psi(4S), and a tentative psi(3D) state, as observed in the mass
distribution, suggest that the J/psi+phi system has quantum numbers JPC=1--. It
is then argued that the Y(4140) enhancement does not represent any kind of
resonance, but instead is a natural consequence of the opening of the J/psi+phi
channel.
