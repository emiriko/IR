The low-energy theory of graphene exhibits spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking due to pairing of quasiparticles and holes, corresponding to a
semimetal-insulator transition at strong Coulomb coupling. We report a Lattice
Monte Carlo study of the critical exponents of this transition as a function of
the number of Dirac flavors $N_f^{}$, finding $\delta = 1.25 \pm 0.05$ for
$N_f^{} = 0$, $\delta = 2.26 \pm 0.06$ for $N_f^{} = 2$ and $\delta = 2.62 \pm
0.11$ for $N_f^{} = 4$, with $\gamma \simeq 1$ throughout. We compare our
results with recent analytical work for graphene and closely related systems,
and discuss scenarios for the fate of the chiral transition at finite
temperature and carrier density, an issue of relevance for upcoming experiments
with suspended graphene samples.
