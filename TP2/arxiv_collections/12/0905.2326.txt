We describe the construction of the complete four-loop four-particle
amplitude of N=8 supergravity. The amplitude is ultraviolet finite, not only in
four dimensions, but in five dimensions as well. The observed extra
cancellations provide additional non-trivial evidence that N=8 supergravity in
four dimensions may be ultraviolet finite to all orders of perturbation theory.
