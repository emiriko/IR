Stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity are of great interest recently in
studying the spread of an infectious disease. The presented method solves an
inverse problem to discover the effectively decisive topology of a
heterogeneous network and reveal the transmission parameters which govern the
stochastic spreads over the network from a dataset on an infectious disease
outbreak in the early growth phase. Populations in a combination of
epidemiological compartment models and a meta-population network model are
described by stochastic differential equations. Probability density functions
are derived from the equations and used for the maximal likelihood estimation
of the topology and parameters. The method is tested with computationally
synthesized datasets and the WHO dataset on SARS outbreak.
