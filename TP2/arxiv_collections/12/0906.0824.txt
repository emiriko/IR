A giant diamagnetism in the Co$_{2}$CrAl compounds, in both bulk and thin
film, below a certain temperature ($T_z$) was observed. Above $T_z$, the
compound behaves as an ordinary ferromagnet. The diamagnetic alignment might be
initiated by the Landau diamagnetism because of the half-metallic properties
and the pinning of the diamagnetism is preserved by the peculiar electronic
structures.
