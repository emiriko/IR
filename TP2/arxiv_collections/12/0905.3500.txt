Thermal fluctuations provide the main source of large scale density
perturbations in warm inflationary models of the early universe. For the first
time, general results are obtained for the power spectrum in the case when the
friction coefficient in the inflaton equation of motion depends on temperature.
A large increase in the amplitude of perturbations occurs when the friction
coefficient increases with temperature. This has to be taken into account when
constructing models of warm inflation. New results are also given for the
thermal fluctuations in the weak regime of warm inflation when the friction
coefficient is relatively small.
