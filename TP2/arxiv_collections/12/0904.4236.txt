The histogram formed from published capture-rate measurements for the GALLEX
solar neutrino experiment is bimodal, showing two distinct peaks. On the other
hand, the histogram formed from published measurements derived from the similar
GNO experiment is unimodal, showing only one peak. However, the two experiments
differ in run durations: GALLEX runs are either three weeks or four weeks
(approximately) in duration, whereas GNO runs are all about four weeks in
duration. When we form 3-week and 4-week subsets of the GALLEX data, we find
that the relevant histograms are unimodal. The upper peak arises mainly from
the 3-week runs, and the lower peak from the 4-week runs. The 4-week subset of
the GALLEX dataset is found to be similar to the GNO dataset. A recent
re-analysis of GALLEX data leads to a unimodal histogram.
