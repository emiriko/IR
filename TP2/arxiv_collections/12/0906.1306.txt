We review recent results from the BABAR and Belle experiments on rare
electroweak B-meson decays, with emphasis on those occurring through flavor
changing neutral current interactions of the type b -> s l l. The recent
results include measurements of the isospin asymmetry and lepton
forward-backward asymmetry in B -> K* l+ l- decays from BABAR, a search for B
-> pi l+ l- from Belle, and searches for B \to K(*) nu anti-nu from BABAR. We
also briefly review the status of B0 -> l+ l- and B+ -> l+ nu searches.
