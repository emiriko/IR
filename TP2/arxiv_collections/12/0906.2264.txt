We investigate experimentally the entropy transfer between two
distinguishable atomic quantum gases at ultralow temperatures. Exploiting a
species-selective trapping potential, we are able to control the entropy of one
target gas in presence of a second auxiliary gas. With this method, we drive
the target gas into the degenerate regime in conditions of controlled
temperature by transferring entropy to the auxiliary gas. We envision that our
method could be useful both to achieve the low entropies required to realize
new quantum phases and to measure the temperature of atoms in deep optical
lattices. We verified the thermalization of the two species in a 1D lattice.
