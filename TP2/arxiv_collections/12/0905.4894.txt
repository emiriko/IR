Single crystalline Ba(Fe(1-x)TMx)2As2 (TM = Rh, Pd) series have been grown
and characterized by structural, thermodynamic and transport measurements.
These measurements show that the structural/magnetic phase transitions, found
in pure BaFe2As2 at 134 K, are suppressed monotonically by the doping and that
superconductivity can be stablized over a dome-like region.
Temperature-composition (T-x) phase diagrams based on electrical transport and
magnetization measurements are constructed and compared to those of the
Ba(Fe(1-x)TMx)2As2 (TM = Co, Ni) series. Despite the generic difference between
3d and 4d shells and the specific, conspicuous differences in the changes to
the unit cell parameters, the effects of Rh doping are exceptionally similar to
the effects of Co doping and the effects of Pd doping are exceptionally similar
to the effects of Ni doping. These data show that whereas the structural /
antiferromagnetic phase transition temperatures can be parameterized by x and
the superconducting transition temperature can be parameterized by some
combination of x and e, the number of extra electrons associated with the TM
doping, the transition temperatures of 3d- and 4d- doped BaFe2As2 can not be
simply parameterized by the changes in the unit cell dimensions or their
ratios.
