Recently, Horava formulated a renormalizable theory of quantum gravity that
reduces to general relativity at large distances but violates Lorentz
invariance at small distances. The absolute time involved in this theory allows
to define an objective notion of particles associated with quantization of
fields in classical gravitational backgrounds. The Unruh effect and other
observer-dependent notions of particles in curved space are interpreted as
effects caused by interaction between the objective vacuum and the measuring
apparatus made up of objective particles.
