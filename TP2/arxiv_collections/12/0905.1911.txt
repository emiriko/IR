The correlated fermionic many-particle system, near infinite scattering
length, reveals an underlying Heisenberg symmetry in one dimension, as compared
to an $SO(2,1)$ symmetry in two dimensions. This facilitates an exact map from
the interacting to the non-interacting system, both with and without a harmonic
trap, and explains the short-distance scaling behavior of the wave-function.
Taking advantage of the phenomenological Calogero-Sutherland-type interaction,
motivated by the density functional approach, we connect the ground-state
energy shift, to many-body correlation effect. For the excited states, modes at
integral values of the harmonic frequency $\omega$, are predicted in one
dimension, in contrast to the breathing modes with frequency $2\omega$ in two
dimensions.
