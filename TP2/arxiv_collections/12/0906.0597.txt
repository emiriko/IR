We demonstrate experimentally that a hybrid single-electron transistor with
superconducting leads and a normal-metal island can be refrigerated by an
alternating voltage applied to the gate electrode. The simultaneous measurement
of the dc current induced by the rf gate through the device at a small bias
voltage serves as an in-situ thermometer.
