The Tc map in parameter space of electron-phonon interaction $\lambda$ and
phonon frequency $\Omega$ is used to classify already known superconductors.
The Tc map is partitioned into six regions based on superconductors parameters
$\lambda$ and $\Omega$, We briefly discuss the properites of superconductors in
evey regionm The Tc map can be used as a useful tool to find and design new
superconductors with higher Tc and better properties for their real
applications.
