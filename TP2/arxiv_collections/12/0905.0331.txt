For a long time, no hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs have been known that have
effective temperature between 30 kK and < 45 kK, i.e. exceeding those of DB
white dwarfs and having lower ones than DO white dwarfs. Therefore, this
temperature range was long known as the DB-gap. Only recently, the SDSS
provided spectra of several candidate DB-gap stars. First analyses based on
model spectra calculated under the assumption of local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) confirmed that these stars had 30 kK < Teff < 45 kK
(Eisenstein et al. 2006). It has been shown for DO white dwarfs that the
relaxation of LTE is necessary to account for non local effects in the
atmosphere caused by the intense radiation field. Therefore, we calculated a
non-LTE model grid and re-analysed the aforementioned set of SDSS spectra. Our
results confirm the existence of DB-gap white dwarfs.
