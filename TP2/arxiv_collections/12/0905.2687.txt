Pion exchange in S-wave between hadrons that are themselves in a relative
S-wave can shift energies by hundreds of MeV. In the case of charmed mesons
$D,D^*,D_0,D_1$ a spectroscopy of quasi-molecular states may arise consistent
with enigmatic charmonium states observed above 4 GeV in $e^+e^-$ annihilation.
A possible explanation of $Y(4260)\to \psi\pi\pi$ and $Y(4360) \to \psi'\pi\pi$
is found. Searches in $D\bar{D}3\pi$ channels as well as B decays are
recommended to test this hypothesis.
