We demonstrate the correspondence between quantum mechanical and quantum
field theoretical descriptions of Mossbauer neutrino oscillations. First, we
compute the combined rate $\Gamma$ of Mossbauer neutrino emission, propagation,
and detection in quantum field theory, treating the neutrino as an internal
line of a tree level Feynman diagram. We include explicitly the effect of
homogeneous line broadening due to fluctuating electromagnetic fields in the
source and detector crystals and show that the resulting formula for $\Gamma$
is identical to the one obtained previously (Akhmedov et al., arXiv:0802.2513)
for the case of inhomogeneous line broadening. We then proceed to a quantum
mechanical treatment of Mossbauer neutrinos and show that the oscillation,
coherence, and resonance terms from the field theoretical result can be
reproduced if the neutrino is described as a superposition of Lorentz-shaped
wave packet with appropriately chosen energies and widths. On the other hand,
the emission rate and the detection cross section, including localization and
Lamb-Mossbauer terms, cannot be predicted in quantum mechanics and have to be
put in by hand.
