LHCb has been installed by spring 2008, followed by intensive testing and
commissioning of the system in order to be ready for first data taking. Despite
the horizontal geometry of the LHCb detector it was possible to collect over
one million useful cosmic events that allowed a first time alignment of the
sub-detectors. Moreover events from beam dumps during the LHC synchronisation
tests provided very useful data for further time and spacial alignment of the
detector. Here we present an overview of our commissioning activities, the
current status and an outlook on the startup in 2009.
