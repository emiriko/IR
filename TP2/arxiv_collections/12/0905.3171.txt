We study the spin-transfer torque and magnetoresistance of a
ferromagnet$\mid$superconductor$\mid$ferromagnet spin-valve, allowing for an
arbitrary magnetization misorientation and treating both s-wave and d-wave
symmetries of the superconductor. We take fully into account Andreev reflection
and also the spin-triplet correlations that are generated when the
magnetizations are non-collinear. It is found that the torque and
magnetoresistance are both strongly enhanced when topological zero-energy
states are present at the interfaces, which is the case for d-wave
superconductors with a crystallographic orientation of [110] relative to the
interface ($d_{xy}$-wave symmetry). Moreover, we find that the
magnetoresistance displays a strong oscillatory and non-monotonous behavior as
a function of $d_S/\xi$ where $d_S$ and $\xi$ are the interlayer width of the
superconducting region and the superconducting coherence length, respectively.
This feature is also attributed to the crossover from layers of size $d_S\sim
2\xi$ to layers of size $d_S\gg 2\xi$, where the contribution to transport from
zero-energy states gradually vanishes.
