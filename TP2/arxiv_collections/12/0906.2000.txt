The statistical distance between pure quantum states is obtained by finding a
measurement that is optimal in a sense defined by Wootters. As such, one may
expect that the statistical distance will turn out to be different if the set
of possible measurements is restricted in some way. It nonetheless turns out
that if the restriction is to local operations and classical communication
(LOCC) on any multipartite system, then the statistical distance is the same as
it is without restriction, being equal to the angle between the states in
Hilbert space.
