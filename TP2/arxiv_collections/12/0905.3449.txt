Obscured by their circumstellar dusty envelopes post-AGB stars emit a large
fraction of their energy in the infrared and thus, infrared sky surveys like
IRAS were essential for discoveries of post-AGBs in the past. Now, with the
AKARI infrared sky survey we can extend our knowledge about the late stages of
stellar evolution. The long-term goal of our work is to define new photometric
criteria to distinguish new post-AGB candidates from the AKARI data.
