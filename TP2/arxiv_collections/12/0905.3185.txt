The increasing size of the data recorded by the CDF and D{\O} experiments at
the Tevatron collider at $\sqrt{s}=$ 1.96 TeV makes the diboson physics program
more accessible for probes of the electroweak gauge structure in the Standard
Model. Here we summarize the most recent measurements of the diboson cross
sections and limits on the trilinear gauge boson couplings.
