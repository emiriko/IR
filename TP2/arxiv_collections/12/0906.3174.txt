We briefly review the various contexts within which one might address the
issue of ``why'' the dimensionless constants of Nature have the particular
values that they are observed to have. Both the general historical trend, in
physics, of replacing a-priori-given, absolute structures by dynamical
entities, and anthropic considerations, suggest that coupling ``constants''
have a dynamical nature. This hints at the existence of observable violations
of the Equivalence Principle at some level, and motivates the need for improved
tests of the Equivalence Principle.
