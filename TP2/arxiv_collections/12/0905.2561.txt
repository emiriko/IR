The process p-pbar -> Lambda_c-Antilambda_c is investigated within the
handbag approach. It is shown that the dominant dynamical mechanism,
characterized by the partonic subprocess u-ubar -> c-cbar factorizes in the
sense that only the subprocess contains highly virtual partons, a gluon to
lowest order of perturbative QCD, while the hadronic matrix elements embody
only soft scales and can be parameterized in terms of helicity flip and
non-flip generalized parton distributions. Modelling these parton distributions
by overlaps of light-cone wave functions for the involved baryons we are able
to predict cross sections and spin correlation parameters for the process of
interest.
