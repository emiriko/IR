We consider projections of points onto fundamental chambers of finite real
reflection groups. Our main result shows that for groups of type $A_n$, $B_n$,
and $D_n$, the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the reflection
arrangement are proportional to the spherical volumes of the sets of points
that are projected onto faces of a given dimension. We also provide strong
evidence that the same connection holds for the exceptional, and thus all,
reflection groups. These results naturally extend those of De Concini and
Procesi, Stembridge, and Denham which establish the relationship for
0-dimensional projections. This work is also of interest for the field of
order-restricted statistical inference, where projections of random points play
an important role.
