We introduce a simulation strategy to consistently couple continuum
biomembrane dynamics to the motion of discrete biological macromolecules
residing within or on the membrane. The methodology is used to study the
diffusion of integral membrane proteins that impart a curvature on the bilayer
surrounding them. Such proteins exhibit a substantial reduction in diffusion
coefficient relative to "flat" proteins; this effect is explained by elementary
hydrodynamic considerations.
