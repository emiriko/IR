With the idea of canceling the leading divergence in vacuum energy of
$\varphi^4$ field theory a parameter is introduced that interpolates between
free Hamiltonian with or without normal ordering. This leads to a condensate
ground state having an arbitrary number of particle-particle pairs. In addition
to the usual states, the condensate supports the states of negative energy and
negative norm. An explicit expression for the condensate state is derived and
perturbation theory with this state investigated. The propagator is modified
off the mass shell while unchanged on the mass shell. Lowest order correction
to the vacuum energy is calculated and conditions for cancelation of the
leading divergence investigated. One possible solution is that all radiative
corrections in this formulation vanish. The other possible solution implies a
phase transition above the coupling of $\frac{(2\pi)^2}{3}$ and the condensate
non-analytical in the coupling constant. Possible implications are discussed.
