Equilibrium and non-equilibrium relaxation behaviors of two-dimensional
superconducting arrays are investigated via numerical simulations at low
temperatures in the presence of incommensurate transverse magnetic fields, with
frustration parameter f= (3-\sqrt{5})/2. We find that the non-equilibrium
relaxation, beginning with random initial states quenched to low temperatures,
exhibits a three-stage relaxation of chirality autocorrelations. At the early
stage, the relaxation is found to be described by the von Schweidler form. Then
it exhibits power-law behavior in the intermediate time scale and faster decay
in the long-time limit, which together can be fitted to the Ogielski form; for
longer waiting times, this crosses over to a stretched exponential form. We
argue that the power-law behavior in the intermediate time scale may be
understood as a consequence of the coarsening behavior, leading to the local
vortex order corresponding to f=2/5 ground-state configurations. High mobility
of the vortices in the domain boundaries, generating slow wandering motion of
the domain walls, may provide mechanism of dynamic heterogeneity and account
for the long-time stretched exponential relaxation behavior. It is expected
that such meandering fluctuations of the low-temperature structure give rise to
finite resistivity at those low temperatures; this appears consistent with the
zero-temperature resistive transition in the limit of irrational frustration.
