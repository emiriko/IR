Dynamic structure of the intermediate state was studied in pinning-free thick
Pb strips using real-time magneto-optical visualization. It is found that
topological hysteresis can be lifted by applying sufficiently large current.
Namely, laminar structure that appears on flux exit in a static case is turned
into tubular when the sufficiently large transport current is present. Size and
distribution of the flux tubes in static and dynamic regimes are different.
Temperature, magnetic field and current phase diagram is discussed.
