We study the conductance through a triangular triple quantum dot, which are
connected to two noninteracting leads, using the numerical renormalization
group (NRG). It is found that the system shows a variety of Kondo effects
depending on the filling of the triangle. The SU(4) Kondo effect occurs at
half-filling, and a sharp conductance dip due to a phase lapse appears in the
gate-voltage dependence. Furthermore, when four electrons occupy the three
sites on average, a local S=1 moment, which is caused by the Nagaoka mechanism,
is induced along the triangle. The temperature dependence of the entropy and
spin susceptibility of the triangle shows that this moment is screened by the
conduction electrons via two separate stages at different temperatures. The
two-terminal and four-terminal conductances show a clear difference at the gate
voltages, where the SU(4) or the S=1 Kondo effects occurring.
