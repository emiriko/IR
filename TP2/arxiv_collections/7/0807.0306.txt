The dynamics of loops at the DNA denaturation transition is studied. A
scaling argument is used to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the
autocorrelation function of the state of complementary bases (either open or
closed). The long-time asymptotic behavior of the autocorrelation function is
expressed in terms of the entropy exponent, c, of a loop. The validity of the
scaling argument is tested using a microscopic model of an isolated loop and a
toy model of interacting loops. This suggests a method for measuring the
entropy exponent using single-molecule experiments such as florescence
correlation spectroscopy.
