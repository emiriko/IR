Any Spin(7)-manifold admits a metric connection \nabla^c with totally
skew-symmetric torsion T^c preserving the underlying structure. We classify
those with \nabla^c-parallel T^c\neq0 and non-Abelian isotropy algebra
iso(T^c)<spin(7). These are isometric to either Riemannian products or
homogeneous naturally reductive spaces, each admitting two \nabla^c-parallel
spinor fields.
