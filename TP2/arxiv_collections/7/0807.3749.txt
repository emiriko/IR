We consider self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on the backbone of percolation
clusters in space dimensions d=2, 3, 4. Applying numerical simulations, we show
that the whole multifractal spectrum of singularities emerges in exploring the
peculiarities of the model. We obtain estimates for the set of critical
exponents, that govern scaling laws of higher moments of the distribution of
percolation cluster sites visited by SAWs, in a good correspondence with an
appropriately summed field-theoretical \varepsilon=6-d-expansion (H.-K. Janssen
and O. Stenull, Phys. Rev. E 75, 020801(R) (2007)).
