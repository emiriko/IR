We find the allowed complex numbers associated with the inner product of N
equally separated pure quantum states. The allowed areas on the unitary complex
plane have the form of petals. A point inside the petal-shape represents a set
of N linearly independent (LI) pure states, and a point on the edge of that
area represents a set of N linearly dependent (LD) pure states. For each one of
those LI sets we study the complete discrimination of its N equi-separated
states combining sequentially the two known strategies: first the unambiguous
identification protocol for LI states, followed, if necessary, by the
error-minimizing measurement scheme for LD states. We find that the
probabilities of success for both unambiguous and ambiguous discrimination
procedures depend on both the module and the phase of the involved inner
product complex number. We show that, with respect to the phase-parameter, the
maximal probability of discriminating unambiguously the N non-orthogonal pure
states holds just when there no longer be probability of obtaining ambiguously
information about the prepared state by applying the second protocol if the
first one was not successful.
