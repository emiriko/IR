We report the generation of a type-I multimode two-photon state on a rubidium
D$_2$ line (780 nm) using periodically poled KTiOPO$_4$ crystals. With a
degenerate optical parametric oscillator far below threshold, we observe an
oscillatory correlation function, the cross-correlation between two photons
shows a cavity bandwidth of about 7.8 MHz. We also use a
Fabry-P$\acute{\rm{e}}$rot etalon to filter its most longitudinal modes and
observe its time correlation function. The experimental data are well fitted to
theoretical curves. This system could be utilized for demonstrating storage and
retrieval of narrowband photons in Rb atomic ensembles, which is important for
long-distance quantum communication.
