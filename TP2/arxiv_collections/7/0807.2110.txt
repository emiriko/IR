We introduce an extended version of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (FOU)
process where the integrand is replaced by the exponential of an independent
L\'evy process. We call the process the generalized fractional
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (GFOU) process. Alternatively, the process can be
constructed from a generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (GOU) process using an
independent fractional Brownian motion (FBM) as integrator. We show that the
GFOU process is well-defined by checking the existence of the integral included
in the process, and investigate its properties. It is proved that the process
has a stationary version and exhibits long memory. We also find that the
process satisfies a certain stochastic differential equation. Our underlying
intention is to introduce long memory into the GOU process which has short
memory without losing the possibility of jumps. Note that both FOU and GOU
processes have found application in a variety of fields as useful alternatives
to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process.
