When applied to different input states, an imperfect quantum operation yields
output states with varying fidelities, defined as the absolute square of their
overlap with the desired states. We present an expression for the distribution
of fidelities for a class of operations applied to a general qubit state, and
we present general expressions for the variance and input-space averaged
fidelities of arbitrary linear maps on finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
