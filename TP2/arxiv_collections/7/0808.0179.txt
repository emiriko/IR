Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Papapetrou, Weinberg, and M{\o}ller
energy-momentum prescriptions in general spherically symmetric space-times are
investigated. It is shown that for two special but not unusual classes of
general spherically symmetric space-times several energy-momentum prescriptions
in Schwarzschild Cartesian coordinates lead to some coincidences in energy
distribution. It is also obtained that for a special class of spherically
symmetric metrics M{\o}ller and Einstein energy-momentum prescriptions give the
same result for energy distribution if and only if it has a specific dependence
on radial coordinate.
