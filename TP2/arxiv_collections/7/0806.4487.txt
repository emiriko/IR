Let M be a matroid representable over a (partial) field P and B a matrix
representable over a sub-partial field P' of P. We say that B confines M to P'
if, whenever a P-representation matrix A of M has a submatrix B, A is a scaled
P'-matrix. We show that, under some conditions on the partial fields, on M, and
on B, verifying whether B confines M to P' amounts to a finite check. A
corollary of this result is Whittle's Stabilizer Theorem.
  A combination of the Confinement Theorem and the Lift Theorem from
arXiv:0804.3263 leads to a short proof of Whittle's characterization of the
matroids representable over GF(3) and other fields.
  We also use a combination of the Confinement Theorem and the Lift Theorem to
prove a characterization, in terms of representability over partial fields, of
the 3-connected matroids that have k inequivalent representations over GF(5),
for k = 1, ..., 6.
  Additionally we give, for a fixed matroid M, an algebraic construction of a
partial field P_M and a representation A over P_M such that every
representation of M over a partial field P is equal to f(A) for some
homomorphism f:P_M->P. Using the Confinement Theorem we prove an algebraic
analog of the theory of free expansions by Geelen et al.
