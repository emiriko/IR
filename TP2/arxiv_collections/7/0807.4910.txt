Analogue models for gravity intend to provide a framework where matter and
gravity, as well as their intertwined dynamics, emerge from degrees of freedom
that have a priori nothing to do with what we call gravity or matter. Bose
Einstein condensates (BEC) are a natural example of analogue model since one
can identify matter propagating on a (pseudo-Riemannian) metric with collective
excitations above the condensate of atoms. However, until now, a description of
the "analogue gravitational dynamics" for such model was missing. We show here
that in a BEC system with massive quasi-particles, the gravitational dynamics
can be encoded in a modified (semi-classical) Poisson equation. In particular,
gravity is of extreme short range (characterized by the healing length) and the
cosmological constant appears from the non-condensed fraction of atoms in the
quasi-particle vacuum. While some of these features make the analogue
gravitational dynamics of our BEC system quite different from standard
Newtonian gravity, we nonetheless show that it can be used to draw some
interesting lessons about "emergent gravity" scenarios.
