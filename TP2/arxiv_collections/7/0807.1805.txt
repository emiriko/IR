One of the most challenging issues in the characterization of magnetic
materials is to obtain quantitative analysis on the nanometer scale. Here we
describe how electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) measurements using the
transmission electron microscope (TEM) can be used for that purpose, utilizing
reciprocal space maps. Applying the EMCD sum rules, an orbital to spin moment
ratio of $m_L/m_S=0.08 \pm 0.01$ is obtained for Fe, which is consistent with
the commonly accepted value. Hence, we establish EMCD as a quantitative element
specific technique for magnetic studies, using a widely available instrument
with superior spatial resolution.
