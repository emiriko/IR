We present an improved parallel algorithm for the enumeration of fixed
benzenoids B_h containing h hexagonal cells. We can thus extend the enumeration
of B_h from the previous best h=35 up to h=50. Analysis of the associated
generating function confirms to a very high degree of certainty that $B_h \sim
A \kappa^h /h$ and we estimate that the growth constant $\kappa =
5.161930154(8)$ and the amplitude $A=0.2808499(1)$.
