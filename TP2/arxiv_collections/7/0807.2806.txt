Starting from the canonical phase space for discretised (4d) BF-theory, we
implement a canonical version of the simplicity constraints and construct phase
spaces for simplicial geometries. Our construction allows us to study the
connection between different versions of Regge calculus and approaches using
connection variables, such as loop quantum gravity. We find that on a fixed
triangulation the (gauge invariant) phase space associated to loop quantum
gravity is genuinely larger than the one for length and even area Regge
calculus. Rather, it corresponds to the phase space of area-angle Regge
calculus, as defined by Dittrich and Speziale in [arXiv:0802.0864] (prior to
the imposition of gluing constraints, that ensure the metricity of the
triangulation). We argue that this is due to the fact that the simplicity
constraints are not fully implemented in canonical loop quantum gravity.
Finally, we show that for a subclass of triangulations one can construct first
class Hamiltonian and Diffeomorphism constraints leading to flat 4d
space-times.
