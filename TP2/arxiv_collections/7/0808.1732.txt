Adding grains at a single site on a flat substrate in the Abelian sandpile
models produce beautiful complex patterns. We study in detail the pattern
produced by adding grains on a two-dimensional square lattice with directed
edges (each site has two arrows directed inward and two outward), starting with
a periodic background with half the sites occupied. The size of the pattern
formed scales with the number of grains added $N$ as $\sqrt{N}$. We give exact
characterization of the asymptotic pattern, in terms of the position and shape
of different features of the pattern.
