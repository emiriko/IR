The first 52 fs of a time evolution of the electron density in OCS after an
interaction with an intense sub 10 fs laser pulse are studied using the
time-dependent density functional theory. The nuclear motion in this linear
trimer is simulated by the classical molecular dynamics method. Laser fields of
intensity 10^{13} W/cm^2 and 10^{15} W/cm^2 are used. Details of the laser
induced changes of the structure, as well as the ionization rate are sensitive
to the applied field intensity and its polarization. It is found that under
suitable conditions the OCS molecule bends soon after an interaction with a
laser pulse. A deviation from the linear geometry of up to 23.6^\circ and
charged ions of up to +3 are observed. The time evolution of electric dipole
moments and the time-dependent electron localization function (ELF) are also
studied.
