We develop practical schemes for the measurement of the covariance matrix for
intrinsic angular-momentum variables in quantum optics. We particularize this
approach to two-beam polarimetry and interferometry, as well as to ensembles of
two-level atoms interacting with classical fields. We show the practical
advantages of noisy simultaneous measurements.
