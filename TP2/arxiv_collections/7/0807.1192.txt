In this paper we show a systematical method to obtain exact solutions of the
nonautonomous nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. An integrable condition
is first obtained by the Painlev\`e analysis, which is shown to be consistent
with that obtained by the Lax pair method. Under this condition, we present a
general transformation, which can directly convert all allowed exact solutions
of the standard NLS equation into the corresponding exact solutions of the
nonautonomous NLS equation. The method is quite powerful since the standard NLS
equation has been well studied in the past decades and its exact solutions are
vast in the literature. The result provides an effective way to control the
soliton dynamics. Finally, the fundamental bright and dark solitons are taken
as examples to demonstrate its explicit applications.
