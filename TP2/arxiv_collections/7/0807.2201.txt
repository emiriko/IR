A complete survey is presented of all half-life and branching-ratio
measurements related to the isospin T = 1/2 mirror beta transitions ranging
from 3He to 83Mo. No measurements are ignored, although some are rejected for
cause. Using the decay energies obtained in the 2003 Mass Evaluation
experimental ft values are then determined for the transitions up to 45V. For
the first time also all associated theoretical corrections needed to convert
these results into "corrected" Ft values, similar to the superallowed 0+ -> 0+
pure Fermi beta transitions, were calculated. Precisions of the resulting
values are in most cases between 0.1 % and 0.4 %. These Ft(mirror) values can
now be used to extract precise weak interaction information from past and
ongoing correlation measurements in the beta decay of the T = 1/2 mirror beta
transitions.
