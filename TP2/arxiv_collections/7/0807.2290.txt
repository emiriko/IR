We investigated the effects of temperature and magnetic field on the
electronic structure of hexagonal RMnO3 (R = Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho) thin films
using optical spectroscopy. As the magnetic ordering of the system was
disturbed, a systematic change in the electronic structure was commonly
identified in this series. The optical absorption peak near 1.7 eV showed an
unexpectedly large shift of more than 150 meV from 300 K to 15 K, accompanied
by an anomaly of the shift at the Neel temperature. The magnetic field
dependent measurement clearly revealed a sizable shift of the corresponding
peak when a high magnetic field was applied. Our findings indicated strong
coupling between the magnetic ordering and the electronic structure in the
multiferroic hexagonal RMnO3 compounds.
