This paper considers interactions between cellular automata and cryptology.
It is known that non-linear elementary rule which is correlation-immune don't
exist. This results limits the use of cellular automata as pseudo-random
generators suitable for cryptographic applications. In addition, for this kind
of pseudo-random generators, a successful cryptanalysis was proposed by Meier
and Staffelbach. However, other ways to design cellular automata capable to
generate good pseudo-random sequences remain and will be discussed in the end
of this article.
