In random matrix theory (RMT), the Tracy-Widom (TW) distribution describes
the behavior of the largest eigenvalue. We consider here two models in which TW
undergoes transformations. In the first one disorder is introduced in the
Gaussian ensembles by superimposing an external source of randomness. A
competition between TW and a normal (Gaussian) distribution results, depending
on the spreading of the disorder. The second model consists in removing at
random a fraction of (correlated) eigenvalues of a random matrix. The usual
formalism of Fredholm determinants extends naturally. A continuous transition
from TW to the Weilbull distribution, characteristc of extreme values of an
uncorrelated sequence, is obtained.
