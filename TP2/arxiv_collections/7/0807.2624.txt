Very recently, the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) of single electrons
in quantum dots was discovered by three independent experimental groups.
Remarkably, these observations revealed three different mechanisms of EDSR:
coupling of electron spin to its momentum (spin-orbit), to the operator of its
position (inhomogeneous Zeeman coupling), and to the hyperfine Overhauser field
of nuclear spins. In this paper, I present a unified microscopic theory of
these resonances in quantum dots. A mean field theory, derived for all three
mechanisms and based on retaining only two-spin correlators, justifies applying
macroscopic description of nuclear polarization to the EDSR theory. In the
framework of the mean field theory, a fundamental difference in the time
dependence of EDSR inherent of these mechanisms is revealed; it changes from
the Rabi-type oscillations to a nearly monotonic growth. The theory provides a
regular procedure to account for the higher nuclear-spin correlators that
become of importance for a wider time span and can change the asymptotic
behavior of EDSR. It also allows revealing the effect of electron spin dynamics
on the effective coupling between nuclear spins.
