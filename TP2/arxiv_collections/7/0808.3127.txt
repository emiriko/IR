Analysis of the electronic structure of an ordinary two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) under an appropriate external periodic potential of hexagonal
symmetry reveals that massless Dirac fermions are generated near the corners of
the supercell Brillouin zone. The required potential parameters are found to be
achievable under or close to laboratory conditions. Moreover, the group
velocity is tunable by changing either the effective mass of the 2DEG or the
lattice parameter of the external potential, and it is insensitive to the
potential amplitude. The finding should provide a new class of systems other
than graphene for investigating and exploiting massless Dirac fermions using
2DEGs in semiconductors.
