We propose a new method to embed data in binary images, including scanned
text, figures, and signatures. Our method relies on the concept of wet paper
codes. The shuffling before embedding is used in order to equalize irregular
embedding capacity from diverse areas in the image. The hidden data can be
extracted without the original binary image. We illustrate some examples of
watermarked binary images after wet paper coding.
