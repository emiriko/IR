We consider random walks (RWs) and self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on disordered
lattices directly at the percolation threshold. Applying numerical simulations,
we study the scaling behavior of the models on the incipient percolation
cluster in space dimensions d=2, 3, 4. Our analysis yields estimates of
universal exponents, governing the scaling laws for configurational properties
of RWs and SAWs.
