We have searched for time modulation of the electron capture decay
probability of $^{142}$Pm in an attempt to confirm a recent claim from a group
at the Gesellschaft f\"{u}r Schwerionenforschung (GSI). We produced $^{142}$Pm
via the $^{124}$Sn($^{23}$Na, 5n)$^{142}$Pm reaction at the Berkeley 88-Inch
Cyclotron with a bombardment time short compared to the reported modulation
period. Isotope selection by the Berkeley Gas-filled Separator is followed by
implantation and a long period of monitoring the $^{142}$Nd K$_{\alpha}$ x-rays
from the daughter. The decay time spectrum of the x-rays is well-described by a
simple exponential and the measured half-life of 40.68(53) seconds is
consistent with the accepted value. We observed no oscillatory modulation at
the proposed frequency at a level 31 times smaller than that reported by
Litvinov {\it et al.} (Phys. Lett. B 664 (2008) 162; arXiv:0801.2079
[nucl-ex]). A literature search for previous experiments that might have been
sensitive to the reported modulation uncovered another example in $^{142}$Eu
electron-capture decay. A reanalysis of the published data shows no oscillatory
behavior.
