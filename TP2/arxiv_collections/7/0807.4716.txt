A continuous time cluster algorithm for two-level systems coupled to a
dissipative bosonic bath is presented and applied to the sub-ohmic spin-Boson
model. When the power s of the spectral function J(w) \propto w^s is smaller
than 1/2, the critical exponents are found to be classical, mean-field like.
Potential sources for the discrepancy with recent renormalization group
predictions are traced back to the effect of a dangerously irrelevant variable.
