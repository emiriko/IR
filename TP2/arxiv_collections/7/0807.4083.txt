Constancy of the speed of light together with the Hubble law lead in a
doctrine of expanding universe to a conclusion that universe evolution is not
only an expansion of space but also a deceleration of the course of physical
time (Taganov, 2003). Duration of any physical process measured by decelerating
physical time is always longer, than corresponding duration, measured by a
scale of invariable uniform Newtonian time. All the processes uniform or
moderately decelerating in physical time appear accelerating when interpreted
in terms of uniform invariable Newtonian time. The article describes several
observational evidences of a phenomenon of the cosmological deceleration of
time: the redshift survey of distant supernovae demonstrates apparent
acceleration of the universe expansion; accelerations in the Earth-Moon system
reveal reliable differences if estimated with the use of ancient and
contemporary astronomical data. Deceleration of the physical time reveals
itself in isotopic chronology by systematic divergence of samples Newtonian
ages, estimated with the use of isotopes with different rates of decay.
