A new iron arsenide superconducting system LiFeAs was found that crystallizes
into a tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm. The superconductivity with
Tc up to 18 K was observed in the compounds. This simple 111 type layered iron
arsenide superconductor can be viewed as an analogue of the infinite layer
structure of copper oxides.
