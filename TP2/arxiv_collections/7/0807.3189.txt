The models constructed by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki describe a
family of quantum antiferromagnets on arbitrary lattices, where the local spin
S is an integer multiple M of half the lattice coordination number. The equal
time quantum correlations in their ground states may be computed as finite
temperature correlations of a classical O(3) model on the same lattice, where
the temperature is given by T=1/M. In dimensions d=1 and d=2 this mapping
implies that all AKLT states are quantum disordered. We consider AKLT states in
d=3 where the nature of the AKLT states is now a question of detail depending
upon the choice of lattice and spin; for sufficiently large S some form of Neel
order is almost inevitable. On the unfrustrated cubic lattice, we find that all
AKLT states are ordered while for the unfrustrated diamond lattice the minimal
S=2 state is disordered while all other states are ordered. On the frustrated
pyrochlore lattice, we find (conservatively) that several states starting with
the minimal S=3 state are disordered. The disordered AKLT models we report here
are a significant addition to the catalog of magnetic Hamiltonians in d=3 with
ground states known to lack order on account of strong quantum fluctuations.
