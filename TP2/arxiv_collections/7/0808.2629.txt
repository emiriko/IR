We extend Sklyanin's construction of commuting open-chain transfer matrices
to the SU(2|2) bulk and boundary S-matrices of AdS/CFT. Using the graded
version of the S-matrices leads to a transfer matrix of particularly simple
form. We also find an SU(1|1) boundary S-matrix which has one free boundary
parameter.
