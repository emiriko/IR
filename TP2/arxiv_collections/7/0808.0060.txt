Noninvasive, non-contact and \textit{in vivo} monitoring of blood glucose is
a long needed pathology tool for saving patients from recurring pain and hassle
that can accompany conventional blood glucose testing methods. Optical
coherence tomography known for its high axial resolution imaging modality is
adopted in this article for monitoring glucose levels in tissue like media
non-invasively. Making use of changes in reduced scattering coefficient due to
the refractive-index mismatch between the extracellular fluid and the cellular
membranes and armed with a theoretical model, we establish a correlation
between the glucose concentration and reduced scattering coefficient. The
scattering coefficients are extracted from the deconvoluted interference signal
by using Monte-Carlo simulation with valid approximations. A program code using
NI LabVIEW(^{TM}) is developed for automation of the experiment, data
acquisition and analysis.
