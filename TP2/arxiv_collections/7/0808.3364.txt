We apply statistical physics to study the task of resource allocation in
random sparse networks with limited bandwidths for the transportation of
resources along the links. Useful algorithms are obtained from recursive
relations. Bottlenecks emerge when the bandwidths are small, causing an
increase in the fraction of idle links. For a given total bandwidth per node,
the efficiency of allocation increases with the network connectivity. In the
high connectivity limit, we find a phase transition at a critical bandwidth,
above which clusters of balanced nodes appear, characterised by a profile of
homogenized resource allocation similar to the Maxwell's construction.
