A dense form of matter is formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The
constituent degrees of freedom in this dense matter are currently unknown.
Long-range, forward-backward multiplicity correlations (LRC) are expected to
arise due to multiple partonic interactions. Model independent and dependent
arguments suggest that such correlations are due to multiple partonic
interactions. These correlations are predicted in the context of the Dual
Parton Model (DPM). The DPM describes soft partonic processes and
hadronization. This model indicates that the underlying mechanism creating
these long-range multiplicity correlations in the bulk matter is due to
multiple partonic interactions.
  In this thesis, long-range multiplicity correlations have been studied in
heavy ion (Au+Au and Cu+Cu) and hadron-hadron ({\it pp}) collisions. The
behavior has been studied as a function of pseudorapidity gap ($\Delta\eta$)
about $\eta$ = 0, the centrality, atomic number, and incident energy dependence
of the colliding particles. Strong, long-range correlations ($\Delta\eta >$
1.0) as a function of $\Delta\eta$ are found for central collisions of %(full
overlap) heavy ions at an energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. This indicates
substantial amounts of dense partonic matter are formed in central heavy ion
collisions at an energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.
