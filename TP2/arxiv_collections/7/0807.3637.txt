We report excited-state spectroscopy on a quantum dot side-coupled to a
quantum wire with accurate energy estimation. Our method utilizes periodic
voltage pulses on the dot, and the energy calibration is performed with
reference to the bias voltage across the wire. We demonstrate the observation
of the orbital excited state and the Zeeman splitting in a single dot.
