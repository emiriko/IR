We study coherent control in the vicinity of metallic nanostructures. Unlike
in the case of control in gas or liquid phase, the collective response of
electrons in a metallic nanostructure can significantly enhance different
frequency components of the control field. This enhancement strongly depends on
the geometry of the nanostructure and can substantially modify the temporal
profile of the local control field. The changes in the amplitude and phase of
the control field near the nanostructure are studied using linear response
theory. The inverse problem of finding the external electromagnetic field to
generate the desired local control field is considered and solved.
