We review the status of models of electroweak symmetry breaking in a slice of
anti--de Sitter space. These models can be thought of as dual to strongly
interacting theories of the electroweak scale. After an introduction to some
generic issues in bulk theories in AdS5, we concentrate on the model-building
of the Higgs sector.
