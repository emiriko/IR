Identified charged particle spectra of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$ and
$\pbar$ at mid-rapidity ($|y|<0.1$) measured by the $\dedx$ method in the
STAR-TPC are reported for $pp$ and d+Au collisions at $\snn = 200$ GeV and for
Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV, 130 GeV, and 200 GeV. ... [Shortened for arXiv
