Subsequent to our recent report of SDW type transition at 190 K and
antiferromagnetic order below 20 K in EuFe2As2, we have studied the effect of
K-doping on the SDW transition at high temperature and AF order at low
temperature. 50% K doping suppresses the SDW transition and in turn gives rise
to high-temperature superconductivity below T_c = 32 K, as observed in the
electrical resistivity, AC susceptibility as well as magnetization. A well
defined anomaly in the specific heat provides additional evidence for bulk
superconductivity.
