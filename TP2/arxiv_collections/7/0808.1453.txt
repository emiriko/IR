Using molecular dynamics simulation, we study structural and dynamical
heterogeneities at melting in two-dimensional one-component systems with 36000
particles. Between crystal and liquid we find intermediate hexatic states,
where the density fluctuations are enhanced at small wave number k as well as
those of the six-fold orientational order parameter. Their structure factors
both grow up to the smallest wave number equal to the inverse system length.
The intermediate scattering function of the density S(k,t) is found to relax
exponentially with decay rate Gamma_k ~ k^z with z~2.6 at small k in the
hexatic phase.
