This keynote paper: presents a 21st century vision of computing; identifies
various computing paradigms promising to deliver the vision of computing
utilities; defines Cloud computing and provides the architecture for creating
market-oriented Clouds by leveraging technologies such as VMs; provides
thoughts on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both
customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain
SLA-oriented resource allocation; presents some representative Cloud platforms
especially those developed in industries along with our current work towards
realising market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds by leveraging the 3rd
generation Aneka enterprise Grid technology; reveals our early thoughts on
interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating an atmospheric computing
environment along with pointers to future community research; and concludes
with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms for delivering our 21st
century vision.
