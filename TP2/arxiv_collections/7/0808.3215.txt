We have recently developed a self-consistent theory of Strong-Coupling in the
presence of an incoherent pumping [arXiv:0807.3194] and shown how it could
reproduce quantitatively the experimental data [PRL 101, 083601 (2008)]. Here,
we summarize our main results, provide the detailed analysis of the fitting of
the experiment and discuss how the field should now evolve beyond merely
qualitative expectations, that could well be erroneous even when they seem to
be firmly established.
