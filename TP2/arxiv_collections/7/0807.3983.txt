Pulsar glitches are a potential source of gravitational waves for current and
future interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Some pulsar glitch events
were observed by radio and X-ray telescopes during the fifth LIGO science run.
It is expected that glitches from these same pulsars should also be seen in the
future. We carried out Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the sensitivity of
possible gravitational wave signals associated with a pulsar glitch using a
coherent network analysis method. We show the detection efficiency and evaluate
the reconstruction accuracy of gravitational waveforms using a matched filter
analysis on the estimated gravitational waveforms from the coherent analysis
algorithm.
