We report the first experimental demonstration of even-order aberration
cancellation in quantum interferometry. The effect is a spatial counterpart of
the spectral group velocity dispersion cancellation, which is associated with
spectral entanglement. It is manifested in temporal interferometry by virtue of
the multi-parameter spatial-spectral entanglement. Spatially-entangled photons,
generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion, were subjected to spatial
aberrations introduced by a deformable mirror that modulates the wavefront. We
show that only odd-order spatial aberrations affect the quality of quantum
interference.
