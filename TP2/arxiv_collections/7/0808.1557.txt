We report the observation of superconductivity in La3Ni4P4O2 at 2.2 K. The
layer stacking in this compound results in an asymmetric distribution of charge
reservoir layers around the Ni2P2 planes. The estimated Wilson ratio, Rw ~ 5,
indicates the presence of a strongly enhanced normal state susceptibility, but
many of the basic superconducting characteristics are conventional. The
estimated electronic contribution to the specific heat, gamma ~ 6.2 mJ
mol-Ni^-1K^-2, is about 2/3 of that found in layered nickel borocarbide
superconductors.
