Quarkyonic matter is a new phase of QCD at finite temperature and density
which is distinct from the confined and de-confined phases. Its existence is
unambiguously argued in the large number of colors limit in QCD. Hints of its
existence for 3 color QCD are shown in lattice Monte-Carlo data and heavy ion
experiments.
