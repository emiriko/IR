Different criteria of constructing clusters and tracing back $\Delta$
resonances from the intermediate-energy neutron-rich HICs are discussed by
employing the updated UrQMD transport model. It is found that both the
phase-space and the coordinate-density criteria affect the single and the
double neutron/proton ratios of free nucleons at small transverse momenta, but
the influence becomes invisible at large transverse momenta. The effect of
different methods of reconstructing freeze-out $\Delta$s on the
$\Delta^0/\Delta^{++}$ ratio is strong in a large kinetic energy region.
