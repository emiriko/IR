The question of whether collider produced of subnuclear black holes might
constitute a catastrophic risk is explored in a model of Casadio & Harms (2002)
that treats them as quantum-mechanical objects. A plausible scenario in which
these black holes accrete ambient matter at the Eddington limit shortly after
their production, thereby emitting Hawking radiation that would be harmful to
Earth and/or CERN and its surroundings, is described. Such black holes are
shown to remain undetectable in existing astrophysical observations and thus
evade a recent exclusion of risks from subnuclear black holes by Giddings &
Mangano (2008) and and a similar one by Koch et al. (2009). I further question
that these risk analyses are complete for the reason that they exclude
plausible black-hole parameter ranges from safety consideration without giving
any reason. Some feasible operational measures at colliders are proposed that
would allow the lowering of any remaining risk probability.
  Giddings & Mangano drew different general conclusions only because they made
different initial assumptions about the properties of microscopic black holes,
not because any of their technical conclusions are incorrect. A critical
comment by Giddings & Mangano (2008) on the present paper and a preprint by
Casadio et al.(2009) - that presents a treatment of the present issue with
methods and assumptions similar to mine - are addressed in appendices.
