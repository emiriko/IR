We propose and analyze inter-edge tunneling in a quantum spin Hall corner
junction as a means to probe the helical nature of the edge states. We show
that electron-electron interactions in the one-dimensional helical edge states
result in Luttinger parameters for spin and charge that are intertwined, and
thus rather different than those for a quantum wire with spin rotation
invariance. Consequently, we find that the four-terminal conductance in a
corner junction has a distinctive form that could be used as evidence for the
helical nature of the edge states.
