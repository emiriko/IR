The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is an important operator which acts on
the Hilbert space of complex valued functions on the ring Z/NZ. In the case
where N=p is an odd prime number, we exhibit a canonical basis of eigenvectors
for the DFT. The transition matrix from the standard basis to the canonical
basis defines a novel transform which we call the discrete oscillator transform
(DOT for short). Finally, we describe a fast algorithm for computing the
discrete oscillator transform in certain cases.
