A general expression for the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) in the s-wave
superconducting state at finite temperatures is derived. Based on the
expression, we study the SHC in a two-dimensional electron gas model in the
presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI). The SHC is zero in the normal
state, whereas it takes a large negative value as soon as the superconductivity
occurs, due to the change in the quasiparticle contributions. Since this
remarkable behavior is independent of the strength of the SOI, it will be
widely observed in thin films of superconductors with surface-induced Rashba
SOI, or in various non-centrosymmetric superconductors.
