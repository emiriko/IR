Many signals in Nature, technology and experiment have a multi-component
structure. By spectral decomposition and projection on the eigenvectors of a
family of unitary operators, a robust method is developed to decompose a
signals in its components. Different signal traits may be emphasized by
different choices of the unitary family. The method is illustrated in simulated
data and on data obtained from plasma reflectometry experiments in the tore
Supra.
