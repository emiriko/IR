This paper calculates the general form of a 5d metric when fundamental string
and momentum charges are added. This is accomplished using the standard method
of boosting and T-dualising a solution to Einstein's equations, where the
solution has three Killing vectors and is expressed in a generic form. The
thermodynamical properties of the charged solution are derived and the physical
implications of the solution are then examined with the two-charge dual
spinning black ring being used as an example.
