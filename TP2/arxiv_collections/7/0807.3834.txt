The $e p\to e^\prime p \rho^0$ reaction has been measured, using the 5.754
GeV electron beam of Jefferson Lab and the CLAS detector. This represents the
largest ever set of data for this reaction in the valence region. Integrated
and differential cross sections are presented. The $W$, $Q^2$ and $t$
dependences of the cross section are compared to theoretical calculations based
on $t$-channel meson-exchange Regge theory on the one hand and on quark handbag
diagrams related to Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) on the other hand.
The Regge approach can describe at the $\approx$ 30% level most of the features
of the present data while the two GPD calculations that are presented in this
article which succesfully reproduce the high energy data strongly underestimate
the present data. The question is then raised whether this discrepancy
originates from an incomplete or inexact way of modelling the GPDs or the
associated hard scattering amplitude or whether the GPD formalism is simply
inapplicable in this region due to higher-twists contributions, incalculable at
present.
