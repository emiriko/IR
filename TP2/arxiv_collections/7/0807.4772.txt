We present an explicit unified stochastic model of fluctuations in population
size due to random birth, death, density-dependent competition and
environmental fluctuations. Stochastic dynamics provide insight into small
populations, including processes such as extinction, that cannot be correctly
treated by deterministic methods. We present exact analytical and
simulation-based results for extinction times of our stochastic model and
compare the different effects of environmental stochasticity and intrinsic
demographic stochasticity. We use both the discrete master equation approach
and an exact mapping to a Fokker-Planck equation (the Poisson method) and
stochastic equation, showing they are precisely equivalent. We also calculate
approximate extinction times using a steepest descent method. This model can
readily be extended to accommodate metapopulation structure and genetic
variation in the population and thus represents a step towards a
microscopically explicit synthesis of population dynamics and population
genetics.
