We suggest a method to create turbulence in a trapped atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC). By replacing in the upper half part of our box the wave
function, Psi, with its complex conjugate, Psi^{*}, new negative vortices are
introduced into the system. The simulations are performed by solving the
two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (2D GPE). We study the successive
dynamics of the wave function by monitoring the evolution of density and phase
profile.
