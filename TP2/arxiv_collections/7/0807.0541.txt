We consider a class of entangled states of a quantum system (S) and a second
system (A) where pure states of the former are correlated with mixed states of
the latter, and work out the entanglement measure with reference to the nearest
separable state. Such `pure-mixed' entanglement is expected when the system S
interacts with a macroscopic measuring apparatus in a quantum measurement,
where the quantum correlation is destroyed in the process of
environment-induced decoherence whereafter only the classical correlation
between S and A remains, the latter being large compared to the former. We
present numerical evidence that the entangled S-A state drifts towards the
nearest separable state through decoherence, with an additional tendency of
equimixing among relevant groups of apparatus states.
