We have known for more than thirty years that black holes behave as
thermodynamic systems, radiating as black bodies with characteristic
temperatures and entropies. This behavior is not only interesting in its own
right; it could also, through a statistical mechanical description, cast light
on some of the deep problems of quantizing gravity. In these lectures, I review
what we currently know about black hole thermodynamics and statistical
mechanics, suggest a rather speculative "universal" characterization of the
underlying states, and describe some key open questions.
