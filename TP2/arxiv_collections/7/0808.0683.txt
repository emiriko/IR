Results on diffractive scattering observed at HERA and at the TEVATRON are
reviewed. This includes the extraction of diffractive parton density functions
and determination of the rapidity gap survival probability at HERA and the
observation of central exclusive production of final states at the TEVATRON.
Finally, preparations to observe diffractive signals at the LHC are discussed.
