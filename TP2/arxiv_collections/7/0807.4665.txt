We prove a strong law of large numbers for a class of strongly mixing
processes. Our result rests on recent advances in understanding of
concentration of measure. It is simple to apply and gives finite-sample (as
opposed to asymptotic) bounds, with readily computable rate constants. In
particular, this makes it suitable for analysis of inhomogeneous Markov
processes. We demonstrate how it can be applied to establish an almost-sure
convergence result for a class of models that includes as a special case a
class of adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.
