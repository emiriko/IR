The generating functional is suggested for multiparticle generation
processes. In mean field approximation of high density QCD two equations for
new generating functional are derived: linear functional equation for an
arbitrary initial condition and non-linear one for a specific initial
condition. The non-linear equation has the form of Kovchegov-Levin equation for
diffraction production and gives its generalization on the processes with fixed
multiplicities of produced particles.
