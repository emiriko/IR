We derive an explicit formula for the vertex amplitude of dual SU(2)
Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions on the lattice, and provide an efficient
algorithm (of order j to the fourth power) for its computation. This opens the
way for both numerical and analytic development of dual methods, previously
limited to the case of three dimensions.
