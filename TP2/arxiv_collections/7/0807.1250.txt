The ability to store multiple optical modes in a quantum memory allows for
increased efficiency of quantum communication and computation. Here we compute
the multimode capacity of a variety of quantum memory protocols based on light
storage in ensembles of atoms. We find that adding a controlled inhomogeneous
broadening improves this capacity significantly.
