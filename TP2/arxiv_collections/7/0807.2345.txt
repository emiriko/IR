We describe three methods to determine a faithful representation of small
dimension for a finite-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra over an arbitrary
field. We apply our methods in finding bounds for the smallest dimension
$\mu(\Lg)$ of a faithful $\Lg$-module for some nilpotent Lie algebras $\Lg$. In
particular, we describe an infinite family of filiform nilpotent Lie algebras
$\Lf_n$ of dimension $n$ over $\Q$ and conjecture that $\mu(\Lf_n) > n+1$.
Experiments with our algorithms suggest that $\mu(\Lf_n)$ is polynomial in $n$.
