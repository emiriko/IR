The main challenge in using abstractions effectively, is to construct a
suitable abstraction for the system being verified. One approach that tries to
address this problem is that of {\it counterexample guided
abstraction-refinement (CEGAR)}, wherein one starts with a coarse abstraction
of the system, and progressively refines it, based on invalid counterexamples
seen in prior model checking runs, until either an abstraction proves the
correctness of the system or a valid counterexample is generated. While CEGAR
has been successfully used in verifying non-probabilistic systems
automatically, CEGAR has not been applied in the context of probabilistic
systems. The main issues that need to be tackled in order to extend the
approach to probabilistic systems is a suitable notion of ``counterexample'',
algorithms to generate counterexamples, check their validity, and then
automatically refine an abstraction based on an invalid counterexample. In this
paper, we address these issues, and present a CEGAR framework for Markov
Decision Processes.
