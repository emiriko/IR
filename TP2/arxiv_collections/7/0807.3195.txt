We update the extraction of |V_{us}| from hadronic tau decay data in light of
recent BaBar and Belle results on the branching fractions of a number of
important strange decay modes. A range of sum rule analyses is performed,
particular attention being paid to those based on "non-spectral weights",
developed previously to bring the slow convergence of the relevant integrated
D=2 OPE series under improved control. Results from the various sum rules are
shown to be in good agreement with one another, but ~3 sigma below expectations
based on 3-family unitarity. Important avenues for future study are briefly
discussed.
