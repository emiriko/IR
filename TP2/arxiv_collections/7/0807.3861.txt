The small angle scattering (by a gravitational field) of classical and
quantum particles is considered and compared. It is suggested that the
differences in small angle scattering of particles with spin 0, 1, 2 are due to
the nonzero probability of forward scattering for particles described by a wave
packet. It is suggested that measurements of the deflection of light in the
vicinity of the Sun will decide which coordinate system is the privileged one.
