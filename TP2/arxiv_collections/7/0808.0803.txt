We provide a quantum statistical thermodynamical solution of the long
standing problem of temperature transformations of uniformly moving bodies. Our
treatment of this question is based on the well established quantum statistical
result that the thermal equilibrium conditions demanded by both the Zeroth and
Second Laws of Thermodynamics are precisely those of Kubo, Martin and Schwinger
(KMS). We prove that, in both the special relativistic and nonrelativistic
settings, a state of a body cannot satisfy these conditions for different
inertial frames with non-zero relative velocity. Hence a body that serves as a
thermal reservoir, in the sense of the Zeroth Law, in an inertial rest frame
cannot do so in a laboratory frame relative to which it moves with non-zero
uniform velocity. Consequently, there is no law of temperature transformation
under either Lorentz or Galilei boosts, and so the concept of temperature
stemming from the Zeroth Law is restricted to states of bodies in their rest
frames.
