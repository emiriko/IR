We investigate here the confluence of singularities of Mathieu differential
equation by means of the Lie algebra contraction of the Lie algebra of the
motion group M(2) on the Heisenberg Lie algebra H(3). A similar approach for
the Lam\'e equation in terms of the Lie algebra contraction of $SO_0(2,1)$ on
the Lie algebra of the motion group M(2) is outlined.
