The notion of a compact object immune to the horizon problem and comprising
an anisotropic inhomogeneous fluid with a specific radial pressure behavior,
i.e. the gravastar, is extended by introducing an electrically charged
component. Einstein-Maxwell field equations are solved in the asymptotically de
Sitter interior where a source of the electric field is coupled to the fluid
energy density. Two different solutions which satisfy the dominant energy
condition are given: one is the delta-shell model for which the analysis is
carried out within Israel's thin shell formalism, the other approach - the
continuous profile model - is solved numerically and the interior solutions
have been (smoothly) joined with the Reissner-Nordstrom exterior. The effect of
electric charge is considered, and the equation of state, the speed of sound
and the surface redshift are calculated for both models.
