Traditional derivation of the material time derivative of volume, surface,
and line integrals relies upon the notion of a referential configuration of
continuum. Such a notion, however, is artificial and, probably, somewhat
misleading in cases of liquids, gases, plastic flow of solids etc. It is,
consequently, desirable to separate the formal calculation of the material time
derivative of time-dependent integrals from any physics that can be related
with them. Such a separation is targeted in the present letter where no
referential continuum configuration or other physical notion is involved. The
material time derivative of volume, surface, and line integrals is presented as
a purely mathematical manipulation.
