We discuss two topics that are usually considered to be exclusively
"quantum": the Schroedinger equation, and the uncertainty principle. We show
(or rather recall) that the Schroedinger equation can be derived from
Hamilton's equations using the metaplectic representation. We also show that
the uncertainty principle, stated in the form of the
Robertson-Schroedinger-Heisenberg inequalities can be formulated in perfectly
classical terms using the topological notion of symplectic capacity.
