This paper is devoted to consideration of the hard exclusive processes
$e^+e^- \to VP$, where $V=\rho,\phi; P=\eta,\eta'$. Experimental measurement of
the cross section of the process $e^+ e^- \to \phi\eta$ at BaBar collaboration
at large center mass energy $\sqrt s=10.6$ GeV and some low energy experimental
data $\sqrt s \sim 2-4$ GeV give us the possibility to study the cross section
in the broad energy region. As the result, we have determined the asymptotic
behavior of the cross section of $e^+ e^- \to \phi\eta$ in the limit $s \to
\infty$, which is in agreement with perturbative QCD prediction. Assuming that
the same asymptotic behavior is valid for the other processes under
consideration and using low energy experimental data we have predicted the
cross sections of these processes at energies $\sqrt s=3.67,~10.6$ GeV. In
addition, we have calculated the cross sections of these processes at the same
energies within perturbative QCD. Our results are in agreement with available
experimental data.
