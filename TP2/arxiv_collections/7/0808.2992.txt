A parallel code has been written in FORTRAN90, C, and MPI for the analysis of
biological simulation data. Using a master/slave algorithm, the software
operates on AMBER generated trajectory data using either UNIX or MPI file IO,
and it supports up to 15 simultaneous function calls. This software has been
performance tested on the Ranger Supercomputer on trajectory data of an aqueous
bacterial reaction center micelle. Although the parallel reading is poor, the
analysis algorithm itself shows embarrassingly parallel speedup up to 1024
compute nodes. At this CPU count the overall scaling of the software compares
well NAMD's best reported speedup, and outperforms AMBER's best known scaling
by a factor of 3, while using only a small number of function calls and a short
trajectory length.
