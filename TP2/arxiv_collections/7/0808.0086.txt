COMPASS is a running fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS with a rich
physics program focused on nucleon spin structure and on hadron spectroscopy.
One of the main goals of the spin program is the measurement of the transverse
spin effects in semi-inclusive DIS off transversely polarised nucleons. In the
years 2002, 2003 and 2004 data have been taken using a 160 $GeV/c$ naturally
polarised $\mu^{+}$ beam and a deuterium target ($^{6}LiD$) transversely
polarised respect to the beam direction. In 2007 the run year has been devoted
to collect data with a proton ($NH_{3}$) target. The preliminary results for
the Collins and Sivers asymmetries, extracted from the 2007 data with
transverse target polarisation, are presented here. Results are also compared
with existing model predictions.
