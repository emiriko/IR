Obliquely deposited amorphous Ge_xSe{1-x} thin-films at several compositions
in the 0.15 < x < 0.333 range, and at several obliqueness angles in the 0 <
alpha < 80 range at each x were evaporated on Si and glass substrates. Here
alpha designates the angle between film normal and direction of vapor
transport. Raman scattering, ir reflectance and optical absorption measurements
were undertaken to characterize the vibrational density of states and optical
band gaps. Edge views of films in SEM confirm the columnar structure of
obliquely (alpha = 80) deposited films. Films, mounted in a cold stage flushed
with N2 gas, were irradiated to UV radiation from a Hg-Xe arc lamp, and
