We report inelastic neutron scattering studies of magnetic excitations in
antiferromagnetically ordered SrFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($T_{N}=220$ K), the parent
compound of the FeAs-based superconductors. At low temperatures (T=7 K), the
spectrum of magnetic excitations $S(Q,\hbar \omega)$ consists of a Bragg peak
at the elastic position ($\hbar \omega =0$ meV), a spin gap ($ \Delta \leq 6.5$
meV), and sharp spin wave excitations at higher energies. Based on the observed
dispersion relation, we estimate the effective magnetic exchange coupling using
a Heisenberg model. On warming across $T_{N} $, the low temperature spin gap
rapidly closes, with weak critical scattering and spin-spin correlations in the
paramagnetic state. The antiferromagnetic order in SrFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is
therefore consistent with a first order phase transition, similar to the
structural lattice distortion.
