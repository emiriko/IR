We combine magneto-optical imaging and a magnetic field pulse technique to
study domain wall dynamics in a ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As layer with
perpendicular easy axis. Contrary to ultrathin metallic layers, the depinning
field is found to be smaller than the Walker field, thereby allowing for the
observation of the steady and precessional flow regimes. The domain wall width
and damping parameters are determined self-consistently. The damping, 30 times
larger than the one deduced from ferromagnetic resonance, is shown to
essentially originate from the non-conservation of the magnetization modulus.
An unpredicted damping resonance and a dissipation regime associated with the
existence of horizontal Bloch lines are also revealed.
