We show theoretically that by applying a bichromatic electromagnetic field,
the dressed states of a monochromatically driven two-level atom can be pumped
into a coherent superposition termed as dressed-state coherent population
trapping. Such effect can be viewed as a new doorknob to manipulate a two-level
system via its control over dressed-state populations. Application of this
effect in the precision measurement of Rabi frequency, the unexpected
population inversion and lasing without inversion are discussed to demonstrate
such controllability.
