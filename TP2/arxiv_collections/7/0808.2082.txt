We exploit the spinor description of four-dimensional Walker geometry, and
conformal rescalings of such, to describe the local geometry of
four-dimensional neutral geometries with algebraically degenerate self-dual
Weyl curvature and an integrable distribution of alpha-planes (algebraically
special real alpha-geometry). In particular, we determine the behaviour of
(four-dimensional neutral) Walker geometry under conformal rescalings and
provide a derivation of the hyperheavenly equation from conformal rescaling
formulae.
