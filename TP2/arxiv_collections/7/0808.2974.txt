We demonstrate high-resolution modification of suspended multi-layer graphene
sheets by controlled exposure to the focused electron beam of a transmission
electron microscope. We show that this technique can be used to realize, on
timescales of a few seconds, a variety of features, including nanometer-scale
pores, slits, and gaps that are stable and do not evolve over time. Despite the
extreme thinness of the suspended graphene sheets, extensive removal of
material to produce the desired feature geometries is found to not introduce
long-range distortion of the suspended sheet structure.
