Here an image restoration on the basis of pixel simultaneous detection
probabilities (PSDP) is proposed. These probabilities can be precisely
determined by means of correlations measurement [NIMA 586 (2008) 314-326]. The
proposed image restoration is based on the solution of matrix equation.
Non-zero elements of Toeplitz block matrix with ones on the main diagonal, is
determined using PSDP. The number of non zero descending diagonals depends on
the detector construction and is not always smaller than 8. To solve the matrix
equation, the Gaussian elimination algorithm is used. The proposed restoration
algorithm is studied by means of the simulated images (with and without
additive noise using PSDP for General Electric Senographe 2000D mammography
device detector) and a small area (160x160 pixels) of real images acquired by
the above mentioned device. The estimation errors of PSDP and the additive
noise magnitude permits to restore images with the precision better than 3% for
the above mentioned detector. The additive noise in the real image is present
after restoration and almost has the same magnitude. In the restored small area
(16x16 mm) of real images, the pixel responses are not correlated. The spatial
resolution improvement is also analyzed by the image of an absorber edge.
