In this paper we present a case study of use of wearable computer within the
framework of activities of maintenance and repairing. Besides the study of
configuration of this wearable computer and its peripherals, we show the
integration of context, in-situ storage, traceability and regulation in these
activities. This case study is in the scope of a huge project called HMTD (Help
Me To Do) which aim is to apply MOCOCO (Mobility, COoperation,
COntextualisation) and IMERA (Mobile Interaction in the Augmented Real
Environment) principles for better use, maintenance and repairing of equipments
in the domestic, public and professional situations.
