We analyze the possibility of inequivalent boundary conditions for a scalar
field propagating in the BTZ black hole space-time. We find that for certain
ranges of the black hole parameters, the Klein-Gordon operator admits a
one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions. For this range, the BTZ
space-time is not quantum mechanically complete. We suggest a physically
motivated method for determining the spectra of the Klein-Gordon operator.
