Identifying patients at risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important
because research suggests prophylactic treatments to reduce risk of long-term
sequelae. Blast pressure waves can cause TBI without penetrating wounds or
blunt force trauma. Similarly, bullet impacts distant from the brain can
produce pressure waves sufficient to cause mild to moderate TBI. The fluid
percussion model of TBI shows that pressure impulses of 15-30 psi cause mild to
moderate TBI in laboratory animals. In pigs and dogs, bullet impacts to the
thigh produce pressure waves in the brain of 18-45 psi and measurable injury to
neurons and neuroglia. Analyses of research in goats and epidemiological data
from shooting events involving humans show high correlations (r > 0.9) between
rapid incapacitation and pressure wave magnitude in the thoracic cavity. A case
study has documented epilepsy resulting from a pressure wave without the bullet
directly hitting the brain. Taken together, these results support the
hypothesis that bullet impacts distant from the brain produce pressure waves
that travel to the brain and can retain sufficient magnitude to induce brain
injury. The link to long-term sequelae could be investigated via
epidemiological studies of patients who were gunshot in the chest to determine
whether they experience elevated rates of epilepsy and other neurological
sequelae.
