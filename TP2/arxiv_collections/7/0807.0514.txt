We present analytic evaluations of some integrals needed to give explicitly
the integrated real-virtual integrated counterterms, based on a recently
proposed subtraction scheme for next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) jet cross
sections. After an algebraic reduction of the integrals, integration-by-parts
identities are used for the reduction to master integrals and for the
computation of the master integrals themselves by means of differential
equations. The results are written in terms of one- and two-dimensional
harmonic polylogarithms, once an extension of the standard basis is made. We
expect that the techniques described here will be useful in computing other
integrals emerging in calculations in perturbative quantum field theories.
