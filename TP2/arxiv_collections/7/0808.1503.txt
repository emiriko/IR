Stone substitution is a conventional operation during heritage buildings'
restoration, but becomes problematic for architects and restorers when the
quarry is mined out. The compatibility of the substitution stones with the
original ones has been for long mainly based on the aesthetical aspect, this
resulting too often in a patchwork of original and substitution stones with
different patina after several years because of differences of properties. In
this study, the objective is to show how substitution stones can be selected by
combining aesthetic criteria and stones properties that are relevant for
analyzing their compatibility. A couple of French limestones with their
potential substitution stones were selected for the study. Our results showed
that potential substitution stones selected on their aesthetic criteria require
to be rejected because of their differences of physical properties. On the
other hand, our results showed also the possibility to select substitution
stones with satisfactory aesthetic aspect and properties that enable to expect
a satisfactory compatibility with the original stone.
