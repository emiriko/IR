We study the implementation of a correlation measurement technique for the
characterization of squeezed light. We show that the sign of the covariance
coefficient revealed from the time resolved correlation data allow us to
distinguish between squeezed, coherent and thermal states. In contrast to the
traditional method of characterizing squeezed light, involving measurement of
the variation of the difference photocurrent, the correlation measurement
method allows to eliminate the contribution of the electronic noise, which
becomes a crucial issue in experiments with dim sources of squeezed light.
