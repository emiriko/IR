The work is related with the finding out of magnetic phases in strongly
anisotropic high-temperature superconductor Bi1,7Pb0,3Sr2Ca2Cu3O10-d in the
temperature region where the superconductor is in the normal state. It was
studied the temperature dependence of the paramagnetic probe EPR line width. In
the normal state at T>Tc near 175 K it was revealed a pick in the temperature
dependence of line width. In this region it was observed the time increase of
the line width with the characteristic time ~ 17 min. This shows the
possibility of magnetic phase formation in this material.
