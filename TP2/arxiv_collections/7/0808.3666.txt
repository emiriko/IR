A series of polycrystalline SmO1-xFxFeAs bulks (x=0.15, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4)
were prepared by the conventional solid state reaction. Resistivity,
susceptibility, magnetic hysteresis, critical current density and
microstructure of these samples have been investigated. It is found that
critical transition temperature Tc increases steadily with increasing fluorine
content, with the highest onset Tc=53 K at x=0.4. On the other hand, the
superconductivity seems correlated with lattice constants; that is, Tc rises
with the shrinkage of a-axis while resistivity increases with the enlargement
of c-axis. A global critical current density of 1.1x10^4 A/cm^2 at 5 K in self
field was achieved in the purest sample. A method of characterization of
inter-grain current density is proposed. This method gives an inter-grain Jc of
3.6x10^3 A/cm^2 at 5 K in self field, in contrast to the intra-grain Jc of 10^6
A/cm^2. The effect of composition gradients on the inter-grain Jc in
SmO1-xFxFeAs is also discussed.
