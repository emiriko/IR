We study quantitative asymptotics of planar random walks that are spatially
non-homogeneous but whose mean drifts have some regularity. Specifically, we
study the first exit time $\tau_\alpha$ from a wedge with apex at the origin
and interior half-angle $\alpha$ by a non-homogeneous random walk on the square
lattice with mean drift at $x$ of magnitude $O(1/|x|)$ as $|x| \to \infty$.
This is the critical regime for the asymptotic behaviour: under mild
conditions, a previous result of the authors (see arXiv:0910.1772) stated that
$\tau_\alpha < \infty$ a.s. for any $\alpha$ (while for a stronger drift field
$\tau_\alpha$ is infinite with positive probability). Here we study the more
difficult problem of the existence and non-existence of moments
$E[\tau_\alpha^s]$, $s>0$. Assuming (in common with much of the literature) a
uniform bound on the walk's increments, we show that for $\alpha < \pi/2$ there
exists $s_0 \in (0,\infty)$ such that $E[\tau_\alpha^s]$ is finite for $s <
s_0$ but infinite for $s > s_0$; under specific assumptions on the drift field
we show that we can attain $E[\tau_\alpha^s] = \infty$ for any $s > 1/2$. We
show that for $\alpha \leq \pi$ there is a phase transition between drifts of
magnitude $O(1/|x|)$ (the critical regime) and $o(1/|x|)$ (the subcritical
regime). In the subcritical regime we obtain a non-homogeneous random walk
analogue of a theorem for Brownian motion due to Spitzer, under considerably
weaker conditions than those previously given (including work by Varopoulos)
that assumed zero drift.
