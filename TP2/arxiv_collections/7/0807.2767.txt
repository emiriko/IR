Gibbs random fields (GRF) are polymorphous statistical models that can be
used to analyse different types of dependence, in particular for spatially
correlated data. However, when those models are faced with the challenge of
selecting a dependence structure from many, the use of standard model choice
methods is hampered by the unavailability of the normalising constant in the
Gibbs likelihood. In particular, from a Bayesian perspective, the computation
of the posterior probabilities of the models under competition requires special
likelihood-free simulation techniques like the Approximate Bayesian Computation
(ABC) algorithm that is intensively used in population genetics. We show in
this paper how to implement an ABC algorithm geared towards model choice in the
general setting of Gibbs random fields, demonstrating in particular that there
exists a sufficient statistic across models. The accuracy of the approximation
to the posterior probabilities can be further improved by importance sampling
on the distribution of the models. The practical aspects of the method are
detailed through two applications, the test of an iid Bernoulli model versus a
first-order Markov chain, and the choice of a folding structure for two
proteins.
