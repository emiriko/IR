We present exact numerical solutions in the form of spatially localized
three-dimensional (3D) nonrotating and rotating (azimuthon) multipole solitons
in the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined by a parabolic trap. We
numerically show that the 3D azimuthon solutions exist as a continuous family
parametrized by the angular velocity (or, equivalently, the modulational
depth). By a linear stability analysis we show that 3D azimuthons with a
sufficiently large phase modulational depth can be stable. The results are
confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
