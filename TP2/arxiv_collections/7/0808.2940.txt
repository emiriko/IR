In the standard model, for the t --> W b decay mode, the relative phase is
0-degrees between the dominant A(0,-1/2) and A(-1, -1/2) helicity amplitudes.
However, in the case of an additional large t_R --> b_L chiral weak-transition
moment, there is instead a 180-degree relative phase and three theoretical
numerical puzzles. This phase can be measured at the Tevatron or LHC in
top-antitop pair production by use of W-boson longitudinal-transverse
interference in beam-referenced stage-two spin-correlation functions. Indeed,
this is a new type of weak-coupling for it is directly associated with E_W, the
W-boson energy in the top quark rest frame, instead of with a canonical
effective mass scale. For most 2 --> 2 reactions, the simple off-shell
continuation of this additional coupling is found to have good high energy
properties, i.e. it does not destroy 1-loop unitarity of the SM. In a subset of
processes, additional third-generation couplings are required.
