We discuss two different types of issues concerning the quantization of
Einstein-Rosen waves. First of all we study in detail the possibility of using
the coherent states corresponding to the dynamics of the auxiliary, free
Hamiltonian appearing in the description of the model to study the full
dynamics of the system. For time periods of arbitrary length we show that this
is only possible for states that are close, in a precise mathematical sense, to
the vacuum. We do this by comparing the quantum evolutions defined by the
auxiliary and physical Hamiltonians on the class of coherent states. In the
second part of the paper we study the structure of n-point functions. As we
will show their detailed behavior differs from the one corresponding to
standard perturbative quantum field theories. We take this as a manifestation
of the fact that the correct approximation scheme for physically interesting
objects in these models does not lead to a power series expansion in the
relevant coupling constant but to a more complicated asymptotic behavior.
