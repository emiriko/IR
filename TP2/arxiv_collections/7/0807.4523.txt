We show that superconductivity is absent within the 1/2-filled band
triangular lattice repulsive Hubbard model that has been proposed for organic
charge-transfer solids. We posit that organic superconductivity is rather
reached from a Bond-Charge Density Wave that either constitutes the insulating
state proximate to superconductivity, or is extremely close in energy to the
antiferromagnetic state, and replaces the latter under pressure. The
Bond-Charge Density Wave can be described within an effective attractive $U$
extended Hubbard Hamiltonian with repulsive nearest neighbor interaction $V$. A
first-order transition from the insulating to the superconducting state occurs
within the model with increasing frustration.
