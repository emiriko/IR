The 3rd International Workshop on a Far Detector in Korea for the J-PARC
Neutrino Beam was held at the Hongo Campus of Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan on
Sep. 30th and October 1, 2007. Forty seven physicists from Japan and Korea, as
well as Europe and USA, participated in the workshop and discussed the physics
opportunities offered by the J-PARC conventional neutrino beam detected by a
new large underground neutrino detector in Korea. In this paper, we highlight
some of the most relevant findings of the workshop.
