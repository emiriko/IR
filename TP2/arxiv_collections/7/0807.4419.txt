Mean-field study of the stripe structures is conducted for a hole-doped
Hubbard model. For bond-directed stripes, the Fermi surface consists of
segments of an open surface and the boundaries of the hole pockets which appear
in the diagonal region of momenta under certain conditions. Segments of the
first type are due to one-dimensional bands of states localized on the domain
walls. The relation of bands to the doping and temperature dependences of the
Hall constant is discussed. In connection with the observation of quantum
magnetic oscillations, a systematic search for the electron pockets has been
carried out. It is shown that the formation of such pockets in bilayer models
is quite possible.
