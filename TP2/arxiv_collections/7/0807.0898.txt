Raychaudhuri equation is generalized in the parameterized absolute
parallelism geometry. This version of absolute parallelism is more general than
the conventional one. The generalization takes into account the suggested
interaction between the quantum spin of the moving elementary particle and the
torsion of the background gravitational field. The generalized Raychaudhuri
equation obtained contains some extra terms, depending on the torsion of
space-time, that would have some effects on the singularity theorems of general
relativity. Under a certain condition, this equation could be reduced to the
original Raychaudhuri equation without any need for a vanishing torsion.
