We examine a scenario where the Higgs is part of an approximate conformal
field theory, and has a scaling dimension greater than one. Such an unparticle
Higgs (or Unhiggs) can still break electroweak symmetry and unitarize WW
scattering, but its gauge couplings are suppressed. An Unhiggs model has a
reduced sensitivity of the weak scale to the cutoff, and can thus provide a
solution to the little hierarchy problem.
