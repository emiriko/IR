We define ambient isotopy invariants of oriented knots and links using the
counting invariants of framed links defined by finite racks. These invariants
reduce to the usual quandle counting invariant when the rack in question is a
quandle. We are able to further enhance these counting invariants with
2-cocycles from the coloring rack's second rack cohomology satisfying a new
degeneracy condition which reduces to the usual case for quandles.
