This paper introduces a new algorithm for solving a sub-class of quantified
constraint satisfaction problems (QCSP) where existential quantifiers precede
universally quantified inequalities on continuous domains. This class of QCSPs
has numerous applications in engineering and design. We propose here a new
generic branch and prune algorithm for solving such continuous QCSPs. Standard
pruning operators and solution identification operators are specialized for
universally quantified inequalities. Special rules are also proposed for
handling the parameters of the constraints. First experimentation show that our
algorithm outperforms the state of the art methods.
