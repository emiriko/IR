An approach to fast fits of the unintegrated gluon density has been developed
and used to determine the unintegrated gluon density by fits to deep inelastic
scatting di-jet data from HERA. The fitting method is based on the
determination of the parameter dependence by help of interpolating between grid
points in the parameter-observable space before the actual fit is performed.
