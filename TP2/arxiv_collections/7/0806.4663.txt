A basic prerequisite for the investigation of relativistic astrophysical
magnetoplasmas, occurring typically in the vicinity of massive stellar objects
(black holes, neutron stars, active galactic nuclei, etc.), is the accurate
description of single-particle covariant dynamics, based on gyrokinetic theory
(Beklemishev et al.,1999-2005). Provided radiation-reaction effects are
negligible, this is usually based on the assumption that both the space-time
metric and the EM fields (in particular the magnetic field) are suitably
prescribed and are considered independent of single-particle dynamics, while
allowing for the possible presence of gravitational/EM perturbations driven by
plasma collective interactions which may naturally arise in such systems. The
purpose of this work is the formulation of a generalized gyrokinetic theory
based on the synchronous variational principle recently pointed out (Tessarotto
et al., 2007) which permits to satisfy exactly the physical realizability
condition for the four-velocity. The theory here developed includes the
treatment of nonlinear perturbations (gravitational and/or EM) characterized
locally, i.e., in the rest frame of a test particle, by short wavelength and
high frequency. Basic feature of the approach is to ensure the validity of the
theory both for large and vanishing parallel electric field. It is shown that
the correct treatment of EM perturbations occurring in the presence of an
intense background magnetic field generally implies the appearance of
appropriate four-velocity corrections, which are essential for the description
of single-particle gyrokinetic dynamics.
