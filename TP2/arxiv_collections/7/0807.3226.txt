The decaying speed of sound can lead to the emergence of the primordial
density perturbation in any expanding phase, even if the expansion is
decelerated. Recently, some proposals have been given to implement this
mechanism, in which it was found that the primordial spectrum of scalar
perturbation can be scale invariant. In this note, we will give more insights
for the details of this seeding mechanism.
