We study the question of the growth of Betti numbers of certain arithmetic
varieties in tower of congruence coverings. In fact, our results are about
Siegel varieties and varieties associated to orthogonal groups. We explain how
a theorem of Waldspurger can be used to obtain lower and upper bound. Our
results are in the direction of conjectures made by Sarnak and Xue.
