We estimate the accuracy with which the coefficient of the CP even dimension
six operators involving Higgs and two vector bosons (HVV) can be measured at
linear $e^+ e^-$ colliders. Using the optimal observables method for the
kinematic distributions, our analysis is based on the five different processes.
First is the WW fusion process in the t-channel ($e^+e^- \to \bar{\nu}_e \nu_e
H$), where we use the rapidity y and the transverse momentum $\pT$ of the Higgs
boson as observables. Second is the ZH pair production process in the
s-channel, where we use the scattering angle of the Z and the Z decay angular
distributions, reproducing the results of the previous studies. Third is the
t-channel ZZ, fusion processes ($e^+e^- \to e^+e^ -H$), where we use the energy
and angular distributions of the tagged $e^+$ and $e^-$. In the fourth, we
consider the rapidity distribution of the untagged $e^+e^-H$ events, which can
be approximated well as the $\gamma \gamma$ fusion of the bremsstrahlung
photons from $e^+$ and $e^-$ beams. As the last process,we consider the single
tagged $e^+e^- H$ events, which probe the $\gamma e^{\pm} \to H e^{\pm}$
process. All the results are presented in such a way that statistical errors of
the constraints on the effective couplings and their correlations are read off
when all of them are allowed to vary simultaneously, for each of the above
processes, for $m_H=120 $ GeV, at $\sqrt{s}=250\GEV$, $350\GEV$ $500\GEV$ and
$1\TEV$, with and without $e^-$ beam polarization of 80%.
