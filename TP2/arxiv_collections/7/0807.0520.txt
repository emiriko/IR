We present a general subtraction method for computing radiative corrections
to QCD jet cross sections at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy. The steps
needed to set up this subtraction scheme are the same as those used in
next-to-leading order computations. However, all steps need non-trivial
modifications, which we implement such that that those can be defined at any
order in perturbation theory. We give a status report of the implementation of
the method to computing jet cross sections in electron-positron annihilation at
the next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy.
