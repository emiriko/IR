We use a scattering matrix approach to simulate the transmission through a
hexagonal Photonic Crystal in the vicinity of the Dirac point. If the crystal
is oriented so that the propagation direction perpendicular to the surface
corresponds to the Gamma-K direction, no oblique transmission is possible for a
very long (infinite) structure. For a finite structure with width, W, and
length, L, the length dependence of the transmission is given by T_total =
Gamma_0 W/L. For T_total all waves with a wavevector parallel to the surface,
k_||=n 2pi/W, described by a channel number, n, must be considered. We show the
transmission at the Dirac point follows the given scaling law and this scaling
law is related to the behavior of the individual channels. This leads to the
establishment of a criterion for the maximum length for this scaling behavior
when the total transmission reaches a constant value. We also compare this
scaling behavior to the results in other frequency regions.
