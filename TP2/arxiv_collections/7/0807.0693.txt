Scintillating crystals are used for calorimetry in several high-energy
physics experiments. For some of them, performance has to be ensured in
difficult operating conditions, like a high radiation environment, very large
particle fluxes and high collision rates. Results are presented here from a
thorough series of measurements concerning mainly the effect of charged hadrons
on lead tungstate. It is also shown how these results can be used to predict
the effect on crystals due to a given flux of particles.
