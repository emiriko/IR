We review recent experimental results on direct CP violation. The hot topic
is a measurement in charmless two-body decays of B0, B+. In connection to this
the first analogous measurements in Bs0 and Lambda_b0 decays are now available.
Furthermore first evidence for direct CP violation in B+ decays is obtained
from Dalitz plot analyzes of the K+pi-pi+ final state at B-factories. The last
group of discussed results probes the b -> c\bar{c}d transition in attempt to
resolve the discrepancy between Belle and BABAR experiments in CP violation in
the B0 -> D+D- decays.
