We present a preliminary analysis of the decays B0 -> K*0 gamma and B+ -> K*+
gamma using a sample of 383 x 10^6 BBbar events collected with the BABAR dector
at the PEP-II asymmetric energy B factory. We measure the branching fractions
BF(B0 -> K*0 Gamma) = (4.58 +/- 0.11 +/- 0.16) x 10^-5 and BF(B+ -> K*+ Gamma)
= 4.73 +/- 0.15 +/- 0.17 x 10^-5. We measure the direct CP asymmetry to be
-0.043 < A(B -> K* gamma) < 0.025 and the isospin asymmetry to be -0.021 <
Delta0- < 0.079, where the limits are determined at the 90% confidence interval
and include both the statistical and systematic uncertainties.
