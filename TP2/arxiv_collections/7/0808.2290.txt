We consider a model with competing double-exchange (ferromagnetic) and
super-exchange (anti-ferromagnetic) interactions in the regime where phase
separation takes place. The presence of a long range Coulomb interaction
frustrates a macroscopic phase separation, and favors microscopically
inhomogeneous configurations. We use the variational Hartree-Fock approach, in
conjunction with Monte-Carlo simulations to study the geometry of such
configurations in a two-dimensional system. We find that an array of diamond
shaped ferromagnetic droplets is the preferred configuration at low electronic
densities, while alternating ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic diagonal
stripes emerge at higher densities. These findings are expected to be relevant
for thin films of colossal magneto-resistive manganates.
