(Abbr.) We consider a direct representation of a periodic time-function by
means of its zero-crossings. The use of the zero-crossings as the describing
parameters is made possible by a singular model of a strongly nonlinear
electrical element. This new method is found helpful in the calculation and
synthesis of a practically important system, and deserves attention of the
mathematicians.
