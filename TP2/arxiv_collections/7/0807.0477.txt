By studying the Hawking radiation of the most general static spherically
symmetric black hole arising from scalar and Dirac particles tunnelling, we
find the Hawking temperature is invariant in the general coordinate
representation (\ref{arbitrary1}), which satisfies two conditions: a) its
radial coordinate transformation is regular at the event horizon; and b) there
is a time-like Killing vector.
