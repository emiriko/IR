We study in detail a very natural metric for quantum states. This new
proposal has two basic ingredients: entropy and purification. The metric for
two mixed states is defined as the square root of the entropy of the average of
representative purifications of those states. Some basic properties are
analyzed and its relation with other distances is investigated. As an
illustrative application, the proposed metric is evaluated for 1-qubit mixed
states.
