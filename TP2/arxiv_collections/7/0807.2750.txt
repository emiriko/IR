We give comments on the recent paper by Giunti (Phys. Lett. B 665, 92 (2008),
arXiv: 0805.0431 [hep-ph]) with a critique of our explanation of the
experimentally observed periodic time-dependence of the interference term in
the rate of the K-shell electron capture decay of the H-like ions 140Pr58+ and
142Pm60+ as a two-neutrino-flavour mixing. We show also that this phenomenon
cannot be explained by a coherent mixing of two states of a mother ion as
proposed by Giunti.
