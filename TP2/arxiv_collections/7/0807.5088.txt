We review a recent proposal to describe dark matter and dark energy based on
an Eddington-Born-Infeld action. The theory is successful in describing the
evolution of the expansion factor as well as galactic flat rotation curves.
Fluctuations and the CMB spectra are currently under study. This paper in
written in honor of Claudio Bunster on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday.
