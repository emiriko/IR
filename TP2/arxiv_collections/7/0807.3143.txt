We propose a set of maximized string order parameters to describe the hidden
topological order in the valence bond solid states of quantum integer spin-S
chains. These optimized string order parameters involve spin-twist angles
corresponding to $Z_{S+1}$ rotations around $z$ or $x$-axes, suggesting a
hidden $Z_{S+1}\times Z_{S+1}$ symmetry. Our results also suggest that a local
triplet excitation in the valence bond solid states carries a $Z_{S+1}$
topological charge measured by these maximized string order parameters.
