Nearly magnetic metals often have layered lattice structures, consisting of
coupled planes. In such a situation, physical properties will display, upon
decreasing temperature or energy, a dimensional crossover from two-dimensional
(2d) to three-dimensional (3d) behavior, which is particularly interesting near
quantum criticality. Here we study this crossover in thermodynamics using a
suitably generalized Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach to the critical behavior,
combined with renormalization group techniques. We focus on two experimentally
relevant cases: the crossover from a 2d to a 3d antiferromagnet, and the
crossover from a 2d ferromagnet to a 3d antiferromagnet. We discuss the
location of phase boundary and crossover lines and determine the crossover
functions for important thermodynamic quantities. As naive scaling does not
apply at and above the upper critical dimension, two crossover scales arise
which can be associated with separate dimensional crossovers of classical and
quantum fluctuations, respectively. In particular, we find an intermediate
regime with novel power laws where the quantum fluctuations still have a 2d and
the classical fluctuations already have a 3d character. For the
ferromagnet-to-antiferromagnet crossover, the mismatch of the dynamical
exponents between the 2d and 3d regimes leads to an even richer crossover
structure, with an interesting 2d non-critical regime sandwiched between two
critical regimes. For all cases, we find that thermal expansion and
compressibility are particularly sensitive probes of the dimensional crossover.
Finally, we relate our results to experiments on the quantum critical
heavy-fermion metals CeCu(6-x)Au(x), YbRh(2)Si(2) and CeCoIn(5).
