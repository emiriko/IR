We study an opinion formation model that takes into account that individuals
have diverse preferences when forming their opinion regarding a particular
issue. We show that the system exhibits a phenomenon called "diversity-induced
resonance"[Tessone et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 194101 (2006)], by which an
external influence (for example advertising, or fashion trends) is better
followed by populations having the right degree of diversity in their
preferences, rather than others where the individuals are identical or have too
different preferences. We support our findings by numerical simulations of the
model and a mean-field type analytical theory.
