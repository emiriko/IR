I introduce and discuss models of finite quark matter using the formalism of
the Thomas-Fermi statistical model. Similar to bag models, a vacuum energy term
is introduced to model long distance confinement, but the model produces bound
states from the residual color Coulomb attraction even in the absence of such a
term. I discuss three baryonic applications: an equal mass nonrelativistic
model with and without volume pressure, the ultra-relativistic limit confined
by volume pressure, and a color-flavor locking massless model. These model may
be extended to multi-meson and other mixed hadronic states. Hopefully, it can
help lead to a better understanding of the phenomenology of high multi-quark
states in preparation for more detailed lattice QCD calculations.
