We give a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of the
configuration-interaction method as applied to parabolic quantum dots among
other systems, including \emph{a priori} error estimates. The method converges
slowly in general, and in order to overcome this, we propose to use an
effective two-body interaction well-known from nuclear physics. Through
numerical experiments we demonstrate a significant increase in accuracy of the
configuration interaction method.
