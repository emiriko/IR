Motivated by recent experiments on Nd-langasite, we consider the effect of
strong easy axis single-ion anisotropy $D$ on $S > 3/2$ spins interacting with
antiferromagnetic exchange $J$ on the Kagome lattice. When $T \ll DS^2$, the
collinear low energy states selected by the anisotropy map on to configurations
of the classical Kagome lattice Ising antiferromagnet. However, the low
temperature limit is quite different from the cooperative Ising paramagnet that
obtains classically for $T \ll JS^2$. We find that sub-leading ${\mathcal
O}(J^3S/D^2)$ multi-spin interactions arising from the transverse quantum
dynamics result in a crossover from an intermediate temperature classical
cooperative Ising paramagnet to a semiclassical spin liquid with distinct
short-ranged correlations for $T \ll J^3S/D^2$.
