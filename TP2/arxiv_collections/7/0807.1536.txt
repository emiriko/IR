The PICASSO collaboration observed for the first time a significant
difference between the acoustic signals induced by neutrons and alpha particles
in a detector based on superheated liquids. This new discovery offers the
possibility of improved background suppression and could be especially useful
for dark matter experiments. This new effect may be attributed to the formation
of multiple bubbles on alpha tracks, compared to single nucleations created by
neutron induced recoils.
