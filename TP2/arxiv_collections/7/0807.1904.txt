In the present paper, the characterization of the Kerr metric found by Marc
Mars is extended to the Kerr-Newman family. A simultaneous alignment of the
Maxwell field, the Ernst two-form of the pseudo-stationary Killing vector
field, and the Weyl curvature of the metric is shown to imply that the
space-time is locally isometric to domains in the Kerr-Newman metric. The paper
also presents an extension of Ionescu and Klainerman's null tetrad formalism to
explicitly include Ricci curvature terms.
