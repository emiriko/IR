The paper addresses counterintuitive behavior of electrons injected into
dense cryogenic media with negative scattering length $a_0$. Instead of
expected polaronic effect (formation of density enhancement clusters) which
should substantially reduce the electron mobility, an opposite picture is
observed: with increasing $|a_0|$ (the trend taking place for inert gases with
the growth of atomic number) and the medium density, the electrons remain
practically free. An explanation of this behaviour is provided based on
consistent accounting for the non-linearity of electron interaction with the
gaseous medium in the gas atom number density.
