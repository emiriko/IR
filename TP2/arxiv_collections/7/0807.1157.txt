The quantum Hall effect in graphene p-n junctions is studied numerically with
emphasis on the effect of disorder at the interface of two adjacent regions.
Conductance plateaus are found to be attached to the intensity of the disorder,
and are accompanied by universal conductance fluctuations in the bipolar
regime, which is in good agreement with theoretical predictions of the random
matrix theory on quantum chaotic cavities. The calculated Fano factors can be
used in an experimental identification of the underlying transport character.
