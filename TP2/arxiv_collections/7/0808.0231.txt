In 2004 the discovery of superconductivity in heavily boron-doped diamond
(C:B) led to an increasing interest in the superconducting phases of wide-gap
semiconductors. Subsequently superconductivity was found in heavily boron-doped
cubic silicon (Si:B) and recently in the stochiometric ''mixture'' of heavily
boron-doped silicon carbide (SiC:B). The latter system surprisingly exhibits
type-I superconductivity in contrast to the type-II superconductors C:B and
Si:B. Here we will focus on the specific heat of two different superconducting
samples of boron-doped SiC. One of them contains cubic and hexagonal SiC
whereas the other consists mainly of hexagonal SiC without any detectable cubic
phase fraction. The electronic specific heat in the superconducting state of
both samples SiC:B can be described by either assuming a BCS-type exponentional
temperature dependence or a power-law behavior.
