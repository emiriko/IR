A hybrid Car-Parrinello QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation has been carried
out for the Watson-Crick base pair of 9-ethyl-8-phenyladenine and
1-cyclohexyluracil in deuterochloroform solution at room temperature. The
resulting trajectory is analyzed putting emphasis on the N-H$...$N Hydrogen
bond geometry. Using an empirical correlation between the $\NN$-distance and
the fundamental NH-stretching frequency, the time-dependence of this energy gap
along the trajectory is obtained. From the gap-correlation function we
determine the infrared absorption spectrum using lineshape theory in
combination with a multimode oscillator model. The obtained average transition
frequency and the width of the spectrum is in reasonable agreement with recent
experimental data.
