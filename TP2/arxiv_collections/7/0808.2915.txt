We generalize and test the recent "ab initio" self-consistent (AISC)
time-independent semiclassical laser theory. This self-consistent formalism
generates all the stationary lasing properties in the multimode regime
(frequencies, thresholds, internal and external fields, output power and
emission pattern) from simple inputs: the dielectric function of the passive
cavity, the atomic transition frequency, and the transverse relaxation time of
the lasing transition. We find that the theory gives excellent quantitative
agreement with full time-dependent simulations of the Maxwell-Bloch equations
after it has been generalized to drop the slowly-varying envelope
approximation. The theory is infinite order in the non-linear hole-burning
interaction; the widely used third order approximation is shown to fail badly.
