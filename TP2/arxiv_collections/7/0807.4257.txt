We demonstrate that most features ascribed to strong correlation effects in
various spectroscopies of the cuprates are captured by a calculation of the
self-energy incorporating effects of spin and charge fluctuations. The self
energy is calculated over the full doping range of electron-doped cuprates from
half filling to the overdoped system. The spectral function reveals four
subbands, two widely split incoherent bands representing the remnant of the
split Hubbard bands, and two additional coherent, spin- and charge-dressed
in-gap bands split by a spin-density wave, which collapses in the overdoped
regime. The incoherent features persist to high doping, producing a remnant
Mott gap in the optical spectra, while transitions between the in-gap states
lead to pseudogap features in the mid-infrared.
