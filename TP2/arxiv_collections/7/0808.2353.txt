To establish an applicable system for advanced quantum information processing
between light and atoms, we have demonstrated the quantum non-demolition (QND)
measurement with a collective spin of cold ytterbium atoms (171Yb), and
observed 1.8 (-1.5, +2.4) dB spin squeezing. Since a 171Yb atom has only a
nuclear spin of 1/2 in the ground state, the system is the simplest spin
ensemble and robust against decoherence. We used very short pulses with the
width of 100 ns, so the interaction time became much shorter than the
decoherence time, which is important for multi-step quantum information
processing.
