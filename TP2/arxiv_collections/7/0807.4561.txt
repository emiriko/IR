I consider semi-classical type IIA strings rotating in the AdS4 part of AdS4
X CP3. The one loop sigma model corrections to this classical solution are used
to compute the energy shift, and the result is found to be E-S=f(lambda) ln S
with f(lambda)= sqrt{2 lambda} - 5 ln 2 /2 pi + O (1/sqrt{lambda}). Even though
the functional forms match, the actual numerical value of this one loop string
result differs from the result obtained on the integrable N=6 Chern-Simons
(ABJM) theory side.
