A new Monte Carlo approach is proposed to investigate the fluid-solid phase
transition of the polydisperse system. By using the extended ensemble, a
reversible path was constructed to link the monodisperse and corresponding
polydisperse system. Once the fluid-solid coexistence point of the monodisperse
system is known, the fluid-solid coexistence point of the polydisperse system
can be obtained from the simulation. The validity of the method is checked by
the simulation of the fluid-solid phase transition of a size-polydisperse hard
sphere colloid. The results are in agreement with the previous studies.
