It is shown that the phase angle of the third harmonic of polarization
response (delta3) is very sensitive to the ageing state of hard, Fe-doped lead
zirconate titanate [Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 or PZT] ceramics and may thus provide rich
information on processes responsible for ageing in hard ferroelectrics. When
hard PZT ceramics experience hardening (aged state) - softening (deaged state)
transition, delta3 changes by about 90 degrees at subswitching fields and by
about 180 degrees at switching conditions. Evolution of delta3 with time,
temperature and electric field amplitude during deageing suggests that at least
two mechanisms of charge migration, one short-range and one long-range, may
participate in the deageing process.
