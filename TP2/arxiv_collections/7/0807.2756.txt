A fluorescence decay of high-affinity non-ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Oregon
Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1) is analyzed with unprecedented temporal resolution in the
two-photon excitation regime. A triple exponential decay is shown to best fit
the fluorescence dynamics of OGB-1. We provide a new model for accurate
measurements of the free Ca2+ concentration and dissociation constants of
non-ratiometric calcium indicators.
