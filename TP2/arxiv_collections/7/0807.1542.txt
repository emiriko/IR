The newly discovered high temperature superconductor SmFeAs(O1-xFx) shows a
clear nematic transition where the square lattice of Fe ions has a rectangular
distortion. Similar nematic ordering has also been observed in the cuprate
superconductors. We provide a detailed theory of experimental observables near
such a nematic transition: we calculate the scaling of specific heat, local
density of states (LDOS) and NMR relaxation rate 1/T_1T.
