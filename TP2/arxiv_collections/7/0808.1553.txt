Conformal Galilei algebra contains so(1,2) subalgebra which is the conformal
algebra in one dimension. In this note we generalize methods previously
developed for one-dimensional many-body systems and construct a unitary map
relating a quantum mechanics invariant under the conformal Galilean
transformations to a set of decoupled particles for which the same symmetry is
realized in a nonlocal way. Possible applications of the map are discussed.
