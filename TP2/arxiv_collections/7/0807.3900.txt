Nonlinear charge transport in strongly coupled semiconductor superlattices is
described by Wigner-Poisson kinetic equations involving one or two minibands.
Electron-electron collisions are treated within the Hartree approximation
whereas other inelastic collisions are described by a modified BGK
(Bhatnaghar-Gross-Krook) model. The hyperbolic limit is such that the collision
frequencies are of the same order as the Bloch frequencies due to the electric
field and the corresponding terms in the kinetic equation are dominant. In this
limit, spatially nonlocal drift-diffusion balance equations for the miniband
populations and the electric field are derived by means of the Chapman-Enskog
perturbation technique. For a lateral superlattice with spin-orbit interaction,
electrons with spin up or down have different energies and their corresponding
drift-diffusion equations can be used to calculate spin-polarized currents and
electron spin polarization. Numerical solutions show stable self-sustained
oscillations of the current and the spin polarization through a voltage biased
lateral superlattice thereby providing an example of superlattice spin
oscillator.
