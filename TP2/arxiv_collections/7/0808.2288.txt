Questions of flux regulation in biological cells raise renewed interest in
the narrow escape problem. The often inadequate expansions of the narrow escape
time are due to a not so well known fact that the boundary singularity of
Green's function for Poisson's equation with Neumann and mixed
Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions in three-dimensions contains a
logarithmic singularity. Using this fact, we find the second term in the
expansion of the narrow escape time and in the expansion of the principal
eigenvalue of the Laplace equation with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary
conditions, with small Dirichlet and large Neumann parts. We also find the
leakage flux of Brownian particles that diffuse from a source to an absorbing
target on a reflecting boundary of a domain, if a small perforation is made in
the reflecting boundary.
