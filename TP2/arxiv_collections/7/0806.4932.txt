I consider two identical quantum particles in two boxes. We can split each
box, and thereby the wavefunction of each particle, into two parts. When two
half boxes are interchanged and combined with the other halves, where do the
two particles end up? I solve this problem for two identical bosons and for two
identical fermions. The solution can be used to define a measurement that
yields some information about the relative phase between the two parts of a
split wavefunction.
