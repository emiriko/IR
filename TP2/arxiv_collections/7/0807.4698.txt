In this paper we describe gauge invariant multi-quark states generalising the
path integral framework developed by Parrinello, Jona-Lasinio and Zwanziger to
amend the Faddeev-Popov approach. This allows us to produce states such that,
in a limit which we call the ice-limit, fermions are dressed with glue
exclusively from the fundamental modular region associated with Coulomb gauge.
The limit can be taken analytically without difficulties, avoiding the Gribov
problem. This is llustrated by an unambiguous construction of gauge invariant
mesonic states for which we simulate the static quark--antiquark potential.
