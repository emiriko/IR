We introduce the concept of a prehomogeneous determinant as a nonreduced
version of a linear free divisor. Both are special cases of prehomogeneous
vector spaces. We show that the roots of the $b$-function are symmetric about
-1 for reductive prehomogeneous determinants and for regular special linear
free divisors. For general prehomogeneous determinants, we describe conditions
under which this symmetry still holds. Combined with Kashiwara's theorem on the
roots of b-functions, our symmetry result shows that -1 is the only integer
root of the b-function. This gives a positive answer to a problem posed by
Castro-Jimenez and Ucha-Enriquez in the above cases. We study the condition of
(strong) Euler homogeneity in terms of the action of the stabilizers on the
normal spaces. As an application of our results, we show that the logarithmic
comparison theorem holds for Koszul free reductive linear free divisors exactly
if they are (strongly) Euler homogeneous.
