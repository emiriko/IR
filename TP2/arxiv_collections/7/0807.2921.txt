The determination of the conductivity of a deterministic or stochastic
classical system coupled to reservoirs at its ends can in general be mapped
onto the problem of computing the stiffness (the `energy' cost of twisting the
boundaries) of a quantum-like operator. The nature of the coupling to the
reservoirs determines the details of the mechanical coupling of the torque at
the ends.
