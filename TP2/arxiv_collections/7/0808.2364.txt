The nature of the metal-insulator Mott transition at zero temperature has
been discussed for a number of years. Whether it occurs through a quantum
critical point or through a first order transition is expected to profoundly
influence the nature of the finite temperature phase diagram. In this paper, we
study the zero temperature Mott transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model
on the square lattice with the variational cluster approximation. This takes
into account the influence of antiferromagnetic short-range correlations. By
contrast to single-site dynamical mean-field theory, the transition turns out
to be first order even at zero temperature.
