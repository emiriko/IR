We report magnetoresistance measurements over an extensive temperature range
(0.1 K $\leq T \leq$ 100 K) in a disordered ferromagnetic semiconductor (\gma).
The study focuses on a series of metallic \gma~ epilayers that lie in the
vicinity of the metal-insulator transition ($k_F l_e\sim 1$). At low
temperatures ($T < 4$ K), we first confirm the results of earlier studies that
the longitudinal conductivity shows a $T^{1/3}$ dependence, consistent with
quantum corrections from carrier localization in a ``dirty'' metal. In
addition, we find that the anomalous Hall conductivity exhibits universal
behavior in this temperature range, with no pronounced quantum corrections. We
argue that observed scaling relationship between the low temperature
longitudinal and transverse resistivity, taken in conjunction with the absence
of quantum corrections to the anomalous Hall conductivity, is consistent with
the side-jump mechanism for the anomalous Hall effect. In contrast, at high
temperatures ($T \gtrsim 4$ K), neither the longitudinal nor the anomalous Hall
conductivity exhibit universal behavior, indicating the dominance of inelastic
scattering contributions down to liquid helium temperatures.
