We introduce the notion of a "baric structure" on a triangulated category, as
an abstraction of S. Morel's weight truncation formalism for mixed l-adic
sheaves. We study these structures on the derived category D_G(X) of
G-equivariant coherent sheaves on a G-scheme X. Our main result shows how to
endow this derived category with a family of nontrivial baric structures when G
acts on X with finitely many orbits.
  We also describe a general construction for producing a new t-structure on a
triangulated category equipped with given t- and baric structures, and we prove
that the staggered t-structures on D_G(X) introduced by the first author arise
in this way.
