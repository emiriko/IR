We assess transport properties of heavy quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma
(QGP) using static heavy-quark (HQ) potentials from lattice-QCD calculations in
a Brueckner many-body T-matrix approach to evaluate elastic
heavy-quark-light-quark scattering amplitudes. In the attractive meson and
diquark channels resonance states are formed for temperatures up to ~1.5 T_c,
increasing pertinent drag and diffusion coefficients for heavy-quark
rescattering in the QGP beyond the expectations from perturbative-QCD
calculations. We use these transport coefficients, complemented with
perturbative elastic HQ gluon scattering, in a relativistic Langevin simulation
to obtain HQ p_t distributions and elliptic flow (v_2) under conditions
relevant for the hot and dense medium created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion
collisions. The heavy quarks are hadronized to open-charm and -bottom mesons
within a combined quark-coalescence fragmentation scheme. The resulting
single-electron spectra from their semileptonic decays are confronted with
recent data on "non-photonic electrons" in 100 AGeV Au-Au collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC).
