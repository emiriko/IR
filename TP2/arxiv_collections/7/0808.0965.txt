We study electrostatic interaction between molecules of the DNA in which a
number of phosphate groups of the sugar-phosphate backbone are exchanged for
the pyrophosphate ones. We employ a model in which the DNA is considered as a
one-dimensional lattice of dipoles and charges corresponding to base pairs and
(pyro)phosphate groups, respectively. The interaction between molecules of the
DNA is described by a pair potential $U$ of electrostatic forces between the
two sets of dipoles and charges belonging to respective lattices describing the
molecules. Minima of potential $U$ indicate orientational ordering of the
molecules and thus liquid crystalline phases of the DNA. We use numerical
methods for finding the set of minima in conjunction with symmetries verified
by potential $U$. The symmetries form a noncommutative group of 8-th order,
${\cal S}$. Using the group ${\cal S}$ we suggest a classification of liquid
crystalline phases of the DNA, which allows of several cholesteric phases, that
is polymorphism. Pyrophosphate forms of the DNA could clarify the part played
by charges in its liquid crystalline phases, and make for experimental
research, important for nano-technological and bio-medical applications.
