We study the vector-axialvector mixing in a hot medium and its evolution
toward the chiral phase transition using different symmetry restoration
scenarios based on the generalized hidden local symmetry framework. We show
that the presence of the $a_1$ meson reduces the vector spectral function
around $\rho$ meson mass and enhances it around $a_1$ meson mass. The coupling
strength of $a_1$ to $\rho$ and $\pi$ vanishes at the critical temperature due
to the degenerate $\rho$-$a_1$ masses. This feature holds rigorously in the
chiral limit and still stays intact to good approximation for the physical pion
mass.
