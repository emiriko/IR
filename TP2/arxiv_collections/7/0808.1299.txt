We consider a stochastic control model driven by a fractional Brownian
motion. This model is a formal approximation to a queueing network with an
on-off input process. We study stochastic control problems associated with the
long-run average cost, the infinite horizon discounted cost, and the finite
horizon cost. In addition, we find a solution to a constrained minimization
problem as an application of our solution to the long-run average cost problem.
We also establish Abelian limit relationships among the value functions of the
above control problems.
