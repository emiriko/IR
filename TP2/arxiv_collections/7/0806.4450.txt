We present low-temperature and high-field magnetotransport data on
SrTiO3-LaAlO3 interfaces. The resistance shows hysteresis in magnetic field and
a logarithmic relaxation as a function of time. Oscillations in the
magnetoresistance are observed, showing a square root periodicity in the
applied magnetic field, both in large-area unstructured samples as well as in a
structured sample. An explanation in terms of a commensurability condition of
edge states in a highly mobile two-dimensional electron gas between substrate
step edges is suggested.
