Borici's construction of minimally doubled chiral fermions builds on a linear
combination of two unitarily related naive fermion actions. Being strictly
local, extremely efficient numerical implementation should be possible. The
resulting system is symmetric under the subgroup of the hypercubic group that
preserves a major hypercube diagonal. The symmetry includes both parity even
and odd transformations, but allows for an anisotropy to appear at finite
lattice spacing.
