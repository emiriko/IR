Optical spectroscopy on single crystals of the new iron arsenide
superconductor Ba{0.55}K{0.45}Fe2As2 shows that the infrared spectrum consists
of two major components: a strong metallic Drude band and a well separated mid
infrared absorption centered at 0.7 eV. It is difficult to separate the two
components unambiguously but several fits of Lorentzian peaks suggest a model
with a Drude peak having a plasma frequency of 1.8 to 2.1 eV and a midinfrared
peak with a plasma frequency of 2.5 eV. In contrast to the cuprate
superconductors the scattering rate obtained from the extended Drude model
saturates at 150 meV as compared to 500 meV for a typical cuprate. Detailed
analysis of the frequency dependent scattering rate shows that the charge
carriers interact with broad bosonic spectrum with a peak at 25 meV and a
coupling constant lambda =approx 2 at low temperature. As the temperature
increases this coupling weakens to lambda=0.6 at ambient temperature. This
suggests a bosonic spectrum that is similar to what is seen in the lower Tc
cuprates.
