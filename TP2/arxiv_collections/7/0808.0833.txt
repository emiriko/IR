The diffractive dissociation of virtual photons, gamma*p -> Xp, has been
studied with the ZEUS detector at HERA by requiring a large rapidity gap
between X and the outgoing proton, by analysing the mass distribution, M_X, of
the hadronic final state, as well as by directly tagging the proton. At low
values of the proton momentum loss, the diffractive structure function
measurements obtained with the three methods are consistent, provided the
different treatment and contributions of proton-dissociative events are taken
into account.
