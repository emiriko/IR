Using a combination of quantum and classical computational approaches, we
model the electronic structure in amorphous silicon in order gain understanding
of the microscopic atomic configurations responsible for light induced
degradation of solar cells. We demonstrate that regions of strained silicon
bonds could be as important as dangling bonds for creating traps for charge
carriers. Further, our results show that defects are preferentially formed when
a region in the amorphous silicon contains a hole and a light-induced
excitation. These results agree with the puzzling dependencies on temperature,
time, and pressure observed experimentally.
