We calculate the efficiency of a rejection-free dynamic Monte Carlo method
for $d$-dimensional off-lattice homogeneous particles interacting through a
repulsive power-law potential $r^{-p}$. Theoretically we find the algorithmic
efficiency in the limit of low temperatures and/or high densities is
asymptotically proportional to $\rho^{\tfrac{p+2}{2}}T^{-\tfrac{d}{2}}$ with
the particle density $\rho$ and the temperature $T$. Dynamic Monte Carlo
simulations are performed in 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional systems with different
powers $p$, and the results agree with the theoretical predictions.
