This note details recent measurements of the top mass and cross section that
have been performed at the Tevatron. Most of these measurements have been
performed with between 1.0 and 2.0 fb-1 of data. Basic top physics concepts are
discussed, cross section and mass analysis methods and results are presented,
and future analysis prospects are discussed with a special attention given to
Electroweak determination of the limits on the Standard Model Higgs mass.
