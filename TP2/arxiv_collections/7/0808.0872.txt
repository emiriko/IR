Optical frequency conversion by four-wave mixing (Bragg scattering) in a
fiber is considered. The evolution of this process can be modeled using the
signal and idler amplitudes, which are complex, or Stokes-like parameters,
which are real. The Stokes-space formalism allows one to visualize power and
phase information simultaneously, and produces a simple evolution equation for
the Stokes parameters.
