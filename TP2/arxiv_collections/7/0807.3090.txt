The leading logarithmic approximation method fails to yield the correct
asymptotic behavior in some realistic situations: inclusion of the beta-terms
to which the LLA method is insensitive may change a power growth to merely
logarithmic. The results of [hep-ph/0101058] indicate that the problem of
large-s behavior of total cross sections belongs to this class. Similarly, a
reference to the LLA method cannot be sufficient to justify constructions such
as the kT jet algorithm.
