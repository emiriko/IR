We show that pulse shaping techniques can be applied to tailor the ultrafast
temporal response of the strongly confined and enhanced optical near fields in
the feed gap of resonant optical antennas (ROAs). Using finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) simulations followed by Fourier transformation, we obtain
the impulse response of a nano structure in the frequency domain, which allows
obtaining its temporal response to any arbitrary pulse shape. We apply the
method to achieve deterministic optimal temporal field compression in ROAs with
reduced symmetry and in a two-wire transmission line connected to a symmetric
dipole antenna. The method described here will be of importance for experiments
involving coherent control of field propagation in nanophotonic structures and
of light-induced processes in nanometer scale volumes.
