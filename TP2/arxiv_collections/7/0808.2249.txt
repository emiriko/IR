We study transport across a point contact separating two line junctions in a
\nu = 5/2 quantum Hall system. We analyze the effect of inter-edge Coulomb
interactions between the chiral bosonic edge modes of the half-filled Landau
level (assuming a Pfaffian wave function for the half-filled state) and of the
two fully filled Landau levels. In the presence of inter-edge Coulomb
interactions between all the six edges participating in the line junction, the
stable fixed point corresponds to a point contact which is neither fully opaque
nor fully transparent. Remarkably, this fixed point represents a situation
where the half-filled level is fully transmitting, while the two filled levels
are completely backscattered; hence the fixed point Hall conductance is given
by G_H = {1/2} e^2/h. We predict the non-universal temperature power laws by
which the system approaches the stable fixed point from the two unstable fixed
points corresponding to the fully connected case (G_H = {5/2} e^2/h) and the
fully disconnected case (G_H = 0).
