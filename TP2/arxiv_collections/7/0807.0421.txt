We establish a connection between the strong solution to the spatially
periodic Navier-Stokes equations and a solution to a system of forward-backward
stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) on the group of volume-preserving
diffeomorphisms of a flat torus. We construct representations of the strong
solution to the Navier-Stokes equations in terms of diffusion processes.
