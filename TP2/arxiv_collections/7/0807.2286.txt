We show that the natural morphism $\phi:\pi_1(X_{\eta},x_{\eta})\to
\pi_1(X,x)_{\eta}$ between the fundamental group scheme of the generic fiber
$X_{\eta}$ of a scheme $X$ over a connected Dedekind scheme and the generic
fiber of the fundamental group scheme of $X$ is always faithfully flat. As an
application we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite,
dominated pointed $G$-torsor over $X_{\eta}$ to be extended over $X$. We
finally provide examples where $\phi:\pi_1(X_{\eta},x_{\eta})\to
\pi_1(X,x)_{\eta}$ is an isomorphism..
