Time-resolved soft X-ray transmission microscopy is applied to image the
current-induced resonant dynamics of the magnetic vortex core realized in a
micronsized Permalloy disk. The high spatial resolution better than 25 nm
enables us to observe the resonant motion of the vortex core. The result also
provides the spin polarization of the current to be 0.67 +/-0.16 for Permalloy
by fitting the experimental results with an analytical model in the framework
of the spin-transfer torque.
