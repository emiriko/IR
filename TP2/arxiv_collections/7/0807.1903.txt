Following two dictums roadmap of Einstein (one, for incorporation of maximum
of empirical facts, and the other, on long continued experimental verifications
for perfecting a scientific theory) for future generations to make his General
Relativity Theory (GRT) evolve to perfection, it is necessary to experimentally
confirm his concept on General relativistic nature of speed of light, c, which
relates to the variation of c under the influence of gravitational field, and
whose experimental confirmation is long overdue.
  This paper gives the Execution and some Additional Details for the Space
Experiment Proposed for GRT, so that any of the Space research organizations
(viz., NASA, ESA, ASI, ISRO, etc.) would conduct this low cost experiment,
during Space missions to Mercury, Venus, or the sun, or may choose to conduct
it as an independent space mission as the cost may be brought down by sending
micro satellites using the launch sharing facility of any other lending
country. Even an advanced country may conduct this experiment at low cost by
sending a micro satellite (called a co-passenger satellite) by arranging with
the Space research organization of any lending country, which is sending a
primary satellite for a space mission to any of the desired locations.
  At present, even a small country interested in making a historic contribution
for making GRT of Einstein evolve, but not having a Space research
organization, may contract with an experienced organization, or hire the
services of an experienced project director who
  * can organize the planning, procurement, and launching of a micro satellite
carrying the laser device, from launch pad of another country (adopting the
piggy back launching method), and
  * can guide (else, can hire the services of a Principal Investigator, from
some renowned institute) remote operation of the laser device for a few days.
