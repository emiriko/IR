It is well-known that in fluid dynamics an alternative to customary direct
solution methods (based on the discretization of the fluid fields) is provided
by so-called \emph{particle simulation methods}. Particle simulation methods
rely typically on appropriate \emph{kinetic models} for the fluid equations
which permit the evaluation of the fluid fields in terms of suitable
expectation values (or \emph{momenta}) of the kinetic distribution function
$f(\mathbf{r,v},t),$ being respectively $\mathbf{r}$ and\textbf{\}$\mathbf{v}$
the position an velocity of a test particle with probability density
$f(\mathbf{r,v},t)$. These kinetic models can be continuous or discrete in
phase space, yielding respectively \emph{continuous} or \emph{discrete kinetic
models} for the fluids. However, also particle simulation methods may be biased
by an undesirable computational complexity. In particular, a fundamental issue
is to estimate the algorithmic complexity of numerical simulations based on
traditional LBM's (Lattice-Boltzmann methods; for review see Succi, 2001
\cite{Succi}). These methods, based on a discrete kinetic approach, represent
currently an interesting alternative to direct solution methods. Here we intend
to prove that for incompressible fluids fluids LBM's may present a high
complexity. The goal of the investigation is to present a detailed account of
the origin of the various complexity sources appearing in customary LBM's. The
result is relevant to establish possible strategies for improving the numerical
efficiency of existing numerical methods.
