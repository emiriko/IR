We consider T=0 states in even-even and odd-odd N=Z nuclei. The g factors
that emerge are isoscalar. We find that the single j shell model gives simple
expressions for these g factors which for even-even nuclei are suprisingly
close to the collective values for K=0 bands. The g factors of many 2+ in
even-even nuclei and 1+ and 3+ states in odd-odd nuclei have g factors close to
0.5.
