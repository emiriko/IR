This proceedings describes the XFT stereo upgrade for the CDF Level 2 trigger
system. Starting with the stereo finder boards, up to the XFT stereo track
algorithim implementation in the Level 2 PC. This proceedings will discuss the
effectiveness of the Level 2 Stereo track algorithm at achieving reduced
trigger rates with high efficiencies during high luminosity running.
