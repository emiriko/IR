This is a pedagogical and self-contained review on obtaining electroweak
precision constraints on TeV scale new physics using the effective theory
method. We identify a set of relevant effective operators in the standard model
and calculate from them corrections to all major electroweak precision
observables. The corrections are compared with data to put constraints on the
effective operators. Various approaches and applications in the literature are
reviewed.
