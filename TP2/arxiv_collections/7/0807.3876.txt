The peculiar correlation effects on the triangular lattice are studied by
means of the rotationally invariant slave boson method in a cellular cluster
approach. Hence nonlocal correlations are included in a short-range regime.
Their impact for the single-band Hubbard model is studied at half filling,
i.e., on the Mott transition, and with doping. Using the realistic band
structure of Na$_x$CoO$_2$, we may also shed light on the cobaltate physics for
$x$$\ge$1/3, with the in-plane transition from antiferromagnetic tendencies
towards the onset of ferromagnetism for a finite Hubbard $U$.
