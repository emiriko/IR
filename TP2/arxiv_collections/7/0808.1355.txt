The polarization process when polarizers act on an optical field is studied.
We give examples for two kinds of polarizers. The first kind presents an
anisotropic absorption - as in a polaroid film - and the second one is based on
total reflection at the interface with a birefringent medium. Using the Stokes
vector representation, we determine explicitly the trajectories of the wave
light polarization during the polarization process. We find that such
trajectories are not always geodesics of the Poincar\'e sphere as it is usually
thought. Using the analogy between light polarization and special relativity,
we find that the action of successive polarizers on the light wave polarization
is equivalent to the action of a single resulting polarizer followed by a
rotation achieved for example by a device with optical activity. We find a
composition law for polarizers similar to the composition law for noncollinear
velocities in special relativity. We define an angle equivalent to the
relativistic Wigner angle which can be used to quantify the quality of two
composed polarizers.
