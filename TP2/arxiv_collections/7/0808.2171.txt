We propose a method for laser cooling and trapping a substantial class of
polar molecules, and in particular titanium (II) oxide (TiO). This method uses
pulsed electric fields to nonadiabatically remix the ground-state magnetic
sublevels of the molecule, allowing us to build a magneto-optical trap (MOT)
based on a quasi-cycling $J'=J"-1$ transition. Monte-Carlo simulations of this
electrostatically remixed MOT (ER-MOT) demonstrate the feasibility of cooling
TiO to a temperature of 10 $\mathrm{\mu}K$ and trapping it with a
radiation-pumping-limited lifetime on the order of 80 ms.
