This is a status report of the evaluation of the three-loop corrections to
the static QCD potential of a heavy quark and an antiquark. The families of
Feynman integrals that appear in the evaluation are described. To reduce any
integral of the families to master integrals we solve integration-by-parts
relations by the algorithm called FIRE. To evaluate the corresponding master
integrals we apply the Mellin-Barnes technique. First results are presented:
the coefficients of n_l^3 and n_l^2, where n_l is the number of light quarks.
