Electrically charged systems bound by a strong gravitational force can
sustain a huge amount of electric charge (up to 10^20C) against Coulomb
repulsion. General relativistically such systems form a stable hydrostatic
configuration both in the non-rotating and rotating cases. Here we study the
effects of electric charge (electric energy density) on the spacetime outside a
rotating electrically charged system bound by a strong gravitational force. In
particular we investigate the effect of charge density on frame-dragging of
spacetime in the exterior region. Using the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations
it is found that in the slow rotation approximation charge accumulations not
only acts like an additional mass, thus modifying the spherically symmetric
part of the spacetime, the electric charge also contributes directly to the
dragging of spacetime. A modified Lense-Thirring formula for the spacetime
frame dragging frequency is obtained.
