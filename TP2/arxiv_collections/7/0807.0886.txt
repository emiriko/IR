We propose the scale-invariant intrinsic hyperpolarizability as a measure of
the figure of merit for electrooptic molecules. By applying our analysis to the
best second-order nonlinear-optical molecules that are made using the present
paradigms, we conclude that it should be possible to make dye-doped polymers
with electrooptic coefficients of several thousand picometers per volt.
