We discuss the phenomenology of charged Higgs bosons in the MSSM with minimal
flavor violation. In addition to the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) with universal
soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters at the GUT scale, we explore
non-universal Higgs mass models (NUHM) where this universality condition is
relaxed. To identify the allowed parameter space regions, we apply constraints
from direct searches, low energy observables, and cosmology. We find that
values of the charged Higgs mass as low as $m_{H^+}\simeq~135$ GeV can be
accommodated in the NUHM models, but that several flavor physics observables
disfavor large $H^+$ contributions, associated with high $\tan\beta$, quite
independently of MSSM scenario. We confront the constrained scenarios with the
discovery potentials reported by ATLAS and CMS, and find that the current
exclusion by indirect constraints is similar to the expected LHC discovery
reach with 30 fb$^{-1}$ of data. Finally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the
presented discovery potential to the choice of MSSM benchmark scenario. This
sensitivity is found to be higher in the case of a light ($m_{H^+}<m_t$)
charged Higgs.
