One-dimensional nonlinear phononic crystals have been assembled from periodic
diatomic chains of stainless steel cylinders alternated with
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) spheres. We report the presence of acoustic band
gaps in the dispersion relation of the linearized systems and study the
transformation of single and multiple pulses in linear, nonlinear and strongly
nonlinear regimes with numerical calculations and experiments. The limiting
frequencies of the band gap are within the audible frequency range (20-20,000
Hz) and can be tuned by varying the particle's material properties, mass and
initial compression. Pulses rapidly transform within very short distances from
the impacted end due to the influence of the band gap in the linear and in
nonlinear elastic chains. The effects of an in situ band gap created by a mean
dynamic compression are observed in the strongly nonlinear wave regime.
