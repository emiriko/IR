In this article we look into characterizing primitive groups in the following
way. Given a primitive group we single out a subset of its generators such that
these generators alone (the so-called primitive generators) imply the group is
primitive. The remaining generators ensure transitivity or comply with specific
features of the group.
  We show that, other than the symmetric and alternating groups, there are
infinitely many primitive groups with one primitive generator each. These
primitive groups are certain Mathieu groups, certain projective general and
projective special linear groups, and certain subgroups of some affine special
linear groups.
