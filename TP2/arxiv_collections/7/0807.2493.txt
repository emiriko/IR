A combination of three or more tones played together is called a chord. In
the chromatic scale, chords which are consonant are of particular interest and
can be divided into several groups, two main ones being the major and minor
chords. This paper shows that if three sounds are produced by three spatially
separated sources, a "happy" sounding major chord can be observed as its "sad"
sounding counterpart depending on the observer's velocity - a consequence of
the well known Doppler effect. The analysis is further extended to show that
almost any triad may be observed by choosing an appropriate frame of reference,
and several interesting symmetries, asymmetries and features of the system are
discussed. Finally, the possibility of applications of this effect in the music
performance and creation in the context of "interactive listener" is discussed
and suggestions for overcoming some technical difficulties are proposed.
