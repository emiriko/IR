Motivated by recent huge interests on graphene sheet and graphite as
"relativistic" systems, a BCS superconductivity in a quasi-(2+1)-dimensional
relativistic model is investigated. The intra-layer particle dynamics is
described by a (2+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu-type four-body contact interaction
model, while inter-layer particle motions will be caused by a hopping term with
a transfer parameter $t$. Especially, we examine the effects of non-vanishing
$t$, chemical potential $\mu$, and a mass parameter $m$ which will give a gap
at a conical intersection point of the relativistic band dispersion, in the BCS
s-wave (scalar) superconducting gap function $\Delta$.
