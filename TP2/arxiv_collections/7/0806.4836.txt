We report optical orientation experiments in individual, strain free GaAs
quantum dots in AlGaAs grown by droplet epitaxy. Circularly polarized optical
excitation yields strong circular polarization of the resulting
photoluminescence at 4K. Optical injection of spin polarized electrons into a
dot gives rise to dynamical nuclear polarization that considerably changes the
exciton Zeeman splitting (Overhauser shift). We show that the created nuclear
polarization is bistable and present a direct measurement of the build-up time
of the nuclear polarization in a single GaAs dot in the order of one second.
