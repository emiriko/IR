Grobli (1877) laid the foundation for the analysis of the motion of three
point vortices in a plane by deriving governing equations for triangular
configurations of the vortices. Synge (1949) took this formulation one step
further to that of a similar triangle of unit perimeter, via trilinear
coordinates. The final reduced problem is governed by an integrable
two-dimensional system of differential equations with solutions represented as
planar trajectories. Another key to Synge's analysis was his classification of
the problem into three distinct cases: elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic
corresponding, respectively, to the sum of products of pairs of vortex
strengths being positive, negative or zero. The reduction of the vortex
configuration, a curve in space to a planar curve is one-to-one, except along a
critical planar curve C in the parabolic case. Each point on C represents a
triangle of unit perimeter corresponding to a family of similar vortex
configurations, expanding or contracting. The latter would lead to coelescence
of the three vortices. Tavantzis and Ting (1988) filled most of the gaps left
by Synge regarding the dynamics of the problem, and showed in particular that
points on C corresponding to similar expanding families of vortex
configurations are stable while those corresponding to similar contracting
families are unstable. Their investigations yielded an exhaustive description
of the motion and stability of three vortices in a plane except for the global
behavior of the vortex configurations in a narrow strip containing C. The main
contribution of this paper is a complete description of the global dynamics in
such a strip, which emphaticallly demonstrates that three distinct vortices
almost never coalesce.
