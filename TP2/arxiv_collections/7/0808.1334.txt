Electrical conductivity, thermopower and magnetic properties of
Fe-intercalated Fe0.33VSe2 has been reported between 4.2K - 300K. We observe a
first order transition in the resistivity of the sintered pellets around 160K
on cooling. The electronic properties including the transitional hysteresis in
the resistance anomaly (from 80K-160K) are found to be very sensitive to the
structural details of the samples, which were prepared in different annealing
conditions. The thermopower results on the sintered pellets are reported
between 10K - 300K. The magnetic measurements between 2K - 300K and up to 14
Tesla field show the absence of any magnetic ordering in Fe0.33VSe2. The
magnetic moment per Fe -atom at room temperature (between 1.4 to 1.7 Bohr
Magneton) is much lower than in previously reported anti-ferromagnetic FeV2Se4.
Furthermore, the Curie constant shows a rapid and continuous reduction and
combined with the high field magnetization result at 2K suggests a rapid
decrease in the paramagnetic moments on cooling to low temperatures and the
absence of any magnetic order in Fe0.33VSe2 at low temperatures.
