The structural and magnetic phase transitions of the ternary iron arsenides
SrFe2As2 and EuFe2As2 were studied by temperature-dependent x-ray powder
diffraction and 57-Fe Moessbauer spectroscopy. Both compounds crystallize in
the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure at room temperature and exhibit
displacive structural transitions at 203 K (SrFe2As2) or 190 K (EuFe2As2) to
orthorhombic lattice symmetry in agreement with the group-subgroup relationship
between I4/mmm and Fmmm. 57-Fe Moessbauer spectroscopy experiments with SrFe2
As2 show full hyperfine field splitting below the phase transition temperature
(8.91(1) T at 4.2 K). Order parameters were extracted from detailed
measurements of the lattice parameters and fitted to a simple power law. We
find a relation between the critical exponents and the transition temperatures
for AFe2As2 compounds, which shows that the transition of BaFe2As2 is indeed
more continuous than the transition of SrFe2As2 but it remains second order
even in the latter case.
