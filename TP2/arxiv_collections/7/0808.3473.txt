We study the impurity suppression of the critical temperature $T_c$ of the
FeAs superconductors theoretically based on the the $\pm$s-wave pairing state
of a two band model. The effects of non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are
studied with the $\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation, which can continuously
treat impurity scattering from weak to strong coupling limit. We found that
both magnetic and non-magnetic impurities suppress $T_c$ with a rate that is
practically indistinguishable from the standard d-wave case despite a possibly
large difference of the positive and negative s-wave order parameter (OP)
magnitudes. This is because the density of states enters together with the OP
magnitude for the scattering process.
