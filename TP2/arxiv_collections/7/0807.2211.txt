Some methods for the determination and the most precise values of constants
of an extended Standard Model, which include the gravitation interaction and
massive neutrinos, are presented. Accuracies of constants at different energy
scales are compared and the possible manifestations of temporal variations of
constants are considered. Theoretical estimations and obtained experimental
bounds of variations are listed, that is important as for search of SM
generalizations as to account for possible influence on metrological
characteristics of measurement standards.
