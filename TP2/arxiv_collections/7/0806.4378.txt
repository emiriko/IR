We propose an alternative approach to the dissipative vortex dynamics
occurring in a superfluid vortex lattice at finite temperatures. Focusing upon
the pseudomomentum of a vortex and its surrounding quasiparticles, we derive an
equation of motion which, in spite of yielding the same evolution as the usual
one for massless vortices, does not involve the vortex mass. This picture could
provide further insights into the controversy about the nature of the vortex
mass.
