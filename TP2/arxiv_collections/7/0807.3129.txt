So far the theory of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of polar molecules was
based on an ad hoc generalization of equations for spherical atoms. Here I
adopt a rigorous pseudo-potential approach to low-energy dipolar interactions
and derive a non-linear mean-field Schrodinger equation for a
harmonically-trapped condensate. I show that, effectively, the dipolar
interactions alter molecular mass. The resulting effective mass is anisotropic:
to the leading order the mass is altered only for the motion along the
polarizing field. For a typical BEC of spin-polarized magnetically-interacting
alkali-metal atoms the effective atomic mass is reduced by 10% from its bare
value. For a BEC of polar molecules the mass may be reduced by a factor of a
1,000.
