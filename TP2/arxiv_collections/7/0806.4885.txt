We prove nonexistence of nonconstant local minimizers for a class of
functionals, which typically appears in the scalar two-phase field model, over
a smooth N-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary with non-negative
Ricci curvature. Conversely for a class of surfaces possessing a simple closed
geodesic along which the Gauss curvature is negative we prove existence of
nonconstant local minimizers for the same class of functionals.
