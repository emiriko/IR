The Higgs-boson production in association with a W-boson pair at $e^+e^-$
linear colliders is one of the important processes in probing the coupling
between Higgs-boson and vector gauge bosons and discovering the signature of
new physics. We describe the impact of the complete electroweak(EW) radiative
corrections of ${\cal O}(\alpha_{ew})$ to this process in the standard
model(SM) at the International Linear Collider(ILC), and investigate the
dependence of the lowest-order(LO) and EW next-to-leading order(NLO) corrected
cross sections on colliding energy $\sqrt{s}$ and Higg-boson mass. The LO and
NLO EW corrected distributions of the invariant mass of W-boson pair and the
transverse momenta of final $W$- and Higgs-boson are presented. Our numerical
results show that the relative EW radiative correction($\delta_{ew}$) varies
from -19.4% to 0.2% when $m_H=120 GeV$ and $\sqrt{s}$ goes up from $300 GeV$ to
$1.2 TeV$.
