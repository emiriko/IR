We study in the $k_T$ factorisation framework jet production at LHC energies.
In particular we are interested in valence quark and gluon initiated jets. The
calculation of the relevant hard matrix element is presented. A CCFM like
evolutionequation for valence quark distribution is solved and the cross
section for valence quark and gluon initiated process is calculated using Monte
Carlo event generator CASCADE.
