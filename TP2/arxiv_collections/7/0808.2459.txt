Three events for the decay K+ => pi+,nu,nubar have been observed in the pion
momentum region below the K+ => pi+,pi0 peak, 140 < P_pi < 199 MeV/c, with an
estimated background of 0.93+-0.17(stat.)+0.32-0.24(syst.) events. Combining
this observation with previously reported results yields a branching ratio of
B(K+ => pi+,nu,nubar) = (1.73+1.15-1.05)e-10 consistent with the standard model
prediction.
