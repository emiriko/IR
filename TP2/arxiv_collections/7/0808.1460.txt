In this paper we have derived Young's, Wenzel's and Cassie-Baxter's equations
using conceptual model rather than showing rigorous derivation to help the
new-comers in this field. We then pointed out that if the substrate is
initially hydorphilic then one can modify the surface morphology and make the
substrate to become hydrophobic or superhydrophobic. But, if the substrate is
initially hydrophobic then one can only make it superhydrophobic but not
hydrophilic by modifying the surface morphology using the formalisms mentioned
in this paper
