After a brief introduction to neutrino oscillations and a review of the world
knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters, we introduce two current neutrino
oscillation experiments, MINOS and MiniBooNE. MINOS makes precise measurements
of the oscillation parameters |\Delta m^{2}_{32}| and sin^{2} (2\theta_{23}).
MiniBooNE tests neutrino oscillations in the parameter region reported by the
LSND experiment, which would require a new neutrino state. We review recent
experimental results from both experiments and give an outlook on future
measurements.
