In the optical conductivity of four different manganites with commensurate
charge order (CO), strong peaks appear in the meV range below the ordering
temperature T_{CO}. They are similar to those reported for one-dimensional
charge density waves (CDW) and are assigned to pinned phasons. The peaks and
their overtones allow one to obtain, for La{1-n/8}Ca{n/8}$MnO{3} with n = 5, 6,
the electron-phonon coupling, the effective mass of the CO system, and its
contribution to the dielectric constant. These results support a description of
the CO in La-Ca manganites in terms of moderately weak-coupling and of the CDW
theory.
