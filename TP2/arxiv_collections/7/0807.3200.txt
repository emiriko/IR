We study non-classical and spectral properties of a strongly driven
single-atom laser engineered within a photonic crystal that facilitates a
frequency-dependent reservoir. In these studies, we apply a dressed atom model
approach to derive the master equation of the system and study the properties
of the dressed laser under the frequency dependent transition rates. By going
beyond the secular approximation in the dressed-atom cavity field interaction,
we find that if, in addition, the non-secular terms are included into the
dynamics of the system, then non-linear processes can occur that lead to
interesting new aspects of cavity field behavior. We calculate variances of the
quadrature phase amplitudes and the incoherent part of the spectrum of the
cavity field and show that they differ qualitatively from those observed under
the secular approximation. In particular, it is found that the non-linear
processes lead to squeezing of the fluctuations of the cavity field below the
quantum shot noise limit. The squeezing depends on the relative population of
the dressed states of the system and is found only if there is no population
inversion between the dressed states. Furthermore, we find a linewidth
narrowing below the quantum limit in the spectrum of the cavity field that is
achieved only when the secular approximation is not made. An interpretation of
the linewidth narrowing is provided in terms of two phase dependent noise
(squeezing) spectra that make up the incoherent spectrum. We establish that the
linewidth narrowing is due squeezing of the fluctuations in one quadrature
phase components of the cavity field.
