The local linear embedding algorithm (LLE) is a non-linear dimension-reducing
technique, widely used due to its computational simplicity and intuitive
approach. LLE first linearly reconstructs each input point from its nearest
neighbors and then preserves these neighborhood relations in the
low-dimensional embedding. We show that the reconstruction weights computed by
LLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the
low-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly
sensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear
projection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To
overcome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using
a low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this
straightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's
sensitivity to noise. This modification also removes the need for
regularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the
input. We present numerical examples demonstrating both the perturbation and
linear projection problems, and the improved outputs using the low-dimensional
neighborhood representation.
