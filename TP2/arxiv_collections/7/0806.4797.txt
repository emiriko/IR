We report $^{123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements of the
filled skutterudite heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$ under high
pressure. The temperature dependence of NQR frequency and the spin-lattice
relaxation rate $1/T_1$ indicate that the crystal-electric-field splitting
$\Delta_{\rm CEF}$ between the ground state $\Gamma_1$ singlet and the first
excited state $\Gamma_4^{(2)}$ triplet decreases with increasing pressure.
Ac-susceptibility measurements indicate that the superconducting transition
temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) also decreases with increasing pressure. However,
above $P$ $\sim$ 2 GPa, both $\Delta_{\rm CEF}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ do not depend
on external pressure up to $P$ = 3.82 GPa. These pressure dependences of
$\Delta_{\rm CEF}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ suggest an intimate relationship between
quadrupole excitations associated with the $\Gamma_4^{(2)}$ level and
unconventional superconductivity in PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$. In the superconducting
state, 1/$T_1$ below $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.55 and 1.57 K at $P$ = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa
shows a power-law temperature variations and are proportional to $T^5$ at
temperatures considerably below $T_{\rm c}$. These data can be well fitted by
the gap model $\Delta(\theta) = \Delta_0\sin\theta$ with $\Delta_0$ = 3.08
$k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ and 3.04 $k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ for $P$ = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa,
respectively. The results indicate there exists point nodes in the gap
function.
