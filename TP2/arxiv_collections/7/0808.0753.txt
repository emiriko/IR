Using specializations of unfold and fold on a generic tree data type we
derive unranking and ranking functions providing natural number encodings for
various Hereditarily Finite datatypes.
  In this context, we interpret unranking operations as instances of a generic
anamorphism and ranking operations as instances of the corresponding
catamorphism.
  Starting with Ackerman's Encoding from Hereditarily Finite Sets to Natural
Numbers we define pairings and tuple encodings that provide building blocks for
a theory of Hereditarily Finite Functions.
  The more difficult problem of ranking and unranking Hereditarily Finite
Permutations is then tackled using Lehmer codes and factoradics.
