We study some properties of the deformed Sine Gordon models. These models,
presented by Bazeia et al, are natural generalisations of the Sine Gordon
models in (1+1) dimensions. There are two classes of them, each dependent on a
parameter n. For special values of this parameter the models reduce to the Sine
Gordon one; for other values of n they can be considered as generalisations of
this model. The models are topological and possess one kink solutions. Here we
investigate the existence of other solutions of these models - such as
breathers. The work is numerical and we find that the breathers, as such,
probably do not exist. However, we show that some of these models, namely, the
n = 1 of the first class possess breather-like solutions which are
quasi-stable; ie these quasi-breathers exist for long periods of time
(thousands of periods of oscillations). These results are found to be
independent of the discretisation used in the numerical part of our work.
