A simple, analytical, nonrelativistic ionization rate formula for atoms and
positive ions in intense ultraviolet and x-ray electromagnetic fields is
derived. The rate is valid at arbitrary values of the Keldysh parameter and
confirmed by results from ab initio numerical solutions of the single active
electron, time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The proposed rate is
particularly relevant for experiments employing the new free electron laser
(FEL) sources under construction worldwide.
