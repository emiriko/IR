Considering the dipole-dipole coupling intensity between two atoms and the
field in the Fock state, the entanglement dynamics between two atoms that are
initially entangled in the system of two two-level atoms coupled to a single
mode cavity in the presence of phase decoherence has been investigated. The
two-atom entanglement appears with periodicity without considering phase
decoherence, however, the phase decoherence causes the decay of entanglement
between two atoms, with the increasing of the phase decoherence coefficient,
the entanglement will quickly become a constant value, which is affected by the
two-atom initial state, Meanwhile the two-atom quantum state will forever stay
in the maximal entangled state when the initial state is proper even in the
presence of phase decoherence. On the other hand, the Bell violation and the
entanglement does not satisfy the monotonous relation, a large Bell violation
implies the presence of a large amount of entanglement under certain
conditions, while a large Bell violation corresponding to a little amount of
entanglement in certain situations. However, the violation of Bell-CHSH
inequality can reach the maximal value if two atoms are in the maximal
entangled state, or vice versa.
