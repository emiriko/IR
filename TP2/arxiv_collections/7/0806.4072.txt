We investigate the semileptonic hyperon decays within the framework of the
self-consistent SU(3) chiral quark-soliton model ($\chi$QSM). We take linear
$1/N_c$ rotational as well as linear $m_s$ corrections into account and apply
the symmetry conserving quantization. We present the results for the form
factors $f_1(Q^2)$, $f_2(Q^2)$ and $g_1(Q^2)$ in addition to the semileptonic
decay constants of hyperons. We also have calculated the radii and dipole
masses of these form factors for all relevant strangeness-conserving and
strangeness-changing transitions.
