We find a three-parameter family of ordinary differential systems in
dimension six with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $D_4^{(2)}$. This is the
second example which gave higher order Painlev\'e type systems of type
$D_{4}^{(2)}$. We show that we give its symmetry and holomorphy conditions.
These symmetries, holomorphy conditions and invariant divisors are new.
