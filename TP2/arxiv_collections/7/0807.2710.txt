We demonstrate that excited states in single-layer graphene quantum dots can
be detected via direct transport experiments. Coulomb diamond measurements show
distinct features of sequential tunneling through an excited state. Moreover,
the onset of inelastic cotunneling in the diamond region could be detected. For
low magnetic fields, the positions of the single-particle energy levels
fluctuate on the scale of a flux quantum penetrating the dot area. For higher
magnetic fields, the transition to the formation of Landau levels is observed.
Estimates based on the linear energy-momentum relation of graphene give carrier
numbers of the order of 10 for our device.
