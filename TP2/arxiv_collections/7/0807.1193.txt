Quantum phonon transport through benzene and alkane chains amide-linked with
single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is studied within the level of density
functional theory. The force constant matrices are obtained from standard
quantum chemistry software. The phonon transmission and thermal conductance are
from the nonequilibrium Green's function and the mode-matching method. We find
that the ballistic thermal conductance is not sensitive to the compression or
stretching of the molecular junction. The terminating groups of the SWCNTs at
the cutting edges only influence the thermal conductance quantitatively. The
conductance of the benzene and alkane chains shows large difference. Analysis
of the transmission spectrum shows that (i) the low temperature thermal
conductance is mainly contributed by the SWCNT transverse acoustic modes, (ii)
the degenerate phonon modes show different transmission probability due to the
presence of molecular junction, (iii) the SWCNT twisting mode can hardly be
transmitted by the alkane chain. As a result, the ballistic thermal conductance
of alkane chains is larger than that of benzene chains below 38 K, while it is
smaller at higher temperature.
