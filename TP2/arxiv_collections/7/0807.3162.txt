A first principles study of La$_{2-2x}$Sr$_{1+2x}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ compounds for
doping levels $0.3\leq x\leq 0.5$ shows that the low energy electronic
structure of the majority spin carriers is determined by strong momentum
dependent interactions between the Mn $e_g$ $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{3z^2-r^2}$
orbitals, which in addition to an $x$ dependent Jahn-Teller distortion, differ
in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. The Fermi surface exhibits
nesting behavior that is reflected by peaks in the static susceptibility, whose
positions as a function of momentum have a non-trivial dependence on $x$.
