We study the Kondo effect and related transport properties in orbitally
degenerate vertical quantum dot systems with plural electrons. Applying the
non-crossing approximation to the three-orbital Anderson impurity model with
the finite Coulomb interaction and Hund-coupling, we investigate the
magnetic-field dependence of the conductance and thermopower. We also introduce
an additional orbital splitting to take account of the realistic many-body
effect in the vertical quantum dot system. It is clarified how the
three-orbital Kondo effect influences the transport properties via the
modulation of the Kondo temperature and unitary limit of transport quantities
due to the change of the symmetry in the system.
