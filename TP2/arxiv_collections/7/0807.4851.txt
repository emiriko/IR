We are pursuing an experiment to measure the electric dipole moment of the
electron using the molecule PbO. This measurement requires the ability to
prepare quantum states with orientation of the molecular axis and,
simultaneously, alignment of the electron spin perpendicular to this axis. It
also requires efficient detection of the evolution of the spin alignment
direction within such a state. We describe a series of experiments that have
achieved these goals, and the features and limitations of the techniques. We
also discuss possible new approaches for improved efficiency in this and
similar systems.
