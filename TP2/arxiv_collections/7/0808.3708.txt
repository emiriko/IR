Mass differences are an often used as signature and measure for shell
closure. Using the angular-momentum projected Generator Coordinate Method and
the Skyrme interaction SLy4, we analyze the modification of mass differences
due to static deformation and dynamic fluctuations around the mean-field ground
state.
