During the past five years the low temperature heat capacity of simple
semiconductors and insulators has received renewed attention. Of particular
interest has been its dependence on isotopic masses and the effect of spin-
orbit coupling in ab initio calculations. Here we concentrate on the lead
chalcogenides PbS, PbSe and PbTe. These materials, with rock salt structure,
have different natural isotopes for both cations and anions, a fact that allows
a systematic experimental and theoretical study of isotopic effects e.g. on the
specific heat. Also, the large spin-orbit splitting of the 6p electrons of Pb
and the 5p of Te allows, using a computer code which includes spin-orbit
interaction, an investigation of the effect of this interaction on the phonon
dispersion relations and the temperature dependence of the specific heat and on
the lattice parameter. It is shown that agreement between measurements and
calculations significantly improves when spin-orbit interaction is included.
