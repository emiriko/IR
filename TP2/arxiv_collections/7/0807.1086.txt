We report the results of a search for the bottomonium ground state eta_b(1S)
in the photon energy spectrum with a sample of (109 +/- 1) million of
Upsilon(3S) recorded at the Upsilon(3S) energy with the BABAR detector at the
PEP-II B factory at SLAC. We observe a peak in the photon energy spectrum at
E_gamma = 921.2 {+2.1} {-2.8} (stat) +/- 2.4(syst) MeV with a significance of
10 standard deviations. We interpret the observed peak as being due to
monochromatic photons from the radiative transition Upsilon(3S) -> gamma
eta_b(1S). This photon energy corresponds to an eta_b(1S) mass of $9388.9
{+3.1} {-2.3} (stat) +/- 2.7(syst) MeV/c2. The hyperfine Upsilon(1S)-eta_b(1S)
mass splitting is 71.4 {+2.3} {-3.1} (stat) +/- 2.7(syst) MeV/c2. The branching
fraction for this radiative Upsilon(3S) decay is estimated to be (4.8 +/-
0.5(stat) +/- 1.2 (syst)) x 10^(-4).
