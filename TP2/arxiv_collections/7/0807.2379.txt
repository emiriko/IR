Using pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance techniques, we directly
probe electron-spin resonance transitions in the excited-state of single
Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers in diamond. Unambiguous assignment of excited
state fine structure is made, based on changes of NV defect photoluminescence
lifetime. This study provides significant insight into the structure of the
emitting 3E excited state, which is invaluable for the development of
diamond-based quantum information processing.
