Differential cross sections of the photo- and electroproduction of the
hypertriton have been calculated by utilizing modern nuclear wave functions and
the elementary operator of KAON-MAID. It is found that a proper treatment of
Fermi motion is essential for the two processes. While the average momentum
approximation can partly simulate the Fermi motion in the process, the ``frozen
nucleon'' assumption yields very different results, especially at lower
energies. The Coulomb effect induced by the interaction between the positively
charged kaon and the hypertriton is found to be negligible. The influence of
higher partial waves is also found to be relatively small, in contrast to the
finding of the previous work. The off-shell assumption is found to be very
sensitive in the case of electroproduction rather than in photoproduction. It
is shown that the few available experimental data favor the assumption that the
initial nucleon is off-shell and the final hyperon is on-shell. This seems to
be reasonable, since the hyperon in the hypertriton is less bound than the
nucleon in the initial 3He nucleus. The effect of the missing resonance
D_{13}(1895) is more profound in the longitudinal cross sections. Excluding
this resonance reduces the longitudinal cross sections by one order of
magnitude, but does not change the effects of various off-shell assumptions on
the cross sections.
