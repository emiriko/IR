The Null Melvin Twist to D4 brane background has been studied and putting in
a bunch of coincident D8 and anti-D8 branes {\it a la} Sakai-Sugimoto model
results in a breakdown of a global symmetry to its diagonal subgroup. The same
is studied at finite temperature which results in the unchanged form of the
chiral symmetry breaking and restoration curve. The effect of turning on a
finite chemical potential do not changes the structure of the phase diagram
with respect to Null Melvin Twist. Moreover, the confining and de-confining
phase transition has the same structure as in the absence of Null Melvin Twist.
