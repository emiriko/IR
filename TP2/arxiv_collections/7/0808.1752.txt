We explore the coherent transfer of electronic signatures from a strongly
correlated, optically gated nanoscale quantum dot to a weakly interacting,
electrically backgated microscale channel. In this unique side-coupled `T'
geometry for transport, we predict a novel mechanism for detecting Rabi
oscillations induced in the dot through quantum, rather than electrostatic
means. This detection shows up as a field-tunable split in the Fano lineshape
arising due to interference between the dipole coupled dot states and the
channel continuum. The split is further modified by the Coulomb interactions
within the dot that influence the detuning of the Rabi oscillations.
Furthermore, time-resolving the signal we see clear beats when the Rabi
frequencies approach the intrinsic Bohr frequencies in the dot. Capturing these
coupled dynamics, including memory effects and quantum interference in the
channel and the many-body effects in the dot requires coupling a Fock-space
master equation for the dot dynamics with the phase-coherent, non-Markovian
time-dependent non-equilibrium Green's function (TDNEGF) transport formalism in
the channel through a properly evaluated self-energy and a Coulomb integral.
The strength of the interactions can further be modulated using a backgate that
controls the degree of hybridization and charge polarization at the transistor
surface.
