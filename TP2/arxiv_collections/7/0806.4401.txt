The recent proof of the Boij-Soederberg conjectures reveals new structure
about Betti diagrams of modules, giving a complete description of the cone of
Betti diagrams. We begin to expand on this new structure by investigating the
semigroup of Betti diagrams. We prove that this semigroup is finitely
generated, and we answer several other fundamental questions about this
semigroup.
