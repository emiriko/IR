Semi-realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions applicable to the self-consistent
mean-field (both Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov) calculations are
developed, by modifying the M3Y interaction. The modification is made so as to
reproduce binding energies and rms matter radii of doubly magic nuclei,
single-particle levels in $^{208}$Pb, and even-odd mass differences of the Sn
isotopes. We find parameter-sets with and without the tensor force. The new
interactions are further checked by the saturation properties of the uniform
nuclear matter including the Landau-Migdal parameters. By the mean-field
calculations, interaction-dependence of the neutron drip line is investigated
for the O, Ca and Ni isotopes, and of the single-particle energies for the
N=16, 32, 50, 82 and Z=50 nuclei. Results of the semi-realistic interactions
including the tensor force are in fair agreement with available experimental
data for all of these properties.
