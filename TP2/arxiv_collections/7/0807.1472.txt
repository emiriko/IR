The ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) consists of a central
barrel, a muon spectrometer, zero degree calorimeters and additional detectors
which are used for trigger purposes and for event classification. The main
detector systems of relevance for measuring diffractive and electromagnetic
processes are described. The trigger strategy for such measurements is
outlined. The physics potential of studying diffractive and electromagnetic
processes at the LHC is presented by discussing possible signatures of the
Odderon.
