A method to hide certain quantum states in a superposition will be proposed.
Such method can be used to increase the security of a communication channel.
States represent an encrypted message will disappear during data exchange. This
makes the message 100% safe under direct measurement by an eavesdropper. No
entanglement sharing is required among the communicating parties.
