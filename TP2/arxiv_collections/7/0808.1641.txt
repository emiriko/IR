Global dynamics of a non-linear Cellular Automata is, in general irregular,
asymmetric and unpredictable as opposed to that of a linear CA, which is highly
systematic and tractable. In the past efforts have been made to systematize
non-linear CA evolutions in the light of Boolean derivatives and Jacobian
Matrices. In this paper two different efforts have been made: first we try to
systematize non-linear CA evolution in the light of deviant states and
non-deviant states. For all the non-deviant states the nearest linear rule
matrix is applicable where as for the deviant states we have a set of other
matrices. Second using algebraic manipulation, an efficient algorithm is
proposed by which every Non-linear Boolean function can be characterized by a
sequence of binary matrices.
