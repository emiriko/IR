The electronic structure of pulsed laser deposited Mo1-xFexO2 (x=0, 0.02 and
0.05) thin films has been investigated using resonant photoemission
spectroscopy near Mo-4p absorption edge. In all the samples a broad Fano- like
resonance peak at ~46 eV is observed in the whole area of the valence band
which indicates the contribution of the Mo-4d states in the entire valence band
region. The doping of Fe in these films leads to decrease in Mo 4d states
contributing to electronic states at lower binding energy region. In addition
to this, we also observe a shoulder at 4.9 eV in the valence band spectra of
doped samples. It is proposed that the origin of this shoulder is due to the Fe
hybridised states.
