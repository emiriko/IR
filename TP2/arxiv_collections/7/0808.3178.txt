We apply the influence-functional method of Feynman and Vernon to the study
of a single-mode optical field that interacts with an environment at zero
temperature. Using the coherent-state formalism of the path integral, we derive
a generalized master equation for the single-mode optical field. Our analysis
explicitly shows how non-Markovian effects manifest in the exact decoherence
dynamics for different environmental correlation time scales. Remarkably, when
these are equal to or greater than the time scale for significant change in the
system, the interplay between the backaction-induced coherent oscillation and
the dissipative effect of the environment causes the non-Markovian effect to
have a significant impact not only on the short-time behavior but also on the
long-time steady-state behavior of the system.
