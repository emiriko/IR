A twisted covariant formulation of noncommutative self-dual gravity is
presented. The formulation for constructing twisted noncommutative Yang-Mills
theories is used. It is shown that the noncommutative torsion is solved at any
order of the $\theta$-expansion in terms of the tetrad and some extra fields of
the theory. In the process the first order expansion in $\theta$ for the
Pleba\'nski action is explicitly obtained.
