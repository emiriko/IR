By using the method of density-matrix renormalization-group to solve the
different spin-spin correlation functions, the nearest-neighbouring
entanglement(NNE) and next-nearest-neighbouring entanglement(NNNE) of
one-dimensional alternating Heisenberg XY spin chain is investigated in the
presence of alternating nearest neighbour interactions of exchange couplings,
external magnetic fields and next-nearest neighbouring interactions. For
dimerized ferromagnetic spin chain, NNNE appears only above the critical
dimerized interaction, meanwhile, the dimerized interaction effects quantum
phase transition point and improves NNNE to a large value. We also study the
effect of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighboring (NNN)
interactions on the dynamics of NNE and NNNE. The ferromagnetic NNN interaction
increases and shrinks NNE below and above critical frustrated interaction
respectively, while the antiferromagnetic NNN interaction always decreases NNE.
The antiferromagnetic NNN interaction results to a larger value of NNNE in
comparison to the case when the NNN interaction is ferromagnetic.
