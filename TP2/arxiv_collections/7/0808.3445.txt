We demonstrate that speedmeter, based on double pumped resonant Sagnac
interferometer, can be used as a displacement noise free gravitational-wave
(GW) detector. The displacement noise of cavity mirrors can be completely
excluded through a proper linear combination of the output signals. We show
that in low-frequency region the obtained displacement-noise-free response
signal is stronger than the one in previously proposed displacement noise free
interferometers.
