We investigate the photoproduction of Lambda(1405,1/2^-) = Lambda* off the
proton target using the effective Lagrangian in the Born approximation. We
observed that, depending on the choice of the K* N Lambda* coupling strength,
the total cross section becomes 0.1 <~ sigma_Lambda* <~ 0.2 mu b near the
threshold and starts to decrease beyond E_gamma ~ 1.6 GeV, and the angular
dependence shows a mild enhancement in the forward direction. It turns out that
the energy dependence of the total cross section is similar to that shown in
the recent LEPS experiment. This suggests that the production mechanism of the
Lambda* is dominated by the s-channel contribution.
