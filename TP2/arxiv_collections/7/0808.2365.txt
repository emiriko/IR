We investigate black-body induced energy shifts for low-lying levels of
atomic systems, with a special emphasis on transitions used in current and
planned high-precision experiments on atomic hydrogen and ionized helium.
Fine-structure and Lamb-shift induced black-body shifts are found to increase
with the square of the nuclear charge number, whereas black-body shifts due to
virtual transitions decrease with increasing nuclear charge as the fourth power
of the nuclear charge. We also investigate the decay width acquired by the
ground state of atomic hydrogen, due to interaction with black-body photons.
The corresponding width is due to an instability against excitation to higher
excited atomic levels, and due to black-body induced ionization. These effects
limit the lifetime of even the most fundamental, a priori absolutely stable,
"asymptotic" state of atomic theory, namely the ground state of atomic
hydrogen.
