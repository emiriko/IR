Several states were proposed as candidates for the $\nu=5/2$ quantum Hall
plateau. We suggest an experiment which can determine the physical state. The
proposal involves transport measurements in the geometry with three quantum
Hall edges connected by two quantum point contacts. In contrast to interference
experiments, this approach can distinguish the Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian
states as well as different states with identical Pfaffian or anti-Pfaffian
statistics. The transport is not sensitive to the fluctuations of the number of
the quasiparticles trapped in the system.
