We study the reduced dynamics of interacting spins, each coupled to its own
bath of bosons. We derive the solution in analytic form in the white-noise
limit and analyze the rich behaviors in diverse limits ranging from weak
coupling and/or low temperature to strong coupling and/or high temperature. We
also view the one spin as being coupled to a spin-boson environment and
consider the regimes in which it is effectively nonlinear, and in which it can
be regarded as a resonant bosonic environment.
