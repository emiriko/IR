The iron oxyarsenide TbFeAsO0.85 was synthesized by a high-pressure method. A
high-quality polycrystalline sample was obtained and characterized by
measurements of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity. Bulk
superconductivity with Tc of 42 K was clearly established without an F doping
usually conducted to tune on superconductivity in the iron oxypnictide.
