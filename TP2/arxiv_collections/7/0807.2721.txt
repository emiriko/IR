Using the non-relativisitc reduction of Coulomb gauge QCD we compute spectrum
of the low mass hybrid mesons containing a heavy quark-antiquark pair. The
gluon degrees of freedom are treated in the mean field approximation calibrated
to the gluelump spectrum. We discuss the role of the non-abelian nature of the
QCD Coulomb interaction in the ordering of the spin-parity levels.
