A characterisation of scintillating fibres with silicon photomultiplier
read-out was performed in view of their possible application in fibre tracking
detector systems. Such a concept is being considered for the Kaos spectrometer
at the Mainz Microtron MAMI and as a time-of-flight start detector for the
hypernuclear physics programme at the PANDA experiment of the FAIR project.
Results on particle detection effciency and time resolution are discussed. In
summary, the silicon devices are very suitable for the detection of the low
light yield from scintillating fibres insofar a trigger scheme is found to cope
with the noise rate characteristics.
