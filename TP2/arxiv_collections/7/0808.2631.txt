The eventual production of mini black holes by proton-proton collisions at
the LHC is predicted by theories with large extra dimensions resolvable at the
Tev scale of energies. It is expected that these black holes evaporate shortly
after its production as a consequence of the Hawking radiation. We show that
for theories based on the ADS/CFT correspondence, the produced black holes may
have an unstable horizon, which grows proportionally to the square of the
distance to the collision point.
