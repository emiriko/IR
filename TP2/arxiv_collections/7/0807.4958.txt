In this paper, we provide a solution to two problems which have been open in
default time modeling in credit risk. We first show that if $\tau$ is an
arbitrary random (default) time such that its Az\'ema's supermartingale
$Z_t^\tau=\P(\tau>t|\F_t)$ is continuous, then $\tau$ avoids stopping times. We
then disprove a conjecture about the equality between the hazard process and
the martingale hazard process, which first appeared in \cite{jenbrutk1}, and we
show how it should be modified to become a theorem. The pseudo-stopping times,
introduced in \cite{AshkanYor}, appear as the most general class of random
times for which these two processes are equal. We also show that these two
processes always differ when $\tau$ is an honest time.
