In this essay, I attempt to provide supporting evidence as well as some
balance for the thesis on `Transforming socio-economics with a new
epistemology' presented by Hollingworth and Mueller (2008). First, I review a
personal highlight of my own scientific path that illustrates the power of
interdisciplinarity as well as unity of the mathematical description of natural
and social processes. I also argue against the claim that complex systems are
in general `not susceptible to mathematical analysis, but must be understood by
letting them evolve over time or with simulation analysis'. Moreover, I present
evidence of the limits of the claim that scientists working within Science II
do not make predictions about the future because it is too complex. I stress
the potentials for a third `Quantum Science' and its associated conceptual and
philosophical revolutions, and finally point out some limits of the `new'
theory of networks.
