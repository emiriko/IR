We propose a model for aggregation where particles are continuously growing
by heterogeneous condensation in one dimension and solve it exactly. We show
that the particle size spectra exhibit transition to dynamic scaling
$c(x,t)\sim t^{-\beta}\phi(x/t^z)$. The exponents $\beta$ and $z$ satisfy a
generalized scaling relation $\beta=(1+q)z$ where the value of $q$ is fixed by
a non-trivial conservation law. We have shown that the value of $(1+q)$ is
always less than the value 2 of aggregation without condensation.
