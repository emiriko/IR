Symbolic dynamics, which partitions an infinite number of finite-length
trajectories into a finite number of trajectory sets, describes the dynamics of
a system in a simplified and coarse-grained way with a limited number of
symbols. The study of symbolic dynamics in 1D chaotic map has been further
developed and is named as the applied symbolic dynamics. In this paper, we will
study the applied symbolic vector dynamics of CML. Based on the original
contribution proposed in Refs.[6], we will study the ergodic property of CML.
We will analyze the relation between admissibility condition and control
parameters, and then give a coupling coefficient estimation method based on the
ergodic property. Both theoretical and experimental results show that we
provide a natural analytical technique for understanding turbulences in CML.
Many of our findings could be expanded to a wider range of application.
