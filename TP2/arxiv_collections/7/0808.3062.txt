In the present work we study dynamical space-time symmetries in
noncommutative relativistic theories by using the minimal canonical extension
of the Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts algebra. Our formalism is constructed
in an extended space-time with independent degrees of freedom associated with
the object of noncommutativity $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. In this framework we consider
theories that are invariant under the Poincar\'{e} group ${\cal P}$ or under
its extension ${\cal P}'$, when translations in the extra dimensions are
permitted. The Noether's formalism adapted to such extended $x+\theta$
space-time is employed.
