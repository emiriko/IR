We present an innovative method of selective epitaxial growth of few layers
graphene (FLG) on a pre-patterned SiC substrate. The methods involves,
successively, the sputtering of a thin AlN layer on top of a mono-crystalline
SiC substrate and, then, patterning it with e-beam lithography (EBL) and wet
etching. The sublimation of few atomic layers of Si from the SiC substrate
occurs only through the selectively etched AlN layer. The presence of the Raman
G-band at ~1582 cm-1 in the AlN-free areas is used to validate the concept, it
gives absolute evidence of the selective FLG growth.
