Let $G$ be a group acting on a category $\mathcal{C}$. We give a definition
for a functor $F\colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}'$ to be a $G$-covering and
three constructions of the orbit category $\mathcal{C}/G$, which generalizes
the notion of a Galois covering of locally finite-dimensional categories with
group $G$ whose action on $\mathcal{C}$ is free and locally bonded defined by
Gabriel. Here $\mathcal{C}/G$ is defined for any category $\mathcal{C}$ and we
do not require that the action of $G$ is free or locally bounded. We show that
a $G$-covering is a universal "$G$-invariant" functor and is essentially given
by the canonical functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}/G$. By using this we
improve a covering technique for derived equivalence. Also we prove theorems
describing the relationships between smash product construction and the orbit
category construction by Cibils and Marcos (2006) without the assumption that
the $G$-action is free. The orbit category construction by a cyclic group
generated by an auto-equivalence modulo natural isomorphisms (e.g., the
construction of cluster categories) is justified by a notion of the "colimit
orbit category". In addition, we give a presentation of the orbit category of a
category with a monoid action by a quiver with relations, which enables us to
calculate many examples.
