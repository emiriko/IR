Nadel's Paradox states that it is not possible to take into account
simultaneously cultural and relational dimensions of social structure. By means
of a simple computational model, the authors explore a dynamic perspective of
the concept of social cohesion that enables the integration of both structural
and cultural dimensions in the same analysis. The design of the model
reproduces a causal path from the level of conflict suffered by a population to
variations on its social cohesiveness, observed both from a structural and
cognitive viewpoint. Submitted to sudden variations on its environmental
conflict level, the model is able to reproduce certain characteristics
previously observed in real populations under situations of emergency or
crisis.
