The cavity method is a well established technique for solving classical spin
models on sparse random graphs (mean-field models with finite connectivity).
Laumann et al. [arXiv:0706.4391] proposed recently an extension of this method
to quantum spin-1/2 models in a transverse field, using a discretized
Suzuki-Trotter imaginary time formalism. Here we show how to take analytically
the continuous imaginary time limit. Our main technical contribution is an
explicit procedure to generate the spin trajectories in a path integral
representation of the imaginary time dynamics. As a side result we also show
how this procedure can be used in simple heat-bath like Monte Carlo simulations
of generic quantum spin models. The replica symmetric continuous time quantum
cavity method is formulated for a wide class of models, and applied as a simple
example on the Bethe lattice ferromagnet in a transverse field. The results of
the methods are confronted with various approximation schemes in this
particular case. On this system we performed quantum Monte Carlo simulations
that confirm the exactness of the cavity method in the thermodynamic limit.
