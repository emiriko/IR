Patterned graphene shows substantial potential for applications in future
molecular-scale integrated electronics. Environmental effects are a critical
issue in a single layer material where every atom is on the surface. Especially
intriguing is the variety of rich chemical interactions shown by molecular
oxygen with aromatic molecules. We find that O2 etching kinetics vary strongly
with the number of graphene layers in the sample. Three-layer-thick samples
show etching similar to bulk natural graphite. Single-layer graphene reacts
faster and shows random etch pits in contrast to natural graphite where
nucleation occurs at point defects. In addition, basal plane oxygen species
strongly hole dope graphene, with a Fermi level shift of ~0.5 eV. These oxygen
species partially desorb in an Ar gas flow, or under irradiation by far UV
light, and readsorb again in an O2 atmosphere at room temperature. This
strongly doped graphene is very different than graphene oxide made by mineral
acid attack.
