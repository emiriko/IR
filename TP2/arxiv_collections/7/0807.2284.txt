Polarized Raman spectra of non-superconducting SrFe$_2$As$_2$ and
superconducting K$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($T_c = 37$ K) are reported.
All four phonon modes (A$_{1g}$ + B$_{1g}$ + 2E$_g$) allowed by symmetry, are
found and identified. Shell model gives reasonable description of the spectra.
No detectable anomalies are observed near the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic
transition in SrFe$_2$As$_2$ or the superconducting transition in
K$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$.
