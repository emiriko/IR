Combining GGA-plane wave approach as implemented into the VASP - 4.6.19
computer code with a slab model, we studied in detail the atomic and electronic
structure of the LaMnO3 surfaces, in both cubic and orthorhombic phases. The
results obtained are compared with similar studies for other ABO3-perovskites.
