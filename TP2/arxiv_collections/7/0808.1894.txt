A possible formation of bound state is predicted in the Standard Model
extension with with additional scalar singlet. A suitable method of solution of
the Bethe-Salpeter equation for a Higgsonium bound state is proposed. With the
help of an integral representation the results are directly obtained in
Minkowski space. The appearance of Higgsonia is shown to be quite natural for
considered extension of Standard model and the calculations are presented for
the bound state composed from two scalars which result from the large mixture
of electroweak doublet and singlet eigenstate.
