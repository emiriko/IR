Multi-TeV e+e- collisions provide with a large enough sample of Higgs bosons
to enable measurements of its suppressed decays. Results of a detailed study of
the determination of the muon Yukawa coupling at 3 TeV, based on full detector
simulation and event reconstruction, are presented. The muon Yukawa coupling
can be determined with a relative accuracy of 0.04 to 0.08 for Higgs bosons
masses from 120 GeV to 150 GeV, with an integrated luminosity of 5 inverse-ab.
The result is not affected by overlapping two-photon background.
