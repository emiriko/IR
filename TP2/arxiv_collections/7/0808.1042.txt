Regge calculus minisuperspace action in the connection representation has the
form in which each term is linear over some field variable (scale of area-type
variable with sign). We are interested in the result of performing integration
over connections in the path integral. To find this function, we compute its
moments, i. e. integrals with powers of that variable. Calculation proceeds
through intermediate appearance of $\delta$-functions and integrating them out
and leads to finite result for any power. The function of interest should
therefore be exponentially suppressed at large areas and it really does being
restored from moments. This gives for gravity a way of defining such
nonabsolutely convergent integral as path integral.
