ABO3 perovskite multiferroic La0.5Bi0.5Mn0.5Fe0.5O3.09 where the B-site
cations is responsible for the magnetic properties and the A-site cation with
lone pair electron is responsible for the ferroelectric properties was
synthesized at normal conditions. This oxide exhibits a ferromagnetic
transition around 240 K with a well defined hysteresis loop, and a significant
reversible remnant polarization below 67K similar to ferroelectric behavior.
The magnetic interaction is interpreted by the ferromagnetic Fe3+-O-Mn3+ and
antiferromagnetic Fe3+(Mn3+)-O-Fe3+(Mn3+) interactions competed each other,
whereas the ferroelectricity is predominantly due to the polar nature
introduced by the 6s2 lone pair of Bi3+ cations
