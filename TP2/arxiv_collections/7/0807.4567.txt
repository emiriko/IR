We report an updated amplitude analysis of the charmless hadronic decays of
neutral B mesons to K+pi-pi0. With a sample of 454 million Upsilon(4S) ->
B0B0bar decays collected by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy
B Factory at SLAC, we measure the magnitudes and phases of the intermediate
resonant and nonresonant amplitudes for B0 and B0bar decays and determine the
corresponding CP-averaged fit fractions and charge asymmetries.
