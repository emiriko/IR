The nature of spin-density wave and its relation with superconductivity are
crucial issues in the newly discovered Fe-based high temperature
superconductors. Particularly it is unclear whether the superconducting phase
and spin density wave (SDW) are truly exclusive from each other as suggested by
certain experiments. With angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we here
report exchange splittings of the band structures in Sr1-xKxFe2As2
(x=0,0.1,0.2), and the non-rigid-band behaviors of the splitting. Our data on
single crystalline superconducting samples unambiguously prove that SDW and
superconductivity could coexist in iron-pnictides.
