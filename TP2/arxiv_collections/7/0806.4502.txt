Benzene is a hexagonal molecule of six carbon atoms, each of which is bound
to six hydrogen atoms. The equality of all six CC bond lengths, despite the
alternating double and single bonds, and the surplus (resonance) energy, led to
the suggestion of two resonanting structures. Here, the new atomic structure
shows that the bond length equality is due to three carbon atoms with double
bond radii bound to three other carbon atoms with resonance bond radii (as in
graphene). Consequently, there are two kinds of CH bonds of slightly different
lengths. The bond energies account for the resonance energy.
