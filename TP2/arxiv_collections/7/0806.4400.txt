The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in La[O1-xFx]FeAs at the
beginning of this year [1] has generated much excitement and has led to the
rapid discovery of similar compounds with as high as 55 K transition
temperatures [2]. The high superconducting transition temperatures are
seemingly incompatible with the electron-phonon driven pairing of conventional
superconductors, resulting in wide speculation as to the mechanism and nature
of the superconductivity in these materials. Here we report results of the
first scanning tunneling microscopy study of the 32 K superconductor
(Sr1-xKx)Fe2As2. We find two distinct topographic regions on the sample, one
with no apparent atomic corrugation, and another marked by a stripe-like
modulation at double the atomic periodicity. In the latter the stripes appear
to modulate the local density of states, occasionally revealing a Delta = 10 mV
gap with a shape consistent with unconventional (non-s wave) superconductivity.
