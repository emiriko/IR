Positive signs of the effective g-factors for free electrons in the
conduction band and electrons localized on deep paramagnetic centers have been
measured in nitrogen dilute alloy GaAs{0.979}N{0.021} at room temperature. The
g-factor signs have been determined from an asymmetry in the depolarization of
edge photoluminescence in a transverse magnetic field (Hanle effect) at the
oblique incidence of the exciting radiation and oblique-angle detection of the
luminescence. The tilted spin polarization of free electrons is induced under
interband absorption of circularly polarized light, and the paramagnetic
centers acquire spin polarization because of spin-dependent capture of free
spin-polarized electrons by these centers. The measured Hanle curve is a
superposition of two lines, narrow and broad, with the widths ~400 G and ~50000
G, arising due to the depolarization of localized and free electrons,
respectively. The magnitude and direction of the asymmetry in the measured
Hanle curve have been found to depend on the partial contributions to the
photoluminecsence from the heavy- and light-hole subbands split by a uniaxial
deformation of the GaAs{1-x}N{x} film grown on a GaAs substrate. We have
extended the theory of optical orientation in order to calculate the excitation
spectrum of the photoelectron tilted-spin polarization and the
circularly-polarized luminescence spectrum taking into account that, in the
strained samples under study, the light-hole subband lies above the heavy-hole
one. The results have further been used to calculate the shape of Hanle curve
as a function of the excitation and registration energies as well as the
incidence and detection angles and to compare the theory with experiment.
