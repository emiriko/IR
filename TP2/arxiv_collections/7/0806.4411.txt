In many extensions of the standard model, the Higgs sector often contains an
additional pseudoscalar boson. A good example is the SU(3) simplest little
Higgs model, which accommodates a light pseudoscalar boson $\eta$ with quite
different characteristics from those in other multi-Higgs-doublet models. We
study various phenomenological signatures of the $\eta$ at the LHC. In
particular, we calculate in details both production and decays in the Drell-Yan
type channel $q \bar{q} \to Z/Z' \to h \eta$, and in the associated production
with a $t\bar t$ pair, $gg (q\bar q) \to t \bar t \eta$. We emphasize the
$\tau^+ \tau^-$ decay mode of the $\eta$ boson when its mass is below the
$b\bar b$ threshold. We show that $t\bar t \eta$ production is in fact large
enough to give a sizable number of events while suppressing the backgrounds. We
also comment on the direct gluon fusion process and the indirect decay from the
heavy $T$ quark ($T \to t \eta$)
