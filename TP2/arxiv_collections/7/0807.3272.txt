Ultracold LiCs molecules in the absolute ground state X$^1\Sigma^+$, v"=0,
J"=0 are formed via a single photo-association step starting from laser-cooled
atoms. The selective production of v"=0, J"=2 molecules with a 50-fold higher
rate is also demonstrated. The rotational and vibrational state of the ground
state molecules is determined in a setup combining depletion spectroscopy with
resonant-enhanced multi-photon ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy. Using
the determined production rate of up to 5x10^3 molecules/s, we describe a
simple scheme which can provide large samples of externally and internally cold
dipolar molecules.
