We find that the spin susceptibility of a two-dimensional electron system
with valley degeneracy does not grow critically at low densities, at variance
with experimental results [A. Shashkin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 036403
(2006)]. We ascribe this apparent discrepancy to the weak disorder present in
experimental samples. Our prediction is obtained from accurate correlation
energies computed with state of-the-art diffusion Monte Carlo simulations and
fitted with an analytical expression which also provides a local spin density
functional for the system under investigation.
