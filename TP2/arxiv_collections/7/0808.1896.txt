Our recent quasi-two-dimensional thermodynamic description of thin-liquid
films stabilized by colloidal particles is generalized to describe nonuniform
equilibrium states of films in external potentials and nonequilibrium transport
processes produced in the film by gradients of thermodynamic forces. Using a
Monte--Carlo simulation method, we have determined equilibrium equations of
state for a film stabilized by a suspension of hard spheres. Employing a
multipolar-expansion method combined with a flow-reflection technique, we have
also evaluated the short-time film-viscosity coefficients and collective
particle mobility.
