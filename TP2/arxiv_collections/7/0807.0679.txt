We investigate the spacetime of a slowly rotating black hole in the
Chern-Simons modified gravity. The long range feature of frame-dragging effect
under the Chern-Simon gravity well explains the flat rotation curves of
galaxies which is a central evidence of dark matter. Our solution provides a
different scenario of rotating space from Goedel's solution.
