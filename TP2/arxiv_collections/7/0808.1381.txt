We investigated excitation spectra of the one-dimensional chain compound
Sr$_{2}$CuO$_{3}$. The small peak at 2.3 eV in the loss function was turned to
correspond to the strong charge transfer transition at 1.8 eV in conductivity.
It has the excitonic character expected in one dimensional extended Hubbard
model of the transition from the lower Hubberd band to the Zhang-Rice singlet
state. The strongest peak at 2.7 eV in the loss function is attributed to the
continuum excitation of the excitonic charge transfer transition. The spectral
weight sum rule is satisfied within these transitions.
