This paper presents a new line element based on the assumption of the
variable rest mass in gravitational field, and explores some its implications.
This line element is not a vacuum solution of Einstein's equations, yet it is
sufficiently close to Schwarzschild's line element to be compatible with all of
the experimental and observational measurements made so far to confirm the
three Einstein's predictions. The theory allows radiation and fast particles to
escape from all massive bodies, even from those that in Einstein's general
relativity framework will be black holes. The striking feature of this line
element is the non-existence of black holes.
