We consider a supersymmetric completion of codimension-two branes with
nonzero tension in a 6D gauged supergravity. As a consequence, we obtain the
football solution with 4D Minkowski space as a new supersymmetric background
that preserves 4D N=1 SUSY. In the presence of brane multiplets, we derive the
4D effective supergravity action for the football background and show that the
remaining modulus can be stabilized by a bulk non-perturbative correction with
brane uplifting potentials at a zero vacuum energy. We find that the U(1)_R
mediation can be a dominant source of SUSY breaking for a brane scalar with
nonzero R charge.
