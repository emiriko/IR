We show that on-shell recursion relations hold for tree amplitudes in generic
two derivative theories of multiple particle species and diverse spins. For
example, in a gauge theory coupled to scalars and fermions, any amplitude with
at least one gluon obeys a recursion relation. In (super)gravity coupled to
scalars and fermions, the same holds for any amplitude with at least one
graviton. This result pertains to a broad class of theories, including QCD, N=4
SYM, and N=8 supergravity.
