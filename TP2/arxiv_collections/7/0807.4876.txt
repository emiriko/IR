The recent observation of superconductivity with critical temperatures up to
55 K in the FeAs based pnictide compounds marks the first discovery of a non
copper-oxide based layered high-Tc superconductor (HTSC) [1-3]. It has raised
the suspicion that these new materials share a similar pairing mechanism to the
cuprates, since both exhibit superconductivity following charge doping of a
magnetic parent material. Here we present a muon spin rotation study on
SmFeAsO1-xFx (x=0-0.30), which shows that static magnetism persists well into
the superconducting regime. The analogy with the cuprates is quite surprising
since the parent compounds appear to have different magnetic ground states:
itinerant spin density wave for the pnictides contrasted with the Mott-Hubbard
insulator in the cuprates. Our findings suggest that proximity to magnetic
order and associated soft magnetic fluctuations, rather than the strong
electronic correlations in the vicinity of a Mott-Hubbard-metal-to-insulator
transition, may be the key ingredients of HTSC.
