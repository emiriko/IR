Could John Kerry have gained votes in the 2004 Presidential election by more
clearly distinguishing himself from George Bush on economic policy? At first
thought, the logic of political preferences would suggest not: the Republicans
are to the right of most Americans on economic policy, and so in a
one-dimensional space with party positions measured with no error, the optimal
strategy for the Democrats would be to stand infinitesimally to the left of the
Republicans. The median voter theorem suggests that each party should keep its
policy positions just barely distinguishable from the opposition. In a
multidimensional setting, however, or when voters vary in their perceptions of
the parties' positions, a party can benefit from putting some daylight between
itself and the other party on an issue where it has a public-opinion advantage
(such as economic policy for the Democrats). We set up a plausible theoretical
model in which the Democrats could achieve a net gain in votes by moving to the
left on economic policy, given the parties' positions on a range of issue
dimensions. We then evaluate this model based on survey data on voters'
perceptions of their own positions and those of the candidates in 2004. Under
our model, it turns out to be optimal for the Democrats to move slightly to the
right but staying clearly to the left of the Republicans' current position on
economic issues.
