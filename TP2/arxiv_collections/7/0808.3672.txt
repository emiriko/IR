Different methods for the calculation of cross sections with many QCD
particles are compared. To this end, CSW vertex rules, Berends-Giele recursion
and Feynman-diagram based techniques are implemented as well as various methods
for the treatment of colours and phase space integration. We find that
typically there is only a small window of jet multiplicities, where the CSW
technique has efficiencies comparable or better than both of the other two
methods.
