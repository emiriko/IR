Diffraction measurements performed via transmission electron microscopy and
high resolution X-ray scattering reveal two distinct charge density wave
transitions in Gd$_2$Te$_5$ at $T_{c1}$ = 410(3) and $T_{c2}$ = 532(3) K,
associated with the \textit{on}-axis incommensurate lattice modulation and
\textit{off}-axis commensurate lattice modulation respectively. Analysis of the
temperature dependence of the order parameters indicates a non-vanishing
coupling between these two distinct CDW states.
