We construct a Kruskal-Szekeres-type analytic extension of the Emparan-Reall
black ring, and investigate its geometry. We prove that the extension is
maximal, globally hyperbolic, and unique within a natural class of extensions.
The key to those results is the proof that causal geodesics are either
complete, or approach a singular boundary in finite affine time. Alternative
maximal analytic extensions are also constructed.
