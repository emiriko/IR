The sequence-dependent structural variability and conformational dynamics of
DNA play pivotal roles in many biological milieus, such as in the site-specific
binding of transcription factors to target regulatory elements. To better
understand DNA structure, function, and dynamics in general, and protein-DNA
recognition in the 'kB' family of genetic regulatory elements in particular, we
performed molecular dynamics simulations of a 20-base pair DNA encompassing a
cognate kB site recognized by the proto-oncogenic 'c-Rel' subfamily of NF-kB
transcription factors. Simulations of the kB DNA in explicit water were
extended to microsecond duration, providing a broad, atomically-detailed
glimpse into the structural and dynamical behavior of double helical DNA over
many timescales. Of particular note, novel (and structurally plausible)
conformations of DNA developed only at the long times sampled in this
simulation -- including a peculiar state arising at ~ 0.7 us and characterized
by cross-strand intercalative stacking of nucleotides within a
longitudinally-sheared base pair, followed (at ~ 1 us) by spontaneous base
flipping of a neighboring thymine within the A-rich duplex. Results and
predictions from the us-scale simulation include implications for a dynamical
NF-kB recognition motif, and are amenable to testing and further exploration
via specific experimental approaches that are suggested herein.
