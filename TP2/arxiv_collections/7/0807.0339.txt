The Slodowy slice is an especially nice slice to a given nilpotent conjugacy
class in a semisimple Lie algebra. Premet introduced noncommutative
quantizaions of the Poisson algebra of polynomial functions on the Slodowy
slice.
  In this paper, we define and study Harish-Chandra bimodules over Premet's
algebras. We apply the technique of Harish-Chandra bimodules to prove a
conjecture of Premet concerning primitive ideals, and to construct
`noncommutative resolutions' of Slodowy slices via translation functors.
