Photoemission spectroscopy with low-energy tunable photons on
oxygen-deficient iron-based oxypnictide superconductors NdFeAsO0.85 (Tc=52K)
reveals a distinct photon-energy dependence of the electronic structure near
the Fermi level (EF). A clear shift of the leading-edge can be observed in the
superconducting states with 9.5 eV photons, while a clear Fermi cutoff with
little leading-edge shift can be observed with 6.0 eV photons. The results are
indicative of the superconducting gap opening not on the hole-like ones around
Gamma (0,0) point but on the electron-like sheets around M(pi,pi) point.
