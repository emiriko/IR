The cosmological scale factor $a(t)$ of the flat-space Robertson-Walker
geometry is examined from a Hamiltonian perspective wherein $a(t)$ is
interpreted as an independent dynamical coordinate and the curvature density
$\sqrt {- g(a)} R({a,\dot a,\ddot a})$ is regarded as an action density in
Minkowski spacetime. The resulting Hamiltonian for $a(t)$ is just the first
Friedmann equation of the traditional approach (i.e. the Robertson-Walker
cosmology of General Relativity), as might be expected. The utility of this
approach however stems from the fact that each of the terms matter, radiation,
and vacuum, and including the kinetic / gravitational field term, are formally
energy densities, and the equation as a whole becomes a formal statement of
energy conservation. An advantage of this approach is that it facilitates an
intuitive understanding of energy balance and exchange on the cosmological
scale that is otherwise absent in the traditional presentation. Each coordinate
system has its own internally consistent explanation for how energy balance is
achieved. For example, in the spacetime with line element $ds^2 = dt^2 - a^2(t)
d{\bf{x}}^2$, cosmological red-shift emerges as due to a post-recombination
interaction between the scalar field $a(t)$ and the EM fields in which the
latter loose energy as if propagating through a homogeneous lossy medium, with
the energy lost to the scale factor helping drive the cosmological expansion.
