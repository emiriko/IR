We present a very simple electronic implementation of the tent map, one of
the best-known discrete dynamical systems. This is achieved by using integrated
circuits and passive elements only. The experimental behavior of the tent map
electronic circuit is compared with its numerical simulation counterpart. We
find that the electronic circuit presents fixed points, periodicity, period
doubling, chaos and intermittency that match with high accuracy the
corresponding theoretical values
