The role of quadratic onsite pinning potentials on determining the size (N)
dependence of the disorder averaged steady state heat current <J>, in a
isotopically disordered harmonic chain connected to stochastic heat baths, is
investigated. For two models of heat baths, namely white noise baths and
Rubin's model of baths, we find that the N dependence of <J> is the same and
depends on the number of pinning centers present in the chain. In the absence
of pinning, <J> ~ 1/N^{1/2} while in presence of one or two pins <J> ~
1/N^{3/2}. For a finite (n) number of pinning centers with 2 <= n << N, we
provide heuristic arguments and numerical evidence to show that <J> ~
1/N^{n-1/2}. We discuss the relevance of our results in the context of recent
experiments.
