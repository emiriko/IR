Taking into account the characteristics of a free scalar field in elliptic
coordinates, a new dynamical variable is found for the free electromagnetic
field. The conservation law associated to this variable cannot be obtained by
direct application of standard Noether theorem since the symmetry generator is
of second order. Consequences on the expected mechanical behavior of an atomic
system interacting with electromagnetic waves exhibiting such a symmetry are
also discussed.
