We present a quantitative analysis of the reversibility properties of
classically chaotic quantum motion. We analyze the connection between
reversibility and the rate at which a quantum state acquires a more and more
complicated structure in its time evolution. This complexity is characterized
by the number ${\cal M}(t)$ of harmonics of the (initially isotropic, i.e.
${\cal M}(0)=0$) Wigner function, which are generated during quantum evolution
for the time $t$. We show that, in contrast to the classical exponential
increase, this number can grow not faster than linearly and then relate this
fact with the degree of reversibility of the quantum motion. To explore the
reversibility we reverse the quantum evolution at some moment $T$ immediately
after applying at this moment an instant perturbation governed by a strength
parameter $\xi$. It follows that there exists a critical perturbation strength,
$\xi_c\approx \sqrt{2}/{\cal M}(T)$, below which the initial state is well
recovered, whereas reversibility disappears when $\xi\gtrsim \xi_c(T)$. In the
classical limit the number of harmonics proliferates exponentially with time
and the motion becomes practically irreversible. The above results are
illustrated in the example of the kicked quartic oscillator model.
