In this work, we present a study like a "stellar dynamics" model of an
infinite Universe, in which the matter distribution follow a relationship
inversely proportional to the square power with respect to the distance from
the center of rotation of cluster and supercluster of galaxies (that have a
common centre of rotation). In this study, we considered that the Universe have
infinite centers similar in structure and in dynamic equilibrium between them.
The stars in the galaxies are supposed to be homogeneously distributed with a
spherical symmetry and with an average radius and, in turn, the galaxies in the
Universe. Also, we consider a smoothed potential of this kind of universe and
study the effect of gravity in the radiation of the stars: applying the
equivalence principle we obtain a mathematical expression for the Hubble's law
and a formula for its redshift that could explain this phenomenon like a
gravitational effect. Also we obtain an approximated calculation of the Cosmic
Background Radiation (CBR), taking as hypothesis that this radiation is the
light of all stars in the Universe that arrive until us with an extreme
gravitational redshift. In conclusion, we present here an alternative
explanation for the redshift and CBR, like an alternative to the presented by
the Big Bang theory, or Steady State theory, postulating in consequence a new
theory about the structure of the Universe: static, infinite, eternal and
self-sustainable.
