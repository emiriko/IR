Magnetization dynamics of a half-quantum vortex in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensate with a ferromagnetic interaction are investigated by mean-field and
Bogoliubov analyses. The transverse magnetization is shown to break the
axisymmetry and form threefold domains. This phenomenon originates from the
topological structure of the half-quantum vortex and spin conservation.
