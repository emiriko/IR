We study the problem of a quantum quench in which the initial state is the
ground state of an inhomogeneous hamiltonian, in two different models,
conformal field theory and ordinary free field theory, which are known to
exhibit thermalisation of finite regions in the homogeneous case. We derive
general expressions for the evolution of the energy flow and correlation
functions, as well as the entanglement entropy in the conformal case.
Comparison of the results of the two approaches in the regime of their common
validity shows agreement up to a point further discussed. Unlike the thermal
analogue, the evolution in our problem is non-diffusive and can be physically
interpreted using an intuitive picture of quasiparticles emitted from the
initial time hypersurface and propagating semiclassically.
