In this paper I discuss the formation of topological defects in quantum field
theory and the relation between fractals and coherent states. The study of
defect formation is particularly useful in the understanding of the same
mathematical structure of quantum field theory with particular reference to the
processes of non-equilibrium symmetry breaking. The functional realization of
fractals in terms of the q-deformed algebra of coherent states is also
presented. From one side, this sheds some light on the dynamical formation of
fractals. From the other side, it also exhibits the fractal nature of coherent
states, thus opening new perspectives in the analysis of those phenomena where
coherent states play a relevant role. The global nature of fractals appears to
emerge from local deformation processes and fractal properties are incorporated
in the framework of the theory of entire analytical functions.
