Spectral deformation of K alpha, K beta and gamma emissions from the nuclear
state 103mRh excited by bremsstrahlung are investigated. Nonlinear increase for
excitation number density of 103mRh with radiation exposure is observed. The
spectral profiles are broadened, attributable to a triplet splitting.
Interesting time-evolution behaviors of the spectral deformations are obtained.
