The low-energy scattering properties of two aligned identical bosonic and
identical fermionic dipoles are analyzed. Generalized scattering lengths are
determined as functions of the dipole moment and the scattering energy. Near
resonance, where a new bound state is being pulled in, all non-vanishing
generalized scattering lengths diverge, with the $a_{00}$ and $a_{11}$
scattering lengths being dominant for identical bosons and identical fermions,
respectively, near both broad and narrow resonances. Implications for the
energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions of trapped two-dipole systems and for
pseudo-potential treatments are discussed.
