We report the results of two signature-based searches for new physics using
1.9- 2.0 fb-1 of data collected at the CDF experiment. Both analyses look in
events containing a photon, a b-tagged jet, and missing transverse energy. The
first search requires an additional jet. The second search requires an extra
electron or muon. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model
prediction is observed. We also describe the "CES/CPR" method which is used to
estimate the amount of mis-identified photons.
