High dimensional array data, tensor data, is becoming important in recent
days. Then maximal rank of tensors is important in theory and applications. In
this paper we consider the maximal rank of 3 tensors. It can be attacked from
various viewpoints, however, we trace the method of Atkinson-Stephens(1979) and
Atkinson-Lloyd(1980). They treated the problem in the complex field, and we
will present various bounds over the real field by proving several lemmas and
propositions, which is real counterparts of their results.
