Intracellular transport is based on molecular motors that pull cargos along
cytoskeletal filaments. One motor species always moves in one direction, e.g.
conventional kinesin moves to the microtubule plus end, while cytoplasmic
dynein moves to the microtubule minus end. However, many cellular cargos are
observed to move bidirectionally, involving both plus-end and minus-end
directed motors. The presumably simplest mechanism for such bidirectional
transport is provided by a tug-of-war between the two motor species. This
mechanism is studied theoretically using the load-dependent transport
properties of individual motors as measured in single-molecule experiments. In
contrast to previous expectations, such a tug-of-war is found to be highly
cooperative and to exhibit seven different motility regimes depending on the
precise values of the single motor parameters. The sensitivity of the transport
process to small parameter changes can be used by the cell to regulate its
cargo traffic.
