We consider a thin-film normal metal/superconductor junction in the presence
of an externally applied in-plane magnetic field for several symmetries of the
superconducting order parameter. For p-wave superconductors, a strongly
spin-polarized current emerges due to an interplay between the nodal structure
of the superconducting order parameter, the existence or non-existence of
zero-energy surface states, and the Zeeman-splitting of the bands which form
superconductivity. Thus, the polarization depends strongly on the orbital
symmetry of the superconducting state. Our findings suggest a mechanism for
obtaining fully spin-polarized currents crucially involving zero-energy surface
states, not present in s-wave superconductors.
