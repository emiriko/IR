The standard equilibrium equation for magnetized plasma is extended to
account for the magnetic polarization force. A factor of the pressure gradient
arising from the magnetic decomposition of the Hall term survives the limit of
vanishing magnetization and is canceled by a contribution from the magnetic
polarization force, such that the proposed equation reduces to the standard
form in the free current limit. Comparison of the solutions for an axially
symmetric plasma column indicates agreement with the free current limit for
vanishing magnetization and variation in the field and current profiles as the
degree of magnetization increases.
