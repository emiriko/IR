We report our results on two new ternary intermetallic compounds
Pr$_{2}$Pd$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ and Pr$_{2}$Rh$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ based on magnetic
susceptibility, magnetization, specific heat, resistivity and magnetoresistance
data. These compounds form in U$_{2}$Co$_{3}$Si$_{5}$-type orthorhombic
structure (space group \textit{Ibam}). Pr$_{2}$Pd$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ exhibits two
magnetic transitions at T$_{N1}$ = 7.5 K and T$_{N2}$ = 8.3 K. In the
magnetically ordered state Pr$_{2}$Pd$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ exhibits a field induced
metamagnetic transition and unusually large magnetoresistance.
Pr$_{2}$Rh$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ does not show any phase transition down to 0.5 K. It
has a CEF singlet ground state, separated from the first excited state by about
10 K. The low lying crystal field excitations lead to exciton mediated
electronic mass enhancement as evidenced by large Sommerfeld coefficient
($\gamma$ $\sim$ 80 mJ/mol K$^2$) in Pr$_{2}$Rh$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$.
