The reconstruction of the unitary symmetry \cite{TFD} under non-linear
dynamical mapping Hilbert space of action amplitudes $C^N$ onto projective
Hilbert space $CP(N-1)$ \cite{Le1} has been applied here to the quantum
dynamics of elementary vacuum excitations. The "vacuum manifold of virtual
action states" is represented here by $CP(N-1)$ whereas its tangent vectors
define local dynamical variables (LDV's) describing "matter". The conservation
laws of LDV's express self-conservation of the "material particles" during
continuous evolution being expressed as the affine parallel transport agrees
with Fubuni-Study metric, create the "affine gauge potential" as the solution
of the partial differential equations. Such procedure embeds the quantum
dynamics into dynamical space-time whose state-dependent coordinates arose due
to encoding results of quantum measurement by the qubit spinor whose components
subjected to Lorentz transformations of "quantum boosts" and "quantum
rotations". Thereby, in the framework of super-relativity, the objective
character of the quantum measurement is inherently related to the dynamical
space-time structure that replaces the notion of "observer".
