We analyze the convex structure of the set of positive operator valued
measures (POVMs) representing quantum measurements on a given finite
dimensional quantum system, with outcomes in a given locally compact Hausdorff
space. The extreme points of the convex set are operator valued measures
concentrated on a finite set of k \le d^2 points of the outcome space, d<
\infty being the dimension of the Hilbert space. We prove that for second
countable outcome spaces any POVM admits a Choquet representation as the
barycenter of the set of extreme points with respect to a suitable probability
measure. In the general case, Krein-Milman theorem is invoked to represent
POVMs as barycenters of a certain set of POVMs concentrated on k \le d^2 points
of the outcome space.
