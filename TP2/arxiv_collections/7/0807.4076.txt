New BABAR measurements are presented for the exclusive rare decays B -> K(*)
l+ l- including branching fractions, isospin asymmetries, direct CP violation,
and lepton flavor universality for dilepton masses below and above the J/psi
resonance. Unexpectedly large isospin asymmetries are observed in both K l+l-
and K* l+ l- decays. For the combined K l+l- and K* l+l- data a 3.9 sigma
significant deviation from the SM prediction is found. Furthermore, recent
BABAR results from an angular analysis in B -> K* l+l- are reported in which
both the K* longitudinal polarization and the lepton forward-backward asymmetry
are measured for dilepton masses below and above the J/psi resonance. Finally,
results of recent searches for B -> pi l+l-$ from Belle and B -> K(*) nu anti
nu$ from BABAR are summarized.
