The derivation of the Nordheim-Boltzmann transport equation for weakly
interacting quantum fluids is a longstanding problem in mathematical physics.
Inspired by the method developed to handle classical dilute gases, a
conventional approach is the use of the BBGKY hierarchy for the time-dependent
reduced density matrices. In contrast, our contribution is motivated by the
kinetic theory of the weakly nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The main
observation is that the results obtained in the latter context carry over
directly to weakly interacting quantum fluids provided one does not insist on
normal order in the Duhamel expansion. We discuss the term by term convergence
of the expansion and the equilibrium time correlation <a(t)* a(0)>.
