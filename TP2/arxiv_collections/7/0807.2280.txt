We prove a local in time smoothing estimate for a magnetic Schrodinger
equation with coefficients growing polynomially at spatial infinity. The
assumptions on the magnetic field are gauge invariant and involve only the
first two derivatives. The proof is based on the multiplier method and no
pseudofferential techniques are required.
