We consider a gradient interface model on the lattice with interaction
potential which is a nonconvex perturbation of a convex potential. Using a
technique which decouples the neighboring vertices sites into even and odd
vertices, we show for a class of non-convex potentials: the uniqueness of
ergodic component for \nabla\phi-Gibbs measures, the decay of covariances, the
scaling limit and the strict convexity of the surface tension.
