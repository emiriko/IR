We report results on the branching fraction ($\mathcal{BF}$) measurement of
the color-suppressed decays $\bar{B}^0\to D^0 \pi^0$, $D^{*0}\pi^0$, $D^0\eta$,
$D^{*0}\eta$, $D^0\omega$, $D^{*0}\omega$, $D^0\eta^{\prime}$, and
$D^{*0}\eta^{\prime}$. The result is based on a sample of $(454\pm 5)\times
10^{6} B\bar{B}$ pairs collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance from 1999 to
2007, with the $\babar$ detector at the PEP-II storage rings at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. The measurements are compared to theoretical
predictions by factorization, SCET and pQCD.
