The low-field electron mobility in rectangular silicon nanowire (SiNW)
transistors was computed using a self-consistent Poisson-Schr\"{o}dinger-Monte
Carlo solver. The behavior of the phonon-limited and surface-roughness-limited
components of the mobility was investigated by decreasing the wire width from
30 nm to 8 nm, the width range capturing a crossover between two-dimensional
(2D) and one-dimensional (1D) electron transport. The phonon-limited mobility,
which characterizes transport at low and moderate transverse fields, is found
to decrease with decreasing wire width due to an increase in the
electron-phonon wavefunction overlap. In contrast, the mobility at very high
transverse fields, which is limited by surface roughness scattering, increases
with decreasing wire width due to volume inversion. The importance of acoustic
phonon confinement is also discussed briefly.
