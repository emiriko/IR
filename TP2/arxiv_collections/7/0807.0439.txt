We consider the one-loop effective action due to gravitons in a FLRW
background with constant epsilon=-(dH/dt)/H^2. By expanding around epsilon=0
(corresponding to an expansion around de Sitter space), we can study how the
deviation from de Sitter space effects the quantum corrected Friedmann
equations. We find that, at zeroth order in epsilon, one-loop effects induce
only a finite shift in the coupling constants. At linear order in epsilon there
is however a divergent contribution to the equations of motion. This
contribution leads to a nontrivial term in the renormalized equations that
depends logarithmically on H and thus cannot be absorbed in local counterterms.
We find that deviations due to this term are unobservably small. Our study
shows that quantum effects in quasi de Sitter space can be fundamentally
different then in de Sitter space, albeit in the case under consideration the
effect is unobservably small.
