We introduce the idea of temporal graphs, a representation that encodes
temporal data into graphs while fully retaining the temporal information of the
original data. This representation lets us explore the dynamic temporal
properties of data by using existing graph algorithms (such as shortest-path),
with no need for data-driven simulations. We also present a number of metrics
that can be used to study and explore temporal graphs. Finally, we use temporal
graphs to analyse real-world data and present the results of our analysis.
