In this letter, we study the condition for a generalized DBI action providing
a quintom scenario of dark energy. We consider a development of string-inspired
quintom by introducing non-minimal coupling. Then we show that the bouncing
solution can appear in the universe dominated by the non-minimally coupled
quintom matter.
