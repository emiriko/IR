In order to achieve quantum interference of free electrons inside a solid, we
have modified the geometry of the solid so that de Broglie waves interfere
destructively inside the solid. Quantum interference of de Broglie waves leads
to a reduction in the density of possible quantum states of electrons inside
the solid and increases the Fermi energy level. This effect was studied
theoretically within the limit of the quantum theory of free electrons inside
the metal. It has been shown that if a metal surface is modified with patterned
indents, the Fermi energy level will increase and consequently the electron
work function will decrease. This effect was studied experimentally in both Au
and SiO2 thin films of special geometry and structure. Work function reductions
of 0.5 eV in Au films and 0.2 eV in SiO2 films were observed. Comparative
measurements of work function were made using the Kelvin Probe method based on
compensation of internal contact potential difference. Electron emission from
the same thin films was studied by two independent research groups using
Photoelectron Emission Microscopy (PEEM).
