A crucial test of the Standard Model is the measurement of electroweak
gauge-boson scattering. In this paper, we describe a generic parameterization
aimed at a realistic simulation of weak-boson scattering at the LHC. The
parameterization implements resonances of all possible spin and isospin
combinations, properly matched to the low-energy effective (chiral) Lagrangian,
includes leading higher-order effects and contains a minimal unitarization
scheme. We implement the parameterization in the Monte-Carlo event generator
WHIZARD and present results for complete partonic cross-section integration and
event generation. We provide a comparison with the effective W approximation
that previously has been used for most WW scattering studies at hadron
colliders.
