The problem of the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor is among the oldest
and the most controversial in macroscopic electrodynamics. In the center of the
issue is a dispute about the Minkowski and the Abraham tensors for moving
media. An overview of the current situation is presented. After putting the
discussion into a general Lagrange-Noether framework, the Minkowski tensor is
recovered as a canonical energy-momentum. It is shown that the balance
equations of energy, momentum, and angular momentum are always satisfied for an
open electromagnetic system despite the lack of the symmetry of the canonical
tensor. On the other hand, although the Abraham tensor is not defined from
first principles, one can formulate a general symmetrization prescription
provided a timelike vector is available. We analyze in detail the variational
model of a relativistic ideal fluid with isotropic electric and magnetic
properties interacting with the electromagnetic field. The relation between the
Minkowski energy-momentum tensor, the canonical energy-momentum of the medium
and the Abraham tensor is clarified. It is demonstrated that the Abraham
energy-momentum is relevant when the 4-velocity of matter is the only covariant
variable that enters the constitutive tensor.
