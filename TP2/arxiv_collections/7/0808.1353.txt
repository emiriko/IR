An early-stage version of simulation package ' ELSES' (Extra-Large-Scale
Electronic-Structure calculation) is developed for electronic structure and
dynamics of large systems, particularly, nm-scale or 10nm-scale systems
(www.elses.jp). Input and output files are written in the Extensible Markup
Language (XML) style for general users. Related pre-/post-simulation tools are
also available. Practical work flow and example are described. A test
calculation of GaAs bulk system is shown to demonstrate that the present code
can handle systems with more than one atom species. Several future aspects are
also discussed.
