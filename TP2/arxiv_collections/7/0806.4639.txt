We study the spin transport properties of the non-centrosymmetric
superconductor with time-reversal-symmetry where spin-triplet $(p_{x} \pm i
p_{y})$-wave and spin-singlet s-wave pair potential can mix each other. We show
that when the amplitude of $(p_{x} \pm ip_{y})$-wave pair potential is larger
than that of s-wave one, the superconducting state belongs to the topologically
nontrivial class analogous to the quantum spin Hall system, and the resulting
helical edge modes as Andreev bound states are topologically protected. We find
that the incident angle dependent spin polarized current flows through the
interface due to the presence of the helical edge modes. With a weak magnetic
field, also the angle-integrated current is strongly spin polarized.
