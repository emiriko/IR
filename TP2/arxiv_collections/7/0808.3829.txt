A Green-function formalism for the Kondo lattice model is presented, which is
designed to be combined with the dynamical mean-field theory. With use of
Wick's theorem only for conduction electrons, dynamical quantities are
represented in terms of the t-matrix and its two-particle generalizations. By
taking the high-frequency limit of the t-matrix with respect to a part of the
fermion frequencies, one obtains dynamical correlation functions of localized
moments. Explicit examples of calculational steps are provided with use of the
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method.
