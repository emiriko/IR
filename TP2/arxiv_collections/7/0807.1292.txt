Using ideas from BCS descriptions of systems of fermions, a covariant
extension of the relativistic Fermi gas model is presented as a way to
incorporate correlation effects in nuclei. The model is developed for the BCS
nuclear ground state and for final states consisting of a single plane-wave
nucleon plus a BCS recoiling daughter nucleus. The nuclear spectral function is
obtained and from it the superscaling function for use in treating high-energy
quasielastic electroweak processes. Interestingly, this model has the
capability to yield the asymmetric tail seen in the experimental scaling
function.
