We show that non-maximally entangled states can be used to build a quantum
key distribution (QKD) scheme whose security and key rate transmission is
nearly equivalent to those of standard QKD protocols. These aspects can be
controlled by using the new free parameter in the present scheme, namely, the
degree of partial entanglement. Furthermore, we discuss how to build a
controlled QKD scheme, also based on partially entangled states, where a third
party can decide whether or not Alice and Bob are allowed to share a key.
