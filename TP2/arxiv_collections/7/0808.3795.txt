The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva (Switzerland) will go in
operation in the coming months and will soon enable us to analyze the highest
energy collisions ever produced at an accelerator. Beyond Standard Model
searches at LHC require a detailed understanding of the detector performance,
reconstruction algorithms and triggering. Precision measurements of Standard
Model processes are also mandatory to acquire the necessary knowledge of
Standard Model background. Both ATLAS and CMS efforts are hence addressed to
determine the best calibration candles and to design a realistic plan for the
initial period of data taking.
