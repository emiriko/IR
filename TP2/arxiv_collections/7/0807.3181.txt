We obtain multi-soliton solutions of the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations or, equivalently, Gorkov equations that describe the dynamics of a
fermionic condensate in the dissipationless regime. There are two kinds of
solitons - normal and anomalous. At large times, normal multi-solitons
asymptote to unstable stationary states of the BCS Hamiltonian with zero order
parameter (normal states), while the anomalous ones tend to eigenstates
characterized by a nonzero anomalous average. Under certain circumstances,
multi-soliton solutions break up into sums of single solitons. In the linear
analysis near the stationary states, solitons correspond to unstable modes.
Generally, they are nonlinear extensions of these modes, so that a stationary
state with $k$ unstable modes gives rise to a $k$-soliton solution. We relate
parameters of the multi-solitons to those of the asymptotic stationary state,
which determines the conditions necessary for exciting solitons. We further
argue that the dynamics in many physical situations is multi-soliton.
