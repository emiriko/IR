We apply a novel method for the equivalence group and its infinitesimal
generators to the investigation of invariants of linear ordinary differential
equations. First, a comparative study of this method is illustrated by an
example. Next, the method is used to obtain the invariants of low order linear
ordinary differential equations, and the structure invariance group for an
arbitrary order of these equations. Other properties of these equations are
also discussed, including the exact number of their invariants.
