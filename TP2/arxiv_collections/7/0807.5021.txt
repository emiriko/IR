Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) provide a new and powerful framework
for a complete description of the nucleon structure. They can provide a
three-dimensional picture of how the quarks and gluons form a nucleon. GPDs can
be probed experimentally in hard exclusive meson production or deeply virtual
Compton scattering (DVCS). The COMPASS experiment at CERN is a unique place to
study these reactions. At COMPASS, a high energy polarized positive or negative
muon beam is scattered off a polarized or unpolarized fixed target. First
results for exclusive rho^0 meson production are shown. The transverse target
spin asymmetry for exclusively produced rho^0 on a transversely polarized
deuteron target has been measured. Prospects for future measurements of DVCS
and exclusive meson production at COMPASS will be shown. The experiment will
use the existing COMPASS spectrometer with a new target, a new recoil detector
and extended calorimetry. Simulations for different models and a test of the
recoil detector have been performed.
