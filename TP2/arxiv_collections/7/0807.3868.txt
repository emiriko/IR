The first aim of the present paper, is to establish strong approximations of
the uniform non-overlapping k-spacings process extending the results of Aly et
al. (1984). Our methods rely on the invariance principle in Mason and van Zwet
(1987). The second goal, is to generalize the Dindar (1997) results for the
increments of the spacings quantile process to the uniforme non-overlapping
k-spacings quantile process. We apply the last result to characterize the limit
laws of functionals of the increments k-spacings quantile process.
