We consider a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a ghost condensate
background. It is shown that the Hawking radiation in the quanta of small
perturbations around this background is highly suppressed- in particular it is
not given by a thermal spectrum. This result is in accord with observations
that such black holes can be used to violate the generalized second law of
thermodynamics, and thus cannot have a standard entropy/area relation.
