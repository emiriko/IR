We present here recent results on the investigations of the mass spectrum
(S-states and P-states), decay constants, decay widths and life time of the D,
$D_s$,and $B_c$mesons within the framework of phenomenological potential
models.We also present the binding energy and the masses of the di-meson
molecular systems with one or more charm meson combinations. Many of the newly
found experimental open charm states are identified with the orbital
excitations of the conventional open charm mesons while others like X(3872),
Y(3930), $D_{sJ}$(2632, 2700) \emph{etc.}, are identified as molecular like
states.
