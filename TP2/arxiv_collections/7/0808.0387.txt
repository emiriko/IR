This paper describes a 8 bits, 20 Msamples/s pipeline analog-to-digital
converter implemented in 0.6 \mu m CMOS technology with a total power
dissipation of 75.47 mW. Circuit techniques used include a precise comparator,
operational amplifier and clock management. A switched capacitor is used to
sample and multiplying at each stage. Simulation a worst case DNL and INL of
0.75 LSB. The design operate at 5 V dc. The ADC achieves a SNDR of 44.86 dB.
