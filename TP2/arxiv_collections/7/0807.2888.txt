We characterize in terms of Darboux transformations the spaces in the
Segal-Wilson rational Grassmannian, which lead to commutative rings of
differential operators having coefficients which are rational functions of e^x.
The resulting subgrassmannian is parametrized in terms of trigonometric
Calogero-Moser matrices.
