The decays of light vector mesons into three pseudoscalar mesons are
calculated to leading order in the recently proposed counting scheme that is
based on the hadrogenesis conjecture. Fully differential as well as integrated
decay widths are presented. Since the required parameters have been fixed by
other processes, the considered three-body decays are predictions of the
presented approach. The decay width of the omega meson into three pions agrees
very well with experiment. The partial decay widths of the K^* into its three
K-pi-pi channels are predicted.
