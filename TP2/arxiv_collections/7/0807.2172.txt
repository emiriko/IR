The article presents an alternative approach to the definition of vector
electrodynamic potential and its properties. It is shown that generally it has
vortical and potential components. The system of differential equations of
generalized electrodynamics (the macroscopical theory) is written down; and on
the basis of these equations the mechanism of occurrence of the electromagnetic
waves spreading in the direction of vector (longitudinal E-waves) is explained.
It is demonstrated that the new macroscopical theory is in accordance with
quantum electrodynamics. The author investigates the issue of physical
pithiness of longitudinal electromagnetic E-waves and specifies the references
to the experimental researches confirming the new theory.
