The status of the commissioning of the ATLAS experiment as of May 2008 is
presented. The sub-detector integration in recent milestone weeks is described.
Cosmic commissioning in milestone week M6 included simultaneous data-taking and
combined track analysis of the muon detector and inner detector, as well as
combined analysis of muon detector and muon trigger. The calorimeters have
achieved near-full operation, and are integrated with the calorimeter trigger.
The high-level-trigger infrastructure is being installed and algorithms tested
in technical runs.
