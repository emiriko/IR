The recent new structure of benzene shows that it consists of three C atoms
of radii as in graphite alternating with three C atoms with double bond radii.
This is different from the hypothetical cyclohexatriene (Kekule structure)
involving alternate double and single bonds. It was shown that the difference
in the bond energy sum of the atomic structure of benzene from that of the
Kekule structure is the energy (erroneously) assumed to be due to resonance.
Here it is shown that the present structure of benzene also explains the energy
of hydrogenation into cyclohexane and its difference from that of
cyclohexatriene.
