We study dynamics of the equation of state parameter for a dark energy
component non-minimally coupled to induced gravity on a warped DGP brane. We
show that there are appropriate domains of the model parameters space that
account for crossing of the phantom divide line. This crossing, which is
possible for both branches of the scenario, depends explicitly on the values of
the non-minimal coupling and warp factor. The effect of warp factor appears in
the value of the redshift parameter at which phantom divide line crossing
occurs.
