We have developed a method to simulate behavior of nanoporous materials in a
molecular dynamics code. The nanoporous solid is produced via a spinodal
decomposition of a material brought from a supercritical fluid into the two
phase (liquid-vapor) region and then quenching and freezing the liquid into an
interconnected nanoporous solid. We have simulated, at the atomic level,
compression in crystal/nanoporous configurations, demonstrating that this is a
powerful technique for studying the equation-of-state of cold and warm dense
matter. By performing compression simulations relevant to high energy density
physics experiments, we have been able to elucidate experimental measurement by
identifying governing microscopic mechanisms.
