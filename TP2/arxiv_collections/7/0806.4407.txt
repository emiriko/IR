The numerical study of QED radiative corrections in the low $x$ region for
the H1 experiment at HERA was performed. The analytical program TERAD91 was
used to get the size of the radiative corrections for the measurement of the
proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ in the range $x= 10^{-2} - 10^{-4}$ and
$ 5 GeV^2 < Q^2 < 80 GeV^2$. It was found that radiative corrections can be not
small in some points of the phase space of the mixed variables.
