Since spin and charge are both carried by electrons (or holes) in a solid, it
is natural to assume that charge and spin diffusion coefficients will be the
same. Drift-diffusion models of spin transport typically assume so. Here, we
show analytically that the two diffusion coefficients can be vastly different
in quantum wires. Although we do not consider quantum wells or bulk systems, it
is likely that the two coefficients will be different in those systems as well.
Thus, it is important to distinguish between them in transport models,
particularly those applied to quantum wire based devices
