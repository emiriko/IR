In this paper various extensions of the design strategy of transformation
media are proposed. We show that it is possible to assign different transformed
spaces to the field strength tensor (electric field and magnetic induction) and
to the excitation tensor (displacement field and magnetic field), resp. In this
way, several limitations of standard transformation media can be overcome. In
particular it is possible to provide a geometric interpretation of
non-reciprocal as well as indefinite materials. We show that these
transformations can be complemented by a continuous version of
electric-magnetic duality and comment on the relation to the complementary
approach of field-transforming metamaterials.
