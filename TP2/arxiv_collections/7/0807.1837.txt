We find evidence for decaying magnons at strong magnetic field in the square
lattice spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The results are obtained using
Quantum Monte Carlo simulations combined with a Bayesian inference technique to
obtain dynamics and are consistent with predictions from spin wave theory.
