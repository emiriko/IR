In some cases the state of a quantum system with a large number of subsystems
can be approximated efficiently by the density matrix renormalization group,
which makes use of redundancies in the description of the state. Here we show
that the achievable efficiency can be much better when performing density
matrix renormalization group calculations in the Heisenberg picture, as only
the observable of interest but not the entire state is considered. In some
non-trivial cases, this approach can even be exact for finite bond dimensions.
