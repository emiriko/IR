Dimuon production has been studied in a series of fixed-target experiments at
Fermilab during the last two decades. Highlights from these experiments,
together wih recent results from the Fermilab E866 experiment, are presented.
Future prospects for studying the parton distributions in the nucleons and
nuclei using dimuon production at Fermilab and J-PARC are also discussed.
