For every compact Kaehler manifold we give a canonical extension of
Griffith's period map to generalized deformations, intended as solutions of
Maurer-Cartan equation in the algebra of polyvector fields. Our construction
involves the notion of Cartan homotopy and a canonical L-infinity structure on
mapping cones of morphisms of differential graded Lie algebras.
