We consider the problem of computing the smallest possible distortion for
embedding of a given n-point metric space into R^d, where d is fixed (and
small). For d=1, it was known that approximating the minimum distortion with a
factor better than roughly n^(1/12) is NP-hard. From this result we derive
inapproximability with factor roughly n^(1/(22d-10)) for every fixed d\ge 2, by
a conceptually very simple reduction. However, the proof of correctness
involves a nontrivial result in geometric topology (whose current proof is
based on ideas due to Jussi Vaisala).
  For d\ge 3, we obtain a stronger inapproximability result by a different
reduction: assuming P \ne NP, no polynomial-time algorithm can distinguish
between spaces embeddable in R^d with constant distortion from spaces requiring
distortion at least n^(c/d), for a constant c>0. The exponent c/d has the
correct order of magnitude, since every n-point metric space can be embedded in
R^d with distortion O(n^{2/d}\log^{3/2}n) and such an embedding can be
constructed in polynomial time by random projection.
  For d=2, we give an example of a metric space that requires a large
distortion for embedding in R^2, while all not too large subspaces of it embed
almost isometrically.
