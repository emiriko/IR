An approach that provides students with an ability to transfer learning in
physics and mathematics to the engineering-technology courses through
e-teaching and e-learning process is proposed. E-modules of courses in
mathematics, physics, computer systems technology, and electrical and
telecommunications engineering technology have been developed. These modules
being used in the Blackboard and Web-based communications systems create a
virtual interdisciplinary learning community, which helps the students to
transfer knowledge from physics and mathematics to their study in engineering
technology.
