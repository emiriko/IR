Any careful singularity analysis of the Mixmaster Universe uncovers the
instance of a triple -1 resonance. The Mixmaster Universe does not exhibit a
closed-form solution and so a correct interpretation of the meaning of the
triple -1 resonance is difficult. We provide a system of differential equations
for which both a closed-form solution and a triple -1 resonance exist.
