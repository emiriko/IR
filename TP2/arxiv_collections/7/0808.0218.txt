I present measurements of W and Z boson properties by the CDF and D0
collaborations. This includes measurements that test the production mechanism
of the bosons and precision measurements of electroweak parameters. In the
former category I present CDF measurements of the Z rapidity and W charge
asymmetry that will help further constrain Parton Distribution Functions in
future global fits, and a D0 measurement of the Z transverse momentum
distribution that can be used to test the predictions of
quantum-chromodynamics. In the later category I present a D0 measurement of the
Z/gamma* forward-backward asymmetry and the subsequent extraction sin2theta_W =
0.2327 +/- 0.0018 (stat.) +/- 0.0006 (syst.) and a CDF measurement of the W
width Gamma_W using a fit to the tail of the W transverse mass distribution in
W->enu and W->munu events that yields Gamma_W = 2032 +/- 73 MeV.
