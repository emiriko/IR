We report a direct observation of segregation of gold atoms to the near
surface regime due to 1.5 MeV Au2+ ion impact on isolated gold nanostructures
deposited on silicon. Irradiation at fluences of 6x10^13, 1x10^14 and 5x10^14
ions cm-2 at a high beam flux of 6.3x1012 ions cm-2 s-1 show a maximum
transported distance of gold atoms into the silicon substrate to be 60, 45 and
23 nm, respectively. At a lower fluence (6x1013 ions cm-2) transport has been
found to be associated with the formation of gold silicide (Au5Si2). At a high
fluence value of 5x10^14 ions cm-2, disassociation of gold silicide and
out-diffusion lead to segregation of gold to defect - rich surface and
interface region.
