Control of the radial profile of trapped antiproton clouds is critical to
trapping antihydrogen. We report the first detailed measurements of the radial
manipulation of antiproton clouds, including areal density compressions by
factors as large as ten, by manipulating spatially overlapped electron plasmas.
We show detailed measurements of the near-axis antiproton radial profile and
its relation to that of the electron plasma.
