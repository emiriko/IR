The nature and value of the order parameters (OPs) in the superconducting
Fe-based oxypnictides REFeAsO_(1-x)F_x (RE = rare earth) are a matter of
intense debate, also connected to the pairing mechanism which is probably
unconventional. Point-contact Andreev-reflection experiments on
LaFeAsO_(1-x)F_x gave us direct evidence of three energy scales in the
superconducting state: a nodeless superconducting OP, Delta1 = 2.8-4.6 meV,
which scales with the local Tc of the contact; a larger unconventional OP that
gives conductance peaks at 9.8-12 meV, apparently closes below Tc and decreases
on increasing the Tc of the contact; a pseudogaplike feature (i.e. a depression
in the conductance around zero bias), that survives in the normal state up to
T* ~ 140 K (close to the Neel temperature of the undoped compound), which we
associate to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations (AF SF) coexisting with
superconductivity. These findings point toward a complex, unconventional nature
of superconductivity in LaFeAsO_(1-x)F_x.
