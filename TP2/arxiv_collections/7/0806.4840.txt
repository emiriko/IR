In this study, we examine decoherence of qubits system coupled independently
by using influence functional. We especially concentrated on the effect of
qubit flip process. We examine the zero-dimensional qubit and one-dimensional
qubits system coupled with multi-band one-dimensional system. The qubit flip
process leads to oscillation and self-excitation. We also obtained the time
evolution of von Neumann entropy.The pure dephasing channel indicates entropy.
These results show quantum brown motion. We present the numerical calculation
of the entropy for random telegraph noise. This indicates that the slower
random telegraph noise leads to more mixed state.Thus for charge qubit, the
background charge fluctuation is important.
