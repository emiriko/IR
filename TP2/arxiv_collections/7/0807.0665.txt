The interior of a Schwarzschild black hole is investigated at the level of
phenomenological dynamics with the discreteness corrections of loop quantum
geometry implemented in two different improved quantization schemes. In one
scheme, the classical black hole singularity is resolved by the quantum bounce,
which bridges the black hole interior with a white hole interior. In the other
scheme, the classical singularity is resolved and the event horizon is also
diffused by the quantum bounce. Jumping over the quantum bounce, the black hole
gives birth to a baby black hole with a much smaller mass. This lineage
continues as each classical black hole brings forth its own descendant in the
consecutive classical cycle, giving the whole extended spacetime fractal
structure, until the solution eventually descends into deep Planck regime,
signaling a breakdown of the semiclassical description. The issues of scaling
symmetry and no-hair theorem are also discussed.
