Measurements of the total cross section of e+e- -> hadrons are presented in
two different ranges of centre-of-mass energy. The measurements are made using
the CLEO III and CLEO-c detectors at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring. The
absolute cross sections and the values of R, the ratio of hadronic to muon pair
production cross sections, are determined at seven centre-of-mass energies
between 6.964 and 10.538 GeV. The total cross sections and values of R are also
determined at thirteen centre-of-mass energies between 3.97 and 4.26 GeV; in
addition, the inclusive and exclusive cross sections for D+, D0 and Ds+
production are presented. Furthermore, for the lower centre-of-mass energy
range, exclusive cross-sections are presented for final states consisting of
two charm mesons: DDbar, D*Dbar, DDbar*, D*Dbar*, Ds+Ds-, Ds*+Ds-, Ds+Ds*-,
DDbar*pi and D*Dbar*pi.
