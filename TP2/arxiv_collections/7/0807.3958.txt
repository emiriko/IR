We address the estimation of the loss parameter of a bosonic channel probed
by arbitrary signals. Unlike the optimal Gaussian probes, which can attain the
ultimate bound on precision asymptotically either for very small or very large
losses, we prove that Fock states at any fixed photon number saturate the bound
unconditionally for any value of the loss. In the relevant regime of low-energy
probes, we demonstrate that superpositions of the first low-lying Fock states
yield an absolute improvement over any Gaussian probe. Such few-photon states
can be recast quite generally as truncations of de-Gaussified photon-subtracted
states.
