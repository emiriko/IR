Assuming antiferromagnetic orbital correlations to model the pseudogap state
in the underdoped high-temperature superconductors, we study how this
correlation is distinguished from the d-wave superconductivity correlation with
including the finite-range antiferromagnetic correlation effect. In spite of
the fact that both correlations have the same d-wave symmetry, the
contributions from each correlation is clearly distinguished in the spectral
weight and the density of states.
