The physical understanding of a method of detecting mammalian cancer via
vocalization during a normal echo-Doppler test is provided. The backscattered
ultrasound frequency in the case of a vocal humming resonating in the chest
wall is computed: the overall effect is that the signal/noise ratio could be
easily improved at no cost. Clinical results are to appear separately
elsewhere.
