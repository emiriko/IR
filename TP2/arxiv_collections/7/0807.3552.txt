We study the Kondo Lattice and Hubbard models on a triangular lattice for
band filling factor 3/4. We show that a simple non-coplanar chiral spin
ordering (scalar spin chirality) is naturally realized in both models due to
perfect nesting of the Fermi surface. The resulting triple-Q magnetic ordering
is a natural counterpart of the collinear Neel ordering of the half-filled
square lattice Hubbard model. We show that the obtained chiral phase exhibits a
spontaneous quantum Hall-effect with sigma_{xy}= e^2/h.
