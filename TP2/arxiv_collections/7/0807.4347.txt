We propose an analytical device model for a graphene nanoribbon field-effect
transistor (GNR-FET). The GNR-FET under consideration is based on a
heterostructure which consists of an array of nanoribbons clad between the
highly conducting substrate (the back gate) and the top gate controlling the dc
and ac source-drain currents. Using the model developed, we derive explicit
analytical formulas for the GNR-FET transconductance as a function of the
signal frequency, collision frequency of electrons, and the top gate length.
The transition from the ballistic and to strongly collisional electron
transport is considered.
