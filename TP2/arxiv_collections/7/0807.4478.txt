In this paper are described the image processing algorithms developed by
SENER, Ingenieria y Sistemas to cope with the problem of image-based,
autonomous rendez-vous (RV) with an orbiting satellite. The methods developed
have a direct application in the OLEV (Orbital Life Extension Extension
Vehicle) mission. OLEV is a commercial mission under development by a
consortium formed by Swedish Space Corporation, Kayser-Threde and SENER, aimed
to extend the operational life of geostationary telecommunication satellites by
supplying them control, navigation and guidance services. OLEV is planned to
use a set of cameras to determine the angular position and distance to the
client satellite during the complete phases of rendez-vous and docking, thus
enabling the operation with satellites not equipped with any specific
navigational aid to provide support during the approach. The ability to operate
with un-equipped client satellites significantly expands the range of
applicability of the system under development, compared to other competing
video technologies already tested in previous spatial missions, such as the
ones described here below.
