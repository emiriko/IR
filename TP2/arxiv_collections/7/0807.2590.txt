We report measurements of the de Haas - van Alphen effect on a series of
compounds, LaMIn$_{5}$ (M = Co, Rh, Ir). The results show that each of the Co
and Ir Fermi surfaces (FSs) exhibit some portions that are two dimensional and
some portions that are three dimensional. The most two dimensional character is
exhibited in LaCoIn$_{5}$, less two dimensional behavior is seen in
LaIrIn$_{5}$, no part of Fermi surface of LaRhIn$_{5}$ is found to have a two
dimensional character. Thus the two dimensionality of portions of the FSs is
largely determined by the d character of the energy bands while all of the
effective masses remain $\leq$ 1.2. This fact has implications for the causes
of the heavy fermion nature of superconductivity and magnetism in the Ce-based
compounds having the similar composition and structure. All of the measurements
were performed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory using either
cantilever magnetometry or field modulation methods.
