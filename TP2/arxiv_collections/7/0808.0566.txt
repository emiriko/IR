A previously derived semi-microscopic analysis based on the Double Folding
Model, for alpha-particle elastic scattering on A~100 nuclei at energies below
32 MeV, is extended to medium mass A ~ 50-120 nuclei and energies from ~13 to
50 MeV. The energy-dependent phenomenological imaginary part for this
semi-microscopic optical model potential was obtained including the dispersive
correction to the microscopic real potential, and used within a concurrent
phenomenological analysis of the same data basis. A regional parameter set for
low-energy alpha-particles entirely based on elastic-scattering data analysis
was also obtained for nuclei within the above-mentioned mass and energy ranges.
Then, an ultimate assessment of (alpha,gamma), (alpha,n) and (alpha,p) reaction
cross sections concerned target nuclei from 45Sc to 118Sn and incident energies
below ~12 MeV. The former diffuseness of the real part of optical potential as
well as the surface imaginary-potential depth have been found responsible for
the actual difficulties in the description of these data, and modified in order
to obtain an optical potential which describe equally well both the low energy
elastic-scattering and induced-reaction data of alpha-particles.
