We compute the scattering amplitude for pion scattering in Wilson chiral
perturbation theory for two degenerate quark flavors. We consider two different
regimes where the quark mass m is of order (i) a\Lambda_QCD^2 and (ii)
a^2\Lambda_QCD^3. Analytic expressions for the scattering lengths in all three
isospin channels are given. As a result of the O(a^2) terms the I=0 and I=2
scattering lengths do not vanish in the chiral limit. Moreover, additional
chiral logarithms proportional to a^2\ln M_{\pi}^2 are present in the one-loop
results for regime (ii). These contributions significantly modify the familiar
results from continuum chiral perturbation theory.
