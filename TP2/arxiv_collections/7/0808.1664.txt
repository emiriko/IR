In this paper we construct a new variant of the Weil representation,
associated with a symplectic vector space V defined over a finite field of
characteristic two. Our variant is a representation of a bigger group than that
of Weil. In the course, we develop the formalism of canonical vector spaces,
which enables us to realize the bigger symmetry group and the representation in
a transparent manner.
