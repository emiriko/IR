By interpreting the fusion matrix as an adjacency matrix we associate a loop
model to every primary operator of a generic conformal field theory. The weight
of these loop models is given by the quantum dimension of the corresponding
primary operator. Using the known results for the O(n) models we establish a
relationship between these models and SLEs. The method is applied to WZW, $c<1$
minimal conformal field theories and other coset models.
