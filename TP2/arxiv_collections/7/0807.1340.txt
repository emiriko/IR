We present low field thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) measurements in
granular CrO2 and composites of ferromagnetic (FM) CrO2 and antiferromagnetic
(AFM) Cr2O3. TRM in these samples is seen to display two distinct time scales.
A quasi static part of remanence, appearing only in low field regime exhibits a
peculiar field dependence. TRM is seen to first rise and then fall with
increasing cooling fields, eventually vanishing above a critical field. Similar
features in TRM have previously been observed in some antiferromagnets that
exhibit the phenomenon of piezomagnetism. Scaling analysis of the TRM data
suggest that presumably piezomoments generated in the AFM component drive the
FM magnetization dynamics in these granular systems in low field regime.
