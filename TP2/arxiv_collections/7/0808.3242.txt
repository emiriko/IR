We reformulate the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model using an N=8 superspace,
thus making the full supersymmetry manifest. The formulation is based on
appropriate "pure spinor wave functions" for the Chern-Simons and matter
multiplets. The Lagrangian has an extremely simple structure, essentially
containing a Chern-Simons-like term for the gauge field wave function and a
minimally coupled matter wave function. No higher order interactions than cubic
are present. The consistency of the setup relies on an interplay between the
algebraic structures of the 3-algebra and of the pure spinors.
