System of partial differential equations with a convolution terms and
non-local nonlinearity describing oscillations of plate due to Berger approach
and with accounting for thermal regime in terms of Coleman-Gurtin and
Gurtin-Pipkin law and fading memory of material is considered. The equation is
transformed into a dynamical system in a suitable Hilbert space which
asymptotic behaviour is analysed. Existence of the compact global attractor in
this dynamical system and some of its properties are proved in this article.
Main tool in analysis of asymptotic behaviour is stabilizability inequality.
