This paper is the second paper in a series of four papers that introduce
cybersusy, which is a new method for analyzing supersymmetry breaking in the
standard supersymmetric model (SSM). The first paper was a summary of the
results and the three next papers set out the details. In this second paper, we
derive the full BRS operator and action for the general massless Wess-Zumino
chiral supersymmetry action. This includes the source terms which bring in the
equations of motion. The auxiliary field is integrated, which removes manifest
supersymmetry, but which allows the Legendre transform to operate correctly to
define one-particle-irreducible vertices from the connected Green's functions.
Then some special terms in the BRS cohomology are described, together with the
constraint equations that they must satisfy. These `simple dotspinors' are
generated by a `fundamental dotspinor', which is constructed partly from the
Zinn sources. The equations of motion play a very important role in the
cohomology for this theory. These dotspinors play an interesting role in the
BRS cohomology of the standard model, which is the subject of the third paper
in the series.
