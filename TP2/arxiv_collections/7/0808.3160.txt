We study heat transfer from a heated nanoparticle into surrounding fluid,
using molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the fluid next to the
nanoparticle can be heated well above its boiling point without a phase change.
Under increasing nanoparticle temperature, the heat flux saturates which is in
sharp contrast with the case of flat interfaces, where a critical heat flux is
observed followed by development of a vapor layer and heat flux drop. These
differences in heat transfer are explained by the curvature induced pressure
close to the nanoparticle, which inhibits boiling. When the nanoparticle
temperature is much larger than the critical fluid temperature, a very large
temperature gradient develops resulting in close to ambient temperature just
radius away from the particle surface
