We study the complete ${\cal O}(\alpha_{ew})$ electroweak (EW) corrections to
the production of three $Z^0$-bosons in the the framework of the standard
model(SM) at the ILC. The leading order and the EW next-to-leading order
corrected cross sections are presented, and their dependence on the colliding
energy $\sqrt{s}$ and Higgs-boson mass $m_{H}$ is analyzed. We investigate also
the LO and one-loop EW corrected distributions of the transverse momentum of
final $Z^0$ boson, and the invariant mass of $Z^0Z^0$-pair. Our numerical
results show that the EW one-loop correction generally suppresses the
tree-level cross section, and the relative correction with $m_{H}=120 GeV(150
GeV)$ varies between $-15.8%(-13.9%)$ and $-7.5%(-6.2%)$ when $\sqrt{s}$ goes
up from $350 GeV$ to $1 TeV$.
