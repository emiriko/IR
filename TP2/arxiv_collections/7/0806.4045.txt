Let U be the quantised enveloping algebra associated to a Cartan matrix of
finite type. Let W be the tensor product of a finite list of highest weight
representations of U. Then the centraliser algebra of W has a basis called the
dual canonical basis which gives an integral form. We show that this integral
form is cellular by using results due to Lusztig.
