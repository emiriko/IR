We investigate phase coherent electronic transport in an open quantum system,
which consists of quantum dots side-coupled to a nanowire. It is demonstrated
that coherent switching can be characterized by adjusting the electronic
energy. A comparative analysis of quantum coherence effects in side-coupled
quantum-dot systems is presented. Our results demonstrate the relevance of
electronic nanodevices based on coherent switching by appropriately detuning
the side-coupled quantum dots that are located at variable distance along a
wire.
