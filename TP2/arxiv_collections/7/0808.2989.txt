We classify, up to local unitary equivalence, the set of $n$-qubit states
that is stabilized by the diagonal subgroup of the local unitary group. We
exhibit a basis for this set, parameterized by diagrams of nonintersecting
chords connecting pairs of points on a circle, and give a criterion for when
the stabilizer is precisely the diagonal subgroup and not larger. This
investigation is part of a larger program to partially classify entanglement
type (local unitary equivalence class) via analysis of stabilizer structure.
