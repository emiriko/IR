We investigate the bandwidth-controlled Mott transition in the Hubbard model
on the checkerboard lattice at half filling using the path-integral
renormalization group (PIRG) method. It is demonstrated that the system
undergoes a first-order phase transition to the plaquette-singlet insulating
phase at a finite Hubbard interaction. This conclusion is drawn via a detailed
analysis of the spin and charge correlations around the phase transition point
by means of the PIRG method aided with a new iteration scheme introduced in
this paper.
