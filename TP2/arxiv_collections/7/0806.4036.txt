The binding energies of di- hadronic states have been calculated assuming a
'molecular' interaction provided by the asymptotic expression of the residual
confined gluon exchange potential between the component hadrons in the system.
Meson- meson and meson- baryon states have been studied in detail and a mass
formula has been used to calculate total mass of the 'molecules'.
