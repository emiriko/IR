The heavy-fermion compound YbRh2Si2 exhibits an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase
transition at an extremely low temperature of TN = 70 mK. Upon applying a tiny
magnetic field of Bc = 60 mT the AFM ordering is suppressed and the system is
driven toward a field-induced quantum critical point (QCP). Here, we present
low-temperature thermopower S(T) measurements of high-quality YbRh2Si2 single
crystals down to 30 mK. S(T) is found negative with comparably large values in
the paramagnetic state. In zero field no Landau-Fermi-liquid (LFL) like
behavior is observed within the magnetically ordered phase. However, a sign
change from negative to positive appears at lowest temperatures on the magnetic
side of the QCP. For higher fields B > Bc a linear extrapolation of S to zero
clearly evidences the recovery of LFL regime. The crossover temperature is
sharply determined and coincides perfectly with the one derived from
resistivity and specific heat investigations.
