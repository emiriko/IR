The SuperNEMO project aims to search for neutrinoless double beta decay
($0\nu\beta\beta$) up to a sensitivity of 10$^{26}$ years for the
$0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life (down to 50 meV in the effective Majorana neutrino
mass), using $\sim$100 kg of source and a `tracko-calo' detector. The current
status of the 2007--2009 R&D programme is presented here, focusing on the most
challenging aspects: calorimetry, production of sources, low radioactivity
measurements, and tracker.
