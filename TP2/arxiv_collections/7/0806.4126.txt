We show that the whole range of RHIC data for hadron production in d-Au
collisions is compatible with geometric scaling. To establish the scaling
violations expected from small-x evolution a larger kinematic range in
transverse momentum and rapidity would be needed. We point out that the
fall-off of the p_t distribution of produced hadrons at large p_t is a
sensitive probe of small-x evolution especially at the LHC.
