We reconsider the geometry of pure and mixed states in a finite quantum
system. The rangesof eigenvalues of the density matrices delimit a regular
simplex (Hypertetrahedron TN) in any dimension N; the polytope isometry group
is the symmetric group SN+1, and splits TN in chambers, the orbits of the
states under the projective group PU(N + 1). The type of states correlates with
the vertices, edges, faces, etc. of the polytope, with the vertices making up a
base of orthogonal pure states. The entropy function as a measure of the purity
of these states is also easily calculable; we draw and consider some isentropic
surfaces. The Casimir invariants acquire then also a more transparent
interpretation.
