We present measurements of the fluctuation spectrum of giant vesicles
containing bacteriorhodopsin (BR) pumps using video-microscopy. When the pumps
are activated, we observe a significant increase of the fluctuations in the low
wavevector region, which we interpret as due to a lowering of the effective
tension of the membrane.
