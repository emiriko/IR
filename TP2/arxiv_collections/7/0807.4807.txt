We consider the problem of approximating a multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) $p\times m$ rational transfer function $H(s)$ of high degree by another
$p\times m$ rational transfer function $\hat H(s)$ of much smaller degree, so
that the ${\cal H}_2$ norm of the approximation error is minimized. We
characterize the stationary points of the ${\cal H}_2$ norm of the
approximation error by tangential interpolation conditions and also extend
these results to the discrete-time case. We analyze whether it is reasonable to
assume that lower-order models can always be approximated arbitrarily closely
by imposing only first-order interpolation conditions. Finally, we analyze the
${\cal H}_2$ norm of the approximation error for a simple case in order to
illustrate the complexity of the minimization problem.
