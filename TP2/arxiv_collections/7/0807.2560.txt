We study the Josephson current in a junction comprising two superconductors
linked by a strong ferromagnet in presence of impurities. We focus on a regime
where the electron (and hole) motion is ballistic over the exchange length and
diffusive on the scale of the weak link length. The current-phase relation is
obtained for both two- and three dimensional ferromagnetic weak links. In the
clean limit, the possibility of temperature-induced 0- transitions is
demonstrated while the corresponding critical current versus temperature
dependences are also studied.
