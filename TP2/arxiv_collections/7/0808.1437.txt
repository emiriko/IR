We present the results of our calculation which has been performed to study
the nuclear effects in the quasielastic, inelastic and deep inelastic
scattering of neutrinos(antineutrinos) from nuclear targets. These calculations
are done in the local density approximation. We take into account the effect of
Pauli blocking, Fermi motion, Coulomb effect, renormalization of weak
transition strengths in the nuclear medium in the case of the quasielastic
reaction. The inelastic reaction leading to production of pions is calculated
in a $\Delta $- dominance model taking into account the renormalization of
$\Delta$ properties in the nuclear medium and the final state interaction
effects of the outgoing pions with the residual nucleus. We discuss the nuclear
effects in the $F_{3}^{A}(x)$ structure function in the deep inelastic
neutrino(antineutrino) reaction using a relativistic framework to describe the
nucleon spectral function in the nucleus.
