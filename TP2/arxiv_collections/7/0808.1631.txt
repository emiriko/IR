The confinement-deconfinement phase transition is explored by lattice
numerical simulations in non-compact (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics
with massive fermions at finite temperature. The existence of two phases, one
with and the other without confinement of fractional charges, is related to the
realization of the Z symmetry. The order parameter of this transition can be
clearly identified. We show that it is possible to detect the critical
temperature for a given value of the fermion mass, by exploiting suitable
lattice operators as probes of the Z symmetry. Moreover, the large-distance
behavior of the correlation of these operators permits to distinguish the phase
with Coulomb-confinement from the Debye-screened phase. The resulting scenario
is compatible with the existence of a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition. Some investigations are presented on the possible relation between
chiral and deconfinement transitions and on the role of ``monopoles''.
