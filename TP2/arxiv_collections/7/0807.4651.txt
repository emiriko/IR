In LiNiO2, the Ni3+ ions, with S=1/2 and twofold orbital degeneracy, are
arranged on a trian- gular lattice. Using muon spin relaxation (MuSR) and
electron spin resonance (ESR), we show that magnesium doping does not stabilize
any magnetic or orbital order, despite the absence of interplane Ni2+. A
disordered, slowly fluctuating state develops below 12 K. In addition, we find
that magnons are excited on the time scale of the ESR experiment. At the same
time, a g factor anisotropy is observed, in agreement with $| 3z^{2}-r^{2}>$
orbital occupancy.
