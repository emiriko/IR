We investigate the development of superconductivity in graphene when the
Fermi level becomes close to one of the Van Hove singularities of the electron
system. The origin of the pairing instability lies in the strong anisotropy of
the e-e scattering at the Van Hove filling, which leads to a channel with
attractive coupling when making the projection of the BCS vertex on the
symmetry modes with nontrivial angular dependence along the Fermi line. We show
that the scale of the superconducting instability may be pushed up to
temperatures larger than 10 K, depending on the ability to tune the system to
the proximity of the Van Hove singularity.
