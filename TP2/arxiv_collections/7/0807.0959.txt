We investigate further the recent analysis \cite{R.Banerjee2}, based on a
Hamilton-Jacobi type approach, to compute the temperature and entropy of black
holes beyond the semiclassical approximation. It is shown how non spherically
symmetric geometries are inducted in the general formalism by explicitly
considering the BTZ black hole. The leading (logarithmic) and non leading
corrections to the area law are obtained.
