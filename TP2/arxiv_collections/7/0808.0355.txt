We calculate the gauge invariant overlaps for
Schnabl/Kiermaier-Okawa-Rastelli-Zwiebach's marginal solution with nonsingular
current. The obtained formula is the same as that for
Fuchs-Kroyter-Potting/Kiermaier-Okawa's marginal solution, which was already
computed by Ellwood. Our result is consistent with the expectation that they
may be gauge equivalent. We also comment on a gauge invariant overlap for
rolling tachyon solutions in cubic open string field theory.
