We have studied the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 51V nuclei in the
superconductor/ferromagnet thin film heterostructures Ni/V/Ni and
Pd{1-x}Fe{x}/V/Pd{1-x}Fe{x} in the normaland superconducting state. Whereas the
position and shape of the NMR line in the normal state for the trilayers is
identical to that observed in a single V-layer, in the superconducting state
the line shape definitely changes, developing a systematic distortion of the
high-field wing of the resonance line. We consider this as the first
experimental evidence for the penetration of ferromagnetism into the
superconducting layer, a phenomenon which has been theoretically predicted
recently and dubbed the inverse proximity effect.
