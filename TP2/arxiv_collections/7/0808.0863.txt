A basis for the space of generalized theta functions of level one for the
spin groups, parameterized by the theta characteristics (the even theta
characteristcs for the odd spin groups) on a curve, is shown to be projectively
flat over the moduli space of curves (for Hitchin's connection). The symplectic
strange duality conjecture, conjectured by Beauville is shown to hold for all
curves of genus at least two, by using Abe's proof of the conjecture for
generic curves, and the above monodromy result.
