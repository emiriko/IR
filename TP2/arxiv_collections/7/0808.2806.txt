We present novel metamaterial structures based upon various planar wallpaper
groups, in both hexagonal and square unit cells. An investigation of
metamaterials consisting of one, two, and three unique sub-lattices with
resonant frequencies in the terahertz (THz) was performed. We describe the
theory, and perform simulations and experiments to characterize these multiple
element metamaterials. A method for using these new structures as a means for
bio / chemical hazard detection, as well as electromagnetic signature control
is proposed.
