It is generally believed that neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined at a
long baseline experiment, often using accelerator neutrino beams. Reactor
neutrino experiments at an intermediate baseline have the capability to
distinguish normal or inverted hierarchy. Recently it has been demonstrated
that the mass hierarchy could possibly be identified using Fourier transform to
the L/E spectrum if the mixing angle $\sin^2(2\theta_{13})>0.02$. In this study
a more sensitive Fourier analysis is introduced. We found that an ideal
detector at an intermediate baseline ($\sim 60$ km) could identify the mass
hierarchy for a mixing angle $\sin^2(2\theta_{13}) > 0.005$, without
requirements on accurate information of reactor neutrino spectra and the value
of $\Delta m^2_{32}$.
