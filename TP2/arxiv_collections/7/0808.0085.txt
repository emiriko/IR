A phenomenological study of quark--hadron duality in electron and neutrino
scattering on nuclei is performed. We compute the structure functions $F_2$ and
$xF_3$ in the resonance region within a framework that includes the
Dortmund-group model for the production of the {f}{i}rst four lowest-lying
baryonic resonances and a relativistic mean-field model for nuclei. We consider
four-momentum transfers between 0.2 and 2.5 GeV$^2$. The results indicate that
nuclear effects play a different role in the resonance and DIS region. We find
that global but not local duality works well. In the studied range of
four-momentum transfers, the integrated strength of the computed nuclear
structure functions in the resonance region, is considerably lower than the DIS
one.
