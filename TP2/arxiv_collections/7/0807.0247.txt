Agent-based models have been employed to describe numerous processes in
immunology. Simulations based on these types of models have been used to
enhance our understanding of immunology and disease pathology. We review
various agent-based models relevant to host-pathogen systems and discuss their
contributions to our understanding of biological processes. We then point out
some limitations and challenges of agent-based models and encourage efforts
towards reproducibility and model validation.
