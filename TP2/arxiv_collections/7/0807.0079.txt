Ion beams have been widely applied in a few biological research fields such
as radioactive breeding, health protection, and tumor therapy. Up to now many
interesting and impressive achievements in biology and agriculture have been
made. Over the past several decades, scientists in biology, physics, and
chemistry have pursued investigations focused on understanding the mechanisms
of these radiobiological effects of ion beams. From the chemical point of view,
these effects are due to the ion irradiation induced biomolecular damage,
direct or indirect. In this review, we will present a chemical overview of the
direct effects of ion irradiation upon DNA and its components, based on a
review of literature combined with recent experimental results. It is suggested
that, under ion bombardment, a DNA molecule undergoes a variety of processes,
including radical formation, atomic displacement, intramolecular
bond-scissions, emission of fragments, fragment recombination and molecular
crosslink, which may lead to genetic mutations or cell death. This may help to
understand the mechanisms of the radiobiological effects caused by ion
irradiation, such as radiation breeding and tumor therapy.
