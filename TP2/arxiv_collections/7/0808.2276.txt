This is the third paper in a series of four papers which introduce cybersusy,
which is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking in the supersymmetric
standard model (SSM). In this paper we display some solutions to the constraint
equations of BRS cohomology in the SSM. In particular we discuss the leptonic
dotspinor pseudosupermultiplets that were used in Cybersusy I to calculate
leptonic supersymmetry breaking in the supersymmetric standard model. We also
introduce examples of hadronic dotspinor pseudosupermultiplets that will induce
baryonic supersymmetry breaking in the SSM for the baryons with charge Q=-1,
and related supersymmetry partner baryons. Some interesting relationships
between the peculiar structure of the SSM, the existence of solutions for the
BRS constraints, and supersymmetry breaking using cybersusy are noted.
