A search for a sidereal modulation in the MINOS near detector neutrino data
was performed. If present, this signature could be a consequence of Lorentz and
CPT violation as predicted by a class of extensions to the Standard Model. No
evidence for a sidereal signal in the data set was found, implying that there
is no significant change in neutrino propagation that depends on the direction
of the neutrino beam in a sun-centered inertial frame. Upper limits on the
magnitudes of the Lorentz and CPT violating terms in these extensions to the
Standard Model lie between 0.01-1% of the maximum expected, assuming a
suppression of these signatures by factor of $10^{-17}$. \
