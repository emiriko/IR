A simple theoretical model is proposed to describe the recent experimental
results on formation of induced superconducting state and anomalous tunneling
characteristics in selectively doped multilayered nanostructures based on
La$_2$CuO$_4$ perovskite. In particular, it is shown that the structure
composed from the nominally non-superconducting (undoped and overdoped) layers
turns to be superconducting with superconductivity confined to narrow regions
near the interfaces, in agreement with the experimental observations.
