We complete the list of one loop renormalization group equations and matching
conditions relevant for the computation of the electroweak precision parameters
$S$ and $T$ in the three site Higgsless model. We obtain one-loop formulas for
$S$ and $T$ expressed in terms of physical observables such as the KK gauge
boson mass $M_{W'}$, the KK fermion mass $M$, and the KK gauge boson ($W'$)
couplings with light quarks and leptons $g_{W'ff}$. It is shown that these
physical observables, $M_{W'}$, $M$ and $g_{W'ff}$ are severely constrained by
the electroweak precision data. Unlike the tree level analysis on the ideally
delocalized fermion, we find that perfect fermiophobity of $W'$ is ruled out by
the precision data. We also study the cutoff dependence of our analysis.
Although the model is non-renormalizable, the dependence on the cutoff
parameter $\Lambda$ is shown to be non-significant.
