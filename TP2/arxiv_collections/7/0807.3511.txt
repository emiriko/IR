The Doppler effect of moving atoms can create irreversibility of light. We
show that the laser field in electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT) scheme
with atomic motion can control the directional propagation of two
counter-propagating probe fields in atomic gas cell. The quantum coherence
effect serves as an optical transistor. Interference of the two output fields
from the cell shows useful feature for determining the mean atomic velocity and
can be useful as quantum velocimeter. We also find that the sign of the
dispersive phase in EIT has a unique property, which helps to explain certain
features in the interference.
