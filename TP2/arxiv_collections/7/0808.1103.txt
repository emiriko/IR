By analyzing trajectories of solid hydrogen tracers, we find that the
distributions of velocity in decaying quantum turbulence in superfluid $^4$He
are strongly non-Gaussian with $1/v^3$ power-law tails. These features differ
from the near-Gaussian statistics of homogenous and isotropic turbulence of
classical fluids. We examine the dynamics of many events of reconnection
between quantized vortices and show by simple scaling arguments that they
produce the observed power-law tails.
