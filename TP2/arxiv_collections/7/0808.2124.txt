We extend the Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) model to a two-component BEG model
in order to study 2D systems with two order parameters, such as magnetic
superconductors or two-component Bose-Einstein condensates. The model is
investigated using Monte Carlo simulations, and the temperature-concentration
phase diagram is determined in the presence and absence of an external magnetic
field. This model exhibits a rich phase diagram, including a second-order
transition to a phase where superconductivity and magnetism coexist. Results
are compared with experiments on Cerium-based heavy-fermion superconductors. To
study cold atom mixtures, we also simulate the BEG and two-component BEG models
with a trapping potential. In the BEG model with a trap, there is no longer a
first order transition to a true phase-separated regime, but a crossover to a
kind of phase-separated region. The relation with imbalanced fermi-mixtures is
discussed. We present the phase diagram of the two-component BEG model with a
trap, which can describe boson-boson mixtures of cold atoms. Although there are
no experimental results yet for the latter, we hope that our predictions could
help to stimulate future experiments in this direction.
