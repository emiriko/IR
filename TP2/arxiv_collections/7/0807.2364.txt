Systematic $1/N_c$ counting of correlators is performed to directly relate
quark-gluon dynamics to qualitatively different hadronic states order by order.
Both 2q and 4q correlators of $\sigma$ quanta are analyzed with $1/N_c$
separation of the instanton, glueball, and in particular, two meson scattering
states. The {\it bare} resonance pole with no mixing effects are studied with
the QCD sum rules (QSR). The bare mass relation for large $N_c$ mesons,
$m_{\rho}<m_{4q}^{I=J=0}<m_{2q}^{I=J=0}$, is derived. The firm theoretical
ground of the QSR at the leading $1/N_{c}$ analyses is also emphasized.
