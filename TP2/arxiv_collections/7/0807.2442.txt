The method used earlier for analysis of correlated nanoscopic systems is
extended to infinite (periodic) s-band like systems described by the Hubbard
model and its extensions. The optimized single-particle wave functions
contained in the parameters of the Hubbard model (the hopping \textit{t} and
the magnitude of the intraatomic interaction \textit{U}) are determined
explicitly in the correlated state for the electronic systems of various
symmetries and dimensions: Hubbard chain, square and triangular planar
lattices, and the three cubic lattices (SC, BCC, FCC). In effect, the evolution
of the electronic properties as a function of interatomic distance $R$ is
obtained. The model parameters in most cases do not scale linearly with the
lattice spacing and hence, their solution as a function of microscopic
parameters reflects only qualitatively the system evolution. Also, the atomic
energy changes with $R$ and therefore should be included in the model analysis.
The solutions in one dimension (\textit{D} = 1) can be analyzed both rigorously
(by making use of the Lieb--Wu solution) and compared with the approximate
Gutzwiller treatment. In higher dimensions (\textit{D} = 2, 3) only the latter
approach is possible to implement within the scheme. The renormalized single
particle wave functions are almost independent of the choice of the scheme
selected to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the Fock space in D=1 case. The
method can be extended to other approximation schemes as stressed at the end.
