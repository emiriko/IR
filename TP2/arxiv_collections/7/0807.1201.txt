The main object of Bayesian statistical inference is the determination of
posterior distributions. Sometimes these laws are given for quantities devoid
of empirical value. This serious drawback vanishes when one confines oneself to
considering a finite horizon framework. However, assuming infinite
exchangeability gives rise to fairly tractable {\it a posteriori} quantities,
which is very attractive in applications. Hence, with a view to a
reconciliation between these two aspects of the Bayesian way of reasoning, in
this paper we provide quantitative comparisons between posterior distributions
of finitary parameters and posterior distributions of allied parameters
appearing in usual statistical models.
