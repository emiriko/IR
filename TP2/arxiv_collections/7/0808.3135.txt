Based only on the Galilean addition of velocities and the de Broglie
relation, it is deduced that in a matter-wave interferometer with slow-speed
particles, a moving segment of deltaL with a velocity V contributes deltaPhi =
(2Pi/vlamda)VdotdeltaL to the total phase difference of the interferometer,
where v is the speed of the particles and lamda is the wavelength.. This
expression is exactly the same as the generalized Sagnac effect for light waves
found by experiments except that v is replaced by c. For a rotational motion,
it leads to the Sagnac effect. Additionally, the scientific value of this
relationship is also to explore the possibility of detecting translation speeds
by a matter-wave interferometer. Two configurations of the experimental setup
have been indicated and the key element is that the paths of the interfering
beams constitute a loop with an opening. If the possibility is confirmed by
experiments, the conclusions will be that there is a preferred reference frame
for matter waves and a speedometer with a very high sensitivity is possible.
