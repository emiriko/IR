Heat-induced mobility of nucleosomes along DNA is an experimentally
well-studied phenomenon. A recent experiment shows that the repositioning is
modified in the presence of minor-groove binding DNA ligands. We present here a
stochastic three-state model for the diffusion of a nucleosome along DNA in the
presence of such ligands. It allows us to describe the dynamics and the steady
state of such a motion analytically. The analytical results are in excellent
agreement with numerical simulations of this stochastic process.With this
model, we study the response of a nucleosome to an external force and how it is
affected by the presence of ligands.
