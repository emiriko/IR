Coherence evolution and echo effect of an electron spin, which is coupled
inhomogeneously to an interacting one-dimensional finite spin bath via
hyperfine-type interaction, is studied using the adaptive time dependent
density matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG) method. It is found that the
interplay of the coupling inhomogeneity and the transverse intra-bath
interactions results in two qualitatively different coherence evolutions,
namely, a coherence preserving evolution characterized by periodic oscillation
and a complete decoherence evolution. Correspondingly, the echo effects induced
by an electron spin flip at time $\tau$ exhibit stable recoherence pulse
sequence for the periodic evolution and a single peak at $\sqrt 2 \tau$ for the
decoherence evolution, respectively. With the diagonal intra-bath interaction
included, the specific feature of the periodic regime is kept, while the $\sqrt
2\tau$-type echo effect in the decoherence regime is significantly affected. To
render the experimental verifications possible, the Hahn echo envelope as a
function of $\tau$ is calculated, which eliminates the inhomogeneous broadening
effect and serves for the identification of the different status of the dynamic
coherence evolution, periodic versus decoherence.
