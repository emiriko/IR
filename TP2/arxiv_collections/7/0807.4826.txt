We study the breakdown of a random fiber bundle model (RFBM) with
$n$-discontinuities in the threshold distribution using the global load sharing
scheme. In other words, $n+1$ different classes of fibers identified on the
basis of their threshold strengths are mixed such that the strengths of the
fibers in the $i-th$ class are uniformly distributed between the values
$\sigma_{2i-2}$ and $\sigma_{2i-1}$ where $1 \leq i \leq n+1$. Moreover, there
is a gap in the threshold distribution between $i-th$ and $i+1-th$ class. We
show that although the critical stress depends on the parameter values of the
system, the critical exponents are identical to that obtained in the recursive
dynamics of a RFBM with a uniform distribution and global load sharing. The
avalanche size distribution (ASD), on the other hand, shows a non-universal,
non-power law behavior for smaller values of avalanche sizes which becomes
prominent only when a critical distribution is approached. We establish that
the behavior of the avalanche size distribution for an arbitrary $n$ is
qualitatively similar to a RFBM with a single discontinuity in the threshold
distribution ($n=1$), especially when the density and the range of threshold
values of fibers belonging to strongest ($n+1$)-th class is kept identical in
all the cases.
