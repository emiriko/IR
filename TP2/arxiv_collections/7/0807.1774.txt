We have performed three dimensional nonlinear fluid simulations of electron
fluid turbulence at nanoscales in an unmagnetized warm dense plasma in which
mode coupling between wave function and electrostatic potential associated with
underlying electron plasma oscillations (EPOs) lead to nonlinear cascades in
inertial range. While the wave function cascades towards smaller length scales,
electrostatic potential follows an inverse cascade. We find from our
simulations that quantum diffraction effect associated with a Bohm potential
plays a critical role in determining the inertial range turbulent spectrum and
the subsequent transport level exhibited by the 3D EPOs.
