The electromagnetic properties of a pancake coil in AC regime as a function
of the number of turns is studied theoretically and experimentally.
Specifically, the AC loss, the coil critical current and the voltage signal are
discussed. The coils are made of Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10/Ag (BiSCCO) tape, although the
main qualitative results are also applicable to other kinds of superconducting
tapes, such as coated conductors. The AC loss and the voltage signal are
electrically measured using different pick up coils with the help of a
transformer. One of them avoids dealing with the huge coil inductance. Besides,
the critical current of the coils is experimentally determined by conventional
DC measurements. Furthermore, the critical current, the AC loss and the voltage
signal are simulated, showing a good agreement with the experiments. For all
simulations, the field dependent critical current density inferred from DC
measurements on a short tape sample is taken into account.
