The presence of extra dimensions can be probed in high energy collisions via
the production or exchange of gravitons. The former corresponds to signatures
with missing energy while the latter corresponds to modifications of the final
state spectra. Here I review results of analyses performed by the CDF and D0
Collaborations on ppbar collisions at 1.96 TeV in signatures sensitive to large
extra dimensions. These include analyses of photon+(missing transverse energy)
and jet+(missing transverse energy) as signatures of graviton production as
well as analyses of dilepton and diboson final states sensitive to graviton
exchange.
