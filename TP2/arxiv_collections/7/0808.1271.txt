We present general formulae for the TsT transformation (T-duality, shift,
T-duality) of type II string backgrounds and open string boundary conditions.
The TsT transformation provides a systematic procedure to find string theory
duals of gauge theories with deformed products of fields in the lagrangian, and
the duals can be analyzed by using transformed D-brane probes. As examples
illustrating some features of the deformed theories, we consider the known
backgrounds dual to non-commutative, dipole and beta-deformed N=4 Super
Yang-Mills as well as new backgrounds dual to deformations of the recently
proposed N=6 Chern-Simons-matter theory living on multiple M2-branes on an
orbifold.
