The local density of states (LDOS) around a vortex core is studied
theoretically in terms of the odd-frequency (odd-omega) Cooper pairing induced
around the center of the vortex core. We find a robust zero-energy peak in the
LDOS at a vortex core in a chiral p-wave superconductor originating from an
odd-omega s-wave pair amplitude. We suggest how to discriminate a spin-triplet
pairing symmetry and spatial chiral-domain structure by scanning tunneling
spectroscopy via odd-omega pair amplitudes inside vortex cores.
