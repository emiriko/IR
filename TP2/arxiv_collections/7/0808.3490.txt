The properties of pseudoscalar bosonic excitations in the color-flavor locked
phase at moderate densities are studied within a model of the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio type. Our previous analysis is extended to Goldstone bosons
with hidden flavor and to higher-lying modes which stay massive in the chiral
limit. The bosons are constructed explicitly by solving the Bethe-Salpeter
equation for quark-quark scattering in random phase approximation. The masses
and weak decay constants of the Goldstone bosons are found in good agreement
with predictions from the low-energy effective theory. In the non-Goldstone
sector we find an SU(3) octet which is weakly bound, while the singlet appears
to be unbound.
