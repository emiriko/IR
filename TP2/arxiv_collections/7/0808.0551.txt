The sum gate is the canonical two-mode gate for universal quantum computation
based on continuous quantum variables. It represents the natural analogue to a
qubit C-NOT gate. In addition, the continuous-variable gate describes a quantum
nondemolition (QND) interaction between the quadrature components of two light
fields. We experimentally demonstrate a QND sum gate, employing the scheme by
R. Filip, P. Marek, and U.L. Andersen [\pra {\bf 71}, 042308 (2005)], solely
based on offline squeezed states, homodyne measurements, and feedforward. The
results are verified by simultaneously satisfying the criteria for QND
measurements in both conjugate quadratures.
