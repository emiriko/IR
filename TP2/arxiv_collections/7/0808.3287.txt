This article is composed of two parts; In the first part (Sec. 1), the
ultra-large-scale electronic structure theory is reviewed for (i) its
fundamental numerical algorithm and (ii) its role in nano-material science. The
second part (Sec. 2) is devoted to the mathematical foundation of the
large-scale electronic structure theory and their numerical aspects.
