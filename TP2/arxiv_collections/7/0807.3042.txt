In recent work, the Schwarzschild interior of a black hole was investigated,
incorporating quantum gravitational modifications due to loop quantum gravity.
The central Schwarzschild singularity was shown to be replaced by a Nariai type
universe. In this brief report we show that this interior solution is stable
with respect to small perturbations, in contrast to the classical Nariai
universe.
