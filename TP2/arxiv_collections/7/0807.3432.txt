We investigate effects of the application of a kick to one-dimensional
matter-wave solitons in a self-attractive Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a
optical lattice. The resulting soliton's dynamics is studied within the
framework of the time-dependent nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation. The
crossover from the pinning to quasi-free motion crucially depends on the size
of the kick, strength of the self-attraction, and parameters of the optical
lattice.
