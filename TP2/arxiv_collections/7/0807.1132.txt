Considering encouraging Virbhadra's results about energy distribution of
non-static spherically symmetric metrics in Kerr-Schild class, it would be
interesting to study some space-times with other symmetries. Using different
energy-momentum complexes, i.e. M{\o}ller, Einstein, and Tolman, in static
plane-symmetric and cylindrically symmetric solutions of Einstein-Maxwell
equations in 3+1 dimensions, energy (due to matter and fields including
gravity) distribution is studied. Energy expressions are obtained finite and
well-defined. calculations show interesting coincidences between the results
obtained by Einstein and Tolamn prescriptions. Our results support the
Cooperstock hypothesis about localized energy.
