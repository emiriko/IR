Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p \geq 3$. We classify
$p$-divisible groups over regular local rings of the form
$W(k)[[t_1,...,t_r,u]]/(u^e+pb_{e-1}u^{e-1}+...+pb_1u+pb_0)$, where
$b_0,...,b_{e-1}\in W(k)[[t_1,...,t_r]]$ and $b_0$ is an invertible element.
This classification was in the case $r = 0$ conjectured by Breuil and proved by
Kisin.
