We study the insertion and value of metric observables in the (discrete) path
integral formulation of the Ponzano-Regge spinfoam model for 3d quantum
gravity. In particular, we discuss the length spectrum and the relation between
insertion of such B-observables and gauge fixing in the path integral.
