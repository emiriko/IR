We develop a systematic analytical approach to study the linear and nonlinear
solitary excitations of quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates trapped
in an optical lattice. For the linear case, the Bloch wave in the $nth$ energy
band is a linear superposition of Mathieu's functions $ce_{n-1}$ and $se_n$;
and the Bloch wave in the $nth$ band gap is a linear superposition of $ce_n$
and $se_n$. For the nonlinear case, only solitons inside the band gaps are
likely to be generated and there are two types of solitons -- fundamental
solitons (which is a localized and stable state) and sub-fundamental solitons
(which is a lacalized but unstable state). In addition, we find that the
pinning position and the amplitude of the fundamental soliton in the lattice
can be controlled by adjusting both the lattice depth and spacing. Our
numerical results on fundamental solitons are in quantitative agreement with
those of the experimental observation [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf92}, 230401
(2004)]. Furthermore, we predict that a localized gap soliton train consisting
of several fundamental solitons can be realized by increasing the length of the
condensate in currently experimental conditions.
