We show that the Comment [arXiv:0808.1224] by Horowitz and Jarzynski obtains
as a main result a general free energy change for a harmonic system that in the
macroscopic limit does not recover the textbook expression for the energy
change of a Hookean spring. The reason is that Horowitz and Jarzynski
improperly identify work with parametric changes of the Hamiltonian instead of
with the standard quantity, force times displacement.
