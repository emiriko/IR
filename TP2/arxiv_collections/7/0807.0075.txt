The influence of random site dilution on the critical properties of the
two-dimensional Ising model on a square lattice was explored by Monte Carlo
simulations with the Wang-Landau sampling. The lattice linear size was $L =
20-120$ and the concentration of diluted sites $q=0.1, 0.2, 0.3$. Its pure
version displays a second-order phase transition with a vanishing specific heat
critical exponent $\alpha$, thus, the Harris criterion is inconclusive, in that
disorder is a relevant or irrelevant perturbation for the critical behavior of
the pure system. The main effort was focused on the specific heat and magnetic
susceptibility. We have also looked at the probability distribution of
susceptibility, pseudocritical temperatures and specific heat for assessing
self-averaging. The study was carried out in appropriate restricted but
dominant energy subspaces. By applying the finite-size scaling analysis, the
correlation length exponent $\nu$ was found to be greater than one, whereas the
ratio of the critical exponents ($\alpha /\nu$) is negative and ($\gamma /\nu$)
retains its pure Ising model value supporting weak universality.
