A common goal in an experimental physics analysis is to extract information
from a reaction with multi-dimensional kinematics. The preferred method for
such a task is typically the unbinned maximum likelihood method. In fits using
this method, the likelihood is a goodness-of-fit quantity in that it
effectively discriminates between available hypotheses; however, it does not
provide any information as to how well the best hypothesis describes the data.
  In this paper, we present an {\em ad-hoc} procedure for obtaining
chi**2/n.d.f. values from unbinned maximum likelihood fits. This method does
not require binning the data, making it very applicable to multi-dimensional
problems.
