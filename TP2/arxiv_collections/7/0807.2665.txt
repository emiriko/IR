The origin of diversification and coexistence of genes and species have been
traditionally studied in isolated biological levels. Ecological and
evolutionary views have focused on the mechanisms that enable or constrain
species coexistence, genetic variation and the genetics of speciation, but a
unified theory linking those approaches is still missing. Here we introduce
evolutionary graphs in the context of neutral theories of molecular evolution
and biodiversity to provide a framework that simultaneously addresses
speciation rate and joint genetic and species diversities. To illuminate this
question we also study two models of evolution on graphs with fitness
differences, which provide insights on how genetic and ecological dynamics
drive the speed of diversification. Neutral evolution generates the highest
speed of speciation, species richness (i.e. five times and twice as many
species as compared to genetic and ecological graphs, respectively) and
genetic--species diversity (i.e., twice as many as genetic and ecological
graphs, respectively). Thus the speed of speciation, the genetic--species
diversity and coexistence can differ dramatically depending on whether genetic
factors versus ecological factors drive the evolution of the system. By linking
molecular, sexual and trophic behavior at ecological and evolutionary scales,
interacting graphs can illuminate the origin and evolution of diversity and
organismal coexistence.
