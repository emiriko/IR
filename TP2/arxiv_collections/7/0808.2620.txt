Several density-matrix renormalization group methods have been proposed to
compute the momentum- and frequency-resolved dynamical correlation functions of
low-dimensional strongly correlated systems. The most relevant approaches are
discussed in this contribution. Their applications in various studies of
quasi-one-dimensional strongly correlated systems (spin chains, itinerant
electron systems, electron-phonon systems) are reviewed.
