We study light propagation in nanoscale periodic structures composed of
dielectric and metal in the visible range. We demonstrate that diffraction can
be tailored both in magnitude and in sign by varying the geometric features of
the waveguides. Diffraction management on a subwavelength scale is demonstrated
by numerical solution of Maxwell equations in frequency domain.
