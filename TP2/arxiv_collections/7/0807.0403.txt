A fully adaptive finite volume multiresolution scheme for one-dimensional
strongly degenerate parabolic equations with discontinuous flux is presented.
The numerical scheme is based on a finite volume discretization using the
Engquist--Osher approximation for the flux and explicit time--stepping. An
adaptivemultiresolution scheme with cell averages is then used to speed up CPU
time and meet memory requirements. A particular feature of our scheme is the
storage of the multiresolution representation of the solution in a dynamic
graded tree, for the sake of data compression and to facilitate navigation.
Applications to traffic flow with driver reaction and a clarifier--thickener
model illustrate the efficiency of this method.
