Photonic crystals with a finite size can support surface modes when
appropriately terminated. We calculate the dispersion curves of surface modes
for different terminations using the plane wave expansion method. These
non-radiative surface modes can be excited with the help of attenuated total
reflection technique. We did experiments and simulations to trace the surface
band curve, both in good agreement with the numerical calculations.
