We propose a photon echo quantum memory scheme using detuned Raman coupling
to long lived ground states. In contrast to previous 3-level schemes based on
controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening that use sequences of
$\pi$-pulses, the scheme does not require accurate control of the coupling
dynamics to the ground states. We present a proof of principle experimental
realization of our proposal using rubidium atoms in a warm vapour cell. The
Raman resonance line is broadened using a magnetic field that varies linearly
along the direction of light propagation. Inverting the magnetic field gradient
rephases the atomic dipoles and re-emits the light pulse in the forward
direction.
