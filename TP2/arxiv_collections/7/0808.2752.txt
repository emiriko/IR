We consider the non uniform $AdS$ black string equations in arbitrary number
of dimension in a perturbative approach up to order 2 and in a non
perturbative. We restrict the study in the perturbative approach to the
backreacting modes, since they provide the first relevant corrections on the
thermodynamical quantities of the solutions. We also present some preliminary
results in the construction of non-perturbative solutions, in particular, we
present a first part of the non uniform - uniform black string phase diagram.
Our results suggests the existence of a new stable phase for $AdS$ non uniform
black strings, namely long non uniform black string, with the extra direction
length of the order of the $AdS$ curvature.
