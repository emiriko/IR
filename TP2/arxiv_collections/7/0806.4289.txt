We proposed novel schemes to perform the deterministic dense coding and
faithful teleportation with multipartite graph states. We also find the
sufficient and necessary condition of a viable graph state for the proposed
scheme. That is, for the associated graph, the reduced adjacency matrix of the
Tanner-type subgraph between senders and receivers should be invertible.
