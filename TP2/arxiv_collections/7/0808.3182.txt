The dynamics of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati Cosmology (DGP) braneworld with an
anisotropic brane is studied. The Friedmann equations and their solutions are
obtained for two branches of anisotropic DGP model. The late time behavior in
DGP cosmology is examined in the presence of anisotropy which shows that
universe enters a self-accelerating phase much later compared to the isotropic
case. The acceleration conditions and slow-roll conditions for inflation are
obtained.
