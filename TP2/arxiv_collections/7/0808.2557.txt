The increasing level of experimental control over atomic and optical systems
gained in the past years have paved the way for the exploration of new physical
regimes in quantum optics and atomic physics, characterised by the appearance
of quantum many-body phenomena, originally encountered only in condensed-matter
physics, and the possibility of experimentally accessing them in a more
controlled manner. In this review article we survey recent theoretical studies
concerning the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to create quantum
many-body systems. Based on recent experimental progress in the fabrication of
arrays of interacting micro-cavities and on their coupling to atomic-like
structures in several different physical architectures, we review proposals on
the realisation of paradigmatic many-body models in such systems, such as the
Bose-Hubbard and the anisotropic Heisenberg models. Such arrays of coupled
cavities offer interesting properties as simulators of quantum many-body
physics, including the full addressability of individual sites and the
accessibility of inhomogeneous models.
