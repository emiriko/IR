We investigate amplitude and phase control of the components of the spinor
order parameter of a 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate. By modeling the interaction
of the multilevel atomic system with a pair of Raman-detuned laser pulses, we
show that it is possible to construct a pulse-sequence protocol for producing a
desired state change within a single Zeeman manifold. We present several
successful elementary tests of this protocol in both the F = 1 and F = 2 Zeeman
manifolds of 87Rb using the D1 transitions. We describe specific features of
the interaction which are important for multimode, spatially-varying field
configurations, including the role of state-dependent, light-induced
potentials.
