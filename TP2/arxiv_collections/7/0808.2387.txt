We present a numerical study of a two dimensional model of the Wess-Zumino
type. We formulate this model on a sphere, where the fields are expanded in
spherical harmonics. The sphere becomes fuzzy by a truncation in the angular
momenta. This leads to a finite set of degrees of freedom without explicitly
breaking the space symmetries. The corresponding field theory is expressed in
terms of a matrix model, which can be simulated. We present first numerical
results for the phase structure of a variant of this model on a fuzzy sphere.
The prospect to restore exact supersymmetry in certain limits is under
investigation.
