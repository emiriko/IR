Temperature and magnetic field dependences of the 19F nuclear spin-lattice
relaxation in a single crystal of LiYF4 doped with holmium are described by an
approach based on a detailed consideration of the magnetic dipole-dipole
interactions between nuclei and impurity paramagnetic ions and nuclear spin
diffusion processes. The observed non-exponential long time recovery of the
nuclear magnetization after saturation at intermediate temperatures is in
agreement with predictions of the spin-diffusion theory in a case of the
diffusion limited relaxation. At avoided level crossings in the spectrum of
electron-nuclear states of the Ho3+ ion, rates of nuclear spin-lattice
relaxation increase due to quasi-resonant energy exchange between nuclei and
paramagnetic ions, in contrast to the predominant role played by electronic
cross-relaxation processes in the low-frequency ac-susceptibility.
