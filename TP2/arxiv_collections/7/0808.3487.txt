We demonstrate that the discrete character of the vibrational spectrum of a
small crystal accounts for size dependence of its thermodynamic properties and
melting temperature. Using a self-consistent statistical method [Phys. Rev.B
66, 054302 (2002)] we derive the Gibbs free energy of free nanocrystalline
plates and calculate the thermodynamic parameters as functions of plate
thickness for Cu.
