We derive the fluctuating hydrodynamic equation for the number and momentum
densities exactly from the underdamped Langevin equation. This derivation is an
extension of the Kawasaki-Dean formula in underdamped case. The steady state
probability distribution of the number and momentum densities field can be
expressed by the kinetic and potential energies. In the massless limit, the
obtained fluctuating hydrodynamic equation reduces to the Kawasaki-Dean
equation. Moreover, the derived equation corresponds to the field equation
derived from the canonical equation when the friction coefficient is zero.
