We have studied the dissociation of heavy quarkonium states in a hot QCD
medium by investigating the medium modifications to a heavy quark potential.
Our model shows that in-medium modification causes the screening of the charge
in contrast to the screening of the range of the potential. We have then
employed the medium-modified potential to estimate the dissociation pattern of
the charmonium and bottomonium states and also explore how the pattern changes
as we go from the perturbative to nonperturbative domain in the Debye mass. The
results are in good agreement with the other current theoretical works both
from the spectral function analysis and the potential model study.
