Bayesian model averaging, model selection and its approximations such as BIC
are generally statistically consistent, but sometimes achieve slower rates og
convergence than other methods such as AIC and leave-one-out cross-validation.
On the other hand, these other methods can br inconsistent. We identify the
"catch-up phenomenon" as a novel explanation for the slow convergence of
Bayesian methods. Based on this analysis we define the switch distribution, a
modification of the Bayesian marginal distribution. We show that, under broad
conditions,model selection and prediction based on the switch distribution is
both consistent and achieves optimal convergence rates, thereby resolving the
AIC-BIC dilemma. The method is practical; we give an efficient implementation.
The switch distribution has a data compression interpretation, and can thus be
viewed as a "prequential" or MDL method; yet it is different from the MDL
methods that are usually considered in the literature. We compare the switch
distribution to Bayes factor model selection and leave-one-out
cross-validation.
