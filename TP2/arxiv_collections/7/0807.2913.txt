We study the $J/\psi\to \bar{p}\eta p$ and $J/\psi\to \bar{p}K^+\Lambda$
reactions with a unitary chiral approach. We find that the unitary chiral
approach, which generates the $N^*(1535)$ dynamically, can describe the data
reasonably well, particularly the ratio of the integrated cross sections. This
study provides further support for the unitary chiral description of the
$N^*(1535)$. We also discuss some subtle differences between the coupling
constants determined from the unitary chiral approach and those determined from
phenomenological studies.
