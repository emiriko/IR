The coordinate transformation method is applied to bounded domains to design
metamaterial devices for steering spatially confined electromagnetic fields.
Both waveguide and free-space beam applications are considered as these are
analogous within the present approach. In particular, we describe devices that
bend the propagation direction and squeeze confined electromagnetic fields. Two
approaches in non-magnetic realization of these structures are examined. The
first is based on using a reduced set of material parameters, and the second on
finding non-magnetic transformation media. It is shown that transverse-magnetic
fields can be bent or squeezed to an arbitrary extent and without reflection
using only dielectric structures.
