Compressed Counting (CC) was recently proposed for very efficiently computing
the (approximate) $\alpha$th frequency moments of data streams, where $0<\alpha
<= 2$. Several estimators were reported including the geometric mean estimator,
the harmonic mean estimator, the optimal power estimator, etc. The geometric
mean estimator is particularly interesting for theoretical purposes. For
example, when $\alpha -> 1$, the complexity of CC (using the geometric mean
estimator) is $O(1/\epsilon)$, breaking the well-known large-deviation bound
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$. The case $\alpha\approx 1$ has important applications, for
example, computing entropy of data streams.
  For practical purposes, this study proposes the optimal quantile estimator.
Compared with previous estimators, this estimator is computationally more
efficient and is also more accurate when $\alpha> 1$.
