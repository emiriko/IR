Structural approximations to positive, but not completely positive maps are
approximate physical realizations of these non-physical maps. They find
applications in the design of direct entanglement detection methods. We show
that many of these approximations, in the relevant case of optimal positive
maps, define an entanglement breaking channel and, consequently, can be
implemented via a measurement and state-preparation protocol. We also show how
our findings can be useful for the design of better and simpler direct
entanglement detection methods.
