We study the causal structure of dynamical charged black holes, with a
sufficient number of massless fields, using numerical simulations. Neglecting
Hawking radiation, the inner horizon is a null Cauchy horizon and a curvature
singularity due to mass inflation. When we include Hawking radiation, the inner
horizon becomes space-like and is separated from the Cauchy horizon, which is
parallel to the out-going null direction. Since a charged black hole must
eventually transit to a neutral black hole, we studied the neutralization of
the black hole and observed that the inner horizon evolves into a space-like
singularity, generating a Cauchy horizon which is parallel to the in-going null
direction. Since the mass function is finite around the inner horizon, the
inner horizon is regular and penetrable in a general relativistic sense.
However, since the curvature functions become trans-Planckian, we cannot
saymore about the region beyond the inner horizon, and it is natural to say
that there is a 'physical' space-like singularity. However, if we assume an
exponentially large number of massless scalar fields, our results can be
extended beyond the inner horizon. In this case, strong cosmic censorship and
black hole complementarity can be violated.
