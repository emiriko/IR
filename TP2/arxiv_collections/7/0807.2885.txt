We report a large, quasi-reversible tunnel magnetoresistance in
exchange-biased ferromagnetic semiconductor tunnel junctions wherein a soft
ferromagnetic semiconductor (\gma) is exchange coupled to a hard ferromagnetic
metal (MnAs). Our observations are consistent with the formation of a region of
inhomogeneous magnetization (an "exchange spring") within the biased \gma
layer. The distinctive tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance of \gma produces
a pronounced sensitivity of the magnetoresistance to the state of the exchange
spring.
