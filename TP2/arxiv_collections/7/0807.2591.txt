A Bragg resonator uses dielectric plates within a metallic cavity to confine
the energy within a central free space region. The importance of the
permittivity is shown with a better Q-factor possible using higher permittivity
materials of larger intrinsic dielectric losses. This is because the electric
energy in the reflectors decreases proportionally to the square root of
permittivity and the coupling to the metallic losses decrease linearly. In a
sapphire resonator with a single reflector pair a Q-factor of 2.34x10^5 is
obtained, which may be improved on by up to a factor of 2 using higher
permittivity materials.
