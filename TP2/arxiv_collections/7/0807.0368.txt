We study a simple class of orbifolds of the N=6 Chern-Simons Matter theory
proposed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena. They are considered as a
world volume theory of membranes probing C^4/ (Z_k x Z_n) and include a new
membrane theory with N=4 supersymmetries. We find that the moduli spaces of
them are consistent with the fact that they probe C^4/ (Z_k x Z_n).
