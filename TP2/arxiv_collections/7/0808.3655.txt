We investigate the entanglement properties of resonating valence bond states
on a two dimensional lattice in the presence of dopants that remove electrons
from the lattice creating "holes". The movement of the holes generated by the
Hubbard Hamiltonian in the regime of strong Coloumb repulsion in this setting
could be responsible for the phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity
as hypothesised by Anderson in Science {\bf 235}, 1196, (1987). We argue that
there is a particular density of dopants (holes) where the entanglement
contained in the lattice attains its maximal value for the nearest-neighbour
RVB liquid state.
