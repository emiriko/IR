Sex is considered as an evolutionary paradox, since its evolutionary
advantage does not necessarily overcome the two fold cost of sharing half of
one's offspring's genome with another member of the population. Here we
demonstrate that sexual reproduction can be evolutionary stable even when its
Darwinian fitness is twice as low when compared to the fitness of asexual
mutants. We also show that more than two sexes are always evolutionary
unstable. Our approach generalizes the evolutionary game theory to analyze
species whose members are able to sense the sexual state of their conspecifics
and to switch sexes consequently. The widespread emergence and maintenance of
sex follows therefore from its co-evolution with even more widespread
environmental sensing abilities.
