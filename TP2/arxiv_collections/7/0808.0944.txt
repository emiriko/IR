When used in quantum state estimation, projections onto mutually unbiased
bases have the ability to maximize information extraction per measurement and
to minimize redundancy. We present the first experimental demonstration of
quantum state tomography of two-qubit polarization states to take advantage of
mutually unbiased bases. We demonstrate improved state estimation as compared
to standard measurement strategies and discuss how this can be understood from
the structure of the measurements we use. We experimentally compared our method
to the standard state estimation method for three different states and observe
that the infidelity was up to 1.84+/-0.06 times lower using our technique than
it was using standard state estimation methods.
