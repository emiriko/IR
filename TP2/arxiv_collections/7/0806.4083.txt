We are concerned with the so-called Boussinesq equations with partial
viscosity. These equations consist of the ordinary incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations with a forcing term which is transported {\it with no dissipation} by
the velocity field. Such equations are simplified models for geophysics (in
which case the forcing term is proportional either to the temperature, or to
the salinity or to the density). In the present paper, we show that the
standard theorems for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations may be extended to
Boussinesq system despite the fact that there is no dissipation or decay at
large time for the forcing term. More precisely, we state the global existence
of finite energy weak solutions in any dimension, and global well-posedness in
dimension $N\geq3$ for small data. In the two-dimensional case, the finite
energy global solutions are shown to be unique for any data in $L^2(\R^2).$
