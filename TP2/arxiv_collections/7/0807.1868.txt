Quantum rings can be characterized by a specific radius and ring width. For
this rich class of physical systems, an accurate approximation for the
exchange-hole potential and thus for the exchange energy is derived from first
principles. Excellent agreement with the exact-exchange results is obtained
regardless of the ring parameters, total spin, current, or the external
magnetic field. The description can be applied as a density functional
outperforming the commonly used local-spin-density approximation, which is here
explicitly shown to break down in the quasi-one-dimensional limit. The
dimensional crossover, which is of extraordinary importance in low-dimensional
systems, is fully captured by our functional.
