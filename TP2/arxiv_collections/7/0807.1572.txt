The decoherence of two initially entangled qubits in a squeezed vacuum cavity
has been investigated exactly. The results show that, first, in principle, the
disentanglement time decreases with the increasing of squeeze parameter r, due
to the augmenting of average photon number of every mode in squeezed vacuum
cavity. Second, there are entanglement revivals after complete disentanglement
for the case of even parity initial Bell state, while there are entanglement
decrease and revival before complete disentanglement for the case of odd parity
initial Bell state. The results are quite different from that of the case for
qubits in a vacuum cavity.
