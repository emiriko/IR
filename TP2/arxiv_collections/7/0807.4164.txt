We propose a two-photon beating experiment based upon biphotons generated
from a resonant pumping two-level system operating in a backward geometry. On
the one hand, the linear optical-response leads biphotons produced from two
sidebands in the Mollow triplet to propagate with tunable refractive indices,
while the central-component propagates with unity refractive index. The
relative phase difference due to different refractive indices is analogous to
the pathway-length difference between long-long and short-short in the original
Franson interferometer. By subtracting the linear Rayleigh scattering of the
pump, the visibility in the center part of the two-photon beating interference
can be ideally manipulated among [0, 100%] by varying the pump power, the
material length, and the atomic density, which indicates a Bell-type inequality
violation. On the other hand, the proposed experiment may be an interesting way
of probing the quantum nature of the detection process. The interference will
disappear when the separation of the Mollow peaks approaches the fundamental
timescales for photon absorption in the detector.
