We have studied the total cross section, $Q^2$, momentum and angular
distributions for pions in the $\nu$($\bar \nu$) induced $\pi^0$ production
from nucleons. The calculations have been done for the weak production induced
by the neutral current in the standard model and the electromagnetic production
induced by neutrino magnetic moment. It has been found that with the present
experimental limits on the muon neutrino magnetic moment $\mu_{\nu_\mu}$, the
electromagnetic contribution to the cross section for the $\pi^0$ production is
small. The neutrino induced neutral current production of $\pi^{0}$, while
giving an alternative method to study the magnetic moment of neutrino
$\mu_{\nu_\mu}$, does not provide any improvement over the present experimental
limit on $\mu_{\nu_\mu}$ from the observation of this process in future
experiments at T2K and NO$\nu$A.
