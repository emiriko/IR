The suppression of flavor and CP violation in supersymmetric theories may be
due to the mechanism responsible for the structure of the Yukawa couplings. We
study model independently the compatibility between low energy flavor and CP
constraints and observability of superparticles at the LHC, assuming a generic
correlation between the Yukawa couplings and the supersymmetry breaking
parameters. We find that the superpotential operators that generate scalar
trilinear interactions are generically problematic. We discuss several ways in
which this tension is naturally avoided. In particular, we focus on several
frameworks in which the dangerous operators are naturally absent. These
frameworks can be combined with many theories of flavor, including those with
(flat or warped) extra dimensions, strong dynamics, or flavor symmetries. We
show that the resulting theories can avoid all the low energy constraints while
keeping the superparticles light. The intergenerational mass splittings among
the sfermions can reflect the structure of the underlying flavor theory, and
can be large enough to be measurable at the LHC. Detailed observations of the
superparticle spectrum may thus provide new handles on the origin of the flavor
structure of the standard model.
