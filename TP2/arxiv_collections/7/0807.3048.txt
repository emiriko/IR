The results of x-ray reflectivity studies of two oil/water (liquid/liquid)
interfaces are inconsistent with recent predictions of the presence of a
vapor-like depletion region at hydrophobic/aqueous interfaces. One of the oils,
perfluorohexane, is a fluorocarbon whose super-hydrophobic interface with water
provides a stringent test for the presence of a depletion layer. The other oil,
heptane, is a hydrocarbon and, therefore, is more relevant to the study of
biomolecular hydrophobicity. These results are consistent with the sub-angstrom
proximity of water to soft hydrophobic materials.
