A pure indirect control of quantum systems via quantum accessor is
investigated. In this control scheme, we do not apply any external classical
excitation fields on the controlled system and we control a quantum system via
a quantum accessor and classical control fields control the accessor only.
Complete controllability is investigated for arbitrary finite dimensional
quantum systems and exemplified by 2 and 3 dimensional systems. The scheme
exhibits some advantages; it uses less qubits in accessor and does not depend
on the energy-level structure of the controlled system.
