The phase diagram of QCD, as a function of temperature T and quark chemical
potential mu, may contain a critical point (mu_E,T_E) whose non-perturbative
nature makes it a natural object of lattice studies. However, the sign problem
prevents the application of standard Monte Carlo techniques at non-zero baryon
density. We have been pursuing an approach free of the sign problem, where the
chemical potential is taken as imaginary and the results are Taylor-expanded in
mu/T about mu=0, then analytically continued to real mu.
  Within this approach we have determined the sensitivity of the critical
chemical potential mu_E to the quark mass, d(\mu_E)^2/dm_q|_{\mu_E=0}. Our
study indicates that the critical point moves to {\em smaller} chemical
potential as the quark mass {\em increases}. This finding, contrary to common
wisdom, implies that the deconfinement crossover, which takes place in QCD at
mu=0 when the temperature is raised, will remain a crossover in the mu-region
where our Taylor expansion can be trusted. If this result, obtained on a coarse
lattice, is confirmed by simulations on finer lattices now in progress, then we
predict that no {\em chiral} critical point will be found for mu_B \lesssim 500
MeV, unless the phase diagram contains additional transitions.
