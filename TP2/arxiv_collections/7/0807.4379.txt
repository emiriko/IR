An extraction of the top mass from cross section measurements in the dilepton
and lepton+jets channels with an integrated luminosity of about 1fb-1 is given.
Two ways are presented : one based on the simple lecture of the graph of the
cross section as a function of the top mass and the other based on the use of
probability density functions. The final result is consistent with direct
measurements but with a greater uncertainty.
