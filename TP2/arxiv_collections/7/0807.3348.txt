We study, within the tight-binding approximation, the electronic properties
of a graphene bilayer in the presence of an external electric field applied
perpendicular to the system -- \emph{biased bilayer}. The effect of the
perpendicular electric field is included through a parallel plate capacitor
model, with screening correction at the Hartree level. The full tight-binding
description is compared with its 4-band and 2-band continuum approximations,
and the 4-band model is shown to be always a suitable approximation for the
conditions realized in experiments. The model is applied to real biased bilayer
devices, either made out of SiC or exfoliated graphene, and good agreement with
experimental results is found, indicating that the model is capturing the key
ingredients, and that a finite gap is effectively being controlled externally.
Analysis of experimental results regarding the electrical noise and cyclotron
resonance further suggests that the model can be seen as a good starting point
to understand the electronic properties of graphene bilayer. Also, we study the
effect of electron-hole asymmetry terms, as the second-nearest-neighbor hopping
energies $t'$ (in-plane) and $\gamma_{4}$ (inter-layer), and the on-site energy
$\Delta$.
