We find a two-parameter family of ordinary differential systems in dimension
five with the affine Weyl group symmetry of type $D_3^{(2)}$. We show its
symmetry and holomorphy conditions. This is the second example which gave
higher order Painlev\'e type systems of type $D_{3}^{(2)}$. By obtaining its
first integrals of polynomial type, we can obtain a two-parameter family of
coupled Hamiltonian systems in dimension four with the polynomial Hamiltonian.
