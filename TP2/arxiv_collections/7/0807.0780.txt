Signaling events in eukaryotic cells are often guided by a scaffolding
protein. Scaffold proteins assemble multiple proteins in a spatially localized
signaling complex and exert numerous physical effects on signaling pathways. To
study these effects, we consider a minimal, three-state kinetic model of
scaffold mediated kinase activation. We first introduce and apply a path
summation technique to obtain approximate solutions to a single molecule master
equation that governs protein kinase activation. We then consider exact
numerical solutions. We comment on when this approximation is appropriate and
then use this analysis to illustrate the competition of processes occurring at
many time scales involved in signal transduction in the presence of a scaffold
protein. The findings are consistent with recent experiments and simulation
data. Our results provide a framework and offer a mechanism for understanding
how scaffold proteins can influence the shape of the waiting time distribution
of kinase activation and effectively broaden the times over which protein
kinases are activated in the course of cell signaling.
