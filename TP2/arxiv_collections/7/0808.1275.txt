We discuss a prescription to construct fractional branes in Landau-Ginzburg
orbifolds, with particular attention to the case of non-abelian orbifolds. We
analyze in detail a S_3 orbifold and a D_n orbifold and show how the
computation of the spectrum can be carried out explicitly even when the
factorizations involve higher rank matrices.
