We propose a strictly local quantum tomography protocol for a bipartite
system. We show that the joint density matrix of an arbitrary two-mode Gaussian
state, entangled or not, is obtained via local operations and classical
communication only. In contrast to previous proposals, simultaneous homodyne
measurements (HM) on both modes are replaced by local homodyne detections and a
set of local projective measurements.
