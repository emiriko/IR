Motivated by the recent contradiction of the superconducting pairing symmetry
in the angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) and the nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) data in the FeAs superconductors, we present the theoretical
results on the phase diagram, the temperature dependent Fermi surfaces in
normal state, the ARPES character of quasiparticles and the spin-lattice
relaxation 1/T$_{1}$ of the two-orbital t-t$^{'}$-J-J$^{'}$ models. Our results
show that most of the properties observed in iron-based superconductors could
be comprehensively understood in the present scenario qualitatively, indicating
that the pairing symmetry of the ironpnictides is anisotropic nodeless s-wave,
mainly originating from the band structures and the Fermi surface topology.
