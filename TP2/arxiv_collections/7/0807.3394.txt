The time evolution of a charged point particle is governed by a second-order
integro-differential equation that exhibits advanced effects, in which the
particle responds to an external force before the force is applied. In this
paper we give a simple physical argument that clarifies the origin and physical
meaning of these advanced effects, and we compare ordinary electrodynamics with
a toy model of electrodynamics in which advanced effects do not occur.
