Simple constructions and protocols are demonstrated to allow the
implementation of universal quantum computation on an arbitrarily large quantum
system by controlling a fixed number of spins, vastly reducing the engineering
requirements in comparison to a direct implementation of the circuit model.
Analytic pulse sequences are derived for deterministic gate operation and
system cooling which only require pulse strengths that are comparable to the
intrinsic Hamiltonian of the system.
