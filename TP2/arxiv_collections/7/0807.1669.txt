In this article we present a method for formally proving the correctness of
the lazy algorithms for computing homographic and quadratic transformations --
of which field operations are special cases-- on a representation of real
numbers by coinductive streams. The algorithms work on coinductive stream of
M\"{o}bius maps and form the basis of the Edalat--Potts exact real arithmetic.
We use the machinery of the Coq proof assistant for the coinductive types to
present the formalisation. The formalised algorithms are only partially
productive, i.e., they do not output provably infinite streams for all possible
inputs. We show how to deal with this partiality in the presence of syntactic
restrictions posed by the constructive type theory of Coq. Furthermore we show
that the type theoretic techniques that we develop are compatible with the
semantics of the algorithms as continuous maps on real numbers. The resulting
Coq formalisation is available for public download.
