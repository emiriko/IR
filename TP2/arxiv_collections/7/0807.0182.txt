Let $M$ be a closed surface. By $\Homeo(M)$ we denote the group of
orientation preserving homeomorphisms of $M$ and let $\MC(M)$ denote the
Mapping class group. In this paper we complete the proof of the conjecture of
Thurston that says that for any closed surface $M$ of genus $\g \ge 2$, there
is no homomorphic section $\E:\MC(M) \to \Homeo(M)$ of the standard projection
map $\Proj:\Homeo(M) \to \MC(M)$.
