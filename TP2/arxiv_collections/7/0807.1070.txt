The authors review the evidence for the applicability of random--matrix
theory to nuclear spectra. In analogy to systems with few degrees of freedom,
one speaks of chaos (more accurately: quantum chaos) in nuclei whenever
random--matrix predictions are fulfilled. An introduction into the basic
concepts of random--matrix theory is followed by a survey over the extant
experimental information on spectral fluctuations, including a discussion of
the violation of a symmetry or invariance property. Chaos in nuclear models is
discussed for the spherical shell model, for the deformed shell model, and for
the interacting boson model. Evidence for chaos also comes from random--matrix
ensembles patterned after the shell model such as the embedded two--body
ensemble, the two--body random ensemble, and the constrained ensembles. All
this evidence points to the fact that chaos is a generic property of nuclear
spectra, except for the ground--state regions of strongly deformed nuclei.
