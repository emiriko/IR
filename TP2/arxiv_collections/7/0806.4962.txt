In Evolutionary Dynamics the understanding of cooperative phenomena in
natural and social systems has been the subject of intense research during
decades. We focus attention here on the so-called "Lattice Reciprocity"
mechanisms that enhance evolutionary survival of the cooperative phenotype in
the Prisoner's Dilemma game when the population of darwinian replicators
interact through a fixed network of social contacts. Exact results on a "Dipole
Model" are presented, along with a mean-field analysis as well as results from
extensive numerical Monte Carlo simulations. The theoretical framework used is
that of standard Statistical Mechanics of macroscopic systems, but with no
energy considerations. We illustrate the power of this perspective on social
modeling, by consistently interpreting the onset of lattice reciprocity as a
thermodynamical phase transition that, moreover, cannot be captured by a purely
mean-field approach.
