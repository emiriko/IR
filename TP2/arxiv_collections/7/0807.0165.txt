The complex theoretical and experimental investigation of plasma kinetics of
the electric discharge in the mixture of air and ethanol-water vapors is
carried out. The discharge was burning in the cavity, formed by air jets
pumping between electrodes, placed in aqueous ethanol solution. It is found out
that the hydrogen yield from the discharge is maximal in the case when ethanol
and water in the solution are in equal amounts. It is shown that the hydrogen
production increases with the discharge power and reaches the saturation at
high value. The concentrations of the main stable gas-phase components,
measured experimentally and calculated numerically, agree well in the most
cases.
