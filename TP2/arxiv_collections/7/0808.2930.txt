We study a simple one-dimensional quantum system on a circle with n scale
free point interactions. The spectrum of this system is discrete and
expressible as a solution of an explicit secular equation. However, its
statistical properties are nontrivial. The level spacing distribution between
its neighboring odd and even levels displays a surprising agreement with the
prediction obtained for the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random matrices.
