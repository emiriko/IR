For the first time a fully self-consistent charge-exchange relativistic RPA
based on the relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) approach is established. The
self-consistency is verified by the so-called isobaric analog state (IAS)
check. The excitation properties and the non-energy weighted sum rules of two
important charge-exchange excitation modes, the Gamow-Teller resonance (GTR)
and the spin-dipole resonance (SDR), are well reproduced in the doubly magic
nuclei $^{48}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr and $^{208}$Pb without readjustment of the
particle-hole residual interaction. The dominant contribution of the exchange
diagrams is demonstrated.
