Plausible phenomenological consequences of the well-known Pisano-Pleitez-
Frampton 3-3-1 model - such as the neutrino masses - are analyzed within the
solution provided by the exact algebraical approach - proposed several years
ago by Cotaescu - for gauge models with high symmetries. We prove that a
suitable parametrisation in the Higgs sector and a redefinition of the three
scalar triplets involved therein can lead to realistic predictions for the
lepton mass spectrum, while a minimal number of coupling parameters are
employed in the Yukawa sector.
