In this contribution on the celebration of the 80th birthday anniversary of
Prof. Ricardo Ferreira, we present a brief survey on the magnetism of
quasi-one-dimensional compounds. This has been a research area of intense
activity particularly since the first experimental announcements of magnetism
in organic and organometallic polymers in the mid 80s. We review experimental
and theoretical achievements on the field, featuring chain systems of
correlated electrons in a special AB2 unit cell structure present in inorganic
and organic compounds.
