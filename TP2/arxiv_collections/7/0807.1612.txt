The KLOE experiment at the DA$\Phi$NE $\phi$-factory has performed a new
precise measurement of the pion form factor using Initial State Radiation
events, with photons emitted at small polar angle. Results based on an
integrated luminosity of 240 pb$^{-1}$ and extraction of the $\pi\pi$
contribution to $a_\mu$ in the mass range [0.35,0.95] GeV$^2$ are presented,
the systematic uncertainty is reduced with respect to the published KLOE
result.
