In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using coarse-grained models to
simulate the self-assembly of DNA nanostructures. We introduce a simple model
of DNA where each nucleotide is represented by two interaction sites
corresponding to the phosphate-sugar backbone and the base. Using this model,
we are able to simulate the self-assembly of both DNA duplexes and Holliday
junctions from single-stranded DNA. We find that assembly is most successful in
the temperature window below the melting temperatures of the target structure
and above the melting temperature of misbonded aggregates. Furthermore, in the
case of the Holliday junction, we show how a hierarchical assembly mechanism
reduces the possibility of becoming trapped in misbonded configurations. The
model is also able to reproduce the relative melting temperatures of different
structures accurately, and allows strand displacement to occur.
