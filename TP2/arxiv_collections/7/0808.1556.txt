We shortly describe recent progress in photon detectors combining bi-alkali
photocathodes and cascaded patterned gas-avalanche electron multipliers. It
permitted the development and the first feasibility demonstration of high-gain
gaseous photomultipliers sensitive in the visible spectral range, operated in
DC mode with single-photon sensitivity.
