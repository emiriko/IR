We derive a set of algorithms for simulating the diffusion-limited growth of
faceted crystals using local cellular automata. This technique has been shown
to work well in reproducing realistic crystal morphologies, and the present
work provides a more rigorous physical foundation that connects the numerical
code to the physics of attachment kinetics and diffusion dynamics. We then
apply these algorithms to examine a novel morphological transition in the
growth of thin plate-like crystals.
