Asymmetrical horizontal interdot coupling was demonstrated to exist in a
system of a single plane of self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots.
Photoluminescence excitation (PLE), second order photon correlation and optical
orientation were used as main experimental tools. Each individual absorbing dot
was identified by a sharp PLE resonance, assigned to neutral exciton
transition, while the corresponding emission contained several excitonic
transitions of different charge states in another single quantum dot different
from the absorbing one. Energy and spin transfer dynamics were studied. A high
efficiency of spin transfer was found from optical orientation in a vertical
magnetic field (70%) as well as without the magnetic field (40%), in spite of a
significant anisotropic exchange splitting of the absorbing dot. Coherent
mechanism of linear-to-circular polarization conversion was identified, with an
efficiency (43%) close to the theoretical limit of 50%.
