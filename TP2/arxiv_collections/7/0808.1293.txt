Through exact numerical diagonalization, the von Neumann entropy is
calculated for the Laughlin and Pfaffian quantum Hall states in rotating
interacting Bose gases at zero temperature in the lowest Landau level limit.
The particles comprising the states are indistinguishable, so the required
spatial bipartitioning is effected by tracing over a subset of single-particle
orbitals. The topological entropy is then extracted through a finite-size
scaling analysis. The results for the Laughlin and the Pfaffian states agree
with the expected values of $\ln\sqrt{2}$ and $\ln\sqrt{4}$, respectively.
