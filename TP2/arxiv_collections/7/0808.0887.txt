Let $f:X\to Y$ be a smooth morphism of complex analytic manifolds and let $F$
be an $\mathbb{R}$-constructible complex on $Y$. Let $\cal{M}$ be a coherent
$\shd_X$-module. We prove that the microsupport of the solution complex of
$\shm$ in the tempered holomorphic functions $t \shh \text{om} (f^{-1} F,
\sho_X)$, is contained in the 1-characteristic variety of $\cal{M}$ associated
to $f$, and that the microsupport of the solution complex in the tempered
microfunctions $t\mu hom(f^{-1}F, \sho_X)$ is contained in the
1-microcharacteristic variety of the microlocalized of $\shm$ along
$T^*Y\times_Y X$.
  This applies in particular to the complex of solutions of $\shm$ in the sheaf
of distributions holomorphic in the fibers of an arbitrary smooth morphism.
