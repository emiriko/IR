Under the emerging network coding paradigm, intermediate nodes in the network
are allowed not only to store and forward packets but also to process and mix
different data flows. We propose a low-complexity cryptographic scheme that
exploits the inherent security provided by random linear network coding and
offers the advantage of reduced overhead in comparison to traditional
end-to-end encryption of the entire data. Confidentiality is achieved by
protecting (or "locking") the source coefficients required to decode the
encoded data, without preventing intermediate nodes from running their standard
network coding operations. Our scheme can be easily combined with existing
techniques that counter active attacks.
