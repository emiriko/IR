Array restructuring operations obscure arrays. Our work aims on java source
code obfuscation containing arrays. Our main proposal is Classes with
restructured array members and obscured member methods for setting, getting
array elements and to get the length of arrays. The class method definition
codes are obscured through index transformation and constant hiding. The
instantiated objects of these classes are used for source code writing. A tool
named JDATATRANS is developed for generating classes and to the best of our
knowledge this is the first tool available for array restructuring, on java
source codes.
