Many cosmologists (myself included) have advocated volume weighting for the
cosmological measure problem, weighting spatial hypersurfaces by their volume.
However, this often leads to the Boltzmann brain problem, that almost all
observations would be by momentary Boltzmann brains that arise very briefly as
quantum fluctuations in the late universe when it has expanded to a huge size,
so that our observations (too ordered for Boltzmann brains) would be highly
atypical and unlikely. Here it is suggested that volume weighting may be a
mistake. Volume averaging is advocated as an alternative. One consequence may
be a loss of the argument that eternal inflation gives a nonzero probability
that our universe now has infinite volume.
