It is of high interest, in the context of Adiabatic Quantum Computation, to
better understand the complex dynamics of a quantum system subject to a
time-dependent Hamiltonian, when driven across a quantum phase transition. We
present here such a study in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with one
variable parameter. We first display numerical results on the dynamical
evolution across the LMG quantum phase transition, which clearly shows a
pronounced effect of the spectral avoided level crossings. We then derive a
phenomenological (classical) transition model, which already shows some
closeness to the numerical results. Finally, we show how a simplified quantum
transition model can be built which strongly improve the classical approach,
and shed light on the physical processes involved in the whole LMG quantum
evolution. From our results, we argue that the commonly used description in
term of Landau-Zener transitions is not appropriate for our model.
