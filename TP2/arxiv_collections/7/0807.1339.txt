The compressibility of solid helium (3He and 4He) in the hcp and fcc phases
has been studied by path-integral Monte Carlo. Simulations were carried out in
both canonical (NVT) and isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensembles at temperatures
between 10 and 300 K, showing consistent results in both ensembles. For
pressures between 4 and 10 GPa, the bulk modulus B is found to decrease by
about 10 %, when temperature increases from the low-temperature limit to the
melting temperature. The isotopic effect on the bulk modulus of helium crystals
has been quantified in a wide range of parameters. At 25 K and pressures on the
order of 1 GPa, the relative difference between 3He and 4He amounts to about 2
%. The thermal expansion has been also quantified from results obtained in both
NPT and NVT simulations.
