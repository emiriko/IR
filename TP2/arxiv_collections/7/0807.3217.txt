We argue that the existence of a new narrow (Gamma < 25 MeV) nucleon
resonance N*(1685) is strongly supported by recent data on eta photoproduction
off the nucleon. The resonance has much stronger photo-coupling to the neutron
than to the proton. This nucleon resonance is a good candidate for the
non-strange member of the exotic anti-decouplet of baryons -- the partner of
the pentaquark Theta+. All up to date known properties of new N*(1685) are
summarized.
