We have computed the spectrum emitted spontaneously by a quantum dot coupled
to an arbitrarily detuned single mode cavity, taking into account pure
dephasing processes. We show that if the emitter is incoherent, the cavity can
efficiently emit photons with its own spectral characteristics. This effect
opens unique opportunities for the development of devices exploiting both
cavity quantum electrodynamics effects and pure dephasing, such as wavelength
stabilized single photon sources robust against spectral diffusion.
