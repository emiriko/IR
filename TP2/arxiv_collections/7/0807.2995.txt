The chorionic plate (or "fetal surface") of the human placenta is drawn as
round, with the umbilical cord inserted roughly at the center, but variability
of this shape is common. The average shape of the chorionic plate has never
been established. The goal of this work is to measure the average shape in a
birth cohort.
