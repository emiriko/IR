We report time resolved measurements of spin relaxation in doped and undoped
InSb quantum wells using degenerate and two-color magneto-optical Kerr effect
techniques. We observed that the photo-excited spin dynamics are strongly
influenced by laser excitation fluence and the doping profile of the samples.
In the low fluence regime, an oscillatory pattern was observed at low
temperatures ($\leq$ 77 K) in the samples with an asymmetric doping profile
which might be attributed to the quasi-collision-free spin relaxation regime.
Our measurements also suggest the influence of the barrier materials
(Al$_{x}$In$_{1-x}$Sb) on the spin relaxation in these material systems.
