The effect of decoherence on the continuous-time quantum walk on the
hypercube is revisited. Previously, an exact solution was found for a
decoherence model that preserved the effective tensor-product form of the
dynamics. Here a new model is presented, inspired by perfect quantum state
transfer in qubit networks. A perturbative solution is found for the dynamics
of this model which is not of a tensor-product form. In contrast to previous
results, the hitting probability has a lower bound that is independent of the
hypercube dimension.
