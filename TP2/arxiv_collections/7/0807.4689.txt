First principles electronic structure calculations have been carried out on
ordered double perovskites Sr_2B'B"O_6 (for B' = Cr or Fe and B" 4d and 5d
transition metal elements) with increasing number of valence electrons at the
B-sites, and on Ba_2MnReO_6 as well as Ba_2FeMoO_6. The Curie temperatures are
estimated ab initio from the electronic structures obtained with the local
spin-density functional approximation, full-potential generalized gradient
approximation and/or the LDA+U method (U - Hubbard parameter). Frozen
spin-spirals are used to model the excited states needed to evaluate the
spherical approximation for the Curie temperatures. In cases, where the induced
moments on the oxygen was found to be large, the determination of the Curie
temperature is improved by additional exchange functions between the oxygen
atoms and between oxygen and B' and B" atoms.
  A pronounced systematics can be found among the experimental and/or
calculated Curie temperatures and the total valence electrons of the transition
metal elements.
