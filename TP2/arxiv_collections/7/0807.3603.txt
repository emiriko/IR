In this paper we show how Rank-Crank type PDE's (first found by Atkin and
Garvan) occur naturally in the framework of non-holomorphic Jacobiforms and
find an infinite family of such differential equations. As an application we
show an infinite family of congruences for odd Durfee symbols, a partition
statistic introduced by George Andrews.
