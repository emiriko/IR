In this work, we determine the effects of temperature on the magnetoplasmon
spectrum of an electrically modulated graphene monolayer as well as the
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The intra-Landau-band magnetoplasmon
spectrum within the Self Consistent Field (SCF) approach is investigated for
both the aforementioned systems. Results obtained not only exhibit Shubnikov-de
Hass (SdH) oscillations but also commensurability oscillations (Weiss
oscillations). These oscillations are periodic as a function of inverse
magnetic field. We find that both the magnetic oscillations, SdH and Weiss,
have a greater amplitude and are more robust against temperature in graphene
compared to conventional 2DEG. Furthermore, there is a $\pi$ phase shift
between the magnetoplasmon oscillations in the two systems which can be
attributed to Dirac electrons in graphene acquiring a Berry's phase as they
traverse a closed path in a magnetic field.
