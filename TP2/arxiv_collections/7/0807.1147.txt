Exciton effects are studied in single-wall boron-nitride nanotubes. The
Coulomb interaction dependence of the band gap, the optical gap, and the
binding energy of excitons are discussed. The optical gap of the (5,0) nanotube
is about 6eV at the onsite interaction U=2t with the hopping integral t=1.1eV.
The binding energy of the exciton is 0.50eV for these parameters. This energy
agrees well with that of other theoretical investigations. We find that the
energy gap and the binding energy are almost independent of the geometries of
nanotubes. This novel property is in contrast with that of the carbon nanotubes
which show metallic and semiconducting properties depending on the chiralities.
