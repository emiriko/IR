We present a class of composite Higgs models in which the particle that
regulates the top quark contribution to the Higgs potential is also a
weakly-interacting dark matter candidate. This color-neutral "dark top" is
related to the standard model top quark through a large global symmetry.
Because the same couplings that control the Higgs potential also determine
various dark matter cross sections, the dark top scenario is quite predictive
once the dark top mass and various quantum numbers are specified. We construct
two concrete examples of dark top models with plausible UV completions and
study their dark matter properties and LHC signatures.
