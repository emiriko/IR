We predict the existence of a new ferromagnetic shape memory alloy Ga_2MnNi
using density functional theory. The martensitic start temperature (T_M) is
found to be approximately proportional to the stabilization energy of the
martensitic phase (deltaE_tot) for different shape memory alloys. Experimental
studies performed to verify the theoretical results show that Ga_2MnNi is
ferromagnetic at room temperature and the T_M and T_C are 780K and 330K,
respectively. Both from theory and experiment, the martensitic transition is
found to be volume conserving that is indicative of shape memory behavior.
