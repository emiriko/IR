We investigate the noise properties of a superconducting single electron
transistor (SSET) coupled to an harmonically driven resonator. Using a Langevin
equation approach, we calculate the frequency spectrum of the SSET charge and
calculate its effect on the resonator field. We find that the heights of the
peaks in the frequency spectra depend sensitively on the amplitude of the
resonator oscillation and hence suggest that the heights of these peaks could
act as a sensitive signal for detecting the small changes in the amplitude of
the drive. The previously known results for the effective amplitude-dependent
damping and temperature provided by the SSET for the case of a low frequency
resonator are generalized for all resonator frequencies.
