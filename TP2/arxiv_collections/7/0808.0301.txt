These are some notes I wrote for the summer school "Symbolic dynamics and
homeomorphisms of the Cantor set" at the University of Copenhagen, 23 - 27 June
2008.
  The notes contain the definition of the C*-algebra associated to a shift
space and some basic facts about these. The notes furthermore contain a proof
of the fact that the C*-algebra associated to a shift space is a one-sided
conjugacy invariant, and a proof of the fact that the Morita equivalence class
of the C*-algebra associated to a shift space is a two-sided conjugacy and a
flow invariant. The notes also contain a section (without proofs) about the
K-theory of C*-algebras associated to shift spaces.
  The notes are written for people without a background in operator algebra and
contains a short appendix about C*-algebras, Morita equivalence and K-theory of
C*-algebras.
