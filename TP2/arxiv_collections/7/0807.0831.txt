We investigate the impact of the fourth generation quarks on production and
decays of the charged Higgs boson at CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with
triple $b$-tagging. The signal is the process $gg\to \bar{u_4}u_4$, followed by
$\bar{u_4}\to W^{-} \bar{b}$ and $u_4\to h^{+} b$ decays with subsequent
$h^{+}\to t \bar{b}$ and corresponding hermitic conjugates. It is shown that,
if $m_{u_{4}}= 400$ GeV, considered process will provide unique opportunity to
discover charged Higgs boson with mass range of 200 to 350 GeV at the first
years of the LHC run.
