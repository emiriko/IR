Here, we show that we control the crystal structure of indium phosphide (InP)
nanowires by impurity dopants. We have found that zinc decreases the activation
barrier for 2D nucleation growth of zinc-blende InP and therefore promotes the
InP nanowires to crystallise in the zinc blende, instead of the commonly found
wurtzite crystal structure. More importantly, we demonstrate that we can, by
controlling the crystal structure, induce twinning superlattices with
long-range order in InP nanowires. We can tune the spacing of the superlattices
by the wire diameter and the zinc concentration and present a model based on
the cross-sectional shape of the zinc-blende InP nanowires to quantitatively
explain the formation of the periodic twinning.
