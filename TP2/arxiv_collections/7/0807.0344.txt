Some recent advances in the theoretical description of the Nucleon
electromagnetic form factors, both in the space- and time-like regions, will be
briefly illustrated. In particular, both the present stage of the lattice
calculations and updated phenomenological approaches, like the ones based on
dispersion relations and on microscopical models, will be reported.
