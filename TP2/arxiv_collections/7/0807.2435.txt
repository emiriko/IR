Recently two hints for new physics have emerged: The B_s mixing phase phi_s
and the rate of D_s -> (mu,tau) nu exposing a discrepancy of \sim 3 sigma and
3.8 sigma deviation from the Standard Model respectively. Moreover the
difference of the CP asymmetries in B -> K pi between the charged and neutral
modes is at the 5.3 sigma level which is somewhat larger than expected. New
physics in phi_s or A_CP(B -> K pi) would be in contradiction with the minimal
flavour violation hypothesis. The latter has recently attracted attention
because of the absence of deviation in CP and flavour violation in the quark
sector.
