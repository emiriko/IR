We derive cosmological limits on two-component hot dark matter consisting of
neutrinos and axions. We restrict the large-scale structure data to the safely
linear regime, excluding the Lyman-alpha forest. We derive Bayesian credible
regions in the two-parameter space consisting of m_a and sum(m_nu).
Marginalizing over sum(m_nu) provides m_a<1.02 eV (95% CL). In the absence of
axions the same data and methods give sum(m_nu)< 0.63 eV (95% CL).
