We discuss the speed-error-heat triangle and related problems with rapidly
increasing energy dissipation and error rate during miniaturization. These and
the independently growing need of unconditional data security have provoked
non-conventional approaches in the physics of informatics. Noise-based
informatics is a potentially promising possibility which is the way how
biological brains process the information. Recently, it has been shown that
thermal noise and its electronically enhanced versions (Johnson-like noises)
can be utilized as information carrier with peculiar properties. Relevant
examples are Zero power (stealth) communication, Unconditionally secure
communication with Johnson(-like) noise and Kirchhoff loop and Noise-driven
computing. The zero power communication utilizes the equilibrium background
noise in the channel to transfer information. The unconditionally secure
communication is based on the properties of Johnson(-like) noise and those of a
simple Kirchhoff's loop. The scheme utilizes on the robustness of classical
information and the second law of thermodynamics. It uncovers active
eavesdropping within a single clock period (no error statistics is required)
and it is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack. Further
advantages of the scheme is that the circuitry can easily be integrated on
computer chips, unconditionally secure computer processors, memories and other
hardware can be realized.
