We develop the cluster self-consistent field method incorporating both
electronic and lattice degrees of freedom to study the origin of ferromagnetism
in Cs$_{2}$AgF$_{4}$. After self-consistently determining the harmonic and
anharmonic Jahn-Teller distortions, we show that the anharmonic distortion
stabilizes the staggered x$^{2}$-z$^{2}$/y$^{2}$-z$^{2}$ orbital and
ferromagnetic ground state, rather than the antiferromagnetic one. The
amplitudes of lattice distortions, Q$_{2}$ and Q$_{3}$, the magnetic coupling
strengthes, J$_{x,y}$, and the magnetic moment, are in good agreement with the
experimental observation.
