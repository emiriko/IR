We describe measurement-only topological quantum computation using both
projective and interferometrical measurement of topological charge. We
demonstrate how anyonic teleportation can be achieved using "forced
measurement" protocols for both types of measurement. Using this, it is shown
how topological charge measurements can be used to generate the braiding
transformations used in topological quantum computation, and hence that the
physical transportation of computational anyons is unnecessary. We give a
detailed discussion of the anyonics for implementation of topological quantum
computation (particularly, using the measurement-only approach) in fractional
quantum Hall systems.
