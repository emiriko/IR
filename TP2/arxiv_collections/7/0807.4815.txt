The effects of flavor mixing in electroweak baryogenesis is investigated in a
generalized semiclassical WKB approach. Through calculating the nonadiabatic
corrections to the particle currents it is shown that extra CP violation
sources arise from the off-diagonal part of the equation of motion of particles
moving inside the bubble wall. The numerical importance of the mixing-induced
source is discussed in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and compared
with the source term induced by semiclassical force.
