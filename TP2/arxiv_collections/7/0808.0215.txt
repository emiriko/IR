A new recipe for concealing objects from detection is suggested. Different
with traditional cloak which deflects light around the core of the cloak to
make the object inside invisible, our cloak guides the light to penetrate the
core of the cloak but without striking some region of the cloak shell - the so
called folded region. Full wave analytical calculation shows that this cloak
will lead to a scattering enhancement instead of scattering reduction in
contrast to the traditional cloak; the scattered field distribution can also be
changed as if the scatterer is moved from its original position. Such
interesting phenomenon indicates the proposed cloak can be used to disguise the
true information of the object, e.g. the position, the size, etc, and further
mislead the observer and avoid being detected.
