The mass of an electroweakly interacting neutrino consists of the electric
and weak parts responsible for the existence of its charge, charge radius, and
magnetic moment. Such connections explain the formation of paraneutrinos, for
example, at the polarized neutrino electroweak scattering by spinless nuclei.
We derive the structural equations that relate the self-components of mass to
charge, charge radius, and magnetic moment of each neutrino as a consequence of
unification of fermions of a definite flavor. They indicate the availability of
neutrino universality and require following its logic in a constancy law
dependence of the size implied from the multiplication of a weak mass of
neutrino by its electric mass. According to this principle, all Dirac neutrinos
of a vector nature, regardless of the difference in their masses, have the same
charge, an identical charge radius, as well as an equal magnetic moment.
Thereby, the possibility appears of establishing the laboratory limits of weak
masses of the investigated types of neutrinos. Finding estimates show clearly
that the earlier measured properties of these particles may testify in favor of
the unified mass structure of their interaction with any of the corresponding
types of gauge fields.
