We have proposed a novel model of general quantum, stochastic and chaotic
psychodynamics. The model is based on the previously developed Life-Space Foam
(LSF) framework to motivational and cognitive dynamics. The present model
extends the LSF-approach by incorporating chaotic and topological
non-equilibrium phase transitions. Such extended LSF-model is applied for
rigorous description of multi-agent joint action. The present model is related
to Haken-Kelso-Bunz model of self-organization in the human motor system
(including: multi-stability, phase transitions and hysteresis effects,
presenting a contrary view to the purely feedback driven neural systems), as
well as the entropy-approach to adaptation in human goal-directed motor
control.
