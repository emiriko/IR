A set of quantum states, dynamically related to the classical periodic orbits
of a chaotic map, is used as a basis in which the description of the
eigenstates of its quantum version is greatly simplified. This set can be
improved with the inclusion of short time propagation along the stable and
unstable manifolds of the periodic orbits resulting in a construction similar
to the scar functions of Vergini (Jour. Phys. A \textbf{33}, (2000) 4709). The
average participation ratio is used to quantify the quality of the basis.
