We study ep deep inelastic scattering and the inclusive production of prompt
photon within the framework of the quasi-multi-Regge-kinematic approach,
applying the quark Reggeization hypothesis. We describe structure functions F_2
and F_L supposing that a virtual photon scatters on a Reggeized quark from a
proton, via the effective gamma-Reggeon-quark vertex. It is shown that the main
mechanism of the inclusive prompt photon production in p \bar p collisions is
the fusion of a Reggeized quark and a Reggeized antiquark into a photon, via
the effective Regeon-Reggeon-gamma vertex. We describe the inclusive photon
transverse momentum spectra measured by the CDF and D0 Collaborations within
errors and without free parameters, using the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin unintegrated
quark and gluon distribution functions in a proton.
