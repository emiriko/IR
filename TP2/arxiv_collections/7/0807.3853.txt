We investigate the storage of light in atomic rubidium vapor using a
multilevel-tripod scheme. In the system, two collective dark polariton modes
exist, forming an effective spinor quasiparticle. Storage of light is performed
by dynamically reducing the optical group velocity to zero. After releasing the
stored pulse, a beating of the two reaccelerated optical modes is monitored.
The observed beating signal oscillates at an atomic transition frequency,
opening the way to novel quantum limited measurements of atomic resonance
frequencies and quantum switches.
