The phase parameters of matched-filtering searches for continuous
gravitational-wave signals are sky position, frequency and frequency
time-derivatives. The space of these parameters features strong global
correlations in the optimal detection statistic. For observation times smaller
than one year, the orbital motion of the Earth leads to a family of
global-correlation equations which describes the "global maximum structure" of
the detection statistic. The solution to each of these equations is a different
hypersurface in parameter space. The expected detection statistic is maximal at
the intersection of these hypersurfaces. The global maximum structure of the
detection statistic from stationary instrumental-noise artifacts is also
described by the global-correlation equations. This permits the construction of
a veto method which excludes false candidate events.
