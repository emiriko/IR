The existence of a monotonic distance dependent contact potential between two
plates in a Casimir experiment leads to an additional electrostatic force that
is significantly different from the case of a constant potential. Such a
varying potential can arise if there is a uniform gradient in the work function
or contact potential across a plate, as opposed to random microscopic
fluctuations associated with patch potentials. A procedure to compensate for
this force is described for the case of an experiment where the electrostatic
force is minimized at each measurement distance by applying a voltage between
the plates. It is noted that the minimizing voltage is not the contact
potential.
