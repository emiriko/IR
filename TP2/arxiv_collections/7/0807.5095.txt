We performed charge detection on a lateral triple quantum dot with star-like
geometry. The setup allows us to interpret the results in terms of two double
dots with one common dot. One double dot features weak tunnel coupling and can
be understood with atom-like electronic states, the other one is strongly
coupled forming molecule-like states. In nonlinear measurements we identified
patterns that can be analyzed in terms of the symmetry of tunneling rates.
Those patterns strongly depend on the strength of interdot tunnel coupling and
are completely different for atomic- or molecule-like coupled quantum dots
allowing the non-invasive detection of molecular bonds.
