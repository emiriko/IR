In this paper we propose a method for a quantitative estimation of the
decision maker's knowledge in the context of the Analytic Hierarchy Process
(AHP) in cases, where the judgment matrix is inconsistent. We show that the
matrix of deviation from the transitivity condition corresponds to the rate
matrix for transaction costs in the financial market. For the quantitative
estimation of the decision maker's professionalism, we apply the Ising model
and thermodynamics tools.
