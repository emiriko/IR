We propose a new class of atomic microwave clocks based on the hyperfine
transitions in the ground state of aluminum or gallium atoms trapped in optical
lattices. For these elements magic wavelengths exist at which both levels of
the hyperfine doublet are shifted at the same rate by the lattice laser field,
cancelling its effect on the clock transition. Our analysis of various
systematic effects shows that, while offering an improved control over
systematic errors, the accuracy of the proposed microwave clock is competitive
to that of the state-of-the-art primary frequency standard.
