The stability and causality of the Landau-Lifshitz theory and the
Israel-Stewart type causal dissipative hydrodynamics are discussed. We show
that the problem of acausality and instability are correlated in relativistic
dissipative hydrodynamics and instability is induced by acausality. We further
discuss the stability of the scaling solution. The scaling solution of the
causal dissipative hydrodynamics can be unstable against inhomogeneous
perturbations.
