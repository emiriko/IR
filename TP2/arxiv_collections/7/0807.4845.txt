To an electron moving in free space an electric field appears as a magnetic
field which interacts with and can reorient the electron spin. In semiconductor
quantum wells this spin-orbit interaction seems to offer the possibility of
gate-voltage control in spintronic devices but, as the electrons are subject to
both ion-core and macroscopic structural potentials, this over-simple picture
has lead to intense debate. For example, an externally applied field acting on
the envelope of the electron wavefunction determined by the macroscopic
potential, underestimates the experimentally observed spin-orbit field by many
orders of magnitude while the Ehrenfest theorem suggests that it should
actually be zero. Here we challenge, both experimentally and theoretically, the
widely held belief that any inversion asymmetry of the macroscopic potential,
not only electric field, will produce a significant spin-orbit field for
electrons. This conclusion has far-reaching consequences for the design of
spintronic devices while illuminating important fundamental physics.
