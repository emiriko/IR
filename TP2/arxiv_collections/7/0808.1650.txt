In this article an efficient method to calculate the matrix elements of
three-nucleon force is presented. The new method is improved version of
partial-wave decomposition presented in Few-Body Syst. 22 (1997) 107, which
simplifies expression to be evaluated and permits to reduce computational
effort as much as six times. Proposed method naturally applies to Faddeev-type
calculations but also can be used by any method relaying on partial-wave
decomposition.
