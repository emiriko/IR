We report progress in the development of a model-based hybrid probabilistic
approach to an on-board IVHM for solid rocket boosters (SRBs) that can
accommodate the abrupt changes of the model parameters in various nonlinear
dynamical off-nominal regimes. The work is related to the ORION mission
program. Specifically, a case breach fault for SRBs is considered that takes
into account burning a hole through the rocket case, as well as ablation of the
nozzle throat under the action of hot gas flow. A high-fidelity model (HFM) of
the fault is developed in FLUENT in cylindrical symmetry. The results of the
FLUENT simulations are shown to be in good agreement with quasi-stationary
approximation and analytical solution of a system of one-dimensional partial
differential equations (PDEs) for the gas flow in the combustion chamber and in
the hole through the rocket case.
