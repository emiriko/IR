A novel approach to solve the Faddeev equation for three-body scattering at
arbitrary energies is proposed. This approach disentangles the complicated
singularity structure of the free three-nucleon propagator leading to the
moving and logarithmic singularities in standard treatments. The Faddeev
equation is formulated in momentum space and directly solved in terms of
momentum vectors without employing a partial wave decomposition. In its
simplest form the Faddeev equation for identical bosons, which we are using, is
an integral equation in five variables, magnitudes of relative momenta and
angles. The singularities of the free propagator and the deuteron propagator
are now both simple poles in two different momentum variables, and thus can
both be integrated with standard techniques.
