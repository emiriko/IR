Studies of angular and time distributions and CP-violating observables in
$B_s\to J/\psi \phi$ decays yield a space of parameters which can be
considerably reduced if relative strong phases among different amplitudes are
specified. We show that the relations between $B_s \to J/\psi \phi$ and $B^0
\to J/\psi K^{*0}$ amplitudes given by flavor symmetry [actually U(3) rather
than SU(3)] are likely to be quite reliable, and hence the use of strong phases
from $B^0 \to J/\psi K^{*0}$ in the analysis of $B_s \to J/\psi\phi$ is
justified. We point out the potential advantage of using helicity angles over
transversity angles, and comment on a way to measure a sizable CP-violating
phase independent of strong phases.
