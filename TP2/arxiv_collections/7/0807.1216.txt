In biological systems, expression dynamics to shape a fitted phenotype for
function has evolved through mutations to genes, as observed in the evolution
of funnel landscape in protein. We study this evolutionary process with a
statistical-mechanical model of interacting spins, where the fitted phenotype
is represented by a configuration of a given set of "target spins" and
interaction matrix J among spins is genotype evolving over generations. The
expression dynamics is given by stochastic process with temperature T_S to
decrease energy for a given set of J. The evolution of J is also stochastic
with temperature T_J, following mutation in J and selection based on a fitness
given by configurations of the target spins. Below a certain temperature
T_S^{c2}, the highly adapted J evolves, whereasanother phase transition
characterised by frustration occurs at T_S^{c1}<T_S^{c2}. At temperature lower
than T_S^{c1}, the Hamiltonian exhibits a spin-glass like phase, where the
dynamics requires long time steps to produce the fitted phenotype, and the
fitness often decreases drastically by single mutation. In contrast, in the
intermediate temperature phase between T_S^{c1} and T_S^{c2}, the evolved
genotypes, that have no frustration around the target spins (we call "local
Mattis state"), give a funnel-like rapid expression dynamics and are robust to
mutation. These results imply that evolution under thermal noise beyond a
certain level leads to funnel dynamics and mutational robustness. We will
explain its mechanism with the statistical-mechanical method.
