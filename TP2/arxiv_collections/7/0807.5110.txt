We derive the criteria for the Thomas-Fermi regime of a dipolar Bose-Einstein
condensate in cigar, pancake and spherical geometries. This also naturally
gives the criteria for the mean-field one- and two-dimensional regimes. Our
predictions, including the Thomas-Fermi density profiles, are shown to be in
excellent agreement with numerical solutions. Importantly, the anisotropy of
the interactions has a profound effect on the Thomas-Fermi/low-dimensional
criteria.
