We study an approximation scheme based on a second quantization method for a
chemical master equation. Small systems, such as cells, could not be studied by
the traditional rate equation approach because fluctuation effects are very
large in such small systems. Although a Fokker-Planck equation obtained by the
system size expansion includes the fluctuation effects, it needs large
computational costs for complicated chemical reaction systems. In addition,
discrete characteristics of the original master equation are neglected in the
system size expansion scheme. It has been shown that the usage of the second
quantization description and a variational method achieves tremendous reduction
in the dimensionality of the master equation approximately, without loss of the
discrete characteristics. We here propose a new scheme for the choice of
variational functions, which is applicable to multivariate cases. It is
revealed that the new scheme gives better numerical results than old ones and
the computational cost increases only slightly.
