The effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the free-solution electrophoresis
of polyelectrolytes is investigated with coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations. By comparing the results to simulations with switched-off
hydrodynamic interactions, we demonstrate their importance in modelling the
experimentally observed behaviour. In order to quantify the hydrodynamic
interactions between the polyelectrolyte and the solution, we present a novel
way to estimate its effective charge. We obtain an effective friction that is
different from the hydrodynamic friction obtained from diffusion measurements.
This effective friction is used to explain the constant electrophoretic
mobility for longer chains. To further emphasize the importance of hydrodynamic
interactions, we apply the model to end-labeled free-solution electrophoresis.
