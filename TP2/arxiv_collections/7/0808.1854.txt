The combined HERA-I data set, of neutral and charged current inclusive
cross-sections for $e^+p$ and $e^-p$ scattering, is used as the sole input for
a next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD parton distribution function (PDF) fit. The
consistent treatment of systematic uncertainties in the joint data set ensures
that experimental uncertainties on the PDFs can be calculated without need for
an increased $\chi^2$ tolerance. This results in PDFs with greatly reduced
experimental uncertainties compared to the separate analyses of the ZEUS and H1
experiments. Model uncertainties, including those arising from parametrization
dependence, are also carefully considered. The resulting HERAPDFs have
impressive precision compared to the global fits.
