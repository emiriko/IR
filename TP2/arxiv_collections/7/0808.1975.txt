$N$-complexes have been argued recently to be algebraic structures relevant
to the description of higher spin gauge fields. $N$-complexes involve a linear
operator $d$ that fulfills $d^N = 0$ and that defines a generalized cohomology.
Some elementary properties of $N$-complexes and the evidence for their
relevance to the description of higher spin gauge fields are briefly reviewed.
