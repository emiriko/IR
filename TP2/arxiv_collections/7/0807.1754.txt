The original Dirac Equation is modified in the simplest imaginable and most
trivial manner to include a universal 4-Vector Cosmological Field term in the
space and time dimensions. This cosmological field leads to a modified Dirac
Equation capable of explaining why the Universe appears to be made up chiefly
of matter. It is seen that this 4-Vector Cosmological Field is actually a
particle field and this particle field can possibly be identified with the
darkmatter and darkenergy field. Further, this 4-Vector Cosmological Field is
seen to give spacetime the desired quantum mechanical properties of randomness.
Furthermore, it is seen that in the emergent Universe, the position coordinates
of a particle in space -- contrary to the widely accepted belief that the
position of a particle in space has no physical significance, we see that that
opposite is true - namely that the position of a particle has physical
significance. We further note that the 4-Vector Cosmological Field modification
to the Dirac Equation leads us to a vacuum model redolent but different from
that of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). This new vacuum model is without virtual
particles but darkparticles. We dare to make the suggestion that these
darkparticles may possibly explain the current mystery of what really is
darkmatter and darkenergy.
