Approximate Killing vector fields are expected to help define physically
meaningful spins for non-symmetric black holes in general relativity. However,
it is not obvious how such fields should be defined geometrically. This paper
relates a definition suggested recently by Cook and Whiting to an older
proposal by Matzner, which seems to have been overlooked in the recent
literature. It also describes how to calculate approximate Killing fields based
on these proposals using an efficient scheme that could be of immediate
practical use in numerical relativity.
