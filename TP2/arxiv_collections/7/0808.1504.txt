We review the collectivity and the suppression pattern of charmed mesons -
produced in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at SPS (158 AGeV) and
RHIC energies (21 ATeV) - in comparison to dynamical and thermal models. In
particular, we examine the charmonium `melting' and the `comover dissociation'
scenarios - implemented in a microscopic transport approach - in comparison to
the available data from the SPS and RHIC. The analysis shows that the dynamics
of c, c-bar quarks at RHIC are dominated by partonic or `pre-hadronic'
interactions in the strongly coupled plasma stage. Both the `charmonium
melting' and the hadronic `comover absorption and recreation model' are found,
however, to be compatible with the experimental observation at SPS energies;
the experimental ratio of Psi'/J/Psi versus centrality clearly favors the
`hadronic comover' scenario. We find that the collective flow of charm in the
purely hadronic Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD) transport appears compatible with
the data at SPS energies, but substantially underestimates the data at top RHIC
energies. Thus, the large elliptic flow v2 of D-mesons and the low R_AA(p_T) of
J/Psi seen experimentally have to be attributed to early interactions of
non-hadronic degrees of freedom. Simultaneously, we observe that non-hadronic
interactions are mandatory in order to describe the narrowing of the J/Psi
rapidity distribution from pp to central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC
energy. We demonstrate additionally that the strong quenching of low-pT J/Psi's
in central Au+Au collisions indicates that a large fraction of final J/Psi
mesons is created by a coalescence mechanism close to the phase boundary.
Throughout this review we, furthermore, provide predictions for charm
observables from Au+Au collisions at FAIR energies of 25-35 AGeV.
