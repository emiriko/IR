We introduce the notion of a {\it mock tridiagonal system}. This is a
generalization of a tridiagonal system in which the irreducibility assumption
is replaced by a certain non-vanishing condition. We show how mock tridiagonal
systems can be used to construct tridiagonal systems that meet certain
specifications. This paper is part of our ongoing project to classify the
tridiagonal systems up to isomorphism.
