Let f in Q[z] be a polynomial of degree d at least two. The associated
canonical height \hat{h}_f is a certain real-valued function on Q that returns
zero precisely at preperiodic rational points of f. Morton and Silverman
conjectured in 1994 that the number of such points is bounded above by a
constant depending only on d. A related conjecture claims that at
non-preperiodic rational points, \hat{h}_f is bounded below by a positive
constant (depending only on d) times some kind of height of f itself. In this
paper, we provide support for these conjectures in the case d=3 by computing
the set of small height points for several billion cubic polynomials.
