Local compositions and structures of Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O alloys have been
investigated by Raman and solid-state {67}Zn/{25}Mg nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopies, and by neutron pair-distribution-function (PDF) analyses.
The E2(low) and E2(high) Raman modes of Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O display Gaussian- and
Lorentzian-type profiles, respectively. At higher Mg substitutions, both modes
become broader, while their peak positions shift in opposite directions. The
evolution of Raman spectra from Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O solid solutions are discussed
in terms of lattice deformation associated with the distinct coordination
preferences of Zn and Mg. Solid-state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR studies
suggest that the local electronic environments of {67}Zn in ZnO are only weakly
modified by the 15% substitution of Mg for Zn. {25}Mg MAS spectra of
Zn_{0.85}Mg_{0.15}O show an unusual upfield shift, demonstrating the prominent
shielding ability of Zn in the nearby oxidic coordination sphere. Neutron PDF
analyses of Zn_{0.875}Mg_{0.125}O using a 2x2x1 supercell corresponding to
Zn_{7}MgO_{8} suggest that the mean local geometry of MgO_{4} fragments concurs
with previous density functional theory (DFT)-based structural relaxations of
hexagonal wurtzite MgO. MgO_{4} tetrahedra are markedly compressed along their
c-axes and are smaller in volume than ZnO_{4} units by ~6%. Mg atoms in
Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O have a shorter bond to the $c$-axial oxygen atom than to the
three lateral oxygen atoms, which is distinct from the coordination of Zn. The
precise structure, both local and average, of Zn_{0.875}Mg_{0.125}O obtained
from time-of-flight total neutron scattering supports the view that
Mg-substitution in ZnO results in increased total spontaneous polarization.
