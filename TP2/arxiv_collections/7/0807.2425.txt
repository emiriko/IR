In their recent work Cooper and Ponec [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2008, 10,
1319-1329] proposed a ``one-electron approximation to domain-averaged Fermi
hole (DAFH)" used in electronic population studies. The goal of this comment is
to note that the proposal had been already published within the framework of
domain-restricted reduced density matrices ($\mathrm{\Omega}$-RDM) and to show
that it cannot conceptually be considered as an approximation to DAFH as the
authors invoke.
