We study hyperbolic cohomology classes in the general context of simplicial
complexes and prove homological invariance statements for them. We relate the
existence of hyperbolic cohomology classes to the non-amenability of the
fundamental group. In degree two we clarify the relation between hyperbolic and
atoroidal classes, leading to an application to symplectically atoroidal
manifolds.
