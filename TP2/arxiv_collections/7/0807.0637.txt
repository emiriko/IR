We elaborate on the expansion of hypergeometric functions about rational
parameters, where we focus mainly on the integer and half-integer case. The
strategy and the basic steps of a recently developed algorithm for the
expansion about half-integer parameters are described. The algorithm is
implemented in the Mathematica package HypExp, by means of which we derive
(partially new) results of selected multi-loop Feynman diagrams. Moreover, we
give a new formulation of a conjecture in the context of a three-loop master
integral in HQET.
