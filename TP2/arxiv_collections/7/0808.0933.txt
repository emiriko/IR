Analyzing $\Upsilon(nS)$ decays acquired with the CLEO detector operating at
the CESR $e^+e^-$ collider, we measure for the first time the product branching
fractions ${\cal B}[\Upsilon(nS)\to\gamma\chi_{b}((n-1)P_J)] \times {\cal
B}[\chi_{b}(n-1)P_J)\to X_i]$ for $n=2$ and 3, where $X_i$ denotes, for each
$i$, one of the fourteen exclusive light-hadron final states for which we
observe significant signals in both $\chi_b(1P_J)$ and $\chi_b(2P_J)$ decays.
We also determine upper limits for the electric dipole (E1) transitions
$\Upsilon(3S) \to \gamma \chi_b(1P_J)$.
