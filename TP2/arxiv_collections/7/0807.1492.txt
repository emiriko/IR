We study the noncommutative scalar field theory in the presence of the
Wick-Voros product (or normally ordered product), a variant of the more studied
Moyal product. We discuss both the classical and the quantum field theory in
the quartic potential case, and calculate the Green's functions up to one loop,
for the two and four points cases.
