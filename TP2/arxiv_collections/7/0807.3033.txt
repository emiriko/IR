This review cover our current understanding of strongly coupled Quark-Gluon
Plasma (sQGP), especially theoretical progress in (i) explaining the RHIC data
by hydrodynamics, (ii) describing lattice data using electric-magnetic duality;
(iii) understanding of gauge-string duality known as AdS/CFT and its
application for "conformal" plasma. In view of interdisciplinary nature of the
subject, we include brief introduction into several topics "for pedestrians".
Some fundamental questions addressed are: Why is sQGP such a good liquid? What
is the nature of (de)confinement and what do we know about ''magnetic'' objects
creating it? Do they play any important role in sQGP physics? Can we understand
the AdS/CFT predictions, from the gauge theory side? Can they be tested
experimentally? Can AdS/CFT duality help us understand rapid
equilibration/entropy production? Can we work out a complete dynamical "gravity
dual" to heavy ion collisions?
