The current status of CARLOMAT, a program for automatic computation of the
lowest order cross sections of multiparticle reactions is described, the
results of comparisons with other multipurpose Monte Carlo programs are shown
and some new results on e+e- -> b anti-b b anti-b u anti-d d anti-u are
presented.
