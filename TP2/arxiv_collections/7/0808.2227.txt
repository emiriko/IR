The compound models of clutter statistics are found suitable to describe the
nonstationary nature of radar backscattering from high-resolution observations.
In this letter, we show that the properties of Mellin transform can be utilized
to generate higher order moments of simple and compound models of clutter
statistics in a compact manner.
