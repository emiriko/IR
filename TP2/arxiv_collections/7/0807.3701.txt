We report on automating the Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction which is a
general procedure to treat infrared divergences in real emission processes at
next-to-leading order in QCD. The automatization rests on three essential
steps: the creation of the dipole terms, the calculation of the color linked
squared Born matrix elements, and the evaluation of different helicity
amplitudes. The routines have been tested for a number of complex processes,
such as the real emission process gg --> t anti-t ggg.
