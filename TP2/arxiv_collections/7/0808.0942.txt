We present a microscopic derivation of the effect of current flow on a system
near a superconductor-metal quantum critical point. The model studied is a 2d
itinerant electron system where the electrons interact via an attractive
interaction and are coupled to an underlying normal metal substrate which
provides a source of dissipation, and also provides a source of inelastic
scattering that allows a nonequilibrium steady state to reach. A nonequilibrium
Keldysh action for the superconducting fluctuations on the normal side is
derived. Current flow, besides its minimal coupling to the order parameter is
found to give rise to two new effects. One is a source of noise that acts as an
effective temperature $T_{eff} = e E v_F \tau_{sc}$ where $E$ is the external
electric field, $v_F$ the Fermi velocity, and $\tau_{sc}$ is the escape time
into the normal metal substrate. Secondly current flow also produces a drift of
the order-parameter. Scaling equations for the superconducting gap and the
current are derived and are found to be consistent with previous
phenomenological treatments as long as a temperature $T \sim T_{eff}$ is
included. The current induced drift is found to produce additional corrections
to the scaling which are smaller by a factor of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{E_F
\tau_{sc}})$, $E_F$ being the Fermi energy.
