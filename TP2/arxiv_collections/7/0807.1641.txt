We find a canonical quantization of Courant algebroids over Veronese rings.
Part of our approach allows a semi-infinite cohomology interpretation, and the
latter can be used to define sheaves of chiral differential operators on some
homogeneous spaces including the space of pure spinors punctured at a point.
