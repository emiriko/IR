We study a system of one-dimensional (iso)spin-1/2 bosons in the regime of
strong repulsive interactions. We argue that the low-energy spectrum of the
system consists of acoustic density waves and the spin excitations described by
an effective ferromagnetic spin chain with a small exchange constant J. We use
this description to compute the dynamic spin structure factor and the spectral
functions of the system.
