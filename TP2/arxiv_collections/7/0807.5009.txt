The magnetization dynamics of a single domain ferromagnet in contact with a
thermal bath is studied by scattering theory. We recover the
Landau-Liftshitz-Gilbert equation and express the effective fields and Gilbert
damping tensor in terms of the scattering matrix. Dissipation of magnetic
energy equals energy current pumped out of the system by the time-dependent
magnetization, with separable spin-relaxation induced bulk and spin-pumping
generated interface contributions. In linear response, our scattering theory
for the Gilbert damping tensor is equivalent with the Kubo formalism.
