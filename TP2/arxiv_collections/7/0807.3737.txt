The 2008 discovery of superconducting ferropnictides with Tc~26K-56K
introduced a new family of materials into the category of high Tc
superconductors. The ongoing project of understanding the superconducting
mechanism and pairing symmetry has already revealed a complicated and often
contradictory underlying picture of the structural and magnetic properties.
There is an almost unprecedented sensitivity of the calculated magnetism and
Fermi surface to structural details that prohibits correspondence with
experiment. Furthermore, experimental probes of the order parameter symmetry
are in surprisingly strong disagreement, even considering the relative
immaturity of the field. Here we outline all of the various and seemingly
contradictory evidences, both theoretical and experimental, and show that they
can be rectified if the system is assumed to be highly magnetic with a spin
density wave that is well-defined but with magnetic twin and anti-phase
boundaries that are dynamic on the time-scale of experiments. Under this
assumption, we find that our calculations can accurately reproduce even very
fine details of the structure, and a natural explanation for the temperature
separation of structural and magnetic transitions is provided. Thus, our theory
restores agreement between experiment and theory in crucial areas, making
further cooperative progress possible on both fronts. We believe that
fluctuating magnetic domains will be an essential component of unravelling the
interplay between magnetic interactions and superconductivity in these newest
high Tc superconductors.
