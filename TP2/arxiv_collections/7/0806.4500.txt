Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>0, let m,r be
integers with m\ge1, r\ge0 and m\ge r and let S_0(2m,r) be the symplectic Schur
algebra over k as introduced by the first author. We introduce the symplectic
Schur functor, derive some basic properties of it and relate this to work of
Hartmann and Paget. We do the same for the orthogonal Schur algebra. We give a
modified Jantzen sum formula and a block result for the symplectic Schur
algebra under the assumption that r and the residue of 2m mod p are small
relative to p. From this we deduce a block result for the orthogonal Schur
algebra under similar assumptions. Finally, we deduce from the previous results
a new proof of the geometric description of the blocks of the Brauer algebra in
characteristic 0 as obtained by Cox, De Visscher and Martin.
