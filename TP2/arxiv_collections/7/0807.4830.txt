We show how to detect entangled, bound entangled, and separable bipartite
quantum states of arbitrary dimension and mixedness using geometric
entanglement witnesses. These witnesses are constructed using properties of the
Hilbert-Schmidt geometry and can be shifted along parameterized lines. The
involved conditions are simplified using Bloch decompositions of operators and
states. As an example we determine the three different types of states for a
family of two-qutrit states that is part of the "magic simplex", i.e. the set
of Bell-state mixtures of arbitrary dimension.
