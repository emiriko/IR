Nuclear reactions leading to formation of new superheavy elements and
isotopes are discussed in the paper. ``Cold'' and ``hot'' synthesis, fusion of
fission fragments, transfer reactions and reactions with radioactive ion beams
are analyzed along with their abilities and limitations. Several most promising
reactions are proposed for experimental study.
