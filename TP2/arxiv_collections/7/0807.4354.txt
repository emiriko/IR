We demonstrate that porous fibers have low effective material loss over an
extended frequency range, 4.5 times larger bandwidth than that can be achieved
in sub-wavelength solid core fibers. We also show that these new fibers can be
designed to have near zero dispersion for 0.5-1 THz resulting to overall less
terahertz signal degradation. In addition, it is demonstrated that the use of
asymmetrical sub-wavelength air-holes within the core leads to high
birefringence ~0.026. This opens up the potential for realization of novel
polarization preserving fibers in the terahertz regime.
