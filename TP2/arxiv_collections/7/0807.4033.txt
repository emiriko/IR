An atomic force microscope is used to structure a film of multilayer
graphene. The resistance of the sample was measured in-situ during
nanomachining a narrow trench. We found a reversible behavior in the electrical
resistance which we attribute to the movement of dislocations. After several
attempts also permanent changes are observed. Two theoretical approaches are
presented to approximate the measured resistance.
