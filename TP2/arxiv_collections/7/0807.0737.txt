Previously measured thermopower data of CeNiSn exhibit a significant sample
dependence and non-monotonous behavior in magnetic fields. In this paper we
demonstrate that the measured thermopower S(T) may contain a contribution from
the huge Nernst coefficient of the compound, even in moderate fields of 2 T. A
correction for this effect allows to determine the intrinsic field dependence
of S(T). The observed thermopower behavior can be understood from Zeeman
splitting of a V-shaped pseudogap in magnetic fields.
