We analyze the effect of time dependent external field on non-Markovian
migration described by the continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach. The
rigorous method of treating the problem is proposed which is based on the
Markovian representations of the CTRW approach and field modulation. The method
is applied to the case of subdiffusive migration in which the exact formulas
for the first and second moments of spatial distribution are derived. For
oscillating external field they predict unusual dependence of the first moment
on oscillation phase and anomalous field dependent contribution to
