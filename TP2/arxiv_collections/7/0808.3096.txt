Fragmentation of ground state ortho Positronium (Ps) in collision with Li ion
(Li+) is studied in the framework of post collisional Coulomb distorted eikonal
approximation (CDEA) for the target elastic case . The present model takes
account of the two center effect on the ejected e which is crucial for a proper
description of the projectile ionization involving an ionic target. Both the
fully differential (TDCS) and the doubly differential (DDCS) cross sections
(energy spectra) are investigated at intermediate and high incident energies. A
broad distinct Electron loss peak (ELP) centered around v_e ~ v_p is noted in
the e energy spectrum in contrast to the sharp ELP for a heavy projectile. Two
salient features are noted in the present study: i) the shift of the e DDCS
peak (summed over e+ angles) towards higher ejection energy with respect to
half the residual energy of the system, ii) comparison of the e& e+ energy
spectra reflect a strong e - e+ asymmetry with respect to the ratio v_e/v_p =1
>. Both these features could be attributed to the post collisional two center
effect on the e due to its parent nucleus (e+) and the screened target ion .
Two different wave functions of the Li ion are chosen in order to test the
sensitivity of the present results with respect to the choice of the wave
function.
