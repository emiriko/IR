In general the kernel of QCD's gap equation possesses a domain of analyticity
upon which the equation's solution at nonzero chemical potential is simply
obtained from the in-vacuum result through analytic continuation. On this
domain the single-quark number- and scalar-density distribution functions are
mu-independent. This is illustrated via two models for the gap equation's
kernel. The models are alike in concentrating support in the infrared. They
differ in the form of the vertex but qualitatively the results are largely
insensitive to the Ansatz. In vacuum both models realise chiral symmetry in the
Nambu-Goldstone mode and in the chiral limit, with increasing chemical
potential, exhibit a first-order chiral symmetry restoring transition at
mu~M(0), where M(p^2) is the dressed-quark mass function. There is evidence to
suggest that any associated deconfinement transition is coincident and also of
first-order.
