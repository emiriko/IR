Recently, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been used to
highlight an anomalously large band renormalization at high binding energies in
cuprate superconductors: the high energy 'waterfall' or high energy anomaly
(HEA). This paper demonstrates, using a combination of new ARPES measurements
and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, that the HEA is not simply the by-product
of matrix element effects, but rather represents a cross-over from a
quasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to valence
bands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen character, in
both hole- and electron-doped cuprates. While photoemission matrix elements
clearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band
dispersion, i.e. the 'waterfall'-like behavior, they provide an inadequate
description for the physics that underlies the strong band renormalization
giving rise to the HEA. Model calculations of the single-band Hubbard
Hamiltonian showcase the role played by correlations in the formation of the
HEA and uncover significant differences in the HEA energy scale for hole- and
electron-doped cuprates. In addition, this approach properly captures the
transfer of spectral weight accompanying both hole and electron doping in a
correlated material and provides a unifying description of the HEA across both
sides of the cuprate phase diagram.
