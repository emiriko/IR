This paper studies the effects of introducing altruistic agents into atomic
congestion games. Altruistic behavior is modeled by a trade-off between selfish
and social objectives. In particular, we assume agents optimize a linear
combination of personal delay of a strategy and the resulting increase in
social cost. Our model can be embedded in the framework of congestion games
with player-specific latency functions. Stable states are the Nash equilibria
of these games, and we examine their existence and the convergence of
sequential best-response dynamics. Previous work shows that for symmetric
singleton games with convex delays Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist. For
concave delay functions we observe that there are games without Nash equilibria
and provide a polynomial time algorithm to decide existence for symmetric
singleton games with arbitrary delay functions. Our algorithm can be extended
to compute best and worst Nash equilibria if they exist. For more general
congestion games existence becomes NP-hard to decide, even for symmetric
network games with quadratic delay functions. Perhaps surprisingly, if all
delay functions are linear, then there is always a Nash equilibrium in any
congestion game with altruists and any better-response dynamics converges. In
addition to these results for uncoordinated dynamics, we consider a scenario in
which a central altruistic institution can motivate agents to act
altruistically. We provide constructive and hardness results for finding the
minimum number of altruists to stabilize an optimal congestion profile and more
general mechanisms to incentivize agents to adopt favorable behavior.
