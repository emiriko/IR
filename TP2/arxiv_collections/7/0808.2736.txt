We present new simulation results for the specific heat in a classical model
of a binary mixture glass-former in two dimensions. We show that in addition to
the formerly observed specific heat peak there is a second peak at lower
temperatures which was not observable in earlier simulations. This is a
surprise, as most texts on the glass transition expect a single specific heat
peak. We explain the physics of the two specific heat peaks by the
micro-melting of two types of clusters. While this physics is easily
accessible, the consequences are that one should not expect any universality in
the temperature dependence of the specific heat in glass formers.
