The spatial extension and complexity of the eigenfunctions of an open
finite-size two-dimensional (2D) random system are systematically studied for a
random collection of systems ranging from weakly scattering to localized. The
eigenfunctions are obtained by introducing gain in the medium and pumping just
above threshold. All lasing modes are found to correspond to quasimodes of the
passive system, for all regimes of propagation. We demonstrate the existence of
multipeaked quasimodes or necklace states in 2D at the transition from
localized to diffusive, resulting from the coupling of localized states.
