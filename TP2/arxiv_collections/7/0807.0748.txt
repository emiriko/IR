A small fraction of phosphorus (up to 10 %) was incorporated in ferromagnetic
(Ga,Mn)As epilayers grown on a GaAs substrate. P incorporation allows reducing
the epitaxial strain or even change its sign, resulting in strong modifications
of the magnetic anisotropy. In particular a reorientation of the easy axis
toward the growth direction is observed for high P concentration. It offers an
interesting alternative to the metamorphic approach, in particular for
magnetization reversal experiments where epitaxial defects stongly affect the
domain wall propagation.
