$D^0$ oscillations, for which the $B$ factories have found strong evidence,
provide a new stage for our search for New Physics in heavy flavour dynamics.
While the theoretical verdict on the observed values of $x_D$ and $y_D$ is
ambiguous -- they could be fully generated by SM dynamics, yet could contain
also a sizable contribution from New Physics -- such oscillations can enhance
the observability of \cp violation driven by New Physics. After emphasizing the
unique role of charm among up-type quarks, I sketch the \cp phenomenology for
partial widths and final state distributions.
