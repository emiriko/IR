All the leading-twist parton distribution functions are calculated in a
spectator model of the nucleon, using scalar and axial-vector diquarks. Single
gluon rescattering is used to generate T-odd distribution functions. Different
choices for the diquark polarization states are considered, as well as a few
options for the form factor at the nucleon-quark-diquark vertex. The results
are listed in analytic form and interpreted in terms of light-cone wave
functions. The model parameters are fixed by reproducing the phenomenological
parametrization of unpolarized and helicity parton distributions at the lowest
available scale. Predictions for the other parton densities are given and,
whenever possible, compared with available phenomenological parametrizations.
