Linearization of coupled second order nonlinear ordinary differential
equations (SNODEs) is one of the open and challenging problems in the theory of
differential equations. In this paper we describe a simple and straightforward
method to derive linearizing transformations for a class of two coupled SNODEs.
Our procedure gives several new types of linearizing transformations of both
invertible and non-invertible kinds. In both the cases we provide algorithms to
derive the general solution of the given SNODE. We illustrate the theory with
potentially important examples.
