This proceedings paper from 2004 contains figures of discharges in different
gap lengths at the same potential that are not available elsewhere. The 2004
abstract: The evolution of streamers is known to depend on gas composition and
electrode geometry, on polarity and size of the voltage and also on the
electric circuit that produces the high voltage pulse. To characterize the
phenomena better and to compare with theory, a new larger experimental setup
with vacuum enclosure has been built. We here present first results in this
setup on positive streamers in air at fixed voltage and varying electrode
distance. While next to the emitting anode tip, a similar number of streamers
seems to emerge due to multiple branching, more streamers seem to survive over
a fixed distance, when the gap is shorter. When lowering the voltage, streamers
branch less at all distances from the anode tip or do not branch at all beyond
a certain distance.
