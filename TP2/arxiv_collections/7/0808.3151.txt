We compute the matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor between glueball
states and the vacuum in SU(3) lattice gauge theory and extrapolate them to the
continuum. These matrix elements may play an important phenomenological role in
identifying glue-rich mesons. Based on a relation derived long ago by the ITEP
group for J/psi radiative decays, the scalar matrix element leads to a
branching ratio for the glueball that is at least three times larger than the
experimentally observed branching ratio for the f_0 mesons above 1GeV. This
suggests that the glueball component must be diluted quite strongly among the
known scalar mesons. Finally we review the current best continuum determination
of the scalar and tensor glueball masses, the deconfining temperature, the
string tension and the Lambda parameter, all in units of the Sommer reference
scale, using calculations based on the Wilson action.
