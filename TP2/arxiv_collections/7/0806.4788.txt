We report an experimental realization of a narrow-band polarization-entangled
photon source with a linewidth of 9.6 MHz through cavity-enhanced spontaneous
parametric down-conversion. This linewidth is comparable to the typical
linewidth of atomic ensemble based quantum memories. Single-mode output is
realized by setting a reasonable cavity length difference between different
polarizations, using of temperature controlled etalons and actively stabilizing
the cavity. The entangled property is characterized with quantum state
tomography, giving a fidelity of 94% between our state and a maximally
entangled state. The coherence length is directly measured to be 32 m through
two-photon interference.
