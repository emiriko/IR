We have studied the structural and superconductivity properties of the
compound LaFeAsO0.9F0.1 under pressures up to 32GPa using synchrotron radiation
and diamond anvil cells. We obtain an ambient pressure bulk modulus K_0 =
78(2)GPa, compressibility comparable to some cuprates. At high pressures, the
sample is in the overdoped region, with a linear decrease with pressure
variation of the superconducting transition temperature.
