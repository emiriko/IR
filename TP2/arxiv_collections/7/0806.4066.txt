Atomic scale computer simulations on structures and photo induced volume
changes of flatly and obliquely deposited amorphous selenium films have been
carried out in order to understand how the properties of chalcogenide glasses
are influenced by their preparation method. Obliquely deposited a-Se thin films
contain more coordination defects, larger voids than the flatly deposited ones.
To model the photo induced volume changes the electron excitation and hole
creation were treated independently within the framework of tight-binding
formalism. Covalent and interchain bond breakings and formations were found.
The obliquely deposited samples containing voids showed a wide spectrum of
photo induced structural changes in microscopic and volume changes in
macroscopic levels.
