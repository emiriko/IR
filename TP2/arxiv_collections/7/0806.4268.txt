We start by remarks on the scientific and societal context of today's
theoretical physics. Major classes of models for physics to be explored at the
LHC are then reviewed. This leads us to propose an LHC timeline and a list of
potential effects on theoretical physics and the society. We then explore three
conceptual questions connected with the LHC physics: symmetry (and symmetry
breaking), effective field theory, and fine tuning.
