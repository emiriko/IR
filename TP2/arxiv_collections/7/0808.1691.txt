Central diffractive production of heavy states (massive dijets, Higgs boson)
is studied in the exclusive mode using a new Hybrid Pomeron Model (HPM). Built
from Hybrid Pomerons defined by the combination of one hard and one soft color
exchanges, the model describes well the centrally produced diffractive dijet
data at the Tevatron. Predictions for the Higgs boson and dijet exclusive
production at the LHC are presented.
