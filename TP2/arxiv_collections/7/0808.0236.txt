This paper puts forward an interpretation of the Josephson effect based on
the Alternative Theory of Superconductivity (ATS). A comparison of ATS- and
BCS-based interpretations is provided. It is demonstrated that the ATS-based
interpretation, unlike that based on BCS theory, does not require a revision of
fundamentals of quantum physics.
