Transverse momentum distributions in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions
carry considerable information about the dynamics of the hot system produced.
Direct comparison with the same spectra from $p+p$ collisions has proven
invaluable to identify novel features associated with the larger system, in
particular, the "jet quenching" at high momentum and apparently much stronger
collective flow dominating the spectral shape at low momentum. We point out
possible hazards of ignoring conservation laws in the comparison of high- and
low-multiplicity final states. We argue that the effects of energy and momentum
conservation actually dominate many of the observed systematics, and that $p+p$
collisions may be much more similar to heavy ion collisions than generally
thought.
