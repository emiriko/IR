We propose a three dimensional non-supersymmetric theory that is conformal in
the large N limit. In a certain well defined bosonic sub-sector of gauge
invariant operators, this theory is planar equivalent to the theory recently
proposed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena as the theory on multiple
M2 branes at an orbifold singularity. We discuss the realization of the theory
on a brane configuration of type 0B string theory. Moreover, we propose an 11D
gravity dual, obtained by a projection of M-theory on AdS4 x S7 / Z_k.
