We give a quantum benchmark for teleportation and quantum storage experiments
suited for pure and mixed test states. The benchmark is based on the average
fidelity over a family of phase-covariant states and certifies that an
experiment can not be emulated by a classical setup, i.e., by a
measure-and-prepare scheme. We give an analytical solution for qubits, which
shows important differences with standard state estimation approach, and
compute the value of the benchmark for coherent and squeezed states, both pure
and mixed.
