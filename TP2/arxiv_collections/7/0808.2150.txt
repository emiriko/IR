An exact renormalization group for theories of a scalar chiral superfield is
formulated, directly in four dimensional Euclidean space. By constructing a
projector which isolates the superpotential from the full Wilsonian effective
action, it is shown that the nonperturbative nonrenormalization theorem
follows, quite simply, from the flow equation. Next, it is argued that there do
not exist any physically acceptable non-trivial fixed points. Finally, the
Wess-Zumino model is considered, as a low energy effective theory. Following an
evaluation of the one and two loop beta-function coefficients, to illustrate
the ease of use of the formalism, it is shown that the beta-function in the
massless case does not receive any nonperturbative power corrections.
