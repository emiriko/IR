We propose a new interpretation of the BFSS large N matrix quantum mechanics
analogous to a novel interpretation of the IKKT matrix model where infinitely
large N matrices act as differential operators in a curved space. In this
picture, the Schr\"odinger equation in the BFSS model is regarded as the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation which determines the wave function of universe. An
explicit solution of wave function is studied in a simple two-dimensional
minisuperspace model.
