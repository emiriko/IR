We consider ramifications of the use of high speed light modulators to
questions of correlation and measurement of time-energy entangled photons.
Using phase modulators, we find that temporal modulation of one photon of an
entangled pair, as measured by correlation in the frequency domain, may be
negated or enhanced by modulation of the second photon. Using amplitude
modulators we describe a Fourier technique for measurement of biphoton wave
functions with slow detectors.
