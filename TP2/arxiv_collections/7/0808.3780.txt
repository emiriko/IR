We demonstrate that it is possible to realize vortex ice states that are
analogous to square and kagome ice. With numerical simulations, we show that
the system can be brought into a state that obeys either global or local ice
rules by applying an external current according to an annealing protocol. We
explore the breakdown of the ice rules due to disorder in the nanostructure
array and show that in square ice, topological defects appear along grain
boundaries, while in kagome ice, individual defects appear. We argue that the
vortex system offers significant advantages over other artificial ice systems.
