We describe a search for Z boson pair production in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=
1.96 TeV with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider using a data
sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb^-1. Using the final
state decay ZZ to llvv (where l = e or mu) we measure a signal with a 2.6
standard deviations significance (2.0 expected) and measure a cross section of
sigma(pp to ZZ + X) = 2.01 +- 0.93 (stat.) +- 0.29 (sys.) pb.
