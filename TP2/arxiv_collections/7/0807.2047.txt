The goal of this paper is to estimate directly the rotation and translation
between two stereoscopic images with the help of five homologous points. The
methodology presented does not mix the rotation and translation parameters,
which is comparably an important advantage over the methods using the
well-known essential matrix. This results in correct behavior and accuracy for
situations otherwise known as quite unfavorable, such as planar scenes, or
panoramic sets of images (with a null base length), while providing quite
comparable results for more "standard" cases. The resolution of the algebraic
polynomials resulting from the modeling of the coplanarity constraint is made
with the help of powerful algebraic solver tools (the Groebner bases and the
Rational Univariate Representation).
