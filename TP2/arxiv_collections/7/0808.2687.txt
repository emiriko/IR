We report the experimental demonstration of a quantum memory for collective
atomic states in a far-detuned optical dipole trap. Generation of the
collective atomic state is heralded by the detection of a Raman scattered
photon and accompanied by storage in the ensemble of atoms. The optical dipole
trap provides confinement for the atoms during the quantum storage while
retaining the atomic coherence. We probe the quantum storage by
cross-correlation of the photon pair arising from the Raman scattering and the
retrieval of the atomic state stored in the memory. Non-classical correlations
are observed for storage times up to 60 microseconds.
