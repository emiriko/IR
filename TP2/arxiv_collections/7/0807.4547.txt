We introduce the quantum theoretical formulation to determine a posteriori,
if existing, the quantum wave functions and to estimate the quantum
interference effects of mental states. Such quantum features are actually found
in the case of an experiment involving the perception and the cognition in
humans. Also some specific psychological variables are introduced and it is
obtained that they characterize in a stringent manner the quantum behaviour of
mind during such performed experiment.
