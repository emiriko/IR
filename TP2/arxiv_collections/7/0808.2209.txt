Collections of micrometer sized solid particles immersed in plamsa are used
to mimic many systems from solid state and fluid physics, due to their strong
electrostatic interaction, their large inertia, and the fact that they are
large enough to be visualized with ordinary optics. On Earth, gravity restricts
the so called dusty plasma systems to thin, two-dimensional layers, unless
special experimental geometries are used, involving heated or cooled electrons,
and/or the use of dielectric materials.In micro-gravity experiments, the
formation of a dust-free void breaks the isotropy of three-dimensional dusty
plasma systems. In order to do real three-dimensional experiments, this void
has somehow to be closed. In this paper, we use a fully self-consistent fluid
model to study the closure of a void in a micro-gravity experiment, by lowering
the driving potential. The analysis goes beyond the simple description of the
virtual void, which describes the formation of a void without taking the dust
into account. We show that self-organization plays an important role in void
formation and void closure, which also allows a reversed scheme, where a
discharge is run at low driving potentials and small batches of dust are added.
No hysteresis is found this way. Finally, we compare our results to recent
experiments and find good agreement,but only when we do not take
charge-exchange collisions into account.
