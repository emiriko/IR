Motivated by a physical interpretation of its correlation functions as
membrane scattering amplitudes, we re-address whether the Lorentzian BLG theory
can be quantized such that it preserves SO(8) superconformal symmetry. We find
that this appears to be possible. While the model seems to adequately reproduce
protected quantities such as chiral primary amplitudes and the four derivative
effective action, we conclude that, as understood at present, it gives a
relatively unpractical parametrization of the IR dynamics of M2-branes.
