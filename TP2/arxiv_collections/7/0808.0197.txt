Here we report the synthesis and basic characterization of SmFe1-xCoxAsO
(x=0.10, 0.15). The parent compound SmFeAsO itself is not superconducting but
shows an antiferromagnetic order near 150 K, which must be suppressed by doping
before superconductivity emerges. With Co-doping in the FeAs planes,
antiferromagnetic order is destroyed and superconductivity occurs at 15 K.
Similar to LaFe1-xCoxAsO, the SmFe1-xCoxAsO system appears to tolerate
considerable disorder in the FeAs planes. This result is important, which
indicates difference between cuprare superconductors and the iron-based
arsenide ones.
