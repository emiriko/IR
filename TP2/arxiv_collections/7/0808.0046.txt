We initiate the representation theory of restricted Lie superalgebras over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic p>2. A superalgebra generalization
of the celebrated Kac-Weisfeiler Conjecture is formulated, which exhibits a
mixture of p-power and 2-power divisibilities of dimensions of modules. We
establish the Conjecture for basic classical Lie superalgebras.
