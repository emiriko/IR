In classical mechanics the complexity of a dynamical system is characterized
by the rate of local exponential instability which effaces the memory of
initial conditions and leads to practical irreversibility. In striking
contrast, quantum mechanics appears to exhibit strong memory of the initial
state. Here we introduce a notion of complexity for a quantum system and relate
it to its stability and reversibility properties.
