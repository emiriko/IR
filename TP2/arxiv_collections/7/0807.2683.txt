We construct a lattice model for two-dimensional N=(2,2) supersymmetric QCD
(SQCD), with the matter multiplets belonging to the fundamental or
anti-fundamental representation of the gauge group U(N) or SU(N). The
construction is based on the topological field theory (twisted supercharge)
formulation and exactly preserves one supercharge along the line of the papers
[1]--[4] for pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. In order to avoid the
species doublers of the matter multiplets, we introduce the Wilson terms and
the model is defined for the case of the number of the fundamental matters
(n_{+}) equal to that of the anti-fundamental matters (n_{-}). If some of the
matter multiplets decouple from the theory by sending the corresponding
anti-holomorphic twisted masses to the infinity, we can analyze the general
n_{+}\neq n_{-} case, although the lattice model is defined for n_{+} =n_{-}.
By computing the anomaly of the U(1)_A R-symmetry in the lattice perturbation,
we see that the decoupling is achieved and the anomaly for n_{+}\neq n_{-} is
correctly obtained.
