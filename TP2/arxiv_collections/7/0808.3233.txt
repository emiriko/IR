The standard topological censorship theorems require asymptotic hypotheses
which are too restrictive for several situations of interest. In this paper we
prove a version of topological censorship under significantly weaker
conditions, compatible e.g. with solutions with Kaluza-Klein asymptotic
behavior. In particular we prove simple connectedness of the quotient of the
domain of outer communications by the group of symmetries for models which are
asymptotically flat, or asymptotically anti-de Sitter, in a Kaluza-Klein sense.
This allows one, e.g., to define the twist potentials needed for the reduction
of the field equations in uniqueness theorems. Finally, the methods used to
prove the above are used to show that weakly trapped compact surfaces cannot be
seen from Scri.
