Lawson has shown that one can obtain sensible wave functions even in the weak
deformation limit of the Nilsson model as long as one projects out states of
good total angular momentum. We apply this method to obtain wave functions and
magnetic $g$ factors of excited states of select even-even Ar isotopes.
