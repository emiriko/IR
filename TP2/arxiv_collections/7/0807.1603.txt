In contrast with most internet topology measurement research, our concern
here is not to obtain a map as complete and precise as possible of the whole
internet. Instead, we claim that each machine's view of this topology, which we
call ego-centered view, is an object worth of study in itself. We design and
implement an ego-centered measurement tool, and perform radar-like measurements
consisting of repeated measurements of such views of the internet topology. We
conduct long-term (several weeks) and high-speed (one round every few minutes)
measurements of this kind from more than one hundred monitors, and we provide
the obtained data. We also show that these data may be used to detect events in
the dynamics of internet topology.
