Based on quantum-kinetic equations, coupled spin-charge drift-diffusion
equations are derived for a two-dimensional electron gas on a cylindrical
surface. Besides the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, the elastic
scattering on impurities, and a constant electric field are taken into account.
  From the solution of the drift-diffusion equations, a long-lived spin
excitation is identified for spins coupled to the Rashba term on a cylinder
with a given radius. The electric-field driven weakly damped spin waves are
manifest in the components of the magnetization and have the potential for
non-ballistic spin-device applications.
