The recent observation of an electronic cluster glass state composed of
random domains with unidirectional modulation of charge density and/or spin
density on Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} reinvigorates the debate of
existence of competing interactions and their importance in high temperature
superconductivity. By using a variational approach, here we show that the
presence of the cluster glass state is actually an inherent nature of the model
based on the antiferromagnetic interaction (J) only, i.e. the well known t-J
model. There is no need yet to introduce a competing interaction to understand
the existence of the cluster glass state. The long-range pairing correlation is
not much influenced by the disorder in the glass state which also has nodes and
linear density of states. In the antinodal region, the spectral weight is
almost completely suppressed. The modulation also produces subgap structures
inside the "coherent" peaks of the local density of states.
