A system consisting of two parallel coupled channels where particles in one
of them follow the rules of totally asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP) and
in another one move as in symmetric simple exclusion processes (SSEP) is
investigated theoretically. Particles interact with each other via hard-core
exclusion potential, and in the asymmetric channel they can only hop in one
direction, while on the symmetric lattice particles jump in both directions
with equal probabilities. Inter-channel transitions are also allowed at every
site of both lattices. Stationary state properties of the system are solved
exactly in the limit of strong couplings between the channels. It is shown that
strong symmetric couplings between totally asymmetric and symmetric channels
lead to an effective partially asymmetric simple exclusion process (PASEP) and
properties of both channels become almost identical. However, strong asymmetric
couplings between symmetric and asymmetric channels yield an effective TASEP
with nonzero particle flux in the asymmetric channel and zero flux on the
symmetric lattice. For intermediate strength of couplings between the lattices
a vertical cluster mean-field method is developed. This approximate approach
treats exactly particle dynamics during the vertical transitions between the
channels and it neglects the correlations along the channels. Our calculations
show that in all cases there are three stationary phases defined by particle
dynamics at entrances, at exits or in the bulk of the system, while phase
boundaries depend on the strength and symmetry of couplings between the
channels. Extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations strongly support our
theoretical predictions.
