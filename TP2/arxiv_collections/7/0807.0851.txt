New generation dark matter experiments aim at exploring the 10e-9 - 10e-10 pb
cross-section region for the WIMP-nucleon scalar interactions. Neutrons
produced in the detector components are one of the main factors that can limit
detector sensitivity. Estimation of the background from this source then
becomes a crucial task for designing future large-scale detectors. Energy
spectra and production rates for neutrons coming from radioactive contamination
are required for all materials in and around the detector. In order to estimate
neutron yields and spectra, the cross-sections of (a,n) reactions and
probabilities of transitions to different excited states should be known.
Cross-sections and transition probabilities have been calculated using
Empire2.19 for several isotopes, and for some isotopes, a comparison with the
experimental data is shown. The results have been used to calculate the neutron
spectra from materials using the code Sources4A. Neutron background event rates
from some detector components in a hypothetical dark matter detector based on
Ge crystals have been estimated. Some requirements for the radiopurity of the
materials have been deduced from the results of these simulations.
