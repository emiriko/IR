Nonlinear magnetotransport of a microwave-irradiated high mobility
two-dimensional electron system under a finite direct current excitation is
analyzed using a dc-controlled scheme with photon-assisted transition
mechanism. The predicted amplitudes, extrema and nodes of the oscillatory
differential resistance versus the magnetic field and the current density, are
in excellent agreement with the recent experimental observation [Hatke et al.
Phys. Rev. B 77, 201304(R) (2008)].
