We describe in detail how to perform universal fault-tolerant quantum
computation on a 2-D color code, making use of only nearest neighbor
interactions. Three defects (holes) in the code are used to represent logical
qubits. Triple defect logical qubits are deformed into isolated triangular
sections of color code to enable transversal implementation of all single
logical qubit Clifford group gates. CNOT is implemented between pairs of triple
defect logical qubits via braiding.
