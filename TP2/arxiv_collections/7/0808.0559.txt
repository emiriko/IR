We have performed high resolution angle resolved photoemission (ARPES)
studies on electron doped cuprate superconductors Sm2-xCexCuO4 (x=0.10, 0.15,
0.18), Nd2-xCexCuO4 (x=0.15) and Eu2-xCexCuO4 (x=0.15). Imaginary parts of the
electron removal self energy show step-like features due to an electron-bosonic
mode coupling. The step-like feature is seen along both nodal and anti-nodal
directions but at energies of 50 and 70 meV, respectively, independent of the
doping and rare earth element. Such energy scales can be understood as being
due to preferential coupling to half- and full-breathing mode phonons,
revealing the phononic origin of the kink structures. Estimated electron-phonon
coupling constant lambda from the self energy is roughly independent of the
doping and momentum. The isotropic nature of lambda is discussed in comparison
with the hole doped case where a strong anisotropy exists.
