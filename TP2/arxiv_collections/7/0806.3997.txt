We study the interaction between several fields initially in coherent states.
The solution allows us to explain why coherent states remain coherent states
when subject to non-Markovian dissipation. We first study the interaction
between two fields and show that this is the building block of the total
interaction. We give a completely algebraic solution of this system.
