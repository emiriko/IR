The gravitational description given for an electric on the basis of exact
solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations eliminates Coulomb divergence. The
internal pulsating semiconfined world formed by neutral dust is smoothly joined
with parallel Reissner-Nordstrem vacuum worlds via two static bottlenecks. The
charge, rest mass, and electric field are expressed in terms of the space
curvatures. The internal and external parameters of the maximon, electron, and
the universe form a power series.
