By treating the electron-ion interaction as perturbation in the
first-principles Hamiltonian, we have calculated the density response functions
of a fluid alkali metal to find an interesting charge instability due to
anomalous electronic density fluctuations occurring at some finite wave vector
${\bi Q}$ in a dilute fluid phase above the liquid-gas critical point. Since
$|{\bi Q}|$ is smaller than the diameter of the Fermi surface, this instability
necessarily impedes the electric conduction, implying its close relevance to
the metal-insulator transition in fluid alkali metals.
