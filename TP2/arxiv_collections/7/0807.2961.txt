We completely describe a new domain for abstract interpretation of numerical
programs. Fixpoint iteration in this domain is proved to converge to finite
precise invariants for (at least) the class of stable linear recursive filters
of any order. Good evidence shows it behaves well also for some non-linear
schemes. The result, and the structure of the domain, rely on an interesting
interplay between order and topology.
