We report pressure-induced superconductivity in a single crystal of CaFe2As2.
At atmospheric pressure, this material is antiferromagnetic below 170 K but
under an applied pressure of 0.69 GPa becomes superconducting, with a
transition temperature Tc exceeding 10 K. The rate of Tc suppression with
applied magnetic field is -0.7 K/T, giving an extrapolated zero-temperature
upper critical field of 10-14T.
