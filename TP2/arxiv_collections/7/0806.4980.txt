We study theoretically the simultaneous effect of a regular and a random
pinning potentials on the vortex lattice structure at filling factor of 1. This
structure is determined by a competition between the square symmetry of regular
pinning array, by the intervortex interaction favoring a triangular symmetry,
and by the randomness trying to depin vortices from their regular positions.
Both analytical and molecular-dynamics approaches are used. We construct a
phase diagram of the system in the plane of regular and random pinning
strengths and determine typical vortex lattice defects appearing in the system
due to the disorder. We find that the total disordering of the vortex lattice
can occur either in one step or in two steps. For instance, in the limit of
weak pinning, a square lattice of pinned vortices is destroyed in two steps.
First, elastic chains of depinned vortices appear in the film; but the vortex
lattice as a whole remains still pinned by the underlying square array of
regular pinning sites. These chains are composed into fractal-like structures.
In a second step, domains of totally depinned vortices are generated and the
vortex lattice depins from regular array.
