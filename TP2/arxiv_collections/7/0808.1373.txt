We derive an approximate expression for the Gilbert damping coefficient
\alpha_G of itinerant electron ferromagnets which is based on their description
in terms of spin-density-functional-theory (SDFT) and Kohn-Sham quasiparticle
orbitals. We argue for an expression in which the coupling of magnetization
fluctuations to particle-hole transitions is weighted by the spin-dependent
part of the theory's exchange-correlation potential, a quantity which has large
spatial variations on an atomic length scale. Our SDFT result for \alpha_G is
closely related to the previously proposed spin-torque correlation-function
expression.
