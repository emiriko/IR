Selfsimilar space-time fractal fluctuations are generic to dynamical systems
in nature such as atmospheric flows, heartbeat patterns, population dynamics,
etc. The physics of the long-range correlations intrinsic to fractal
fluctuations is not yet identified. It is important to quantify the physics
underlying the irregular fractal fluctuations for predictability studies. A
general systems theory for fractals visualizes the emergence of successively
larger scale fluctuations to result from the space-time integration of enclosed
smaller scale fluctuations. The model predictions are as follows. The
probability distribution and the power spectrum for fractal fluctuations is the
same inverse power law function incorporating the golden mean. The predicted
distribution is close to the Gaussian distribution for small-scale fluctuations
but exhibits fat long tail for large-scale fluctuations with higher probability
of occurrence than predicted by Gaussian distribution. Since the power
(variance i.e. square of eddy amplitude) spectrum also represents the
probability densities as in the case of quantum systems such as the electron or
photon, fractal fluctuations exhibit quantumlike chaos. The fine structure
constant for spectrum of fractal fluctuations is a function of the golden mean
and is analogous to atomic spectra equal to about 1/137. Global gridded time
series data sets of monthly mean temperatures for the period 1880 - 2007/2008
are analysed to show that data sets and corresponding power spectra exhibit
distributions close to the model predicted inverse power law distribution. The
model predicted and observed universal spectrum for interannual variability
rules out linear secular trends in global monthly mean temperatures. Global
warming results in intensification of fluctuations of all scales and manifested
immediately in high frequency fluctuations.
