Longitudinal broadening along $\Delta\eta$ direction on near side in
two-dimensional ($\Delta\phi \times \Delta\eta$) di-hadron correlation
distribution has been studied for central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =
200 GeV, within a dynamical multi-phase transport model. It was found that the
longitudinal broadening is generated by a longitudinal flow induced by strong
parton cascade in central Au+Au collisions, in comparison with p+p collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The longitudinal broadening may shed light on the
information about strongly interacting partonic matter at RHIC.
