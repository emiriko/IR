Results are presented from four CDF analyses involving heavy quark production
in proton-antiproton collisions at center of mass energy 1.96 TeV. The shapes
of b-jets are found to be broader than inclusive predictions and broader than
both PYTHIA and HERWIG defaults. A measurement of the production cross section
for psi(2S) is consistent with Run 1 results and with theoretical predictions
associated with parton distribution function energy dependence. The inclusive
b-jet production cross section is also consistent with theoretical predictions
over six orders of magnitude. The b-bbar differential production cross section
is compared to several theoretical models and found to be best described by
MC@NLO + JIMMY.
