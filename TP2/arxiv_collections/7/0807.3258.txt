The universal properties and structure of halo nuclei composed of two
neutrons (2n) and a core are investigated within an effective quantum mechanics
framework. We construct an effective interaction potential that exploits the
separation of scales in halo nuclei and treat the nucleus as an effective
three-body system. The uncertainty from higher orders in the expansion is
quantified through theoretical error bands. First, we investigate the
possibility to observe excited Efimov states in 2n halo nuclei. Based on the
experimental data, 20C is the only halo nucleus candidate to possibly have an
Efimov excited state, with an energy less than 7 keV below the scattering
threshold. Second, we study the structure of 20C and other 2n halo nuclei. In
particular, we calculate their matter form factors, radii, and two-neutron
opening angles.
