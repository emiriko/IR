A recently introduced thermodynamic model of amphiphilic molecules in
solution has yielded, under certain realistic conditions, a significant
presence of metastable aggregates well below the critical micelle concentration
-- a phenomenon that has been reported also experimentally. The theory is
extended in two directions pertaining to the experimental and technological
relevance of such premicellar aggregates. (a) Combining the thermodynamic model
with reaction rate theory, we calculate the lifetime of the metastable
aggregates. (b) Aggregation number fluctuations are examined. We demonstrate
that, over most of the metastable concentration range, the premicellar
aggregates should have macroscopic lifetimes and small polydispersity.
