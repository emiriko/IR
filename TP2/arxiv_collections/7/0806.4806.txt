High resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements have been carried
out on (Sr,K)Fe$_2$As$_2$ superconductor (Tc=21 K). Three hole-like Fermi
surface sheets are clearly resolved for the first time around the Gamma point.
The overall electronic structure shows significant difference from the band
structure calculations. Qualitative agreement between the measured and
calculated band structure is realized by assuming a chemical potential shift of
-0.2 eV. The obvious band renormalization suggests the importance of electron
correlation in understanding the electronic structure of the Fe-based
compounds.
