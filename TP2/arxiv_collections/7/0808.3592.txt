We present an accurate quantum mechanical study of molecule-molecule
collisions in the presence of a magnetic field. The work focusses on the
analysis of elastic scattering and spin relaxation in collisions of
O2(3Sigma_g) molecules at cold (~0.1 K) and ultracold (~10^{-6} K)
temperatures. Our calculations show that magnetic spin relaxation in
molecule-molecule collisions is extremely efficient except at magnetic fields
below 1 mT. The rate constant for spin relaxation at T=0.1 K and a magnetic
field of 0.1 T is found to be as large as 6.1 x 10^{-11} cm3/s. The magnetic
field dependence of elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections at
ultracold temperatures is dominated by a manifold of Feshbach resonances with
the density of ~100 resonances per Tesla for collisions of molecules in the
absolute ground state. This suggests that the scattering length of ultracold
molecules in the absolute ground state can be effectively tuned in a very wide
range of magnetic fields. Our calculations demonstrate that the number and
properties of the magnetic Feshbach resonances are dramatically different for
molecules in the absolute ground and excited spin states. The density of
Feshbach resonances for molecule-molecule scattering in the low-field-seeking
Zeeman state is reduced by a factor of 10.
