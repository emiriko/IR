We consider complex projective space P^{n} and a smooth closed curve gamma in
P^{n}. Harvey and Lawson have defined the notion of the projective hull \hat{K}
of a compact subset K in P^n. This concept is an analogue of the polynomial
hull of compact subsets of C^{n}. In the present note we study the relation
between the following two properties of the curve gamma:
  (1) \hat{gamma} - gamma is a one-dimensional complex analytic subvariety of
  P^{n} - gamma, and
  (2) There exists a Stein subdomain of P^{n} which contains the projective
hull \hat{gamma} of gamma.
