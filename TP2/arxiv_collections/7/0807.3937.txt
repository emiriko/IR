An important aspect that must be considered when studying opinion formation
phenomena is the different social attitude of the agents taking part in the
process. Different kinds of interconnections and of interacting behaviours
should be associated to the agents depending on their opinion: radicals tend to
self-segregate but, on the other hand, have a stronger capacity to convince
neutral agents. Other important questions arise when the official media
strongly promotes one position. The different perception that each agent has of
the official information can lead, in case of monopolistic and aggressive
media, to a reaction effect in the population that starts to create massive
antagonist clusters.
