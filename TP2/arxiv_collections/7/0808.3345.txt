R. Hirota and K. Kimura discovered integrable discretizations of the Euler
and the Lagrange tops, given by birational maps. Their method is a
specialization to the integrable context of a general discretization scheme
introduced by W. Kahan and applicable to any vector field with a quadratic
dependence on phase variables. According to a proposal by T. Ratiu,
discretizations of the Hirota-Kimura type can be considered for numerous
integrable systems of classical mechanics. Due to a remarkable and not well
understood mechanism, such discretizations seem to inherit the integrability
for all algebraically completely integrable systems. We introduce an
experimental method for a rigorous study of integrability of such
discretizations. Application of this method to the Hirota-Kimura type
discretization of the Clebsch system leads to the discovery of four
functionally independent integrals of motion of this discrete time system,
which turn out to be much more complicated than the integrals of the continuous
time system. Further, we prove that every orbit of the discrete time Clebsch
system lies in an intersection of four quadrics in the six-dimensional phase
space. Analogous results hold for the Hirota-Kimura type discretizations for
all commuting flows of the Clebsch system, as well as for the $so(4)$ Euler
top.
