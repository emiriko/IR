Two-dimensional scattering by homogeneous and layered dielectric elliptical
cylinders is analyzed following an analytical approach using Mathieu functions.
Closed-form relations for the expansion coefficients of the resulting electric
field in the vicinity of the scatterer are provided. Numerical examples show
the focalizing effect of dielectric elliptical cylinders illuminated normally
to the axis. The influence of the confocal dielectric cover on the resulting
scattered field is envisaged.
