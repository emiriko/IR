he $\rho^0$ production at high-$p_T$ (5.0 $\leq p_T \leq$ 10.0 GeV/$c$)
measured in minimum bias $p+p$, Au+Au and central Au+Au collisions in the STAR
detector are presented. The $\rho^0/\pi$ ratio measured in $p+p$ is compared to
PYTHIA calculations as a test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD)
that describes reasonably well particle production from hard processes. The
$\rho^0$ nuclear modification factor are also presented. In $p+p$ collisions,
charged pions and (anti-)protons are measured in the range 5.0 $\leq p_T \leq$
15.0 GeV/$c$ and the anti-particle to particle ratio and the baryon to meson
ratios of these hadrons are discussed.
