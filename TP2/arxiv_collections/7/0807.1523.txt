The generating series of a radix-rational sequence is a rational formal power
series from formal language theory viewed through a fixed radix numeration
system. For each radix-rational sequence with complex values we provide an
asymptotic expansion for the sequence of its Ces\`aro means. The precision of
the asymptotic expansion depends on the joint spectral radius of the linear
representation of the sequence; the coefficients are obtained through some
dilation equations. The proofs are based on elementary linear algebra.
