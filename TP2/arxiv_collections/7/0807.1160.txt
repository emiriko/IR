A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server may be overloaded by
emergency-induced call volume, ``American Idol'' style flash crowd effects or
denial of service attacks. The SIP server overload problem is interesting
especially because the costs of serving or rejecting a SIP session can be
similar. For this reason, the built-in SIP overload control mechanism based on
generating rejection messages cannot prevent the server from entering
congestion collapse under heavy load. The SIP overload problem calls for a
pushback control solution in which the potentially overloaded receiving server
may notify its upstream sending servers to have them send only the amount of
load within the receiving server's processing capacity. The pushback framework
can be achieved by either a rate-based feedback or a window-based feedback. The
centerpiece of the feedback mechanism is the algorithm used to generate load
regulation information. We propose three new window-based feedback algorithms
and evaluate them together with two existing rate-based feedback algorithms. We
compare the different algorithms in terms of the number of tuning parameters
and performance under both steady and variable load. Furthermore, we identify
two categories of fairness requirements for SIP overload control, namely,
user-centric and provider-centric fairness. With the introduction of a new
double-feed SIP overload control architecture, we show how the algorithms can
meet those fairness criteria.
