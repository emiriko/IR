We analyze inelastic 2 to 2 scattering amplitudes for gauge bosons and
Nambu-Goldstone bosons in deconstructed Higgsless models. Using the (KK)
Equivalence Theorem in 4D (5D), we derive a set of general sum rules among the
boson masses and multi-boson couplings that are valid for arbitrary
deconstructed models. Taking the continuum limit, our results naturally include
the 5D Higgsless model sum rules for arbitrary 5D geometry and boundary
conditions; they also reduce to the elastic sum rules when applied to the
special case of elastic scattering. For the case of linear deconstructed
Higgsless models, we demonstrate that the sum rules can also be derived from a
set of general deconstruction identities and completeness relations. We apply
these sum rules to the deconstructed 3-site Higgsless model and its extensions;
we show that in 5D ignoring all higher KK modes (n>1) is inconsistent once the
inelastic channels become important. Finally, we discuss how our results
generalize beyond the case of linear Higgsless models.
