We study the Faltings height pairing of arithmetic Heegner divisors and CM
cycles on Shimura varieties associated to orthogonal groups. We compute the
Archimedian contribution to the height pairing and derive a conjecture relating
the total pairing to the central derivative of a Rankin L-function. We prove
the conjecture in certain cases where the Shimura variety has dimension 0, 1,
or 2. In particular, we obtain a new proof of the Gross-Zagier formula.
