The extension of the notion of quantum fidelity from the state-space level to
the operator one can be used to study environment-induced decoherence.
state-dependent operator fidelity sucepti- bility (OFS), the leading order term
for slightly different operator parameters, is shown to have a nontrivial
behavior when the environment is at critical points. Two different
contributions to OFS are identified which have distinct physical origins and
temporal dependence. Exact results for the finite-temperature decoherence
caused by a bath described by the Ising model in transverse field are obtained.
