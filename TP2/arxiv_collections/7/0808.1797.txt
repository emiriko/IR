The ratio of the semivertical cone angles of the quark and gluon jets
calculated in the statistical model is found to be in exact agreement with that
derived from QCD.In hadron production also,the model's prediction of the power
law type of behaviour for the inclusive distribtuion is strikingly close to the
the corresponding experimental findings;these spectacular results are
significant for the model to be realistic.
