Using the local density approximation and its combination with dynamical
mean-field theory, we show that electronic correlations induce a single-sheet,
cuprate-like Fermi surface for hole-doped 1/1 LaNiO3 /LaAlO3 heterostructures,
even though both eg orbitals contribute to it. The Ni 3d 3z^2-1 orbital plays
the role of the axial Cu 4s-like orbital in the cuprates. These two results
indicate that "orbital engineering" by means of heterostructuring should be
possible. As we also find strong antiferromagnetic correlations, the low-energy
electronic and spin excitations in nickelate heterostructures resemble those of
high-temperature cuprate superconductors.
