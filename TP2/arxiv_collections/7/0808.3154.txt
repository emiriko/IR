Second order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) at the complete basis
set (CBS) limit and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to examine
several low energy isomers of the water hexamer. Both approaches predict the
so-called "prism" to be the lowest energy isomer, followed by "cage", "book",
and "cyclic" isomers. The energies of the four isomers are very similar, all
being within 10-15 meV/H2O. This reference data is then used to evaluate the
performance of several density-functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation
(xc) functionals. A subset of the xc functionals tested for smaller water
clusters [I: Santra et al., J. Chem. Phys. 127, 184104 (2007)] has been
considered. Whilst certain functionals do a reasonable job at predicting the
absolute dissociation energies of the various isomers (coming within 10-20
meV/H2O), none predict the correct energetic ordering of the four isomers, nor
does any predict the correct low total energy isomer. All xc functionals tested
either predict the book or cyclic isomers to have the largest dissociation
energies. A many-body decomposition of the total interaction energies within
the hexamers leads to the conclusion that the failure lies in the poor
description of van der Waals (dispersion) forces in the xc functionals
considered. It is shown that the addition of an empirical pairwise (attractive)
C6/R6 correction to certain functionals allows for an improved energetic
ordering of the hexamers. The relevance of these results to density-functional
simulations of liquid water is also briefly discussed.
