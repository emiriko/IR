We present a detailed description of a zero temperature phase transition
between superconducting and diffusive metallic states in very thin wires due to
a Cooper pair breaking mechanism. The dissipative critical theory contains
current reducing fluctuations in the guise of both quantum and thermally
activated phase slips. A full cross-over phase diagram is computed via an
expansion in the inverse number of complex components of the superconducting
order parameter (one in the physical case). The fluctuation corrections to the
direct current electrical and thermal conductivities are determined, and we
find that the electrical conductivity has a non-monotonic temperature
dependence in the metallic phase which may be consistent with recent
experimental results on ultra-narrow wires. In the quantum critical regime, the
ratio of the thermal to electrical conductivity displays a linear temperature
dependence and thus the Wiedemann-Franz law is obeyed, with a new universal
experimentally verifiable Lorenz number.
