We study statistical properties of spatial distances between successive
earthquakes, the so-called hypocenter intervals, produced by a two-dimensional
(2D) Burridge-Knopoff model involving stick-slip behavior. It is found that
cumulative distributions of hypocenter intervals can be described by the
$q$-exponential distributions with $q<1$, which is also observed in nature. The
statistics depend on a friction and stiffness parameters characterizing the
model and a threshold of magnitude. The conjecture which states that $q_t+q_r
\sim 2$, where $q_t$ and $q_r$ are an entropy index of time intervals and
spatial intervals, respectively, can be reproduced semi-quantitatively. It is
concluded that we provide a new perspective on the Burridge-Knopoff model which
addresses that the model can be recognized as a realistic one in view of the
reproduction of the spatio-temporal interval statistics of earthquakes on the
basis of nonextensive statistical mechanics.
