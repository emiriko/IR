We revisit the effect of CP violating anomalous top-quark couplings in
$t\bar{t}$ production and decay. We consider $t\bar{t}$ production through
gluon fusion (and light $q{\bar q}$ annihilation) followed by top-quark decay
into $bW$ or $b\ell\nu$. We find explicit analytic expressions for all the
triple products generated by the anomalous couplings that fully incorporate all
spin correlations. Our results serve as a starting point for numerical
simulations for the LHC.
