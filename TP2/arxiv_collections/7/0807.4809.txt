This contribution briefly illustrates preliminary calculations of the
electromagnetic form factors of $^3$He and $^3$H, obtained within the
Light-front Relativistic Hamiltonian Dynamics, adopting i) a Poincar\'e
covariant current operator, without dynamical two-body currents, and ii)
realistic nuclear bound states with $S$, $P$ and $D$ waves. The kinematical
region of few $(GeV/c)^2$, relevant for forthcoming TJLAB experiments, has been
investigated, obtaining possible signatures of relativistic effects for
$Q^2>2.5 ~(GeV/c)^2$.
