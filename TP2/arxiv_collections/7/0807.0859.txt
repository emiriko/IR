We describe a search for production of a charged Higgs boson, q \bar{q'} ->
H^+, reconstructed in the t\bar{b} final state in the mass range 180 <= M_{H^+}
<= 300 GeV. The search was undertaken at the Fermilab Tevatron collider with a
center-of-mass energy sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV and uses 0.9 fb^{-1} of data collected
with the D0 detector. We find no evidence for charged Higgs boson production
and set upper limits on the production cross section in the Types I, II and III
two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs). An excluded region in the (M_{H^+},tan\beta)
plane for Type I 2HDM is presented.
