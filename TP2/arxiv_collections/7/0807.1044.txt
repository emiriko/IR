Zero-field (ZF) muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements have revealed
static commensurate magnetic order of Fe moments in NdOFeAs below $T_{N} \sim
135$ K, with the ordered moment size nearly equal to that in LaOFeAs, and
confirmed similar behavior in BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$. In single crystals of
superconducting (Ba$_{0.55}$K$_{0.45}$)Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, $\mu$SR spectra
indicate static magnetism with incommensurate or short-ranged spin structure in
$\sim$ 70 % of volume below $T_{N} \sim$ 80 K, coexisting with remaining volume
which exhibits superfluid-response consistent with nodeless gap below
$T_{c}\sim 30$ K.
