We study the empirical meaning of randomness with respect to a family of
probability distributions $P_\theta$, where $\theta$ is a real parameter, using
algorithmic randomness theory. In the case when for a computable probability
distribution $P_\theta$ an effectively strongly consistent estimate exists, we
show that the Levin's a priory semicomputable semimeasure of the set of all
$P_\theta$-random sequences is positive if and only if the parameter $\theta$
is a computable real number. The different methods for generating
``meaningful'' $P_\theta$-random sequences with noncomputable $\theta$ are
discussed.
