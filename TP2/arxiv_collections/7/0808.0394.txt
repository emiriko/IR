The magnetoplasmon spectrum of a magnetically modulated two-dimensional
electron gas (MM2DEG) is investigated. We derive the inter and intra Landau
band magnetoplasmon spectrum within the self consistent field approach. The
derivation is performed at zero temperature as well as at finite temperature.
Results are presented for the inter and intra Landau band magnetoplasmon
spectrum as a function of the inverse magnetic field. As a result of magnetic
modulation, magnetic Weiss oscillations are found to occur in the
magnetoplasmon spectrum. Furthermore, our finite temperature theory facilitates
analysis of effects of temperature on the magnetoplasmon spectrum. The results
are compared with those obtained for an electrically modulated 2DEG system. In
addition, we derive and discuss the effects of simultaneous electric and
magnetic modulations on the magnetoplasmon spectrum of 2DEG when the
modulations are in phase as well as when they are out of phase. Magnetic
oscillations are affected by the relative phase of the two modulations and
position of the oscillations depends on the relative strength of the two
modulations in the former case while we find complete suppression of Weiss
oscillations for particular relative strength of the modulations in the latter
case.
