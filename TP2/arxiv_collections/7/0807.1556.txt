Among the dipole models of deep inelastic scattering at small values of the
Bjorken variable $x$, one has been recently proposed which relates the virtual
photon-proton cross section to the dipole-proton forward scattering amplitude
in momentum space. The latter is parametrized by an expression which
interpolates between its behavior at saturation and the travelling wave,
ultraviolet, amplitudes predicted by perturbative QCD from the
Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. Inspired by recent developments in coordinate
space, we use this model to parametrize the proton structure function and
confront it to HERA data on $ep$ deep inelastic scattering. Both event-by-event
and the physical amplitudes are considered, the latter used to investigate the
effect of gluon number fluctuations, beyond the mean-field approximation. We
conclude that fluctuations are not present in DIS at HERA energies.
