We present a summary of the measurements of the top quark production and
decay properties performed by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron
proton-antiproton collider at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV using 1 fb-1 of data. We discuss
the first simultaneous measurement of the ratio of branching fractions, R=B(t->
Wb)/B(t->Wq), with q being a d, s, or b quark, and the top quark pair
production cross section, the first model-independent measurement of the
helicity of W bosons produced in the top quark decays, and the first
measurement of the integrated forward-backward charge asymmetry in the
production of top quark pairs.
