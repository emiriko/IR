The excitation spectra of the radial quadrupole and scissors modes of
ultracold Fermi gases in elongated traps are studied across the BCS
superfluid-normal phase transition in the framework of a transport theory for
quasiparticles. In the limit of zero temperature, this theory reproduces the
results of superfluid hydrodynamics, while in the opposite limit, above the
critical temperature, it reduces to the collisionless Vlasov equation. In the
intermediate temperature range, the excitation spectra have two or three broad
peaks, respectively, which are roughly situated at hydrodynamic and
collisionless frequencies, and whose strength is shifted from the hydrodynamic
to the collisionless modes with increasing temperature. By fitting the time
dependent quadrupole deformation with a damped oscillation of a single
frequency, we can understand the "jump" of the frequency of the radial
quadrupole mode as a function of interaction strength which has recently been
reported by the Innsbruck group.
