We study Lyapunov vectors (LVs) corresponding to the largest Lyapunov
exponents in systems with spatiotemporal chaos. We focus on characteristic LVs
and compare the results with backward LVs obtained via successive Gram-Schmidt
orthonormalizations. Systems of a very different nature such as coupled-map
lattices and the (continuous-time) Lorenz `96 model exhibit the same features
in quantitative and qualitative terms. Additionally we propose a minimal
stochastic model that reproduces the results for chaotic systems. Our work
supports the claims about universality of our earlier results [I. G. Szendro et
al., Phys. Rev. E 76, 025202(R) (2007)] for a specific coupled-map lattice.
