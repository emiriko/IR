We discuss some of the localization issues associated with the embedding of
Robertson-Walker type Randall-Sundrum branes in a bulk $AdS_5$. Specifically,
we show that of the branes which are embeddable in $AdS_5$ the geometry
associated with $M_4$ and $dS_4$ branes warps away from the brane while that
associated with $AdS_4$ and $RW$ branes of any spatial 3-curvature antiwarps
away from the brane. We discuss the gravitational fluctuations around an $M_4$
brane and analyze the specific role played by a delta function singularity at
the brane. We show how a bulk sine-Gordon scalar field can without any
fine-tuning naturally lead to localization of gravity around an $M_4$ brane.
