Based on the concept of complementary media, we propose a novel design which
can enhance the electromagnetic wave scattering cross section of an object so
that it looks like a scatterer bigger than the scale of the device. Such a
``superscatterer'' is realized by coating a negative refractive material shell
on a perfect electrical conductor cylinder. The scattering field is
analytically obtained by Mie scattering theory, and confirmed by full-wave
simulations numerically. Such a device can be regarded as a cylindrical concave
mirror for all angles.
