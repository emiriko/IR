We present the latest $B$ hadron lifetimes, $B^0_s$ mixing, and $D^0$ mixing
measurements using up to 3.0 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by CDF and D0
experiments at Fermilab. The $B^0_s$ lifetime is measured from both $J/\psi
\phi$ (CP admixture) and flavor specific channels, and the $B_c$ lifetime is
obtained from semileptonic channels. Following the $B^0_s$ oscillation
frequency measurement at CDF in 2006, the D0 collaboration now observes $B^0_s$
oscillation at a significance of about 3$\sigma$. Since the first $D^0$ mixing
evidence established at $B$ factories in 2007, CDF has observed $D^0$ mixing at
a significance of about 4$\sigma$ level, the first time from hadron collider.
