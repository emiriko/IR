We investigate the changes of the masses and widths of $\chi_{c0}$ and
$\chi_{c1}$ in hot gluonic matter near $T_c$ and in nuclear medium using QCD
sum rules. As in the previous works for the $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$, in-medium
effects are incorporated through the changes of gluon condensates. Twist-2
terms for the $^3 P_0 (\chi_{c0})$ and $^3 P_1 (\chi_{c1})$ are also included
for the first time. The results show that larger mass shifts and width
broadenings take place as compared to the $S$-wave states. As the critical
change take place near $T_c$, related measurements can reveal critical
phenomenon in QCD.
