Transverse polarization in the Hyperon production in the unpolarized deep
inelastic scattering and pp collisions is studied in the twist-three approach,
considering the contribution from the quark-gluon-antiquark correlation
distribution in nucleon. We further compare our results for deep inelastic
scattering to a transverse momentum dependent factorization approach, and find
consistency between the two approaches in the intermediate transverse momentum
region. We also find that in pp collisions, there are only derivative terms
contributions, and the non-derivative terms vanish.
