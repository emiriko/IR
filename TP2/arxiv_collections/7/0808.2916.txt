The low-temperature behavior of Ce2RuZn4 has been investigated. Specific heat
and magnetic susceptibility data reveal an antiferromagnetic transition at a
Neel temperature of 2 K. Ce2RuZn4 is a static intermediate-valent compound with
two crystallographically independent cerium atoms. The magnetic data clearly
show that only one cerium site is magnetic (Ce^3+), while the second one
carries no magnetic moment. The experimental data are interpreted with the help
of first principles electronic structure calculations using density functional
theory and the augmented spherical wave method. The calculations reveal the
occurrence of two different cerium sites, which are characterized by strongly
localized magneticmoments and strong Ce-Ru bonding, respectively.
