Recent investigations have shown that the first proposed explanations of the
disagreement between experimental and theoretical value of isotope coefficient
in MgB2 need to be reconsidered. Considering that in samples with residual
resistivity of few mu-Ohm cm critical temperature variations produced by
disorder effects can be comparable with variations due to the isotopic effect,
we adopt a procedure in evaluating the B isotope coefficient which take account
of these effects, obtaining a value which is in agreement with previous results
and then confirming that there is something still unclear in the physics of
MgB2.
