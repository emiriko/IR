In the electron doped compounds SrFe_(2-x)Co_xAs_2 superconductivity with T_c
up to 20 K is observed for 0.2 < x < 0.4. Results of structure determination,
magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and specific heat are
reported. The observation of bulk superconductivity in all thermodynamic
properties -- despite strong disorder in the Fe-As layer -- favors an itinerant
picture in contrast to the cuprates and renders a p- or d-wave scenario
unlikely. DFT calculations find that the substitution of Fe by Co (x > 0.3)
leads to the suppression of the magnetic ordering present in SrFe_2As_2 due to
a rigid down-shift of the Fe-3d_(x^2-y^2) related band edge in the density of
states.
