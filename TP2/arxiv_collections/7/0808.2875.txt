We propose a new method to compute the running coupling constant of gauge
theories on the lattice. We first give the definition of the running coupling
in the new scheme using the Wilson loops in a finite volume, and explain how
the running of the coupling constant is extracted from the measurement of the
volume dependence. The perturbative calculation of the renormalization constant
to define the scheme is also given at the leading order. As a benchmark test of
the new scheme we apply the method the case of the quenched QCD. We show the
preliminary result from our numerical simulations which are carried out with
plaquette gauge action for various lattice sizes and bare lattice couplings.
With techniques to improve the statistical accuracy, we show that we can
determine the non-perturbative running of the coupling constant in a wide range
of the energy scale with relatively small number of gauge configurations in our
scheme. We compare our lattice data of the running coupling constant with
perturbative renormalization group evolution at one- and two-loop order, and
confirm the consistency between them at high energy.
