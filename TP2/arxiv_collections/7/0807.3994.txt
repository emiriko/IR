We present a tutorial on the properties of the new ideal circuit element, a
memristor. By definition, a memristor M relates the charge q and the magnetic
flux $\phi$ in a circuit, and complements a resistor R, a capacitor C, and an
inductor L as an ingredient of ideal electrical circuits. The properties of
these three elements and their circuits are a part of the standard curricula.
The existence of the memristor as the fourth ideal circuit element was
predicted in 1971 based on symmetry arguments, but was clearly experimentally
demonstrated just this year. We present the properties of a single memristor,
memristors in series and parallel, as well as ideal memristor-capacitor (MC),
memristor-inductor (ML), and memristor-capacitor-inductor (MCL) circuits. We
find that the memristor has hysteretic current-voltage characteristics. We show
that the ideal MC (ML) circuit undergoes non-exponential charge (current) decay
with two time-scales, and that by switching the polarity of the capacitor, an
ideal MCL circuit can be tuned from overdamped to underdamped. We present
simple models which show that these unusual properties are closely related to
the memristor's internal dynamics. This tutorial complements the pedagogy of
ideal circuit elements (R,C, and L) and the properties of their circuits.
