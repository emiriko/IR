We report single-color, time resolved magneto-optical measurements in
ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. We demonstrate coherent optical control
of the magnetization precession by applying two successive ultrashort laser
pulses. The magnetic field and temperature dependent experiments reveal the
collective Mn-moment nature of the oscillatory part of the time-dependent Kerr
rotation, as well as contributions to the magneto-optical signal that are not
connected with the magnetization dynamics.
