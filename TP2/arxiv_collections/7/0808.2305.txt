We consider B to PS decays where P stands for pseudoscalar and S for a heavy
(~1500 MeV) scalar meson. We achieve agreement with available experimental data
-- which includes a two orders of magnitude hierarchy -- assuming the scalars
mesons are two quark states. The contribution of the dipolar penguin operator
O_{11} is quantified.
