In this letter, we report on the single crystal growth and physical
characterization of the distorted kagom\'{e} system Pr$_3$Ga$_5$SiO$_{14}$. It
is found that at zero magnetic field the system shows no magnetic order down to
0.035 K and exhibits a $T^{2}$ behavior for the specific heat at low
temperatures, indicative of a gapless 2D spin liquid state. Application of an
applied field induces nanoscale islands of ordered spins, with a concomitant
reduction of the $T^{2}$ specific heat term. This state could be a possible
ferro-spin nematic ordering stabilized out of an unusual spin liquid state.
