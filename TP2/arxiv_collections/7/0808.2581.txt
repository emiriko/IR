Positivity of the density operator reflects itself in terms of sequences of
inequalities on observable moments. Uncertainty relations for non-commuting
observables form a subset of these inequalities. In addition, criterion of
positivity under partial transposition (PPT) imposes distinct bounds on
moments, violations of which signal entanglement. We present bounds on some
novel sets of composite moments, consequent to positive partial transposition
of the density operator and report their violation by entangled multiqubit
states. In particular, we derive separability bounds on a multiqubit moment
matrix (based on PPT constraints on bipartite divisions of the density matrix)
and show that three qubit pure states with non-zero tangle violate these PPT
moment constraints. Further, we recover necessary and sufficient condition of
separability in a multiqubit Werner state through PPT bounds on moments.
