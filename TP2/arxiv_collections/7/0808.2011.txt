Strength parameters of rocks are currently determined from indentation tests.
In this paper, a finite element analysis of this test is presented and scale
effect is studied. The rock is modelled as an elasto-plastic medium with
Cosserat microstructure and consequently possesses an internal length. The
response of the indentation curve is studied for various values of the size of
the indentor as compared to the internal length of the rock in order to assess
the scale effect.
