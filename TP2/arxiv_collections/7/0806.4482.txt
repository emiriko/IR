Quantum fluctuations in the post inflationary Affleck-Dine baryogenesis model
are studied. The squeezed states formalism is used to give evolution equations
for the particle and anti-particle modes in the early universe. The role of
expansion and parametric amplification of the quantum fluctuations on the
baryon asymmetry produced is investigated.
