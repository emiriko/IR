Transport phenomena are fundamental in Physics. They allow for information
and energy to be exchanged between individual constituents of communication
systems, networks or even biological entities. Environmental noise will
generally hinder the efficiency of the transport process. However, and contrary
to intuition, there are situations in classical systems where thermal
fluctuations are actually instrumental in assisting transport phenomena. Here
we show that, even at zero temperature, transport of excitations across
dissipative quantum networks can be enhanced by local dephasing noise. We
explain the underlying physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon, show that
entanglement does not play a supportive role and propose possible experimental
demonstrations in quantum optics. We argue that Nature may be routinely
exploiting this effect and show that the transport of excitations in light
harvesting molecules does benefit from such noise assisted processes. These
results point towards the possibility for designing optimized structures for
transport, for example in artificial nano-structures, assisted by noise.
