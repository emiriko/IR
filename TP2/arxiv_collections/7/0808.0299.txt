We study the proximity effect between conventional superconductor and
magnetic normal metal with a spin-orbit interaction of the Rashba type. Using
the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory and the quasiclassical Eilenberger
approach it is demonstrated that the Josephson junction with such a metal as a
weak link has a special non-sinusoidal current-phase relation. The ground state
of this junction is caracterized by the finite phase difference Phi, which is
proportional to the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and the exchange
field in the normal metal. The proposed mechanism of the Phi junction formation
gives a direct coupling between the superconducting current and the magnetic
moment in the weak link. Therefore the Phi junctions open interesting
perspectives for the superconducting spintronics.
