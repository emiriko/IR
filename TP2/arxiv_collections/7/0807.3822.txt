The effects of discrete macroion surface charge distribution and valences of
these surface charges and counterions on charge reversal have been studied for
macroions of three different geometries and compared with those of continuous
surface charge distributions. The geometry of the macroion has been observed to
play an important role in overcharging in these cases. The interplay of
valences of discrete microions and counterions have noticeable effects on
overcharging efficiency. For some valence combinations overcharging the
macroion with discrete surface charge is seen to be more efficient than those
with continuous charge distribution. The calculations have been performed using
a previously developed energy minimization simulation technique. For comparison
purposes the corresponding continuous charge distribution cases together with
an analytical model derived from modified Scatchard approach (for continuous
charge distribution) have been evaluated.
