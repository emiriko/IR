In this paper, I study the diffusion of new terms, called neologism, in
social networks. I consider it as an example of information dynamics on
networks and I hope that solving this problem can help us to understand and
describe the information dynamics problem. To do so I develop a
phenomenological model for the diffusion mechanism. I find an analytical
relationship between number of people in the society who has learned the term
and time taken. The Network parameters are imported in this analytical
solution. I also present some simulation for this mechanism for several sample
and some real networks which confirms the analytical results. In addition, I
study the effects of network topology on diffusion process.
