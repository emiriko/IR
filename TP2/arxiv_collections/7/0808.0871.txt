The main fundamental principles characterizing the vacuum field structure are
formulated, the modeling of the related vacuum medium and charged point
particle dynamics by means of devised field theoretic tools are analyzed. The
Maxwell electrodynamic theory is revisited and newly derived from the suggested
vacuum field structure principles, the classical special relativity theory
relationship between the energy and the corresponding point particle mass is
revisited and newly obtained. The Lorentz force expression with respect to
arbitrary non-inertial reference frames is revisited and discussed in detail,
some new interpretations of relations between the special relativity theory and
quantum mechanics are presented. The famous quantum-mechanical Schr\"{o}dinger
type equations for a relativistic point particle in the external potential and
magnetic fields within the quasiclassical approximation as the Planck constant
$\hbar \to 0$ and the light velocity $c\to \infty$ are obtained.
