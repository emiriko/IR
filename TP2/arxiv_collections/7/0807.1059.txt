Heavy metal contamination of agricultural land is partly responsible for
limiting crop productivity. Cd$^{2+}$ is known as a non-essentiel HM that can
be harmful to plants even at low concentrations. Brassica juncea (L.) is able
to accumulate more than 400 $\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W. in the shoot, a physiological
trait which may be exploited for the phytoremediation of contaminated soils and
waters. . The application of 75 $\mu$M CdCl$_2$ for three days does not show
any effect in the B. juncea growth parameters (F.W. and D.W.) whatever the type
of plantlets. This application decreases also the contents of chlorophyll a,
carotenoids and Chl a/b ratio (2.26) for plantlets regenerated in the absence
of CdCl$_2$ but not those of plantlets regenerated in its presence. Roots have
the highest contents (3071; 1544 $\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.) followed by stems (850;
687$\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.) and leaves (463; 264$\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.)
respectively. In our conditions, we suggest that the low accumulation in the
plantlets regenerated in the presence of CdCl$_2$ by the means of in-vitro
regeneration technology is still benefical, to some extent, for the
phytoextraction process and seems to be an interesting technology that allows
the cultivation of these plantlets in contaminated soils with low accumulation
of metal in their shoots and probably in their seeds used in many food
technologies.
