We present a scheme to establish non-classical correlations in the motion of
two macroscopically separated massive particles without resorting to
entanglement in their internal degrees of freedom. It is based on the
dissociation of a diatomic molecule with two temporally separated Feshbach
pulses generating a motional state of two counter-propagating atoms that is
capable of violating a Bell inequality by means of correlated single particle
interferometry. We evaluate the influence of dispersion on the Bell
correlation, showing it to be important but manageable in a proposed
experimental setup. The latter employs a molecular BEC of fermionic Lithium
atoms, uses laser-guided atom interferometry, and seems to be within the reach
of present-day technology.
