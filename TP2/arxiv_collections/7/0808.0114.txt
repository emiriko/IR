Azimuthal Asymmetries in unpolarized SIDIS can be used to probe the
transverse momentum of quarks inside the nucleon. Furthermore, they give access
to the so-far unmeasured Boer-Mulders function. We report on the first
measurement of azimuthal asymmetries of the SIDIS cross section from scattering
of muons off a deuteron target.
