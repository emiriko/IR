Two different paradoxes of the fuzzy logic programming system of [29] are
presented. The first paradox is due to two distinct (contradictory) truth
values for every ground atom of FLP, one is syntactical, the other is
semantical. The second paradox concerns the cardinality of the valid FLP
formulas which is found to have contradictory values: both $\aleph_0$ the
cardinality of the natural numbers, and $c$, the cardinality of the continuum.
The result is that CH="False" and Axiom of Choice="False". Hence, ZFC is
inconsistent.
