Transcription is regulated through interplay between transcription factors,
an RNA polymerase(RNAP), and a promoter. Even for a simple repressive
transcription factor that disturbs promoter activity at the initial binding of
RNAP, its repression level is not determined solely by the dissociation
constant of transcription factor but is sensitive to the time scales of
processes in RNAP. We first analyse the promoter activity under strong
repression by a slow binding repressor, in which case transcriptions occur in a
burst, followed by a long quiescent period while a repressor binds to the
operator; the number of transcriptions, the bursting and the quiescent times
are estimated by reaction rates. We then examine interference effect from an
opposing promoter, using the correlation function of transcription initiations
for a single promoter. The interference is shown to de-repress the promoter
because RNAP's from the opposing promoter most likely encounter the repressor
and remove it in case of strong repression. This de-repression mechanism should
be especially prominent for the promoters that facilitate fast formation of
open complex with the repressor whose binding rate is slower than about 1/sec.
Finally, we discuss possibility of this mechanism for high activity of promoter
PR in the hyp-mutant of lambda phage.
