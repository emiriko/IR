A second quantized field theory on the world sheet is developed for summing
planar graphs of the phi^3 theory. This is in contrast to the earlier work,
which was based on first quantization. The ground state of the model is
investigated with the help of a variational ansatz. In complete agreement with
standard perturbation theory, the infinities encountered in carrying out this
calculation can be eliminated by the renormalization of the parameters of the
model. We also find that, as in the earlier work, in the ground state, graphs
form a dense network (condensate) on the world sheet.
