We present evidence for spin polarized charge carriers in In$_2$O$_3$ films.
Both In$_2$O$_3$ and Cr doped In$_2$O$_3$ films exhibit room temperature
ferromagnetism after vacuum annealing, with a saturation moment of
approximately 0.5 emu/cm$^3$. We used Point Contact Andreev Reflection
measurements to directly determine the spin polarization, which was found to be
approximately 50$\pm$5% for both compositions. These results are consistent
with suggestions that the ferromagnetism observed in certain oxide
semiconductors may be carrier mediated.
