We construct a framework for studying clustering algorithms, which includes
two key ideas: persistence and functoriality. The first encodes the idea that
the output of a clustering scheme should carry a multiresolution structure, the
second the idea that one should be able to compare the results of clustering
algorithms as one varies the data set, for example by adding points or by
applying functions to it. We show that within this framework, one can prove a
theorem analogous to one of J. Kleinberg, in which one obtains an existence and
uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We explore further
properties of this unique scheme, stability and convergence are established.
