In Split-Supersymmetry models, where the only non-Standard Model states
produceable at LHC-energies consist of a gluino plus neutralinos and charginos,
it is conventionally accepted that only mass differences among these latter are
measureable at the LHC. The present work shows that application of a simple
`Kinematic Selection' technique allows full reconstruction of neutralino and
chargino masses from one event, in principle. A Monte Carlo simulation
demonstrates the feasibilty of using this technique at the LHC.
