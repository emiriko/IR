The crucial search for the Higgs boson at future colliders is capable of
discovering the Standard Model Higgs, but is not guaranteed to discover a Higgs
that decays nonstandardly. Such new physics is motivated by many aspects; from
experiment, by the tension between precision electroweak fits and the LEP2
direct search bound and from theory, by issues of satisfying the LEP2 bound in
theories that naturally have a lighter Higgs. The consistent nonstandard Higgs
scenario is that the Higgs is lighter than the LEP2 bound and is consistent
with direct search limits because the dominant new decays are cascades into a
multi-body final state, mediated by new light particles. The reduction in the
Standard Model branching ratio implies that searches dependent on these decays
can be severely weakened. Thus, it is imperative to design searches capable of
discovering the new decays. Some of the possible analyses that can be performed
at the Tevatron and LHC are presented. However, much work remains to see if
discovery of the nonstandard Higgs at hadron colliders can be ensured.
