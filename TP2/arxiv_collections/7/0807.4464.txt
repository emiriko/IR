We discuss two different models for the impact parameter dependent dipole
cross section: one based on DGLAP evolution and the other inspired by the
Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. The parameters are determined from fits to data on
the total gamma* p cross section measured at HERA. The impact parameter
dependent saturation scale is extracted. Predictions are then confronted with
HERA data on exclusive diffractive vector meson production and deeply virtual
Compton scattering. Finally, predictions are given for the cross sections of
exclusive photoproduced J/psi and Upsilon mesons, and Z^0 bosons, expected at
the Tevatron and LHC.
