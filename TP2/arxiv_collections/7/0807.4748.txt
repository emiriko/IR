We study the issue of the recovery of diffeomorphism invariance in the
recently introduced loop quantum gravity treatment of the exterior
Schwarzschild space-time. Although the loop quantization agrees with the
quantization in terms of metric variables in identifying the physical Hilbert
space, we show that diffeomorphism invariance in space-time is recovered with
certain limitations due to the use of holonomic variables in the loop treatment
of the model. This resembles behaviors that are expected in the full theory.
