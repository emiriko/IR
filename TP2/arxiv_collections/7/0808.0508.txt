Previously, it has been argued that the anomalous emission from the region
around the Galactic Center observed by WMAP, known as the ``WMAP Haze'', may be
the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons produced in
dark matter annihilations. In particular, the angular distribution, spectrum,
and intensity of the observed emission are consistent with the signal expected
to result from a WIMP with an electroweak-scale mass and an annihilation cross
section near the value predicted for a thermal relic. In this article, we
revisit this signal within the context of supersymmetry, and evaluate the
parameter space of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(CMSSM). We find that, over much of the supersymmetric parameter space, the
lightest neutralino is predicted to possess the properties required to generate
the WMAP Haze. In particular, the focus point, A-funnel, and bulk regions
typically predict a neutralino with a mass, annihilation cross section, and
dominant annihilation modes which are within the range required to produce the
observed features of the WMAP Haze. The stau-coannihilation region, in
contrast, is disfavored as an explanation for the origin of this signal.
