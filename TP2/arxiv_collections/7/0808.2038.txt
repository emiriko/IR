The extraordinary properties of resonant four-wave mixing of backward waves
in doped negative-index materials are investigated. The feasibility of
independent engineering of negative refractive index and nonlinear optical
response as well as quantum control of the nonlinear propagation process in
such composites is shown due to the coherent energy transfer from the control
to the signal field. Laser-induced transparency, quantum switching,
frequency-tunable narrow-band filtering, amplification, and realizing a
miniature mirrorless optical parametric generator of the entangled backward and
ordinary waves are among the possible applications of the investigated
processes.
