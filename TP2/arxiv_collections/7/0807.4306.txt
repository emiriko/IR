We use \ZZ^d-gradings to study d-dimensional monomial ideals. The Koszul
functor is employed to interpret the quasidegrees of local cohomology in terms
of the geometry of distractions and to explicitly compute the multiplicities of
exponents. These multigraded techniques originate from the study of
hypergeometric systems of differential equations.
