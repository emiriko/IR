In this paper we quantize the Klein--Gordon scalar field coupled to gravity
in the instanton representation for spatially homogeneous variables. The
construction provides a well-defined Hilbert space of states for generic
self-interaction potential V, with a direct link to the semiclassical limit
below the Planck scale. Additionally, we compute the Hamilton's equations of
motion for this model, performing various consistency checks on the quantum
theory.
