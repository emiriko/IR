Mitochondria are complex organelles, and their proteomics analysis requires a
combination of techniques. The emphasis in this chapter is made first on
mitochondria preparation from cultured mammalian cells, then on the separation
of the mitochondrial proteins with two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE),
showing some adjustment over the classical techniques to improve resolution of
the mitochondrial proteins. This covers both the protein solubilization, the
electrophoretic part per se, and the protein detection on the gels, which makes
the interface with the protein identification part relying on mass
spectrometry.
