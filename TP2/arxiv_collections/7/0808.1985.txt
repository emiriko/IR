Superconducting epitaxial films of Fe-based layered arsenide, Co-doped
SrFe2As2, were grown at 700oC on mixed perovskite (La, Sr)(Al, Ta)O3 (001)
single-crystal substrates by pulsed-laser deposition. Both the epitaxial film
and an (001)-oriented film grown at 600oC exhibited superconducting transitions
at ~ 20 K. The zero-resistance states of the epitaxial film were sustained
under a magnetic field (H) of 9 T at 9 K when H was parallel to the c-axis,
while they were sustained at higher temperatures up to 10 K for H parallel to
the a-axis. This is the first demonstration of superconducting thin films of
FeAs-based new superconductors.
