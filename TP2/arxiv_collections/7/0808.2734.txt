Spider dragline silk shows well-known outstanding mechanical properties.
However, its sigmoidal shape of the measured stress-strain curves (i.e. the
yield) can not be described by classical polymer theories and recent
hierarchical chain model. To solve the long lasting problem, we generalized the
Maier-Saupe theory of nematics to construct an elastic model for the
polypeptide chain network of the dragline silk. The comprehensive agreement
between theory and experiments on the stress-strain curve strongly indicates
the dragline silks to belong to liquid crystal elastomers. Especially, the
remarkable yielding elasticity of the silk is understood for the first time as
the force-induced isotropic-nematic phase transition of the chain network. Our
theory also predicts a drop of the stress in supercontracted dragline silk, an
early found effect of humidity on the mechanical property in many silks.
