Glauber theory for nucleus-nucleus scattering at high incident energies is
reformulated so as to become applicable also for the scattering at intermediate
energies. We test validity of the eikonal and adiabatic approximations used in
the formulation, and discuss the relation between the present theory and the
conventional Glauber calculations with either the empirical nucleon-nucleon
profile function or the modified one including the in-medium effect.
