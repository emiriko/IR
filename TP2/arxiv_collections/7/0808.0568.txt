The interplay of slow dynamics and thermodynamic features of dense liquids is
studied by examinining how the glass transition changes depending on the
presence or absence of Lennard-Jones-like attractions. Quite different
thermodynamic behavior leaves the dynamics unchanged, with important
consequences for high-pressure experiments on glassy liquids. Numerical results
are obtained within mode-coupling theory (MCT), but the qualitative features
are argued to hold more generally. A simple square-well model can be used to
explain generic features found in experiment.
