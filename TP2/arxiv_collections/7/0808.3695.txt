Sound is a preferred context to build foundations on wave phenomena, one of
the most important disciplinary referents in physics. It is also one of the
best-set frameworks to achieve transversality, overcoming scholastic level and
activating emotional aspects which are naturally connected with every day life,
as well as with music and perception. Looking at sound and music by a
transversal perspective - a border-line approach between science and art, is
the adopted statement for a teaching proposal using meta-cognition as a
strategy in scientific education. This work analyzes curricular proposals on
musical acoustics, planned by prospective secondary-school teachers in the
framework of a Formative Intervention Module answering the expectation of
making more effective teaching scientific subjects by improving creative
capabilities, as well as leading to build logical and scientific
categorizations able to consciously discipline artistic activity in music
students. With this aim, a particular emphasis is given to those concepts -
like sound parameters and structural elements of a musical piece, which are
best fitted to be addressed on a transversal perspective, involving
simultaneously physics, psychophysics and music.
