In the present work we study both thermal and non-thermal leptogenesis in all
neutrino mass models describing the presently available neutrino mass patterns.
We consider the Majorana CP violating phases coming from right-handed Majorana
mass matrices to estimate the baryon asymmetry of the universe, for different
neutrino mass models namely degenerate, inverted hierarchical and normal
hierarchical models, with tribimaximal mixings. Considering two possible
diagonal forms of Dirac neutrino mass matrix as either charged lepton or
up-quark mass matrix, the right-handed Majorana mass matrices are constructed
from the light neutrino mass matrix through the inverse seesaw formula. Only
the normal hierarchical model leads to the best predictions for baryon
asymmetry of the universe, consistent with observations in both thermal and
non-thermal leptogenesis scenario. The analysis though phenomenological may
serve as an additional information in the discrimination among the presently
available neutrino mass models.
