We have investigated electrical transport and shot noise in graphene field
effect devices. In large width over length ratio $W/L$ graphene strips, we have
measured shot noise at low frequency ($f$ = 600--850 MHz) in the temperature
range of 4.2--30 K. We observe a minimum conductivity of $\frac{4e^{2}}{\pi h}$
and a finite and gate dependent Fano factor reaching the universal value of 1/3
at the Dirac point, i.e. where the density of states vanishes. These findings
are in good agreement with the theory describing that transport at the Dirac
point should occur via evanescent waves in perfect graphene samples with large
$W/L$. Moreover, we show and discuss how disorder and non-parallel leads affect
both conductivity and shot noise.
