Layered d-metal pnictide oxides are a unique class of compounds which
consists of characteristic d-metal pnictide layers and metal oxide layers. More
than 100 of these layered compounds, including the recently discovered Fe-based
superconducting pnictide oxides, can be classified into 9 structure types.
These structure types and the chemical and physical properties of the
characteristic d-metal pnictide layers and metal oxide layers of the layered
d-metal pnictide oxides are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, possible
approaches to design new superconductors based on these layered d-metal
pnictide oxides are proposed.
