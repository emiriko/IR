We study higher derivative corrections to the statistical entropy function
and the statistical entropy for five dimensional BMPV black holes by doing the
asymptotic expansion of the partition function. This enables us to evaluate
entropy for a large range of charges, even out of Cardy (Farey tail) limit.
