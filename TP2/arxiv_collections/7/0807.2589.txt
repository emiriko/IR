We discuss the large set of observables available from the angular
distributions of the decay anti-B --> anti-K*0 l+ l-. We present a NLO analysis
of all observables based on the QCD factorization approach in the low-dilepton
mass region and an estimate of \Lambda/m_b corrections. Moreover, we discuss
their sensitivity to new physics. We explore the experimental sensitivities at
LHCb (10 fb^-1) and Super-LHCb (100 fb^-1) based on a full-angular fit method
and explore the sensitivity to right handed currents. We also show that the
previously discussed transversity amplitude A_T^(1) cannot be measured at the
LHCb experiment or at future B factory experiments as it requires a measurement
of the spin of the final state particles.
