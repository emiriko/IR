Energy for a nucleus is considered in macroscopic limit, in terms of nucleon
numbers. Further considered for a nuclear system is the Hohenberg-Kohn energy
functional, in terms of proton and neutron densities. Finally,
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out for a half-infinite
particle-stable nuclear-matter. In each case, the attention is focused on the
role of neutron-proton asymmetry and on the nuclear symmetry energy. We extend
the considerations on the symmetry term from an energy formula to the
respective term in the Hohenberg-Kohn functional. We show, in particular, that
in the limit of an analytic functional, and subject to possible Coulomb
corrections, it is possible to construct isoscalar and isovector densities out
of the proton and neutron densities, that retain a universal relation to each
other, approximately independent of asymmetry. In the so-called local
approximation, the isovector density is inversely proportional to the symmetry
energy in uniform matter at the local isoscalar density. Generalized symmetry
coefficient of a nuclear system is related, in the analytic limit of a
functional, to an integral of the isovector density. We test the relations,
inferred from the Hohenberg-Kohn functional, in the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock
calculations of half-infinite matter. Within the calculations, we obtain
surface symmetry coefficients and parameters characterizing the densities, for
the majority of Skyrme parameterizations proposed in the literature. The
volume-to-surface symmetry-coefficient ratio and the displacement of nuclear
isovector relative to isoscalar surfaces both strongly increase as the slope of
symmetry energy in the vicinity of normal density increases.
