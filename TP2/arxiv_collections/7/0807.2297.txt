In rotationally constrained percolation models, a site of a percolation
cluster could be occupied more than once from different directions due to the
nature of the rotational constraint. A state variable $s_i$ is assigned to each
lattice site whose value corresponds to the number times it has been visited
during the growth of a cluster. It is proposed here that the percolation
transition and the multifractal aspects of infinite percolation clusters under
rotational constraint can be studied defining suitable measures in terms of the
state variable $s_i$. This method does not require to introduce any external
agency like an electric current or a random walker in order to explore
multifractality as in the case of ordinary percolation. The state variable
representation also describes the universality class of the percolation models
appropriately.
