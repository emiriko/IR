I discuss two of Edward Teller's contributions to nuclear physics, the
introduction of the Gamow-Teller operator in beta decay and the formulation of
the Goldhaber-Teller model for electric dipole transitions, in the context of
efforts to understand the weak interaction and the nature of the neutrino.
