An unsolved problem of classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics is
the search of the exact relativistic equations of motion for a classical
charged point-particle subject to the force produced by the action of its EM
self-field. The problem is related to the conjecture that for a classical
charged point-particle there should exist a relativistic equation of motion (RR
equation) which results both non-perturbative, in the sense that it does not
rely on a perturbative expansion on the electromagnetic field generated by the
charged particle and non-asymptotic, i.e., it does not depend on any
infinitesimal parameter. In this paper we intend to propose a novel solution to
this well known problem, and in particular to point out that the RR equation is
necessarily variational. The approach is based on two key elements: 1) the
adoption of the relativistic hybrid synchronous Hamilton variational principle
recently pointed out (Tessarotto et al, 2006). Its basic feature is that it can
be expressed in principle in terms of arbitrary "hybrid" variables (i.e.,
generally non-Lagrangian and non-Hamiltonian variables); 2) the variational
treatment of the EM self-field, taking into account the exact particle
dynamics.
