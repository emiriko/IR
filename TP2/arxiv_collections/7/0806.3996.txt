We study the effect of long-range hoppings on Tc for the two-dimensional (2D)
Hubbard model with and without Holstein phonons using parameters evaluated from
band-structure calculations for cuprates. Employing the dynamical cluster
approximation (DCA) with a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) cluster solver for a
4-site cluster, we observe that without phonons, the long-range hoppings, t'
and t'', generally suppress Tc. We argue that this trend remains valid for
larger clusters. In the presence of the Holstein phonons, a finite t' enhances
Tc in the under-doped region for the hole-doped system, consistent with
local-density approximation (LDA) calculations and experiment. This is
interpreted through the suppression of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations and
the interplay between polaronic effects and the antiferromagnetism.
