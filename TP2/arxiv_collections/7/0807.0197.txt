In this note we study M5-branes in the multiple membrane action which is
recently proposed by Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena. We write down the N=6
supersymmetry transformation of the action and obtain 1/2 BPS equations and
their solutions. They are expected to represent membranes ending on a M5-brane.
We also consider the M5-M2 bound state in the action.
