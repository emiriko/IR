We introduce a perturbative approach to solving the time dependent
Schroedinger equation, named adiabatic perturbation theory (APT), whose zeroth
order term is the quantum adiabatic approximation. The small parameter in the
power series expansion of the time-dependent wave function is the inverse of
the time it takes to drive the system's Hamiltonian from the initial to its
final form. We review other standard perturbative and non-perturbative ways of
going beyond the adiabatic approximation, extending and finding exact relations
among them, and also compare the efficiency of those methods against the APT.
Most importantly, we determine APT corrections to the Berry phase by use of the
Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. We then solve several time dependent problems
allowing us to illustrate that the APT is the only perturbative method that
gives the right corrections to the adiabatic approximation. Finally, we propose
an experiment to measure the APT corrections to the Berry phase and show, for a
particular spin-1/2 problem, that to first order in APT the geometric phase
should be two and a half times the (adiabatic) Berry phase.
