Slender rods in concentrated suspensions constitute strongly interacting
systems with rich dynamics: transport slows down drastically and the anisotropy
of the motion becomes arbitrarily large. We develop a mesoscopic description of
the dynamics down to the length scale of the interparticle distance. Our theory
is based on the exact solution of the Smoluchowski-Perrin equation; it is in
quantitative agreement with extensive Brownian dynamics simulations in the
dense regime. In particular, we show that the tube confinement is characterised
by a power law decay of the intermediate scattering function with exponent 1/2.
