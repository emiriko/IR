In this paper we present FeynRules, a new Mathematica package that
facilitates the implementation of new particle physics models. After the user
implements the basic model information (e.g. particle content, parameters and
Lagrangian), FeynRules derives the Feynman rules and stores them in a generic
form suitable for translation to any Feynman diagram calculation program. The
model can then be translated to the format specific to a particular Feynman
diagram calculator via FeynRules translation interfaces. Such interfaces have
been written for CalcHEP/CompHEP, FeynArts/FormCalc, MadGraph/MadEvent and
Sherpa, making it possible to write a new model once and have it work in all of
these programs. In this paper, we describe how to implement a new model,
generate the Feynman rules, use a generic translation interface, and write a
new translation interface. We also discuss the details of the FeynRules code.
