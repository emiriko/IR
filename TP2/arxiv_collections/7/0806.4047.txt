We have investigated the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance in the Pr-based
HF compound PrFe4P12. The large anisotropy of effective mass and its strong
field dependence have been confirmed by resistivity measurements. Particularly
for H||[111], where the effective mass is most strongly enhanced, the non-Fermi
liquid behavior has been observed. Also, we have found the angular dependence
of the magnetoresistance sharply enhanced at H||[111], which is evidently
correlated with both the non-Fermi liquid behavior and the high-field ordered
state (B-phase).
