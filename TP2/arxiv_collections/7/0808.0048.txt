Recent measurements of B hadron properties carried out in sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV
p/p-bar collisions at the Tevatron are reviewed. Included are measurements of
the Bc+ meson lifetime, using J/psi+l+X final states, and the mass, using
J/psi+pi final states, a flavor specific measurement of the Bs0 lifetime in
Ds+pi+X decays, simultaneous measurements of the Bs0 lifetime and lifetime
difference in J/psi+phi decays, the first direct evidence and mass measurements
of the Xi_b- baryon, and measurements of the polarization of 1S charmonium. For
all measurements, charge conjugate modes are included.
