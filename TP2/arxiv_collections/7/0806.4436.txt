A new type of noise-induced synchronous behavior is described. This
phenomenon, called incomplete noise-induced synchronization, arises for
one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equations driven by common noise. The
mechanisms resulting in the incomplete noise-induced synchronization in the
spatially extended systems are revealed analytically. The different model noise
are considered. A very good agreement between the theoretical results and the
numerically calculated data is shown.
