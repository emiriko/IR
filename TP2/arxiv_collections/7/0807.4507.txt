We study the radiative corrections to all Kl3 decay modes to leading
non-trivial order in the chiral effective field theory, working with a fully
inclusive prescription on real photon emission. We present new results for Kmu3
modes and update previous results on Ke3 modes. Our analysis provides important
theoretical input for the extraction of the CKM element Vus from Kl3 decays.
