The aim of this paper is to provide a logic-based conceptual analysis of the
twin paradox (TwP) theorem within a first-order logic framework. A geometrical
characterization of TwP and its variants is given. It is shown that TwP is not
logically equivalent to the assumption of the slowing down of moving clocks,
and the lack of TwP is not logically equivalent to the Newtonian assumption of
absolute time. The logical connection between TwP and a symmetry axiom of
special relativity is also studied.
