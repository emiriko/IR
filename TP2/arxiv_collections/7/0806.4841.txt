High-energy photon-proton interactions at the LHC offer interesting
possibilities for the study of top properties. Using a fast simulation of a
LHC-like detector, first results on the measurement of the |V_{tb}| matrix
element using Wt photoproduction are presented. Anomalous photoproduction of
single top due to Flavour-Changing Neutral Currents permits to improve the
current limits on the coupling parameters, k_{tu\gamma} and k_{tc\gamma} after
only 1 fb^{-1}.
