The classical concept of $Q$-functions associated to symmetric and
selfadjoint operators due to M.G. Krein and H. Langer is extended in such a way
that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map in the theory of elliptic differential
equations can be interpreted as a generalized $Q$-function. For couplings of
uniformly elliptic second order differential expression on bounded and
unbounded domains explicit Krein type formulas for the difference of the
resolvents and trace formulas in an $H^2$-framework are obtained.
