Quantum solitons are discovered with the help of generalized quantum
hydrodynamics (GQH). The solitons have the character of the stable quantum
objects in the self consistent electric field. These effects can be considered
as explanation of the existence of lightning balls. The delivered theory
demonstrates the great possibilities of the generalized quantum hydrodynamics
in investigation of the quantum solitons. The paper can be considered also as
comments and prolongation of the materials published in the known author`s
monograph (Boris V. Alexeev, Generalized Boltzmann Physical Kinetics. Elsevier.
2004). The theory leads to solitons as typical formations in the generalized
quantum hydrodynamics.
