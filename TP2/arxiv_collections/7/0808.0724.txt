We give a new description of the ring structure on the differential
characters of a smooth manifold via the smooth hyperspark complex. We show the
explicit product formula, and as an application, calculate the product for
differential characters of the unit circle. Applying the presentation of spark
classes by smooth hypersparks, we give an explicit construction of the
isomorphism between groups of spark classes and the $(p,p)$ part of smooth
Deligne cohomology groups associated to a smooth manifold. We then give a new
direct proof that this is an isomorphism of ring structures.
