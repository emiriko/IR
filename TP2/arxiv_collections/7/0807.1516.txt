A complete error analysis of variational integrators is obtained, by blowing
up the discrete variational principles, all of which have a singularity at zero
time-step. Divisions by the time step lead to an order that is one less than
observed in simulations, a deficit that is repaired with the help of a new
past-future symmetry.
