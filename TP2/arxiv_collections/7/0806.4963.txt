In this paper, we consider a time dependent module field on spacetime
extension without modifying commutative relation on noncommutative quantum
plane. The significant idea is that $Lorentz$ symmetry is conserved in module
and unmodule coordinate. We focus on the redefinition of spacetime structure
without considering noncommutative bosonic gas in deforming the product between
fields. Which the null vector is a vector on orthogonal $D$ dimensional
$Hilbert$ spacetime. In $Riemann$ geometry, the equation of motion is deformed
from an induced rotation. Particle field survives on the state composed by two
theoretical assumed $null$ vectors, one is commutative, another is
anticommutative. In the point of view, neutrino and photon mass are produced by
its shift, the rotated effect generates a horizon in redefining particle field.
