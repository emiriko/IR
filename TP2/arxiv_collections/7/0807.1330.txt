The CLAS Collaboration has published an analysis using Bayesian model
selection. My Comment criticizing their use of arbitrary prior probability
density functions, and a Reply by D.G. Ireland and D. Protopopsecu, have now
been published as well. This paper responds to the Reply and discusses the
issues in more detail, with particular emphasis on the problems of priors in
Bayesian model selection.
