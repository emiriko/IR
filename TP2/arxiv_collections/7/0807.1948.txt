Three new approaches to generating thrust in uniform magnetic fields are
proposed. The first direction is based on employing Lorentz force acting on
partial magnetically shielded 8-shaped loop with current in external magnetic
field, whereby a net force rather than a torque origins. Another approach,
called a Virtual Wire System, is based on creating a magnetic field having an
energetic symmetry (a virtual wire), with further superposition of external
field. The external field breaks the symmetry causing origination of a net
force. Unlike a wire with current, having radial energetic symmetry, the
symmetry of the Virtual Wire System is closer to an axial wire. The third
approach refers to the first two. It is based on creation of developed surface
system, comprising the elements of the first two types. The developed surface
approach is a way to drastically increase a thrust-to-weight ratio. The
conducted experiments have confirmed feasibility of the proposed approaches.
