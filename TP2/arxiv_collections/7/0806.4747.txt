The confinement mechanism earlier proposed by author is applied to describe
the (possible) ground state of toponium $\eta_t$. For this aim the
nonperturbative consistent approach is elaborated in both relativistic and
nonrelativistic cases. The study entails estimates for parameters of the
confining SU(3)-gluonic field in the above quarkonium, those estimates being
also consistent with possible width of decay $\eta_t\to2\gamma$. The
corresponding estimates of the gluon concentrations, electric and magnetic
colour field strengths are also adduced for the mentioned field at the scales
of toponium.
