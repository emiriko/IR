Biomarker discovery for clinical purposes is one of the major areas in which
proteomics is used. However, despite considerable effort, the successes have
been relatively scarce. In this perspective paper, we try to highlight and
analyze the main causes for this limited success, and to suggest alternate
strategies, which will avoid them, without eluding the foreseeable weak points
of these strategies. Two major strategies are analyzed, namely, the switch from
body fluids to cell and tissues for the initial biomarker discovery step or, if
body fluids must be analyzed, the implementation of highly selective protein
selection strategies.
