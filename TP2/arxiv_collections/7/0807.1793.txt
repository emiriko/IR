We present a new necessary and sufficient condition to determine the
entanglement status of an arbitrary N-qubit quantum state (maybe pure or mixed)
represented by a density matrix. A necessary condition satisfied by separable
bipartite quantum states was obtained by A. Peres, [1]. A. Peres showed that if
a bipartite state represented by the density matrix is separable then its
partial transpose is positive semidefinite and has no negative eigenvalues. In
other words, if the partial transpose is not positive semidefinite and so one
or more of its eigenvalues are negative then the state represented by the
corresponding density matrix is entangled. It was then shown by M. Horodecki
et.al, [2], that this necessary condition is also sufficient for two-by-two and
two-by-three dimensional systems. However, in other dimensions, it was shown by
P. Horodecki, [3], that the criterion due to A. Peres is not sufficient. In
this paper, we develop a new approach and a new criterion for deciding the
entanglement status of the states represented by the density matrices
corresponding to N-qubit systems. We begin with a 2-qubit case and then show
that these results for 2-qubit systems can be extended to N-qubit systems by
proceeding along similar lines. We discuss few examples to illustrate the
method proposed in this paper for testing the entanglement status of few
density matrices.
