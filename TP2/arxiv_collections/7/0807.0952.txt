Taking into account the helicity of a massless particle, which obeys a Dirac
equation and is exposed to an electromagnetic field, one soon arrives at a
Lagrangian containing a chiral supersymmetric operator. We can even achieve an
analogous result in case of an electroweak interaction. Then the Lagrangian
contains terms that look very similar to those usually being interpreted as
mass terms for the W and Z bosons appearing in models of spontaneous symmetry
breaking, but this time they are accompanied by neutrino fields instead of
Higgs fields. This invites us to a speculation that in the procedure of
spontaneous symmetry breaking, neutrinos could take on the role, which we
normally ascribe to the Higgs bosons.
