I discuss an evolution of SUSY GUT model building, starting with the
construction of 4d GUTs, to orbifold GUTs and finally to orbifold GUTs within
the heterotic string. This evolution is an attempt to obtain realistic string
models, perhaps relevant for the LHC. This review is in memory of the sudden
loss of Julius Wess, a leader in the field, who will be sorely missed.
