The superconducting phase of the high-Tc cuprates has been thought to be
described by a single d-wave pairing order parameter. Recently, there has been
growing evidence suggesting that another form of order, possibly inherited from
the pseudogap phase above Tc, may coexist with superconductivity in the
underdoped regime. Through a combined study of scanning tunneling microscopy
and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report the observation of two
distinct gaps (a small-gap and a large-gap) that coexist both in real space and
in the anti-nodal region of momentum space in the superconducting phase of
Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+delta. We show that the small-gap is associated with
superconductivity. The large-gap persists to temperatures above the transition
temperature Tc and is found to be linked to short-range charge ordering.
Remarkably, we find a strong, short-ranged correlation between the local small-
and large- gap magnitudes suggesting that the superconductivity and charge
ordering are affected by similar physical processes.
