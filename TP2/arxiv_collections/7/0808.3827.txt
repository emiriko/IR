Spatial variability of polarization relaxation kinetics in relaxor
ferroelectric 0.9Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.1PbTiO3 is studied using time-resolved
Piezoresponse Force Microscopy. Local relaxation attributed to the
reorientation of polar nanoregions is shown to follow stretched exponential
dependence, exp(-(t/tau)^beta), with beta~~0.4, much larger than the
macroscopic value determined from dielectric spectra (beta~~0.09). The spatial
inhomogeneity of relaxation time distributions with the presence of 100-200 nm
"fast" and "slow" regions is observed. The results are analyzed to map the
Vogel-Fulcher temperatures on the nanoscale.
