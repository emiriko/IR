Exclusive $\pi^0$ electroproduction from nucleons is suggested for extracting
the tensor charge and other quantities related to transversity from
experimental data. This process isolates C-parity odd and chiral odd
combinations of t-channel exchange quantum numbers. In a hadronic picture it
connects the meson production amplitudes to C-odd Regge exchanges with final
state interactions. In a description based on partonic degrees of freedom, the
helicity structure for this C-odd process relates to the quark helicity flip,
or chiral odd generalized parton distributions.
