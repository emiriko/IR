We study the asymptotic behavior of the least squares estimators of the
unknown parameters of bifurcating autoregressive processes. Under very weak
assumptions on the driven noise of the process, namely conditional pair-wise
independence and suitable moment conditions, we establish the almost sure
convergence of our estimators together with the quadratic strong law and the
central limit theorem. All our analysis relies on non-standard asymptotic
results for martingales.
