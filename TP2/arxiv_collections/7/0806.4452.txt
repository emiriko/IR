We investigate the Gauss-Bonnet black hole in five dimensional anti-de Sitter
spacetimes (GBAdS). We analyze all thermodynamic quantities of the GBAdS, which
is characterized by the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $c$ and mass $M$, comparing with
those of the Born-Infeld-AdS (BIAdS), Reissner-Norstr\"om-AdS black holes
(RNAdS), Schwarzschild-AdS (SAdS), and BTZ black holes. For $c<0$ we cannot
obtain the black hole with positively definite thermodynamic quantities of
mass, temperature, and entropy because the entropy does not satisfy the
area-law. On the other hand, for $c>0$, we find the BIAdS-like black hole,
showing that the coupling $c$ plays the role of pseudo-charge. Importantly, we
could not obtain the SAdS in the limits of $c\to 0$, which means that the GBAdS
is basically different from the SAdS. In addition, we clarify the connections
between thermodynamic and dynamical stability. Finally, we also conjecture that
if a black hole is big and thus globally stable, its quasinormal modes may take
analytic expressions.
