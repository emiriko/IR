The Projected Configuration Interaction (PCI) method starts from a collection
of mean-field wave functions, and builds up correlated wave functions of good
symmetry. It relies on the Generator Coordinator Method (GCM) techniques, but
it improves the past approaches by a very efficient method of selecting the
basis states. We use the same realistic Hamiltonians and model spaces as the
Configuration Interaction (CI) method, and compare the results with the full CI
calculations in the sd and pf shell. Examples of 24Mg, 28Si, 48Cr, 52Fe and
56Ni are discussed.
