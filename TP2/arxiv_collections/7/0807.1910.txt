In this paper, we investigate the spectrum of light scattered from a
Bose-Einstein condensate in the framework of f-deformed boson. We use an
f-deformed quantum model in which the Gardiners phonon operators for BEC are
deformed by an operator-valued function, f(n), of the particle-number operator
n. We consider the collisions between the atoms as a special kind of
f-deformation. The collision rate k is regarded as the deformation parameter
and the spectrum of light scattered from the deformed BEC is analyzed. In
particular, we find that with increasing the values of deformation parameters k
and eta=1/N (N, total number of condensate atoms) the scattering spectrum shows
deviation from the spectrum associated with nondeformed Bose-Einstein
condensate.
