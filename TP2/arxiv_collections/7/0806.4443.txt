The branching ratio between the beta- and beta+/electron capture decay of
74As has been measured in different host materials such as Ta, Al, Ge and
mylar. No significant dependence of the branching ratio on the host material
has been observed. The half-life of 74As has also been measured in metallic Ta
and in semiconductor Ge, no difference has been found and the results are in
agreement with the literature value. The obtained results provide an upper
limit for the possible host material dependence of the decay rate in 74As.
