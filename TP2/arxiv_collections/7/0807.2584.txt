We report a proof-of-principle experiment where the refractive index of an
atomic vapor is enhanced while maintaining vanishing absorption of the beam.
The key idea is to drive alkali atoms in a vapor with appropriate control
lasers and induce a gain resonance and an absorption resonance for a probe beam
in a two-photon Raman configuration. The strength and the position of these two
resonances can be manipulated by changing the parameters of the control lasers.
By using the interference between these two resonances, we obtain an enhanced
refractive index without an increase in the absorption.
