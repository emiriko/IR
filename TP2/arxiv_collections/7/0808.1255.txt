We consider the influence of the built-in surface field on the 180-degree
domain wall profile in primary ferroics within Landau-Ginsburg-Devonshire
phenomenological approach. We predict the effect of domain wall bending near
the surface caused by the built-in field and derived corresponding approximate
analytical expressions. At that the higher is the surface energy contribution
(i.e. the smaller is corresponding extrapolation length) and/or the higher is
the field, the stronger is the bending effect. Built-in surface field is one of
the possible mechanisms of domain wall near surface broadening recently
observed in the ferroics.
