We use NMR quantum simulators to study antiferromagnetic Ising spin chains
undergoing quantum phase transitions. Taking advantage of the sensitivity of
the systems near criticality, we detect the critical points of the transitions
using a direct measurement of the Loschmidt echo. We test our simulators for
spin chains of even and odd numbers of spins, and compare the experimental
results to theoretical predictions.
