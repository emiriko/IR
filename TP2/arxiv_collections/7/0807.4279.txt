In this report we review modern nonlinearity methods that can be used in the
preterm birth analysis. The nonlinear analysis of uterine contraction signals
can provide information regarding physiological changes during the menstrual
cycle and pregnancy. This information can be used both for the preterm birth
prediction and the preterm labor control.
