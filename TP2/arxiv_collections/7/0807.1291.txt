We present a brief review of the current understanding of neutrino flavor
mixing and masses, followed by a discussion of the current and future
experimental programs in neutrinoless double-beta decay, direct neutrino mass
measurements, indirect neutrino mass determination from cosmology, solar
neutrinos and other probes. We emphasize how these programs will improve our
understanding of neutrino masses and flavor mixing.
