High resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements have been carried
out to study the superconducting gap in the (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2 superconductor
with Tc=35 K. Two hole-like Fermi surface sheets around the G(0,0) point
exhibit different superconducting gaps. The inner Fermi surface sheet shows
larger (10-12 meV) and slightly momentum-dependent gap while the outer one has
smaller (7-8 meV) and nearly isotropic gap. The lack of gap node in both Fermi
surface sheets favours s-wave superconducting gap symmetry. Superconducting gap
opening is also observed at the M(pi,pi) point. The two Fermi surface spots
near the M point are gapped below Tc but the gap persists above Tc. The rich
and detailed superconducting gap information will provide key insights and
constraints in understanding pairing mechanism in the iron-based
superconductors.
