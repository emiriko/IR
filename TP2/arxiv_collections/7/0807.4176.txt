We show that seesaw models based on flavor symmetries (such as A_4 and Z_7 X
Z_3) which produce exact tribimaximal neutrino mixing, also imply a vanishing
leptogenesis asymmetry. We show that higher order symmetry breaking corrections
in these models can give a non-zero leptogenesis asymmetry and generically also
give deviations from tribimaximal mixing and a non-zero theta13 >~ 10^(-2)
