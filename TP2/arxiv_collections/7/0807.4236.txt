For two or more classes (or types) of points, nearest neighbor contingency
tables (NNCTs) are constructed using nearest neighbor (NN) frequencies and are
used in testing spatial segregation of the classes. Pielou's test of
independence, Dixon's cell-specific, class-specific, and overall tests are the
tests based on NNCTs (i.e., they are NNCT-tests). These tests are designed and
intended for use under the null pattern of random labeling (RL) of completely
mapped data. However, it has been shown that Pielou's test is not appropriate
for testing segregation against the RL pattern while Dixon's tests are. In this
article, we compare Pielou's and Dixon's NNCT-tests; introduce the one-sided
versions of Pielou's test; extend the use of NNCT-tests for testing complete
spatial randomness (CSR) of points from two or more classes (which is called
\emph{CSR independence}, henceforth). We assess the finite sample performance
of the tests by an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study and demonstrate that
Dixon's tests are also appropriate for testing CSR independence; but Pielou's
test and the corresponding one-sided versions are liberal for testing CSR
independence or RL. Furthermore, we show that Pielou's tests are only
appropriate when the NNCT is based on a random sample of (base, NN) pairs. We
also prove the consistency of the tests under their appropriate null
hypotheses. Moreover, we investigate the edge (or boundary) effects on the
NNCT-tests and compare the buffer zone and toroidal edge correction methods for
these tests. We illustrate the tests on a real life and an artificial data set.
