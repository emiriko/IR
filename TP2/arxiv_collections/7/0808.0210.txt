In this letter we define a family of entanglement distribution protocols
assisted by feedback classical communication that gives an operational
interpretation to reverse coherent information, i.e., the symmetric counterpart
of the well known coherent information. This lead to the definition of a new
entanglement distribution capacity that exceeds the unassisted capacity for
some interesting channels.
