Expressions describing the vortex beams, which are generated in a process of
Fresnel diffraction of a Gaussian beam, incident out of waist on a fork-shaped
gratings of arbitrary integer charge p, and vortex spots in the case of
Fraunhofer diffraction by these gratings are deduced. The common general
transmission function of the gratings is defined and specialized for the cases
of amplitude holograms, binary amplitude gratings, and their phase versions.
Optical vortex beams, or carriers of phase singularity with charges mp and -mp,
are the higher negative and positive diffraction order beams. The radial part
of their wave amplitudes is described by the product of mp-th order
Gauss-doughnut function and a Kummer function, or by the first order
Gauss-doughnut function and a difference of two modified Bessel functions,
whose orders do not match the singularity charge value. The wave amplitude and
the intensity distributions are discussed for the near and far field, in the
focal plane of a convergent lens, as well as the specialization of the results
when the grating charge p=0, i.e. the grating turns from forked into
rectilinear. The analytical expressions for the vortex radii are also
discussed.
