We propose a scheme to investigate the nonequilibrium work distribution of a
quantum particle under well controlled transformations of the external
potential, exploiting the versatility of a single ion in a segmented linear
Paul trap. We describe in detail how the motional quantum state of a single ion
can be prepared, manipulated and finally read out to fully determine the free
energy difference in both harmonic and anharmonic potentials. Uniquely to our
system, we show how an ion may be immersed in an engineered laser--field
reservoir. Trapped ions therefore represent an ideal tool for investigating the
Jarzynski equality in open and closed quantum systems.
