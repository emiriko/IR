The mean-first-passage-times (MFPTs) for a vacancy that diffuses (via one-
and six-jump cycles) in a two dimensional ordered binary alloy are evaluated
using the properties of random walks on networks. We investigate the effect of
temperature and relative barrier height on the ratio between the MFPTs of the
two cycles. We find that the six-jump cycle takes shorter time than the
one-jump cycle for the range of parameters considered.
