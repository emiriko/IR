This paper reports the solution of the equation of motion for a domain wall
in a magnetic material which exhibits high magneto-crystalline anisotropy.
Starting from the Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation for field-induced motion,
we solve the equation to give an analytical expression, which specifies the
domain wall position as a function of time. Taking parameters from a Co/Pt
multilayer system, we find good quantitative agreement between calculated and
experimentally determined wall velocities, and show that high field uniform
wall motion occurs when wall rigidity is assumed.
