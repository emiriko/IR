We study (4+2n)-dimensional N=1 super Yang-Mills theory on the orbifold
background with non-vanishing magnetic flux. In particular, we study zero-modes
of spinor fields. The flavor structure of our models is different from one in
magnetized torus models, and would be interesting in realistic model building.
