The valuation of counterparty risk for single name credit derivatives
requires the computa- tion of joint distributions of default times of two
default-prone entities. For a Merton-type model, we derive some formulas for
these joint distribu- tions. As an application, closed formulas for
counterparty risk on a CDS or for a first-to-default swap on two underlyings
are obtained.
