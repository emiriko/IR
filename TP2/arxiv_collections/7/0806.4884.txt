We have studied numerically the statistics for electronic states
(level-spacings and participation ratios) from disordered graphene of finite
size, described by the aspect ratio $W/L$ and various geometries, including
finite or torroidal, chiral or achiral carbon nanotubes. Quantum chaotic Wigner
energy level-spacing distribution is found for weak disorder, even
infinitesimally small disorder for wide and short samples ($W/L>>1$), while for
strong disorder Anderson localization with Poisson level-statistics always sets
in. Although pure graphene near the Dirac point corresponds to integrable
ballistic statistics chaotic diffusive behavior is more common for realistic
samples.
