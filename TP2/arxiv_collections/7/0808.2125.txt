Data mining is a recognized predictive tool in a variety of areas ranging
from bioinformatics and drug design to crystal structure prediction. In the
present study, an electronic structure implementation has been combined with
structural data from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database to generate
results for highly accelerated electronic structure calculations of about
22,000 inorganic compounds. It is shown how data mining algorithms employed on
the database can identify new functional materials with desired materials
properties, resulting in a prediction of 136 novel materials with potential for
use as detector materials for ionizing radiation. The methodology behind the
automatized ab-initio approach is presented, results are tabulated and a
version of the complete database is made available at the internet web site
