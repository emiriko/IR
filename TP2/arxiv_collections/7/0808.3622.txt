New models for evolutionary processes of mutation accumulation allow
hypotheses about the age-specificity of mutational effects to be translated
into predictions of heterogeneous population hazard functions. We apply these
models to questions in the biodemography of longevity, including proposed
explanations of Gompertz hazards and mortality plateaus, and use them to
explore the possibility of melding evolutionary and functional models of aging.
