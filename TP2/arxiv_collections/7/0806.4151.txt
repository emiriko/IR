For any finite, real reflection group $W$, we construct a geometric basis for
the homology of the corresponding non-crossing partition lattice. We relate
this to the basis for the homology of the corresponding intersection lattice
introduced by Bj\"{o}rner and Wachs in \cite{BW} using a general construction
of a generic affine hyperplane for the central hyperplane arrangement defined
by $W$.
