Using the exact renormalization group, it is shown that no physically
acceptable non-trivial fixed points, with positive anomalous dimension, exist
for (i) O(N) scalar field theory in four or more dimensions, (ii) non-compact,
pure Abelian gauge theory in any dimension. It is then shown, for both theories
in any dimension, that otherwise physically acceptable non-trivial fixed points
with negative anomalous dimension are non-unitary. In addition, a very simple
demonstration is given, directly from the exact renormalization group, that
should a critical fixed point exist for either theory in any dimension, then
the n-point correlation functions exhibit the expected behaviour.
