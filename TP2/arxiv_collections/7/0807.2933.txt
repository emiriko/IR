Dynamics of quenching temperature is studied in pure and random Ising chains.
Using the Kibble-Zurek argument, we obtain for the pure Ising model that the
density of kinks after quenching decays as 1/\sqrt{\tau} with the quench rate
of temperature 1/\tau for large \tau. For the random Ising model, we show that
decay rates of the density of kinks and the residual energy are 1/\ln\tau and
1/(\ln\tau)^2 for large \tau respectively. Analytic results for the random
Ising model are confirmed by the Monte-Carlo simulation. Our results reveal a
clear difference between classical and quantum quenches in the random Ising
chain.
