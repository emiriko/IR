In this talk, we are concerned with the formulation and understanding of the
combinatorics of time-ordered n-point functions in terms of the Hopf algebra of
field operators. Mathematically, this problem can be formulated as one in
combinatorics or graph theory. It consists in finding a recursive algorithm
that generates all connected graphs in their Hopf algebraic representation.
This representation can be used directly and efficiently in evaluating Feynman
graphs as contributions to the n-point functions.
