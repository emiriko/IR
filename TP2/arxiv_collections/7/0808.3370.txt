We determine charge transfer statistics in a quantum conductor driven by a
time-dependent voltage and identify the elementary transport processes. At zero
temperature unidirectional and bidirectional single charge transfers occur. The
unidirectional processes involve electrons injected from the source terminal
due to excess dc bias voltage. The bidirectional processes involve
electron-hole pairs created by time-dependent voltage bias. This interpretation
is further supported by the charge transfer statistics in a multiterminal beam
splitter geometry in which injected electrons and holes can be partitioned into
different outgoing terminals. The probabilities of elementary processes can be
probed by noise measurements: the unidirectional processes set the dc noise
level while bidirectional ones give rise to the excess noise. For ac voltage
drive, the noise oscillates with increasing the driving amplitude. The
decomposition of the noise into the contributions of elementary processes
identifies the origin of these oscillations: the number of electron-hole pairs
generated per cycle increases with increasing the amplitude. The decomposition
of the noise into elementary processes is studied for different time-dependent
voltages. The method we use is also suitable for systematic calculation of
higher-order current correlators at finite temperature. We obtain current noise
power and the third cumulant in the presence of time-dependent voltage drive.
The charge transfer statistics at finite temperature can be interpreted in
terms of multiple charge transfers with probabilities which depend on energy
and temperature.
