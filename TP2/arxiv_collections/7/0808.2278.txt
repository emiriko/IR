We present the results of numerical simulations of fluctuations of the
electrostatic potential and electric field inside cavities created in the fluid
of dipolar hard spheres. We found that the thermodynamics of polar solvation
dramatically changes its regime when the cavity size becomes about 4-5 times
larger than the size of the liquid particle. The range of small cavities can be
reasonably understood within the framework of current solvation models. On the
contrary, the regime of large cavities is characterized by a significant
softening of the cavity interface resulting in a decay of the fluctuation
variances with the cavity size much faster than anticipated by both the
continuum electrostatics and microscopic theories. For instance, the variance
of potential decays with the cavity size $R_0$ approximately as $1/R_0^{4-6}$
instead of the $1/R_0$ scaling expected from standard electrostatics. Our
results suggest that cores of non-polar molecular assemblies in polar liquids
lose solvation strength much faster than is traditionally anticipated.
