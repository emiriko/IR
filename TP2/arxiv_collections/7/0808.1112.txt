The expressions of solutions for general $n\times m$ matrix-valued
inhomogeneous linear stochastic differential equations are derived. This
generalizes a result of Jaschke (2003) for scalar inhomogeneous linear
stochastic differential equations. As an application, some $\R^n$ vector-valued
inhomogeneous nonlinear stochastic differential equations are reduced to random
differential equations, facilitating pathwise study of the solutions.
