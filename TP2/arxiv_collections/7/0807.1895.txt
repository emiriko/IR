The crystal structures of the triangular lattice, layered anhydrous alums
KCr(SO4)2, RbCr(SO4)2 and KAl(SO4)2 are characterized by X-ray and neutron
powder diffraction at temperatures between 1.4 and 773 K. The compounds all
crystallize in the space group P-3, with octahedral coordination of the
trivalent cations. In all cases, small amounts of disorder in the stacking of
the triangular layers of corner sharing MO6 octahedra and SO4 tetrahedra is
seen, with the MO6-SO4 network rotated in opposite directions between layers.
The electron diffraction study of KCr(SO4)2 supports this model, which on
average can be taken to imply trigonal prismatic coordination for the M3+ ions;
as was previously reported for the prototype anhydrous alum KAl(SO4)2. The
temperature dependent magnetic susceptibilities for ACr(SO4)2 (A = K,Rb,Cs)
indicate the presence of predominantly ferromagnetic interactions. Low
temperature powder neutron diffraction reveals that the magnetic ordering is
ferromagnetic in-plane, with antiferromagnetic ordering between planes below 3
K.
