A surface magnetoelectric effect is revealed by density-functional
calculations that are applied to ferromagnetic Fe(001), Ni(001) and Co(0001)
films in the presence of external electric field. The effect originates from
spin-dependent screening of the electric field which leads to notable changes
in the surface magnetization and the surface magnetocrystalline anisotropy.
These results are of considerable interest in the area of
electrically-controlled magnetism and magnetoelectric phenomena.
