The signal to noise ratio, which plays such an important r\^ole in
information theory, is shown to become pointless for digital communications
where the demodulation is achieved via new fast estimation techniques.
Operational calculus, differential algebra, noncommutative algebra and
nonstandard analysis are the main mathematical tools.
