We have experimentally found related anomalies in electrical resistivity, dc
and ac magnetic susceptibility, appearing deeply within ferromagnetically
ordered state in SrRuO3. Lack of Jahn-Teller distortion in this regime rules
out conventional orbital order, forcing one to describe these in terms of an
orbital liquid ground state coexisting with ferromagnetic spin order. We
suggest that weak spin-orbit coupling in such an unusual state underpins the
observed anomalies.
