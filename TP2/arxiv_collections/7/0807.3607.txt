In a previous paper, we proposed a simple extension of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model which gives rise to thermal inflation and
baryogenesis in a natural and remarkably consistent way. In this paper, we
consider the $\lambda_\phi = 0$ special case of our model, which is the minimal
way to incorporate a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. The axino/flatino becomes the
lightest supersymmetric particle with $m_\axino \sim 1$ to $10 \GeV$ and is
typically over-produced during the flaton decay. Interestingly though, the dark
matter abundance is minimized for $m_\axino \sim 1 \GeV$, $f_a \sim 10^{11}$ to
$10^{12} \GeV$ and $|\mu| \sim 400 \GeV$ to $2 \TeV$ at an abundance coincident
with the observed abundance and with significant amounts of both axions and
axinos. Futhermore, for these values the baryon abundance naturally matches the
observed abundance.
