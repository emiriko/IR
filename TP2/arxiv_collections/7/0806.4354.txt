The Activation-Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) is an eigenvector
following method for systematic search of saddle points and transition pathways
on a given potential energy surface. We propose a variation of this method
aiming at improving the efficiency of the local convergence close to the saddle
point. We prove the convergence and robustness of this new algorithm. The
efficiency of the method is tested in the case of point defects in body
centered cubic iron.
