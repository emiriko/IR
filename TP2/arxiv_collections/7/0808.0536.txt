A general method is proposed to design the cylindrical cloak, concentrator
and superscatterer with arbitrary cross section. The method is demonstrated by
the design of a perfect electrical conductor (PEC) reshaper which is able to
reshape a PEC cylinder arbitrarily by combining the concept of cloak,
concentrator and superscatterer together. Numerical simulations are performed
to demonstrate its properties.
