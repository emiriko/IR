The notion of (Z/2Z) x (Z/2Z)-symmetric spaces is a generalization of
classical symmetric spaces, where the group Z/2Z is replaced by (Z/2Z) x
(Z/2Z). In this article, a classification is given of the (Z/2Z) x
(Z/2Z)-symmetric spaces G/K where G is an exceptional compact Lie group or
Spin(8), complementing recent results of Bahturin and Goze. Our results are
equivalent to a classification of (Z/2Z) x (Z/2Z)-gradings on the exceptional
simple Lie algebras e6, e7, e8, f4, g2 and so(8).
