We present the results of the first joint search for gravitational-wave
bursts by the LIGO and GEO600 detectors. We search for bursts with
characteristic central frequencies in the band 768 to 2048 Hz in the data
acquired between the 22nd of February and the 23rd of March, 2005 (fourth LSC
Science Run - S4). We discuss the inclusion of the GEO600 data in the
Waveburst-CorrPower pipeline that first searches for coincident excess power
events without taking into account differences in the antenna responses or
strain sensitivities of the various detectors. We compare the performance of
this pipeline to that of the coherent Waveburst pipeline based on the maximum
likelihood statistic. This likelihood statistic is derived from a coherent sum
of the detector data streams that takes into account the antenna patterns and
sensitivities of the different detectors in the network. We find that the
coherentWaveburst pipeline is sensitive to signals of amplitude 30 - 50%
smaller than the Waveburst-CorrPower pipeline. We perform a search for
gravitational-wave bursts using both pipelines and find no detection candidates
in the S4 data set when all four instruments were operating stably.
