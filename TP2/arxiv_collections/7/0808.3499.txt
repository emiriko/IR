Differential systems with a Fuchsian linear part are studied in regions
including all the singularities in the complex plane of these equations. Such
systems are not necessarily analytically equivalent to their linear part (they
are not linearizable) and obstructions are found as a unique nonlinear
correction after which the system becomes formally linearizable.
  More generally, normal forms are found.
  The corrections and the normal forms are found constructively. Expansions in
multiple orthogonal polynomials and their generalization to matrix-valued
polynomials are instrumental to these constructions.
