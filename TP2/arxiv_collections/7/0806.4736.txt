Using muon spin rotation we determine the zero temperature staggered
antiferromagnetic order parameter M0 versus hole doping measured from optimum
Dp_m, in the (Ca_{x}La_{1-x})(Ba_{1.75-x}La_{0.25+x})Cu_{3}O_{y} system. In
this system the maximum Tc and the superexchange J vary by 30% between families
(x). M0(x,Dp_m) is found to be x-independent. Using neutron diffraction we also
determine the lattice parameters variations for all x and doping. The oxygen
buckling angle is found to change with x, implying a change in the holes
kinetic energy. We discuss the surprising insensitivity of M0(x,Dp_m) to the
kinetic energy variations in the framework of the t-J model.
