Correlated basis function perturbation theory and the formalism of cluster
expansions have been recently employed to obtain an effective interaction from
a state-of-the-art nucleon nucleon potential model. The approach based on the
effective interaction allows for a consistent description of the nuclear matter
ground state and nucleon-nucleon scattering in the nuclear medium. This paper
reports the the results of numerical calculations of different properties of
nuclear and neutron matter, including the equation of state and the shear
viscosity and thermal conductivity transport coefficients, carried out using
the effective interaction.
