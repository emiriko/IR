In the littlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT) new flavor-changing
interactions between mirror fermions and the Standard Model (SM) fermions can
induce various FCNC decays for B-mesons, Z-boson and Higgs boson. Since all
these decays induced in the LHT model are correlated, we in this work perform a
collective study for these decays, namely the Z-boson decay Z -> b s_bar, the
Higgs boson decay h -> b s_bar, and the B-meson decays B -> X_s \gamma, B_s ->
\mu^+\mu^- and B -> X_s \mu^+ \mu^-. We find that under the current
experimental constraints from the B-decays, the branching ratios of both Z -> b
s_bar and h -> b s_bar can still deviate from the SM predictions significantly.
In the parameter space allowed by the B-decays, the branching ratio of Z -> b
s_bar can be enhanced to 10^{-7} (about one order above the SM prediction)
while h -> b s_bar can be much suppressed relative to the SM prediction (about
one order below the SM prediction).
