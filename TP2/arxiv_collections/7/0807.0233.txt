We study the evolution of rotational response of a hydrodynamic model of a
two-component superfluid with a non-dissipative drag interaction, as the system
undergoes a transition into a paired phase at finite temperature. The
transition manifests itself in a change of (i) vortex lattice symmetry, and
(ii) nature of vortex state. Instead of a vortex lattice, the system forms a
highly disordered tangle which constantly undergoes merger and reconnecting
processes involving different types of vortices, with a "hidden" breakdown of
translational symmetry.
