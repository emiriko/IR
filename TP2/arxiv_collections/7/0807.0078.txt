Using a two-channel model, we show that the number of closed channel
molecules in a two-component Fermi gas close to a Feshbach resonance is
directly related to the derivative of the energy of the gas with respect to the
inverse scattering length. We extract this quantity from the fixed node
Monte-Carlo equation of state and we compare to the number of closed channel
molecules measured in the Rice experiment with lithium [Partridge et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 95, 020404 (2005)]. We also discuss the effect of a difference
between the trapping potentials seen by a closed-channel molecule and by an
open-channel pair of atoms in terms of an effective position-dependent
scattering length.
