If a central vector potential V(r,a) in the Dirac equation is monotone in a
parameter 'a', then a discrete eigenvalue E(a) is monotone in 'a'. For such a
special class of comparisons, this generalizes an earlier comparison theorem
that was restricted to node free states. Moreover, the present theorem applies
to every discrete eigenvalue.
