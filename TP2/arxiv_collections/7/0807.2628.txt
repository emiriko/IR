We present HIC (Human-system Interaction Container), a general framework for
the integration of advanced interaction in the software development process. We
show how this framework allows to reconcile the software development methods
(such MDA, MDE) with the architectural models of software design such as MVC or
PAC. We illustrate our approach thanks to two different types of implementation
for this concept in two different business areas: one software design pattern,
MVIC (Model View Interaction Control) and one architectural model, IM
(Interaction Middleware).
