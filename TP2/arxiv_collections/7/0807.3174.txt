Using ab initio density functional theory and quantum transport calculations
based on nonequilibrium Green's function formalism we study structural,
electronic, and transport properties of hydrogen-terminated short graphene
nanoribbons (graphene flakes) and their functionalization with vanadium atoms.
Rectangular graphene flakes are stable, having geometric and electronic
structures quite similar to that of extended graphene nanoribbons. We show that
a spin-polarized current can be produced by pure, hydrogenated rectangular
graphene flakes by exploiting the spatially-separated edge states of the flake
using asymmetric, non-magnetic contacts. Functionalization of the graphene
flake with magnetic adatoms such as vanadium also leads to spin-polarized
currents even with symmetric contacts. We observe and discuss sharp
discontinuities in the transmission spectra which arise from Fano resonances of
localized states in the flake.
