In the current paper we present a graphical user interface useful for
settings input parameter of the Windows precompiled binaries for the Parallel
Finite Element Micromagnetics Package (MagPar). The Package is used for
magnetization dynamics analysis on a base of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)
equation. In an available version of the MagPar package there are several text
files which control simulations. Presented here graphical extension (MagParExt)
enables easy preparation of input and output data, stored in text files, and
additionally, direct and fast creation of figures obtained from dependencies
between simulated physical quantities.
