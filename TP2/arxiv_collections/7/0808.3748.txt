We present the first infrared and optical study in the normal state of
ab-plane oriented single crystals of the iron-oxypnictide superconductor
LaFePO. We find that this material is a low carrier density metal with a
moderate level of correlations and exhibits signatures of electron-boson
coupling. The data is consistent with the presence of coherent quasiparticles
in LaFePO.
