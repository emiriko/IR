The properties of the B-meson light-cone wave function up to next-to-leading
order Fock state expansion have been studied through a comparative study of the
$B\to \pi$, $K$ transition form factors within the $k_T$ factorization approach
and the light-cone sum rule analysis. The transition form factors
$F^{B\to\pi}_{+,0,T}$ and $F^{B\to K}_{+,0,T}$ are carefully re-calculated up
to ${\cal O}(1/m_b^2)$ within the $k_T$ factorization approach in the large
recoil region, in which the main theoretical uncertainties are discussed. The
QCD light-cone sum rule is applicable in the large and intermediate energy
regions, and the QCD light-cone sum rule results in Ref.\cite{sumrule} are
adopted for such a comparative study. It is found that when the two
phenomenological parameters $\bar\Lambda\in [0.50,0.55]$ and
$\delta\in[0.25,0.30]$, the results of $F^{B\to\pi}_{+,0,T}(Q^2)$ and $F^{B\to
K}_{+,0,T}(Q^2)$ from these two approaches are consistent with each other in
the large recoil energy region.
