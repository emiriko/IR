In the paper, we provide some examples of MF algebras by considering minimal
or maximal tensor products of MF algebras and crossed products of MF algebras
by finite groups or an integer group. We also present some examples of
C$^*$-algebras, whose BDF extension semigroup is not group. These examples
include, for example, $
  C_r^*(F_n)\otimes_{max} C^*(F_n) $, $ C_r^*(F_n)\otimes_{min} C^*(F_n) $,
$C_r^*(H_1\ast H_2)$ with $2\le |H_1|<\infty$ and $3\le |H_2|<\infty$ where
$|H_1|$, $|H_2|$ are the orders of thr groups $H1$, or $H_2$ respectively, and
many others.
