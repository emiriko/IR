Motivated by models of holographic technicolor, we discuss a four-site
deconstructed Higgsless model with nontrivial wavefunction mixing. We compute
the spectrum of the model, the electroweak triple gauge boson vertices, and,
for brane-localized fermions, the electroweak parameters to O(M^2_W/M^2_rho).
We discuss the conditions under which "S" vanishes (even for brane-localized
fermions) and the (distinct but overlapping) conditions under which the
phenomenologically interesting decay a_1 to W gamma is non-zero and suppressed
by only one power of M_W/M_rho.
