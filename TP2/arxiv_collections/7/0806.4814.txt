An general survey of the superconducting (SC) gap study in the title
compounds by point-contact (PC) spectroscopy is presented. The SC gap was
determined from dV/dI of PCs employing the well-known theory of conductivity
for normal metal-superconductor PCs accounting Andreev reflection. The theory
was modified by including pair-breaking effects considering the presence of
magnetic rare-earth ions. A possible multiband structure of these compounds was
also taken into account. The PC study of the gap in the Er-compound
(TN=6K<Tc=11K) gives =evidence for the presence of two SC gaps. Additionally, a
distinct decrease of both gaps is revealed for R = Er in the antiferromagnetic
(AF) state. For R = Tm (TN=1.5K<Tc=10.5K) a decrease of the SC gap is observed
below 4-5K, while for R = Dy (TN=10.5K>Tc=6.5K) the SC gap has a BCS-like
dependence in the AF state. The SC gap for R = Ho (TN=5.2K<Tc=8.5K) exhibits
below T*=5.6K a single-band BCS-like dependence vanishing above T*, where a
specific magnetic order occurs. The difference in the SC gap behavior in the
title compounds is attributed to different AF ordering.
