We report a scanning tunneling spectroscopy investigation of polycrystalline
SmFeAsO0.85 having a superconducting transition at 52 K. On large regions of
the sample surface the tunneling spectra exhibited V-shaped gap structures with
no coherence peaks, indicating degraded surface properties. In some regions,
however, the coherence peaks were clearly observed, and the V-shaped gaps could
be fit to the theory of tunneling into a d-wave superconductor, yielding gap
values between 8 to 8.5 meV, corresponding to the ratio 2D/KTc ~ 3.55 - 3.8,
which is slightly above the BCS weak-coupling prediction. In other regions the
spectra exhibited zero-bias conductance peaks, consistent with a d-wave order
parameter symmetry.
