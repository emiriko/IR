Single sheets of hexagonal boron nitride on transition metals provide a model
system for single layer dielectrics. The progress in the understanding of h-BN
layers on transition metals of the last 10 years are shortly reviewed.
Particular emphasis lies on the boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111), which is a
corrugated single sheet of h-BN, where the corrugation imposes strong lateral
electric fields. Fermi surface maps of h-BN/Rh(111) and Rh(111) are compared. A
h-BN layer on Rh(111) introduces no new bands at the Fermi energy, which is
expected for an insulator. The lateral electric fields of h-BN nanomesh violate
the conservation law for parallel momentum in photoemission and smear out the
momentum distribution curves on the Fermi surface.
