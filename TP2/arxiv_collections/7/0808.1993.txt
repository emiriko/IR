Consequences of explicit symmetry breaking in a physically motivated model of
SU(N) antiferromagnet in spatial dimensions one and two are studied. It is
shown that the case N=3, which can be realized in spin-1 cold atom systems,
displays special properties distinctly different from those for N>=4.
Qualitative form of the phase diagram depending on the model parameters is
given.
