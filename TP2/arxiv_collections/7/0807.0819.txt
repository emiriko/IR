Mechanical rejuvenation and over-aging of glasses is investigated through
stochastic simulations of the soft glassy rheology (SGR) model. Strain- and
stress-controlled deformation cycles for a wide range of loading conditions are
analyzed and compared to molecular dynamics simulations of a model polymer
glass. Results indicate that deformation causes predominantly rejuvenation,
whereas over-aging occurs only at very low temperature, small strains, and for
high initial energy states. Although the creep compliance in the SGR model
exhibits full aging independent of applied load, large stresses in the
nonlinear creep regime cause configurational changes leading to rejuvenation of
the relaxation time spectrum probed after a stress cycle. During recovery,
however, the rejuvenated state rapidly returns to the original aging trajectory
due to collective relaxations of the internal strain.
