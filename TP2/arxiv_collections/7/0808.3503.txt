We measure the transmission and reflection amplitudes of microwaves in a
resonator coupled to two antennas at room temperature in the regime of weakly
overlapping resonances and in a frequency range of 3 to 16 GHz. Below 10.1 GHz
the resonator simulates a chaotic quantum system. The distribution of the
elements of the scattering matrix S is not Gaussian. The Fourier coefficients
of S are used for a best fit of the autocorrelation function if S to a
theoretical expression based on random--matrix theory. We find very good
agreement below but not above 10.1 GHz.
