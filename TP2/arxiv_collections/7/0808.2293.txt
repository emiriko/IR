We report ^{31}P and ^{139}La NMR studies of (La_{0.87}Ca_{0.13})FePO, which
is a family member of the recently discovered superconductor
LaFeAs(O_{1-x}F_x). In the normal state, Knight shift and $1/T_1T$ show that a
Fermi-liquid state with moderate ferromagnetic fluctuations emerges below 30K.
  From 1/T_1T of ^{31}P and ^{139}La, quasi-two dimensional electronic
structure is suggested, in which the FeP layer is more conductive than the LaO
layer. In the superconducting (SC) state, although a clear Meissner signal was
observed, 1/T_1T increases below T_c, in contrast to a decrease of 1/T_1T due
to the opening of a SC gap, suggesting that novel low-energy spin dynamics
develop in the SC state.
