InN/In nanocomposites with periodical In inclusions amounting up to 30% of
the total volume exhibit bright emission near 0.7 eV explicitly associated with
In clusters. Its energy and intensity depend on the In amount. The principal
absorption edge in the semiconductor host, as given by a photovoltaic response,
is markedly higher than the onset of thermally detected absorption. These
findings, being strongly suggestive of plasmon-dominated emission and
absorption, are discussed in terms of electromagnetic enhancement taking into
account the In parallel-band transitions.
