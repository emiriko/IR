Under a unified theory we investigate the formation of various types of
vector-solitons in two-species Bose-Einstein condensates with arbitrary
scattering lengths. We then show that by tuning the interaction parameter via
Feshbach resonance, transformation between different types of vector solitons
is possible. Our results open up new ways in the quantum control of
multi-species Bose-Einstein condensates.
