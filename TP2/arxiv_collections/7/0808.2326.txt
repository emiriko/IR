Recent measurements of nucleon resonance transition form factors with CLAS at
Jefferson Lab are discussed. The new data resolve a long-standing puzzle of the
nature of the Roper resonance, and confirm the assertion of the symmetric
constituent quark model of the Roper as the first radial excitation of the
nucleon. The data on $n\pi^+$ production at high $Q^2$ confirm the slow fall
off of the $S_{11}(1535)$ transition form factor with $Q^2$, and better
constrain the branching ratios $\beta_{N\pi}=0.50$ and $\beta_{N\eta}=0.45$.
Also, new results on the transition amplitudes for the $D_{13}(1520)$ resonance
are presented showing a rapid change from helicity 3/2 dominance seen at the
real photon point to helicty 1/2 dominance at higher $Q^2$.
