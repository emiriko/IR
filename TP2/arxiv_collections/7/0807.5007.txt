Collisionless damping of electrical waves in plasma is investigated in the
frame of the classical formulation of the problem. The new principle of
regularization of the singular integral is used. The exact solution of the
corresponding dispersion equation is obtained. The results of calculations lead
to existence of discrete spectrum of frequencies and discrete spectrum of
dispersion curves. Analytical results are in good coincidence with results of
direct mathematical experiments. Key words: Foundations of the theory of
