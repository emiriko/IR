Disorder, prevalent in nature, is intimately involved in such spectacular
effects as the fractional quantum Hall effect and vortex pinning in type-II
superconductors. Understanding the role of disorder is therefore of fundamental
interest to materials research and condensed matter physics. Universal
behavior, such as Anderson localization, in disordered non-interacting systems
is well understood. But, the effects of disorder combined with strong
interactions remains an outstanding challenge to theory. Here, we
experimentally probe a paradigm for disordered, strongly-correlated bosonic
systems-the disordered Bose-Hubbard (DBH) model-using a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) of ultra-cold atoms trapped in a completely characterized
disordered optical lattice. We determine that disorder suppresses condensate
fraction for superfluid (SF) or coexisting SF and Mott insulator (MI) phases by
independently varying the disorder strength and the ratio of tunneling to
interaction energy. In the future, these results can constrain theories of the
DBH model and be extended to study disorder for strongly-correlated fermionic
particles.
