We consider the decoherence of photons suffering in phase-damping channels.
By exploring the evolutions of single-photon polarization states and two-photon
polarization-entangled states, we find that different frequency spectrum
envelopes of photons induce different decoherence processes. A white frequency
spectrum can lead the decoherence to an ideal Markovian process. Some color
frequency spectrums can induce asymptotical decoherence, while, some other
color frequency spectrums can make coherence vanish periodically with variable
revival amplitudes. These behaviors result from the non-Markovian effects on
the decoherence process, which may give rise to a revival of coherence after
complete decoherence.
