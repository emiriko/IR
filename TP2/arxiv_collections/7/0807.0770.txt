We consider the ground state of the homogeneous electron gas and we prove
that a Hartree-Fock solution, motivated by previous simulations, has lower
energy than the Fermi gas in the large density limit. This solution is a
metallic phase : the density modulation corresponds to a partially occupied
crystal (the number of sites is larger than the number of electrons).
