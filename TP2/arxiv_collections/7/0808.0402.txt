Finite projective (lattice) geometries defined over rings instead of fields
have recently been recognized to be of great importance for quantum information
theory. We believe that there is much more potential hidden in these geometries
to be unleashed for physics. There exist specific rings over which the
projective spaces feature two principally distinct kinds of basic constituents
(points and/or higher-rank linear subspaces), intricately interwoven with each
other -- unimodular and non-unimodular. We conjecture that these two projective
"degrees of freedom" can rudimentary be associated with spatial and temporal
dimensions of physics, respectively. Our hypothesis is illustrated on the
projective line over the smallest ring of ternions. Both the fundamental
difference and intricate connection between time and space are demonstrated,
and even the ring geometrical germs of the observed macroscopic dimensionality
(3+1) of space-time and the arrow of time are outlined. Some other conceptual
implications of this speculative model (like a hierarchical structure of
physical systems) are also mentioned.
