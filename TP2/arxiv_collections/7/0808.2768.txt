The spin-spiral (SS) type of magnetization is studied with the Hubbard model.
Consideration of noncollinearity of the magnetic moments results in a phase
diagram which consists of regions of the SS and paramagnetic states depending
on the number of electrons and the parameter U/t (U is the Hubbard repulsion,
and t is an overlap integral). A possibility of stabilization of the SS state
with three nonzero components of magnetic moment is considered.
