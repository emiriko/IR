We develop a systematic approach to establish Bell inequalities for qubits
based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We also use the concept of distinct
"roots" of Bell function to classify some well-known Bell inequalities for
qubits. As applications of the approach, we present three new and tight Bell
inequalities for four and three qubits, respectively.
