Numerous theoretical and experimental arguments are presented in favor of the
generation of intermediate $\sigma$-dressed dibaryon in $NN$ interaction at
intermediate and short distances. We argue that this intermediate dibaryon can
be responsible for the strong intermediate-range attraction and the short-range
repulsion in the $NN$ interaction, and also for the short-range correlations in
nuclei. The suggested mechanism for the $\sigma$-dressing of the dibaryon is
identical to that which explains the Roper resonance structure, its dominant
decay modes and its extraordinary low mass. A similar transformation mechanism
from the glue to the scalar field was discovered in $J/\Psi$ decays. The new
experimental data on 2$\pi$-production in the scalar-isoscalar channel produced
in $pn$- and $pd$-collisions and in particular the very recent data on
$\gamma\gamma$ correlations in $p$C and $d$C scattering in the GeV region seems
to corroborate the existence of the $\sigma$-dressed dibaryon in two- and three
nucleon interactions.
