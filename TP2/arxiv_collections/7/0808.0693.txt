The rapid experimental progress in the field of superconducting nanocircuits
gives rise to an increasing quest for advanced quantum-control techniques for
these macroscopically coherent systems. Here we demonstrate theoretically that
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), a well-established method in
quantum optics, should be possible with the quantronium setup of a Cooper-pair
box. We find the parameters which optimize the procedure and show how the
scheme appears to be robust against decoherence and should be realizable even
with the existing technology.
