We prove the Liv\v{s}ic Theorem for arbitrary $GL(m,\mathbb R)$ cocycles. We
consider a hyperbolic dynamical system $f : X \to X$ and a H\"older continuous
function $A: X \to GL(m,\mathbb R)$. We show that if $A$ has trivial periodic
data, i.e. $A(f^{n-1} p) ... A(fp) A(p) = Id$ for each periodic point $p=f^n
p$, then there exists a H\"older continuous function $C: X \to GL(m,\mathbb R)$
satisfying $A (x) = C(f x) C(x) ^{-1}$ for all $x \in X$. The main new
ingredients in the proof are results of independent interest on relations
between the periodic data, Lyapunov exponents, and uniform estimates on growth
of products along orbits for an arbitrary H\"older function $A$.
