We determine diffractive parton distributions of the proton from DGLAP based
fits to HERA data including the twist--4 contribution from longitudinal
polarized virtual photons, which is known to be important in the region of
large beta. The biggest impact of this contribution is on the diffractive gluon
distribution and on the diffractive longitudinal structure function to be
determined from HERA data.
