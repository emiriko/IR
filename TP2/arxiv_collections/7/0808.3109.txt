We extend Knuth's 16 Boolean binary logic operators to fuzzy logic and
neutrosophic logic binary operators. Then we generalize them to n-ary fuzzy
logic and neutrosophic logic operators using the smarandache codification of
the Venn diagram and a defined vector neutrosophic law. In such way, new
operators in neutrosophic logic/set/probability are built.
