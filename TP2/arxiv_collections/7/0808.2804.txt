Results of experimental investigations of a new assumed interaction in nature
with the aid of high-current magnets, torsion and piezoresonance balances,
high-precision gravimeter, fluctuations in intensity of betta-decay of
radioactive elements, plasma devices and manifestations in astrophysics are
presented. A possible explanation of the results obtained based on a hypothesis
of global anisotropy of physical space caused by the existence of a
cosmological vectorial potential A_g, is given. It is shown that the vector A_g
has the following coordinates in the second equatorial coordinate system: right
ascension alpha = 293 +- 10, declination delta = 36 +- 10.
