This paper proposes a new method and algorithm for predicting multivariate
responses in a regression setting. Research into classification of High
Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) data, in particular microarray data, has made
considerable advances, but regression prediction for high-dimensional data with
continuous responses has had less attention. Recently Bair et al (2006)
proposed an efficient prediction method based on supervised principal component
regression (PCR). Motivated by the fact that a larger number of principal
components results in better regression performance, this paper extends the
method of Bair et al in several ways: a comprehensive variable ranking is
combined with a selection of the best number of components for PCR, and the new
method further extends to regression with multivariate responses. The new
method is particularly suited to HDLSS problems. Applications to simulated and
real data demonstrate the performance of the new method. Comparisons with Bair
et al (2006) show that for high-dimensional data in particular the new ranking
results in a smaller number of predictors and smaller errors.
