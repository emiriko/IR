A Raman study of a back gated bilayer graphene sample is presented. The
changes in the Fermi level induced by charge transfer splits the Raman G-band,
hardening its higher component and softening the lower one. These two
components are associated with the symmetric (S) and anti-symmetric vibration
(AS) of the atoms in the two layers, the later one becoming Raman active due to
inversion symmetry breaking. The phonon hardening and softening are explained
by considering the selective coupling of the S and AS phonons with interband
and intraband electron-hole pairs.
