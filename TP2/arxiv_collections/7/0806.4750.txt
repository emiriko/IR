Effective Hamiltonians for LaFeAsO and LaFePO are derived from the
downfolding scheme based on first-principles calculations and provide insights
for newly discovered superconductivity in the family of LnFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$,
Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd. Extended Hubbard Hamiltonians for five
maximally localized Wannier orbitals per Fe are constructed dominantly from
five-fold degenerate iron-3$d$ bands. They contain parameters for effective
Coulomb and exchange interactions screened by the polarization of other
electrons away from the Fermi level. The onsite Coulomb interaction estimated
as 2.2-3.3 eV is compared with the transfer integrals between the
nearest-neighbor Fe-3$d$ Wannier orbitals, 0.2-0.3 eV, indicating moderately
strong electron correlation. The Hund's rule coupling is found to be 0.3-0.6
eV. The derived model offers a firm basis for further studies on physics of
this family of materials. The effective models for As and P compounds turn out
to have very similar screened interactions with slightly narrower bandwidth for
the As compound.
