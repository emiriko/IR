We investigate how hot-electron fluctuations in n-type Si are affected by the
presence of an intense (static) magnetic field in a Hall geometry. By using the
Monte Carlo method, we find that the known Hall-effect-induced redistribution
of electrons among valleys can suppress electron fluctuations with a
simultaneous enhancement of the drift velocity.
