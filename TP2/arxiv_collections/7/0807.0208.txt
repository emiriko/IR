We consider the problem of creating a long-distance entangled state between
two stations of a network, where neighboring nodes are connected by noisy
quantum channels. We show that any two stations can share an entangled pair if
the effective probability for the quantum errors is below a certain threshold,
which is achieved by using local redundant encoding to preserve the global
phase and network-based correction for the bit-flip errors. In contrast to the
convensional quantum repeater schemes we are not limited by the memory
coherence time, because all quantum operations only use one-way classical
communication and can be done in one shot. Meanwhile, the overhead of local
resources only increases logarithmically with the size of the network, making
our proposal favorable to practical applications of long-distance quantum
communication.
