An infinite family of axisymmetric charged dust disks of finite extension is
presented. The disks are obtained by solving the vacuum Einstein-Maxwell
equations for conformastatic spacetimes, which are characterized by only one
metric function. In order to obtain the solutions, it is assumed that the
metric function and the electric potential are functionally related and that
the metric function is functionally dependent of another auxiliary function,
which is taken as a solution of Laplace equation. The solutions for the
auxiliary function are then taken as given by the infinite family of
generalized Kalnajs disks recently obtained by Gonz\'alez and Reina (MNRAS 371,
1873, 2006), which is expressed in terms of the oblate spheroidal coordinates
and represents a well behaved family of finite axisymmetric flat galaxy models.
The so obtained relativistic thin disks have then a charge density that is
equal, except maybe by a sign, to their mass density, in such a way that the
electric and gravitational forces are in exact balance. The energy density of
the disks is everywhere positive and well behaved, vanishing at the edge.
Accordingly, as the disks are made of dust, their energy-momentum tensor it
agrees with all the energy conditions.
