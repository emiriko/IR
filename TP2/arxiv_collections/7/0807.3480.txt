We have prepared the superconducting system LaFe1-yCoyAsO1-xFx (x=0.11) and
carried out measurements of their electrical resistivities r and
superconducting diamagnetisms. 75As- and 135La-NMR studies have also been
carried out. The Knight shift observed for 75As has been found to be suppressed
by the superconductivity, while for 135La, the shift is almost insensitive to
the superconductivity. This result presents rather strong experimental evidence
for the singlet pairing. The Co-doping effect on the superconducting transition
temperature Tc is not so significant as expected for superconductors with
nodes, suggesting that the potential scattering does not seem to primarily
suppress the superconductivity. Even for superconductors without nodes, it may
not be so trivial to expect this small effect, if there are two different
(disconnected) Fermi surfaces whose order parameters have opposite signs. As a
possible explanation of this small Tc suppression seems to be related with the
loss of the itinerant nature of the electrons.
