We investigated a possibility of application of liquid metal contacts for
devices based on thermotunneling. Electric and thermal characteristics of low
wetting contact Hg/Si, and high wetting contacts Hg/Cu were determined and
compared. We got tunneling I-V characteristics for Hg/Si, while for Hg/Cu, I-V
characteristics were ohmic. We explained tunneling I-V characteristics by
presence of nanogap between the contact materials. Heat conductance of high
wetting and low wetting contacts were compared, using calorimeter measurements.
Heat conductance of high wetting contact was 3-4 times more than of low wetting
contact. Both electric and thermal characteristics of liquid metal contact
indicated that it could be used for thermotunneling devices. We solved liquid
Cs in liquid Hg to reduce work function and make liquid metal more suitable for
room temperature cooling. Work function as low as 2.6 eV was obtained.
