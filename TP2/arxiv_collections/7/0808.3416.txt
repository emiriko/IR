This paper proposes a novel uncertainty quantification framework for
computationally demanding systems characterized by a large vector of
non-Gaussian uncertainties. It combines state-of-the-art techniques in advanced
Monte Carlo sampling with Bayesian formulations. The key departure from
existing works is the use of inexpensive, approximate computational models in a
rigorous manner. Such models can readily be derived by coarsening the
discretization size in the solution of the governing PDEs, increasing the time
step when integration of ODEs is performed, using fewer iterations if a
non-linear solver is employed or making use of lower order models. It is shown
that even in cases where the inexact models provide very poor approximations of
the exact response, statistics of the latter can be quantified accurately with
significant reductions in the computational effort. Multiple approximate models
can be used and rigorous confidence bounds of the estimates produced are
provided at all stages.
