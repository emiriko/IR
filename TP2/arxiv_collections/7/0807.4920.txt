Photon storage with 250 ps rise time of the readout optical signal was
implemented with indirect excitons in coupled quantum well nanostructures
(CQW). The storage and release of photons was controlled by the gate voltage
pulse. The transient processes in the CQW were studied by measuring the
kinetics of the exciton emission spectra after application of the gate voltage
pulse. Strong oscillations of the exciton emission wavelength were observed in
the transient regime when the gate voltage pulse was carried over an ordinary
wire. Gating the CQW via an impedance-matched broadband transmission line has
lead to an effective elimination of these transient oscillations and expedient
switching of the exciton energy to a required value within a short time, much
shorter than the exciton lifetime.
