The general expressions for parity violation observables in elastic
scattering of polarized and/or unpolarized electrons from unpolarized deuterons
are given and are numerically evaluated for the kinematics of SAMPLE, PVA4 and
G0 experiments. The dominant contribution from the interference of $\gamma$ and
Z exchange as well as the smaller contributions from strangeness ($s{\bar{s}}$)
components of the nucleon, parity odd admixtures in the deuteron wave function,
anapole moments and radiative corrections are included and discussed in the
context of parity violating electron scattering experiments of present
interest.
