We obtain the approximate solutions for the steady temperature profiles of
materials with a temperature-dependent thermal absorptivity inside a
microannulus with wavy-rough surfaces considering a quasilinear partial
differential equation by the boundary perturbation approach. We found the
critical Frank-Kamanestkii parameter will depend on the small amplitude
wavy-roughness.
