This article reports world averages for measurements of b-hadron and c-hadron
properties obtained by the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG) using the
results available at the end of 2007. For the averaging, common input
parameters used in the various analyses are adjusted (rescaled) to common
values, and known correlations are taken into account. The averages include
branching fractions, lifetimes, neutral meson mixing parameters, CP violation
parameters, and parameters of semileptonic decays.
