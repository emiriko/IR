The validity of the structure-property relationships governing the
deformation behavior of bcc metals was brought into question with recent {\it
ab initio} density functional studies of isolated screw dislocations in Mo and
Ta. These existing relationships were semiclassical in nature, having grown
from atomistic investigations of the deformation properties of the groups V and
VI transition metals. We find that the correct form for these
structure-property relationships is fully quantum mechanical, involving the
coupling of electronic states with the strain field at the core of long
$a/2<111>$ screw dislocations.
