Classical information that is retrieved from a quantum tetrahedron is
intrinsically fuzzy. We present an asymptotically optimal generalized
measurement for the extraction of classical information from a quantum
tetrahedron. For a single tetrahedron the optimal uncertainty in dihedral
angles is shown to scale as an inverse of the surface area. Having commutative
observables allows to show how the clustering of many small tetrahedra leads to
a faster convergence to a classical geometry.
