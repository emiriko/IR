Using a scanning tunneling microscope we have measured the quantum
conductance through a PTCDA molecule for different configurations of the
tip-molecule-surface junction. A peculiar conductance resonance arises at the
Fermi level for certain tip to surface distances. We have relaxed the molecular
junction coordinates and calculated transport by means of the Landauer/Keldysh
approach. The zero bias transmission calculated for fixed tip positions in
lateral dimensions but different tip substrate distances show a clear shift and
sharpening of the molecular chemisorption level on increasing the STM-surface
distance, in agreement with experiment.
