Spontaneous and induced fission in Special Nuclear Material (SNM) such as
235U and 239Pu results in the emission of neutrons and high energy gamma-rays.
The multiplicities of and time correlations between these particles are both
powerful indicators of the presence of fissile material. Detectors sensitive to
these signatures are consequently useful for nuclear material monitoring,
search, and characterization. In this article, we demonstrate sensitivity to
both high energy gamma-rays and neutrons with a water Cerenkov based detector.
Electrons in the detector medium, scattered by gamma-ray interactions, are
detected by their Cerenkov light emission. Sensitivity to neutrons is enhanced
by the addition of a gadolinium compound to the water in low concentrations.
Cerenkov light is similarly produced by an 8 MeV gamma-ray cascade following
neutron capture on the gadolinium. The large solid angle coverage and high
intrinsic efficiency of this detection approach can provide robust and low cost
neutron and gamma-ray detection with a single device.
