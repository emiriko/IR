We give the explicit algorithm computing the motivic generalization of the
Poincare series of the plane curve singularity introduced by A. Campillo, F.
Delgado and S. Gusein-Zade. It is done in terms of the embedded resolution of
the curve. The result is a rational function depending of the parameter q, at
q=1 it coincides with the Alexander polynomial of the corresponding link. For
irreducible curves we relate this invariant to the Heegard-Floer knot
homologies constructed by P. Ozsvath and Z. Szabo. Many explicit examples are
considered.
