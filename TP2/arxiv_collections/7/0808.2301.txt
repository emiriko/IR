This is the fourth of a series of four papers introducing cybersusy, which is
a new approach to supersymmetry breaking in the supersymmetric standard model.
This paper contains a brief summary, and then goes on to the calculation of the
propagators and masses for the leptons, using the cybersusy action deduced in
the three previous papers of this series. The results here are for the general
case of three flavours of leptons.
