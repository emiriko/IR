In this note I mainly focus on the neutrino physics part in my talk and
report the most recent progress made in \cite{YLW0}. It is seen that the
Majorana features of neutrinos and SO(3) gauge flavor symmetry can
simultaneously explain the smallness of neutrino masses and nearly
tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing when combining together with the mechanism of
approximate global U(1) family symmetry. The mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and
CP-violating phase are in general nonzero and testable experimentally at the
allowed sensitivity. The model also predicts the existence of vector-like
Majorana neutrinos and charged leptons as well as new Higgs bosons, some of
them can be light and explored at the LHC and ILC.
