We study degree sequences for simplicial posets and polyhedral complexes,
generalizing the well-studied graphical degree sequences. Here we extend the
more common generalization of vertex-to-facet degree sequences by considering
arbitrary face-to-flag degree sequences. In particular, these may be viewed as
natural refinements of the flag f-vector of the poset. We investigate
properties and relations of these generalized degree sequences, proving linear
relations between flag degree sequences in terms of the composition of rank
jumps of the flag. As a corollary, we recover an f-vector inequality on
simplicial posets first shown by Stanley.
