We propose a nonperturbative definition of N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM). We
realize N=4 SYM on RxS^3 as the theory around a vacuum of the plane wave matrix
model. Our regularization preserves sixteen supersymmetries and the gauge
symmetry. We perform the 1-loop calculation to give evidences that the
superconformal symmetry is restored in the continuum limit.
