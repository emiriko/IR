Consider an absolutely simple abelian variety X over a number field K. If the
absolute endomorphism ring of X is commutative and satisfies certain parity
conditions, then the reduction X_p is absolutely simple for almost all p.
Conversely, if the absolute endomorphism ring of X is noncommutative, then X_p
is reducible for p in a set of positive density.
