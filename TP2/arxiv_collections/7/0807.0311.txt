The algorithm of the creation texts parallel corpora was presented. The
algorithm is based on the use of "key words" in text documents, and on the
means of their automated translation. Key words were singled out by means of
using Russian and Ukrainian morphological dictionaries, as well as dictionaries
of the translation of nouns for the Russian and Ukrainianlanguages. Besides, to
calculate the weights of the terms in the documents, empiric-statistic rules
were used. The algorithm under consideration was realized in the form of a
program complex, integrated into the content-monitoring InfoStream system. As a
result, a parallel bilingual corpora of web-publications containing about 30
thousand documents, was created
