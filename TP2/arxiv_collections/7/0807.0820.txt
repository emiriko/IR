Although negative-refractive-index metamaterials have successfully achieved
subwavelength focusing, image resolution is limited by the presence of losses.
In this Letter, a metal transmission screen with subwavelength spaced slots is
proposed that focuses the near-field beyond the diffraction limit and
furthermore, is easily scaled from microwave frequencies to the optical regime.
An analytical model based on the superposition of shifted beam patterns is
developed that agrees very well with full-wave simulations and is corroborated
by experimental results at microwave frequencies.
