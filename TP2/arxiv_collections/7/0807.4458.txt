We report a measurement of the exclusive e+e- -->Lambda_c+ Lambda_c- cross
section as a function of center-of-mass energy near the Lambda_c+ Lambda_c-
threshold. A clear peak with a significance of 8.2 sigma is observed in the
Lambda_c+ Lambda_c- invariant mass distribution just above threshold. With an
assumption of a resonance origin for the observed peak, a mass and width of
M=(4634^{+8}_{-7}(stat.)^{+5}_{-8}(sys.))Mev/c2 and
Gamma_tot=(92^{+40}_{-24}(stat.)}^{+10}_{-21}(sys.))MeV are determined. The
analysis is based on a study of events with initial-state-radiation photons in
a data sample collected with the Belle detector at the \Upsilon(4S) resonance
and nearby continuum with an integrated luminosity of 695/fb at the KEKB
asymmetric-energy e+e- collider.
