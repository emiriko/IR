YouTube (http://www.youtube.com) is an online, public-access video-sharing
site that allows users to post short streaming-video submissions for open
viewing. Along with Google, MySpace, Facebook, etc. it is one of the great
success stories of the Internet, and is widely used by many of today's
undergraduate students. The higher education sector has recently realised the
potential of YouTube for presenting teaching resources/material to students,
and publicising research. This article considers another potential use for
online video archiving websites such as YouTube and GoogleVideo in higher
education - as an online video archive providing thousands of hours of video
footage for use in lectures. In this article I will discuss why this might be
useful, present some examples that demonstrate the potential for YouTube as a
teaching resource, and highlight some of the copyright and legal issues that
currently impact on the effective use of new online video websites, such as
YouTube, for use as a teaching resource.
