We study the Standard-Model extensions that have the following features: they
violate Lorentz invariance explicitly at high energies; they are unitary,
local, polynomial and renormalizable by weighted power counting; they contain
the vertex (LH)^2, which gives Majorana masses to the neutrinos after symmetry
breaking, and possibly four fermion interactions; they do not contain
right-handed neutrinos, nor other extra fields. We study the simplest CPT
invariant Standard-Model extension of this type in detail and prove the
cancellation of gauge anomalies. We investigate the low-energy recovery of
Lorentz invariance and comment on other types of extensions.
