We measured the electronic properties and gas sensing responses of
template-grown poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT/PSS)-based nanowires. The nanowires have a "striped" structure
(gold-PEDOT/PSS-gold), typically 8um long (1um-6um-1um for each section,
respectively) and 220 nm in diameter. Single-nanowire devices were contacted by
pre-fabricated gold electrodes using dielectrophoretic assembly. A polymer
conductivity of 11.5 +/- 0.7 S/cm and a contact resistance of 27.6 +/- 4 kOhm
were inferred from measurements of nanowires of varying length and diameter.
The nanowire sensors detect a variety of odors, with rapid response and
recovery (seconds). The response (R-R0)/R0 varies as a power law with analyte
concentration.
