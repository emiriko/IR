Quantum spin transport is studied in an interacting quantum dot. It is found
that a conductance "plateau" emerges in the non-linear charge conductance by a
spin bias in the Kondo regime. The conductance plateau, as a complementary to
the Kondo peak, originates from the strong electron correlation and exchange
processes in the quantum dot, and can be regarded as one of the characteristics
in quantum spin transport.
