We show that Mach-like correlations from heavy quark jets in the Gubser et al
AdS/CFT string drag model arise not from the expected (weak) hydrodynamical
Mach sound wakes zone but from a near ``Neck'' zone where strong chromo-viscous
field effects dominated and lead to a distinctive stress in the plasma of the
form $T^{\mu\nu}_{Neck} \propto \surd \lambda T_0^2 Y^{\mu\nu}(x)/x^2$. We
propose that measurement of the jet velocity dependence of moderate $p_T$
hadrons associated with future {\em identified heavy quark jets} at RHIC and
LHC could be used to look for this novel source of conical correlations which
are unrelated to Mach's law.
