New results which correlate SUSY dark matter with LHC signals are presented,
and a brief review of recent developments in supersymmetric and hidden sector
dark matter is given. It is shown that the direct detection of dark matter is
very sensitive to the hierarchical SUSY sparticle spectrum and the spectrum is
very useful in distinguishing models. It is shown that the prospects of the
discovery of neutralino dark matter are very bright on the "Chargino Wall" due
to a copious number of model points on the Wall, where the NLSP is the
Chargino, and the spin independent neutralino-proton cross section is
maintained at high values in the $10^{-44}$cm$^{2}$ range for neutralino masses
up to $\sim 850$ GeV . It is also shown that the direct detection of dark
matter along with lepton plus jet signatures and missing energy provide dual,
and often complementary, probes of supersymmetry. Finally, we discuss an out of
the box possibility for dark matter, which includes dark matter from the hidden
sector, which could either consist of extra weakly interacting dark matter (a
Stino XWIMP), or milli-charged dark matter arising from the Stueckelberg
extensions of the MSSM or the SM.
