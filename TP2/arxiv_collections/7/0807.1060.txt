We report on transport properties of millimetric super-lattices of CoFe
nanoparticles surrounded by organic ligands. R(T)s follow R(T) =
R_0.exp(T/T_0)^0.5 with T_0 ranging from 13 to 256 K. At low temperature I(V)s
follow I=K[(V-V_T)/V_T]^ksi with ksi ranging 3.5 to 5.2. I(V) superpose on a
universal curve when shifted by a voltage proportional to the temperature.
Between 1.8 and 10 K a high-field magnetoresistance with large amplitude and a
strong voltage-dependence is observed. Its amplitude only depends on the
magnetic field/temperature ratio. Its origin is attributed to the presence of
paramagnetic states present at the surface or between the nanoparticles. Below
1.8 K, this high-field magnetoresistance abruptly disappears and inverse
tunnelling magnetoresistance is observed, the amplitude of which does not
exceed 1%. At this low temperature, some samples display in their I(V)
characteristics abrupt and hysteretic transitions between the Coulomb blockade
regime and the conductive regime. The increase of the current during these
transitions can be as high as a factor 30. The electrical noise increases when
the sample is near the transition. The application of a magnetic field
decreases the voltage at which these transitions occur so magnetic-field
induced transitions are also observed. Depending on the applied voltage, the
temperature and the amplitude of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field induced
transitions are either reversible or irreversible. These abrupt and hysteretic
transitions are also observed in resistance-temperature measurements. They
could be the soliton avalanches predicted by Sverdlov et al. [Phys. Rev. B 64,
041302 (R), 2001] or could also be interpreted as a true phase transition
between a Coulomb glass phase to a liquid phase of electrons.
