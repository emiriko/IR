One of the most popular lottery games worldwide is the so-called ``lotto
k/N''. It considers N numbers 1,2,...,N from which k are drawn randomly,
without replacement. A player selects k or more numbers and the first prize is
shared amongst those players whose selected numbers match all of the k randomly
drawn. Exact rules may vary in different countries.
  In this paper, mean values and covariances for the random variables
representing the numbers drawn from this kind of game are presented, with the
aim of using them to audit statistically the consistency of a given sample of
historical results with theoretical values coming from a hypergeometric
statistical model. The method can be adapted to test pseudorandom number
generators.
