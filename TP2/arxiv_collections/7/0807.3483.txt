In this chapter, we propose a new practical codification of the elements of
the Venn diagram in order to easily manipulate the focal elements. In order to
reduce the complexity, the eventual constraints must be integrated in the
codification at the beginning. Hence, we only consider a reduced hyper power
set $D_r^\Theta$ that can be $2^\Theta$ or $D^\Theta$. We describe all the
steps of a general belief function framework. The step of decision is
particularly studied, indeed, when we can decide on intersections of the
singletons of the discernment space no actual decision functions are easily to
use. Hence, two approaches are proposed, an extension of previous one and an
approach based on the specificity of the elements on which to decide. The
principal goal of this chapter is to provide practical codes of a general
belief function framework for the researchers and users needing the belief
function theory.
