We analyze the fermion density of the one-dimensional Hubbard model using
bosonization and numerical DMRG calculations. For finite systems we find a
relatively sharp crossover even for moderate short range interactions into a
region with $4k_F$ density waves as a function of density. The results show
that the unstable fixed point of a spin-incoherent state can dominate the
physical behavior in a large region of parameter space in finite systems. The
crossover may be observable in ultra cold fermionic gases in optical lattices
and in finite quantum wires.
