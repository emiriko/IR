We calculate the ground-state properties of fermionic dipolar atoms or
molecules in a one-dimensional double-tube potential by using the Luttinger
liquid theory and the density matrix renormalization-group calculation. When
the external field is applied near a magic angle with respect to the
double-tube plane, the long-ranged dipolar interaction can generate a
spontaneous correlation between fermions in different tubes, even when the bare
intertube tunneling rate is negligibly small. Such interaction-induced
correlation strongly enhances the contrast of the interference fringes and
therefore can be easily observed in the standard time-of-flight experiment.
