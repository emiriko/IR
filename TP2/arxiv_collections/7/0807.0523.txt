We report that the classical phenomena of optical activity and circular
dichroism, which are traditionally associated with chirality (helicity) of
organic molecules, proteins and inorganic structures, can be observed in
non-chiral artificial media. Intriguingly, our metamaterial structure yields
exceptionally strong resonant optical activity, which also leads to the
appearance of a backward wave, a characteristic sign of negative-index media.
