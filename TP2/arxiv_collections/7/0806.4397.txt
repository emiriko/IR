We have carried out calculations of electron transport through a
metal-molecule-metal junction with metal nanoclusters taking the part of
electrodes. We show that negative differential resistance peaks could appear in
the current-voltage curves. The peaks arise due to narrow features in the
electron density of states of the metal clusters. The proposed analysis is
based on the ab initio computations of the relevant wave functions and energies
within the framework of the density functional theory using NRLMOL software
package.
