Magnetic excitation spectra of quantum spins of Na3Cu2SbO6 with the distorted
honeycomb structure have been measured by neutron inelastic scattering. The
intensity distribution and the dispersion curves of the excitations indicate
that the spin system can be well understood by considering one-dimensional spin
chains formed of Cu2+ ions on a lattice of the alternation of the shorter- and
longer-spacings along the b axis. The exchange interactions between the
neighboring spins with the shorter- and longer-spacings correspond to
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ones, respectively. These findings are
consistent with those we reported previously on the basis of macroscopic
measurements. The observed spin gap is 8.9 meV and the antiferromagnetic- and
ferromagnetic-interactions have been found to be 13.9 and -12.5 meV,
respectively.
