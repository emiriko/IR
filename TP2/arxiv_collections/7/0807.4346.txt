Given any finitely presented group G we find a triangular algebra such that
has two presentations, one with fundamental group G and another with trivial
group. Thus proving that given a collection G1,...,Gn of finitely presented
groups there exist a triangular algebra A such that all Gi appear as
fundamental group of some presentation of A, extending one of the result in
