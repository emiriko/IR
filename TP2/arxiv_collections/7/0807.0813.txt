Given a compact Riemannian spin manifold with positive scalar curvature, we
find a family of connections $\nabla^{A_t}$ for $t\in[0,1]$ on a trivial vector
bundle of sufficiently high rank, such that the first eigenvalue of the twisted
Dirac operator $D_{A_t}$ is nonzero and becomes arbitrarily small as $t\to1$.
However, if one restricts the class of twisting connections considered, then
nonzero lower bounds do exist. We illustrate this fact by establishing a
nonzero lower bound for the Dirac operator twisted by Hermitian-Einstein
connections over Riemann surfaces.
