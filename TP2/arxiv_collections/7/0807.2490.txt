A scheme to generate shared tripartite entangled states, with two-trapped
atoms in a cavity held by Alice (qubits A1 and A2) entangled to a single
trapped atom in a remote lab owned by Bob (B), is proposed. The entanglement is
generated through interaction of trapped atoms with two mode squeezed light
shared by the two cavities. The proposed scheme is an extension of the proposal
of ref. [W. Son, M. S. Kim, J. Lee, and D. Ahn, J. Mod. Opt. 49, 1739 (2002)],
where the possibility of entangling two remote qubits using a bipartite
continuous variable state was examined. While the global negativity detects the
free entanglement of the three atom mixed state, the bound entanglement is
detected by the negativity calculated from pure state decomposition of the
state operator. The partial negativities calculated by selective partial
transposition of the three atom mixed state detect the pairwise entanglement of
qubit pairs A1B, A2B, and A1A2. The entanglement of three atoms is found to be
W-like, no GHZ like quantum correlations being generated.
