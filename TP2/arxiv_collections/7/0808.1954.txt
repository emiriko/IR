The structural changes of TlCoCl$_3$ around phase IV (68 K $<T<$ 75 K) were
studied by single-crystal neutron diffraction measurement. The present
investigation revealed that a small but definite Bragg peak at (${1/6} {1/6}
2$) appeared only in phase IV. A precursor phenomenon of the phase V ($T<$ 68
K) structure in the phase IV temperatures was also identified as the
coexistence of a slightly broadened (${1/4} {1/4} 2$) Bragg peak. We confirmed
that intermediate phase IV is a stable, nontransient, single phase with
$2\sqrt{3}a\times 2\sqrt{3}a\times c$ unit cells. A possible sequence of
structural phase transitions was proposed.
