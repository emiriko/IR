We report the results of a search for the decay B0 -> K*+ K*- with a sample
of 454 +/- 5 million BBbar pairs collected with the BaBar detector at the
PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center. We obtain an upper limit at the 90% confidence level on the branching
fraction for Br(B0 -> K*+ K*-) < 2.0 x 10^{-6}, assuming the decay is fully
longitudinally polarized.
