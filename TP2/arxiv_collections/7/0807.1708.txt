Phase separation under directional quenching has been studied in a
Cahn-Hilliard model. In distinct contrast to the disordered patterns which
develop under a homogeneous quench periodic stripe patterns are generated
behind the quench front. Their wavelength is uniquely defined by the velocity
of the quench interface in a wide range. Numerical simulations match perfectly
analytical results obtained in the limit of small and large velocities of the
quench interface. Additional periodic modulation of the quench interface may
lead to cellular patterns. The quenching protocols analyzed in this paper are
expected to be an effective tool in technological applications to design
nanostructured materials.
