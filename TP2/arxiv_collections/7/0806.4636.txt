In this work we apply the Poincare-Cartan formalism of the Classical Field
Theory to study the systems of balance equations (balance systems). We
introduce the partial k-jet bundles of the configurational bundle and study
their basic properties: partial Cartan structure, prolongation of vector
fields, etc. A constitutive relation C of a balance system is realized as a
mapping between a (partial) k-jet bundle and the extended dual bundle similar
to the Legendre mapping of the Lagrangian Field Theory. Invariant (variational)
form of the balance system corresponding to a constitutive relation C is
studied. Special cases of balance systems -Lagrangian systems of order 1 with
arbitrary sources and RET (Rational Extended Ther- modynamics) systems are
characterized in geometrical terms. Action of auto- morphisms of the
configurational bundle on the constitutive mappings C is studied and it is
shown that the symmetry group Sym(C) of C acts on the sheaf of solutions Sol(C)
of he balance system. Suitable version of Noether Theorem for an action of a
symmetry group is presented together with the special forms for semi-
Lagrangian and RET balance systems and examples of energy momentum and gauge
symmetries balance laws.
