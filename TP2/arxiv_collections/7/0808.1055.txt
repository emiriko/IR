Light charged hadron production data in the current fragmentation region at
HERA are calculated using next-to-leading order perturbative calculations and
fragmentation functions obtained from similar data from e+ e- reactions.
General good agreement is found at large photon virtuality Q^2 and intermediate
momentum fraction x_p, consistent with fragmentation function universality. The
description of the small x_p and Q^2 region is improved by incorporating hadron
mass effects.
