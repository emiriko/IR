As Cosmologists struggle to understand the evolution of our universe, an
often over-looked element is the affect of gravitational radiation on the
primordial plasma field. This appears to be due to the inaccurate approximation
of the primordial plasma field as a simple hydrodynamic fluid, therefore
neglecting the full dynamics of the magneto-fluid. In this paper, we show how
gravitational waves may have had a significant impact on the evolution of our
universe. While more work is needed, the author hopes to eventually develop a
large-scale simulation of structure formation in the early universe, which
takes the interactions of scalar perturbations, gravitational waves, magnetic
fields and a dynamic plasma field into account.
