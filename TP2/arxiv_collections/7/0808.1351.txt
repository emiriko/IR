Lusztig has given a construction of certain representations of reductive
groups over finite local principal ideal rings of characteristic p, extending
the construction of Deligne and Lusztig of representations of reductive groups
over finite fields. We generalize Lusztig's results to reductive groups over
arbitrary finite local rings. This generalization uses the Greenberg functor
and the theory of group schemes over Artinian local rings.
