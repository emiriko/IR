We report extensive lattice dynamical calculations of the newly discovered
infinite-layer iron oxides SrFeO2 and CaFeO2. For SrFeO2, the parameters of the
interatomic potential have been determined to reproduce the zone-centre phonon
frequencies reported using ab-initio calculations. Further we have extended the
potential model for calculations of CaFeO2. The potential parameters are found
to be transferable between the two compounds, and are used to calculate the
phonon spectra in the whole Brillouin zone and several thermodynamic properties
for these compounds. The calculations show fair agreement with the available
experimental data of structure, thermal expansion, and mean-squared amplitudes
of the atoms.
