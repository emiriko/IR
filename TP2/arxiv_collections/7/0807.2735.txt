In kaon physics, several new precision measurements on flavour variables and
CP violation have performed in the recent years. Presented are a new precise
determination of the CKM parameter |V_us|, which combines the results of all
experiments together with recent theoretical progress, and new measurements of
the ratio R_K = Gamma(K+ -> e+ nu)/Gamma(K+ -> mu+ nu), which is sensitive to
contributions of a possible charged Higgs in the SUSY framework. Also, final
results of a precision search for direct CP violation in charged kaon decays
are presented.
