The unconstrained frame-like formulation of an infinite tower of completely
symmetric tensor gauge fields is reviewed and examined in the limit where the
cosmological constant goes to zero. By partially fixing the gauge and solving
the torsion constraints, the form of the gauge transformations in the
unconstrained metric-like formulation are obtained till first order in a weak
field expansion. The algebra of the corresponding gauge symmetries is shown to
be equivalent, at this order and modulo (unphysical) gauge parameter
redefinitions, to the Lie algebra of Hermitian differential operators on R^n,
the restriction of which to the spin-two sector is the Lie algebra of
infinitesimal diffeomorphisms.
