Let $\lie g$ be a simple Lie algebra and let $\bs^{\lie g}$ be the locally
finite part of the algebra of invariants $(_\bc\bv\otimes S(\lie g))^{\lie g}$
where $\bv$ is the direct sum of all simple finite-dimensional modules for
$\lie g$ and $S(\lie g)$ is the symmetric algebra of $\lie g$. Given an
integral weight $\xi$, let $\Psi=\Psi(\xi)$ be the subset of roots which have
maximal scalar product with $\xi$. Given a dominant integral weight $\lambda$
and $\xi$ such that $\Psi$ is a subset of the positive roots we construct a
finite-dimensional subalgebra $\bs^{\lie g}_\Psi(\le_\Psi\lambda)$ of
$\bs^{\lie g}$ and prove that the algebra is Koszul of global dimension at most
the cardinality of $\Psi$. Using this we then construct naturally an
infinite-dimensional Koszul algebra of global dimension equal to the
cardinality of $\Psi$. The results and the methods are motivated by the study
of the category of finite-dimensional representations of the affine and quantum
affine algebras.
