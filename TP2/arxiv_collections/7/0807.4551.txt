To calculate the baryon asymmetry in the baryogenesis via leptogenesis
scenario one usually uses Boltzmann equations with transition amplitudes
computed in vacuum. However, the hot and dense medium and, potentially, the
expansion of the universe can affect the collision terms and hence the
generated asymmetry. In this paper we derive the Boltzmann equation in the
curved space-time from (first-principle) Kadanoff-Baym equations. As one
expects from general considerations, the derived equations are covariant
generalizations of the corresponding equations in Minkowski space-time. We find
that, after the necessary approximations have been performed, only the
left-hand side of the Boltzmann equation depends on the space-time metric. The
amplitudes in the collision term on the right--hand side are independent of the
metric, which justifies earlier calculations where this has been assumed
implicitly. At tree level, the matrix elements coincide with those computed in
vacuum. However, the loop contributions involve additional integrals over the
the distribution function.
