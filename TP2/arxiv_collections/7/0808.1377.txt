We investigate the evolution of a central spin coupled to a spin bath without
internal dynamics. We compare the cases where the bath couples to one or two
components of the spin. It is found that the central spin dynamics is enhanced
in the latter case, which may be interpreted as a frustration of dissipation.
However, the quantum purity of the spin decays fast in both scenarios. We
conclude that symmetric coupling of the bath to two orthogonal components of
the spin inhibits dissipation but not decoherence.
