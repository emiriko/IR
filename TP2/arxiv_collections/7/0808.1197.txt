Radiation damage is an unavoidable process when performing structural
investigations of biological macromolecules with X-ray sources. In
crystallography this process can be limited through damage distribution in a
crystal, while for single molecular imaging it can be outrun by employing short
intense pulses. Secondary electron generation is crucial during damage
formation and we present a study in urea, as model for biomaterial. From first
principles we calculate the band structure and energy loss function, and
subsequently the inelastic electron cross section in urea. Using Molecular
Dynamics simulations, we quantify the damage and study the magnitude and
spatial extent of the electron cloud coming from an incident electron, as well
as the dependence with initial energy.
