We give an elementary introduction to a recent diagrammatic extension of
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) coined dynamical vertex approximation
(D$\Gamma$A). This approach contains the important local correlations of DMFT,
giving, among others, rise to quasiparticle renormalizations, Mott-Hubbard
transitions and magnetism, but also non-local correlations beyond. The latter
are at the very essence of many physical phenomena in strongly correlated
elecectron systems. As correlations are treated equally on all length scales,
D$\Gamma$A allows us to describe physical phenomena such as magnons, quantum
criticality, and the interplay between antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity. We review results hitherto obtained for the Hubbard model in
dimensions d=3, 2, and 1.
