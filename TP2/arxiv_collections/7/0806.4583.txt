We construct an explicit renormalization group (RG) transformation for Levin
and Wen's string-net models on a hexagonal lattice. The transformation leaves
invariant the ground-state "fixed-point" wave function of the string-net
condensed phase. Our construction also produces an exact representation of the
wave function in terms of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz
(MERA). This sets the stage for efficient numerical simulations of string-net
models using MERA algorithms. It also provides an explicit quantum circuit to
prepare the string-net ground-state wave function using a quantum computer.
