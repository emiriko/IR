In their study of a quartic integral, Boros and Moll discovered a special
class of Jacobi polynomials, which we call the Boros-Moll polynomials. Kauers
and Paule proved the conjecture of Moll that these polynomials are log-concave.
In this paper, we show that the Boros-Moll polynomials possess the ratio
monotone property which implies the log-concavity and the spiral property. We
conclude with a conjecture which is stronger than Moll's conjecture on the
$\infty$-log-concavity.
