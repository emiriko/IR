Q-lumps associated with the noncommutative CP^N model in 2+1 dimensions are
constructed. These are solitonic configurations which are time dependent and
rotate with constant angular frequency. Energy of the Q-lumps is E=2 \pi k +
\alpha |Q|, and we find that in a regime in which the noncommutativity
parameter \theta is related to the moduli determining the size of the lumps, it
can be viewed to depend on \theta via the Noether charge Q. We present a
collective coordinate-type analysis signalling that CP^1 Q-lumps remain stable
under small radiative perturbations.
