The recently discovered superconducting - spin density wave materials,
containing Fe and As, have raised huge interest. However most materials
prepared to date, suffer from a varying degree of content of foreign Fe-As
phases, Fe2As, FeAs2 and FeAs, which can lead to wrong conclusions concerning
the properties of these materials. We show here that Mossbauer Spectroscopy is
able to determine quite easily the relative content of the foreign phases. This
procedure is demonstrated by a study of seven samples of superconducting or
spin density wave materials, prepared in three different laboratories.
