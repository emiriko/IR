Student content knowledge and general reasoning abilities are two important
areas in education practice and research. However, there hasn't been much work
in physics education that clearly documents the possible interactions between
content learning and the development of general reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we report one study of a systematic research to investigate the possible
interactions between students' learning of physics content knowledge and the
development of general scientific reasoning abilities. Specifically, this study
seeks to answer the research question of whether and to what extent content
learning may affect the development of general reasoning abilities. College
entrance testing data of freshman college students in both USA and China were
collected using three standardized tests, FCI, BEMA, and Lawson's Classroom
Test of Scientific Reasoning (Lawson Test). The results suggest that years of
rigorous training of physics knowledge in middle and high schools have made
significant impact on Chinese students' ability in solving physics problems,
while such training doesn't seem to have direct effects on their general
ability in scientific reasoning, which was measured to be at the same level as
that of the students in USA. Details of the curriculum structures in the
education systems of USA and China are also compared to provide a basis for
interpreting the assessment data.
