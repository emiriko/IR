We study the properties of a few-electron system confined in coupled
elongated quantum dots (QDs) using a model Gaussian potential and the numerical
exact diagonalization technique. In the absence of magnetic fields, as the
aspect ratio $r$ between the QD extensions in the direction perpendicular and
parallel to the coupling directions increases, the exchange energy exhibits a
sharp variation at the specific value $r=3.9$, before (after) which the
exchange energy increases (declines). The sharp variation occurs because of a
sudden change in the single-particle configuration of the triplet state. The
stability region with one electron in each of the QDs is found to shrink, and
finally vanishes as it becomes progressively easier to localize both electrons
into the lower QD. For $r>3.9$, the first singlet-triplet transition shifts to
a small magnetic fields.
