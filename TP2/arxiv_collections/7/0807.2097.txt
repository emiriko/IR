We study human dynamics by analyzing Linux history files. The goodness-of-fit
test shows that most of the collected datasets belong to the universality class
suggested in the literature by a variable-length queueing process based on
priority. In order to check the validity of this model, we design two tests
based on mutual information between time intervals and a mathematical
relationship known as the arcsine law. Since the previously suggested queueing
process fails to pass these tests, the result suggests that the modelling of
human dynamics should properly consider the statistical dependency in the
temporal dimension.
