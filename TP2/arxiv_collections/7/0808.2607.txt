We consider the magnetic response of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
with both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling to a microwave excitation.
We generalize the results of [A. Shnirman and I. Martin, Europhys. Lett. 78,
27001 (2007).], where pure Rashba coupling was studied. We observe that the
microwave with the in-plane electric field and the out-of-plane magnetic field
creates an out-of-plane spin polarization. The effect is more prominent in
clean systems with resolved spin-orbit-split subbands. Considered as response
to the microwave magnetic field, the spin-orbit contribution to the
magnetization far exceeds the usual Zeeman contribution in the clean limit. The
effect vanishes when the Rashba and the Dresselhaus couplings have equal
strength.
