LaFeAsO1-xFx thin films were deposited successfully on (001)-oriented LaAlO3
and MgO substrates from stoichiometric LaFeAsO1-xFx polycrystalline targets
with fluorine concentrations up to x = 0.25 by PLD. Room temperature deposition
and post annealing of the films yield nearly phase pure films with a pronounced
c-axis texture and a strong biaxial in-plane orientation. Transport
measurements show metallic resistance and onset of superconductivity at 11 K.
Hc2(T) was determined by resistive measurements and yield Hc2 values of 3 T at
3.6 K for B||c and 6 T at 6.4 K for B||ab.
