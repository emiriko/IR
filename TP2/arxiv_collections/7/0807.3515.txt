A contradiction arises when applying standard boundary conditions to a simple
quantum rotator with a single coordinate. New boundary conditions for the
Schroedinger equation are proposed that involve only gauge invariant
quantities, and that can be applied beyond the immediate problem. The use of
gauge invariant boundary conditions has important consequence for energy flow
in or out of a simple rotator.
