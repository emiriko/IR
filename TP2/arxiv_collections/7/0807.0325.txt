We have in earlier papers presented an extension of Mueller's dipole cascade
model, which includes sub-leading effects from energy conservation and running
coupling as well as colour suppressed saturation effects from pomeron loops via
a ``dipole swing''. The model was applied to describe the total and diffractive
cross sections in $pp$ and $\gamma^*p$ collisions, and also the elastic cross
section in $pp$ scattering.
  In this paper we extend the model to describe the corresponding quasi-elastic
cross sections in $\gamma^*p$, namely the exclusive production of vector mesons
and deeply virtual compton scattering. Also for these reactions we find a good
agrement with measured cross sections. In addition we obtain a reasonable
description of the $t$-dependence of the elastic $pp$ and quasi-elastic
$\gamma^\star p$ cross sections.
