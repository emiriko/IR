We consider schemes for secret key distribution which use as a resource
correlations that violate Bell inequalities. We provide the first security
proof for such schemes, according to the strongest notion of security, the so
called universally-composable security. Our security proof does not rely on the
validity of quantum mechanics, it solely relies on the impossibility of
arbitrarily-fast signaling between separate physical systems. This allows for
secret communication in situations where the participants distrust their
quantum devices.
