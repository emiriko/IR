The linear electrodynamic properties of graphene -- the frequency-dependent
conductivity, the transmission spectra and collective excitations -- are
briefly outlined. The non-linear frequency multiplication effects in graphene
are studied, taking into account the influence of the self-consistent-field
effects and of the magnetic field. The predicted phenomena can be used for
creation of new devices for microwave and terahertz optics and electronics.
