Here I discuss the major pitfalls and the most severe mistakes of the above
mentioned paper. The thorough analysis shows that despite all the claims the
present work has nothing to do with the thermalization process in relativistic
heavy ion collisions. In contrast to the authors' beliefs I show that their
main result is not derived, but is a combination of mathematical mistakes and
hand waving arguments.
