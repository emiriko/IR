J. Renault has recently found a generalization of the caracterization of
C*-diagonals obtained by A. Kumjian in the eighties, which in turn is a
C*-algebraic version of J. Feldman and C. Moore's well known Theorem on Cartan
subalgebras of von Neumann algebras. Here we propose to give a version of
Renault's result in which the Cartan subalgebra is not necessarily commutative
[sic]. Instead of describing a Cartan pair as a twisted groupoid C*-algebra we
use N. Sieben's notion of Fell bundles over inverse semigroups which we believe
should be thought of as "twisted etale groupoids with noncommutative unit
space". En passant we prove a theorem on uniqueness of conditional
expectations.
