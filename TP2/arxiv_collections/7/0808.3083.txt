It is shown that quantum systems of identical particles can be treated as if
they were different when they are in well differentiated states. This
simplifying assumption allows the consideration of quantum systems isolated
from the rest of the universe and justifies many intuitive statements about
identical systems. However, it is shown that this simplification may lead to
wrong results in the calculation of the entropy.
