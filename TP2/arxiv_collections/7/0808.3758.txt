Pseudorandom circuits generate quantum states and unitary operators which are
approximately distributed according to the unitarily invariant Haar measure. We
explore how several design parameters affect the efficiency of pseudo-random
circuits, with the goal of identifying relevant trade-offs and optimizing
convergence. The parameters we explore include the choice of single- and
two-qubit gates, the topology of the underlying physical qubit architecture,
the probabilistic application of two-qubit gates, as well as circuit size,
initialization, and the effect of control constraints. Building on the
equivalence between pseudo-random circuits and approximate $t$-designs, a
Markov matrix approach is employed to analyze asymptotic convergence properties
of pseudo-random second-order moments to a 2-design. Quantitative results on
the convergence rate as a function of the circuit size are presented for qubit
topologies with a sufficient degree of symmetry. Our results may be
theoretically and practically useful to optimize the efficiency of random state
and operator generation.
