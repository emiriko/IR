The photoluminescence spectrum of a single quantum dot was recorded as a
secondary resonant laser optically dressed either the vacuum-to-exciton or the
exciton-to-biexciton transitions. High-resolution polarization-resolved
measurements using a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer reveal splittings of
the linearly-polarized fine-structure states that are non-degenerate in an
asymmetric quantum dot. These splittings manifest as either triplets or
doublets and depend sensitively on laser intensity and detuning. Our approach
realizes complete resonant control of a multi-excitonic system in emission,
which can be either pulsed or continuous-wave, and offers direct access to the
emitted photons.
