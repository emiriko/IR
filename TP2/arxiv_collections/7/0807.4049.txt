Raman spectra were measured for mono-, bi- and trilayer graphene grown on SiC
by solid state graphitization, whereby the number of layers was pre-assigned by
angle-resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. It was found that the
only unambiguous fingerprint in Raman spectroscopy to identify the number of
layers for graphene on SiC(0001) is the linewidth of the 2D (or D*) peak. The
Raman spectra of epitaxial graphene show significant differences as compared to
micromechanically cleaved graphene obtained from highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite crystals. The G peak is found to be blue-shifted. The 2D peak does not
exhibit any obvious shoulder structures but it is much broader and almost
resembles a single-peak even for multilayers. Flakes of epitaxial graphene were
transferred from SiC onto SiO2 for further Raman studies. A comparison of the
Raman data obtained for graphene on SiC with data for epitaxial graphene
transferred to SiO2 reveals that the G peak blue-shift is clearly due to the
SiC substrate. The broadened 2D peak however stems from the graphene structure
itself and not from the substrate.
