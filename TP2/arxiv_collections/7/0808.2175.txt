This paper presents analysis of important issues associated with the design
of refractive laser beam shaping systems. The concept of singular radius is
introduced along with solutions to minimize its adverse effect on shaper
performance. In addition, the surface boundary constraint is discussed in
detail. This study provides useful guidelines to circumvent possible design
errors that would degrade the shaper quality or add undesired complication to
the system.
