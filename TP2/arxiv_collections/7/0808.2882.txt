We investigate tunneling properties of a bound pair of Fermi atoms in an
optical lattice, comparing with results obtained in an attractive Hubbard
model. In the strong coupling regime of the Hubbard model, it has been
predicted that the motion of a bound pair between lattice sites is accompanied
by virtual dissociation. To explore the possibility of this interesting
phenomenon in optical lattice, we calculate molecular wavefunction in a
cosine-shape periodic potential. We show that the molecular tunneling
accompanied by dissociation occurs in the intermediate coupling regime of the
optical lattice system. In the strong coupling regime, in contrast to the
prediction in the Hubbard model, the bound pair is shown to tunnel through
lattice potential without dissociation. As a result, the magnitude of molecular
band mass M remains finite even in the strong coupling limit, which is in
contrast to the diverging molecular mass in the case of the Hubbard model.
Including this finite value of molecular band mass, we evaluate the superfluid
phase transition temperature Tc in the BEC limit of the optical lattice system,
where the Hubbard model gives Tc=0 due to the diverging molecular mass.
