Mirror isobars $^7$Li and $^7$Be are investigated in a dicluster model. The
magnetic dipole moments and the magnetic dipole response to the continuum are
calculated in this framework. The magnetic contribution is found to be small
with respect to electric dipole and quadrupole excitations even at
astrophysical energies, at a variance with the case of deuteron. Energy
weighted molecular sum rules are evaluated and a formula for the molecular
magnetic dipole sum rule is found which matches the numerical calculations.
Cross-sections for photo-dissociation and radiative capture as well as the
S-factor for reactions of astrophysical significance are calculated with good
agreement with known experimental data.
