This is a summary of experimental results on photons, leptons, and heavy
quarks presented at Quark Matter 2008. A first measurement of the bottom to
charm contribution to the lepton spectrum has given experimental indication for
the suppression of charm and bottom. Excess dileptons have been observed and
studied by both NA60 and PHENIX, which may arise from the early production of
thermal dileptons and/or the modification of mesons.
