We briefly review the status of the calculation of next-to-next-to-leading
order corrections to large angle Bhabha scattering in pure QED. In particular,
we focus on the analytic calculation of the two-loop virtual corrections
involving a heavy-flavor fermion loop, which was recently completed. We
conclude by assessing the numerical impact of these corrections on the Bhabha
scattering cross section at colliders operating at a center of mass energy of 1
GeV and at the future ILC.
