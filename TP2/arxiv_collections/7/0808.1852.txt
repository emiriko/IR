This article is interested in the origin of the genetic code, it puts forward
a scenario of a simultaneous selection of the bases and amino acids and setting
up of a correlation between them. Each amino acid is associated with a pair of
its own kind, called the binding pair and each binding pair is associated with
the codon(s) corresponding to the same amino acid. An explanation is also
proposed about the origin of the start and stop codons.
