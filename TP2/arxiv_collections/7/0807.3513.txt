We present results from Monte Carlo simulations to test for ultrametricity
and clustering properties in spin-glass models. By using a one-dimensional
Ising spin glass with random power-law interactions where the universality
class of the model can be tuned by changing the power-law exponent, we find
signatures of ultrametric behavior both in the mean-field and non-mean-field
universality classes for large linear system sizes. Furthermore, we confirm the
existence of nontrivial connected components in phase space via a clustering
analysis of configurations.
