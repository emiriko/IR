The equilibrium equations for wide, developable, Moebius strips undergoing
large deformations have recently been derived, and solved, numerically. We use
these results to compute the eigenvalues and eigenstates of non-interacting
electrons confined to Moebius strips of linking number up to 1.5 and of
arbitrary width. The inverse participation ratio is used to show that electrons
are increasingly localised to the higher curvature regions of the higher-width
structures, where sharp creases could form channels for particle transport. Our
geometric formulation could be used to study transport properties of Moebius
strip and other components in nanoscale devices.
