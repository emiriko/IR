Higgs singlet superfields are usually present in most extensions of the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) that address the mu-problem, such
as the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) and the Minimal
Nonminimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MNSSM). Employing a gauge- and
flavour-covariant effective Lagrangian formalism, we show how the singlet Higgs
bosons of such theories can have significant contributions to B-meson
flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) observables for large values of
$\tan\beta \stackrel{>}{{}_\sim} 50$ at the 1-loop level. Illustrative results
are presented including effects on the B_s and B_d mass differences and on the
rare decay $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$. In particular, we find that depending on the
actual value of the lightest singlet pseudoscalar mass in the NMSSM, the
branching ratio for $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ can be enhanced or even suppressed with
respect to the Standard Model prediction by more than one order of magnitude.
