There have been many attempts over the years to derive the Born Rule from the
wave equation since Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation was proposed; however,
none of these have been satisfactory as shown when critics pointed out
loopholes and unsupported assumptions. In this paper the case is made that the
currently fashionable decision-theoretic approach founded by David Deutsch and
explicated by David Wallace is likewise unsatisfactory. A more fundamental
computationalist approach is advocated.
