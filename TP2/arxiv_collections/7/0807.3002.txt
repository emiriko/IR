The nature of epistasis has important consequences for the evolutionary
significance of sex and recombination. Recent efforts to find negative
epistasis as source of negative linkage disequilibrium and associated long-term
sex advantage have yielded little support. Sign epistasis, where the sign of
the fitness effects of alleles varies across genetic backgrounds, is
responsible for ruggedness of the fitness landscape with implications for the
evolution of sex that have been largely unexplored. Here, we describe fitness
landscapes for two sets of strains of the asexual fungus \emph{Aspergillus
niger} involving all combinations of five mutations. We find that $\sim 30$% of
the single-mutation fitness effects are positive despite their negative effect
in the wild-type strain, and that several local fitness maxima and minima are
present. We then compare adaptation of sexual and asexual populations on these
empirical fitness landscapes using simulations. The results show a general
disadvantage of sex on these rugged landscapes, caused by the break down by
recombination of genotypes escaping from local peaks. Sex facilitates escape
from a local peak only for some parameter values on one landscape, indicating
its dependence on the landscape's topography. We discuss possible reasons for
the discrepancy between our results and the reports of faster adaptation of
sexual populations.
