We obtain a variety of predictions for the properties of
population-imbalanced (or polarized) fermionic superfluids near their
tricritical point. In the vicinity of the high-symmetry tricritical point,
observable quantities such as the cloud shape, heat capacity, and local
polarization should exhibit distinct behavior arising from the tricritical
scaling laws, as well as logarithmic corrections to scaling reflecting the
marginal nature of interactions.
