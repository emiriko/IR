A new geometrical perturbation scheme is developed in order to calculate the
electromagnetic fields produced by charged sources in prescribed motion moving
in a non-straight perfectly conducting beam pipe. The pipe is regarded as a
perturbed infinitely long hollow right-circular cylinder. The perturbation
maintains the pipe's circular cross-section while deforming its axis into a
planar space-curve with, in general, non-constant curvature. Various charged
source models are considered including a charged bunch and an off-axis point
particle. In the ultra-relativistic limit this permits a calculation of the
longitudinal wake potential in terms of powers of the product of the pipe
radius and the arbitrarily varying curvature of the axial space-curve. Analytic
expressions to leading order are presented for beam pipes with piecewise
defined constant curvature modelling pipes with straight segments linked by
circular arcs of finite length. The language of differential forms is used
throughout and to illustrate the power of this formalism a pedagogical
introduction is developed by deriving the theory ab-initio from Maxwell's
equations expressed intrinsically as a differential system on (Minkowski)
spacetime.
