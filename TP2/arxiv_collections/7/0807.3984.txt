We prove the longtime existence and convergence of the Calabi flow on toric
Fano surfaces in a large family of Kahler classes where the class has positive
extremal Hamiltonian potential and the initial Calabi energy is bounded by some
constant. This is an extension of our previous work. We use the toric condition
in a more essential way to rule out bubbles.
