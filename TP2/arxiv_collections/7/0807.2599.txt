We summarize the intuitive connection between deformations of parton
distributions in impact parameter space and single-spin asymmetries. Lattice
results for the $x^2$-moment of the twist-3 polarized parton distribution
$g_2(x)$ are used to estimate the average transverse force acting on the active
quark in SIDIS in the instant after being struck by the virtual photon.
