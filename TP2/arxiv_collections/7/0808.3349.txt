A good agreement between a flux tube-based quark model of light baryons
(strange and nonstrange) and the $1/N_c$ expansion mass formula has been found
in previous studies. In the present work a larger connection is established
between the quark model and the $1/N_c$ and $1/m_Q$ expansion method by
extending the previous procedure to baryons made of one heavy and two light
quarks. The compatibility between both approaches is shown to hold in this
sector too.
