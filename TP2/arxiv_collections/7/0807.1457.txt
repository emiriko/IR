In this paper, we study the thermal entanglement in a two-qubit Heisenberg
XYZ system with different Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) couplings. We show that
different DM coupling parameters have different influences on the entanglement
and the critical temperature. In addition, we find that when $J_{i}$
($i$-component spin coupling interaction) is the largest spin coupling
coefficient, $D_{i}$ ($i$-component DM interaction) is the most efficient DM
control parameter, which can be obtained by adjusting the direction of DM
interaction.
