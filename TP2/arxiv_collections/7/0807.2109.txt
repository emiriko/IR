Dynamic rupture propagation along an interface between two different elastic
solids under shear dominated loading is studied numerically by a 2-D lattice
particle model (LPM). The configuration of the lattice particle model consists
of two solid blocks of different elastic properties connected along a planar
interface. Each block is characterized as an isotropic elastic material and the
interface strength is described as a composite elastic modulus of a mismatch
function of the elastic properties of two dissimilar materials. The particle
interaction between the two blocks with pair inter-particle potential also
takes account of normal stress variations.
