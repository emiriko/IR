We investigate numerically the local density of states (LDOS) in the vicinity
of a vortex core in a ferromagnetic superconductor. Specifically, we
investigate how the LDOS is affected by the relative weight of the spin bands
in terms of the superconducting pairing, and we also examine the effect of
different pairing symmetries for the superconducting order parameter. Our
findings are directly related to scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and
may thus be highly useful to clarify details of the superconducting pairing in
recently discovered ferromagnetic superconductors.
