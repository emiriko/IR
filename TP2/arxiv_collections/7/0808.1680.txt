We study the phenomenology of a Z'-boson field coupled to hypercharge. The Z'
propagator has a non-trivial K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral density due to the
mixing with a higher dimensional inert vector field. As a consequence detection
possibilities at hadron colliders are reduced. We determine the range of
parameters where this field can be studied at the Tevatron and the LHC through
its production cross section via the Drell-Yan mechanism.
