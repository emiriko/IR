We discuss conformal symmetry on the two dimensional noncommutative plane
equipped with Moyal product in the twist deformed context. We show that the
consistent use of the twist procedure leads to results which are free from
ambiguities. This lends support to the importance of the use of twist
symmetries in noncommutative geometry.
