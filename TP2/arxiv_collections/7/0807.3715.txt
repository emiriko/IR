The interaction of (two-level) Rydberg atoms with dissipative QED cavity
fields can be described classically or quantum mechanically, even for very low
temperatures and mean number of photons, provided the damping constant is large
enough. We investigate the quantum-classical border, the entanglement and
decoherence of an analytically solvable model, analog to the atom-cavity
system, in which the atom (field) is represented by a (driven and damped)
harmonic oscillator. The maximum value of entanglement is shown to depend on
the initial state and the dissipation-rate to coupling-constant ratio. While in
the original model the atomic entropy never grows appreciably (for large
dissipation rates), in our model it reaches a maximum before decreasing.
Although both models predict small values of entanglement and dissipation, for
fixed times of the order of the inverse of the coupling constant and large
dissipation rates, these quantities decrease faster, as a function of the ratio
of the dissipation rate to the coupling constant, in our model.
