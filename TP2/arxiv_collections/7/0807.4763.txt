We present two simple cryogenic RF ion trap systems in which cryogenic
temperatures and ultra high vacuum pressures can be reached in as little as 12
hours. The ion traps are operated either in a liquid helium bath cryostat or in
a low vibration closed cycle cryostat. The fast turn around time and
availability of buffer gas cooling made the systems ideal for testing
surface-electrode ion traps. The vibration amplitude of the closed cycled
cryostat was found to be below 106 nm. We evaluated the systems by loading
surface-electrode ion traps with $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions using laser ablation, which
is compatible with the cryogenic environment. Using Doppler cooling we observed
small ion crystals in which optically resolved ions have a trapped lifetime
over 2500 minutes.
