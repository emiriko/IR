The Mixmaster dynamics is revisited in a new light as revealing a series of
transitions in the complex scale invariant scalar invariant of the Weyl
curvature tensor best represented by the speciality index $\mathcal{S}$, which
gives a 4-dimensional measure of the evolution of the spacetime independent of
all the 3-dimensional gauge-dependent variables except for the time used to
parametrize it. Its graph versus time characterized by correlated isolated
pulses in its real and imaginary parts corresponding to curvature wall
collisions serves as a sort of electrocardiogram of the Mixmaster universe,
with each such pulse pair arising from a single circuit or ``complex pulse''
around the origin in the complex plane. These pulses in the speciality index
and their limiting points on the real axis seem to invariantly characterize
some of the so called spike solutions in inhomogeneous cosmology and should
play an important role as a gauge invariant lens through which to view current
investigations of inhomogeneous Mixmaster dynamics.
