Elastic neutron-scattering, inelastic x-ray scattering, specific-heat, and
pressure-dependent electrical transport measurements have been made on single
crystals of AuZn and Au_{0.52}Zn_{0.48} above and below their martensitic
transition temperatures (T_M=64K and 45K, respectively). In each composition,
elastic neutron scattering detects new commensurate Bragg peaks (modulation)
appearing at Q = (1.33,0.67,0) at temperatures corresponding to each sample's
T_M. Although the new Bragg peaks appear in a discontinuous manner in the
Au_{0.52}Zn_{0.48} sample, they appear in a continuous manner in AuZn.
Surprising us, the temperature dependence of the AuZn Bragg peak intensity and
the specific-heat jump near the transition temperature are in favorable accord
with a mean-field approximation. A Landau-theory-based fit to the pressure
dependence of the transition temperature suggests the presence of a critical
endpoint in the AuZn phase diagram located at T_M*=2.7K and p*=3.1GPa, with a
quantum saturation temperature \theta_s=48.3 +/- 3.7K.
