Single crystal of Cu0.03TaS2 with low copper intercalated content was
successfully grown via chemical iodine-vapor transport. The structural
characterization results show that the copper intercalated 2H-Cu0.03TaS2 single
crystal has the same structure of the CdI2-type structure as the parent 2H-TaS2
crystal. Electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements reveal that
2H-Cu0.03TaS2 becomes a superconductor below 4.2 K. Besides, electrical
resistivity and Hall effects results show that a charge density wave transition
occurs at TCDW = 50 K.
