Usually the asymptotic behavior for large orders of the perturbation theory
is reached rather slowly. However, in the case of the N-component $\phi^4$
model in D=4 dimensions one can find a special quantity that exhibits an
extremely fast convergence to the asymptotic form. A comparison of the
available 5-loop result for this quantity with the asymptotic value shows
agreement at the 0.1% level. An analogous superfast convergence to the
asymptotic form happens in the case of the O(N)-symmetric anharmonic oscillator
where this convergence has inverse factorial type. The large orders of the
$\epsilon$ expansion for critical exponents manifest a similar effect.
