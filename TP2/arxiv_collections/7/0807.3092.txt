Pump-probe experiments are used as a controllable way to investigate the
properties of photoexcited semiconductors, in particular, the absorption
saturation. We present an experiment-theory comparison for ZnSe quantum wells,
investigating the energy renormalization and bleaching of the excitonic
resonances. Experiments were performed with spin-selective excitation and
above-bandgap pumping. The model, based on the semiconductor Bloch equations in
the screened Hartree-Fock approximation, takes various scattering processes
into account phenomenologically. Comparing numerical results with available
experimental data, we explain the experimental results and find that the
electron spin-flip occurs on a time scale of 30 ps.
