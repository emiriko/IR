A nonlinear transformation approach is formulated for the correlated
fermions' thermodynamics through a medium-scaling effective action. An
auxiliary implicit variable-effective chemical potential is introduced to
characterize the non-Gaussian fluctuations physics. By incorporating the
nonlocal correlation effects, the achieved grand partition function is made of
coupled highly nonlinear parametric equations. Analytically, the low
temperature expansions for the strongly interacting unitary Fermi gas are
performed for the adiabatic compressibility-sound speed and specific heat with
the Sommerfeld lemma. The expressions for the Landau Fermi-Liquid parameters
$F_0^s$ and $F_1^s$ of the strongly interacting fermion system are obtained. As
a universal constant, the effective fermion mass ratio is $m^*/m={10/9}$ at
unitarity.
