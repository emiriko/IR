We present first results from our analysis of the most general quark-quark
correlator of the nucleon, which can be parameterized in terms of so-called
generalized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions. These results
include the first complete parameterization of the nucleon GPDs and TMDs to all
twists as well as new results on possible nontrivial relations between them.
