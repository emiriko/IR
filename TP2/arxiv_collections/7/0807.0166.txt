We study the Sivers effect in transverse single spin asymmetries (SSA) for
pion and kaon production in Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS)
processes. We perform a fit of A^{sin(phi_h-phi_S)}_UT taking into account the
recent data from HERMES and COMPASS Collaborations, which allow a new
determination of the Sivers distribution functions for quark and anti-quark
with u, d and also s flavours. Estimates for forthcoming SIDIS experiments at
COMPASS and JLab are given.
