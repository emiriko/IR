In asymmetric heavy ion collisions like dA or pA, particle production yields
are different in the forward (d- or p-side) and backward (A-side) rapidity
directions. The rapidity distribution reflects the geometry and phase-space
distribution of nuclear matter. These properties may depend on the time
evolution of the collision. Due to the smallness of the backward-forward
differences, the rapidity asymmetry factor can be useful to quantify nuclear
modification effects, like e.g. shadowing and the EMC effect. Our work is a
survey of the nuclear modification factor and the rapidity asymmetries at RHIC
energies. We analyze the rapidity dependence and the strength of the nuclear
effects. We focus on the high transverse momentum region, and make predictions
for the role of nuclear modifications and rapidity asymmetries for future
experimental measurements at increasing absolute values of rapidity.
