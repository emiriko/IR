Theories of proximity effect in layered superconductor-normal metal
structures usually deal with a hypothetic normal metal with no interaction
between electrons and with finite temperatures often close to the
superconductor critical temperature. We present an asymptotic solution of the
Gor'kov equations in the opposite low-temperature limit for a clean normal
metal with a repulsive interaction between electrons. The order parameter in
the metal exhibits a power-law decay, Delta(x) is proportional to 1/x, as a
function of the distance from the SN boundary, x, with a proximity length
strongly depending on the repulsive interaction.
