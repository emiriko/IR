We derive expressions for the shear modulus of deeply-quenched, glassy
solids, in terms of a Cauchy-Born free energy expansion around a rigid
(quenched) reference state, following the approach due to Alexander [Alexander,
Phys. Rep. 296, 1998]. Continuum-limit explicit expressions of the shear
modulus are derived starting from the microscopic Hamiltonians of central and
bond-bending interactions. The applicability of the expressions to dense
covalent glasses as well as colloidal glasses with strongly attractive and
adhesive bonds is discussed.
