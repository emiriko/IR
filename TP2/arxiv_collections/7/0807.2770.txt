Epitaxial graphene on Ir(111) prepared in excellent structural quality is
investigated by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. It clearly displays
a Dirac cone with the Dirac point shifted only slightly above the Fermi level.
The moire resulting from the overlaid graphene and Ir(111) surface lattices
imposes a superperiodic potential giving rise to Dirac cone replicas and the
opening of minigaps in the band structure.
