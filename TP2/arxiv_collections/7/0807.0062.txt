Steric effect in the threshold dissociative ionizations of serine conformers
[CH2OH-C\alphaH(NH2)-C\betaOOH] is revealed by high-level ab initio
calculations combined with our newly developed infrared laser desorption /
tunable VUV photoionization mass spectrometry. We find that near the ionization
thresholds the C\alpha-C\beta and C\alpha-C bonds are selectively broken for
the respective cationic conformers, yielding the different fragments. Novel
dynamic processes, proton transfer and reorientation between the
predissociative fragments, are involved in the threshold photoionization
dissociations.
