Let $k$ be a commutative ring and let $R$ be a commutative $k-$algebra. The
aim of this paper is to define and discuss some connection morphisms between
schemes associated to the representation theory of a (non necessarily
commutative) $R-$algebra $A. $ We focus on the scheme $\ran//\GL_n$ of the
$n-$dimensional representations of $A, $ on the Hilbert scheme $\Hilb_A^n$
parameterizing the left ideals of codimension $n$ of $A$ and on the affine
scheme Spec $\Gamma_R^n(A)^{ab} $ of the abelianization of the divided powers
of order $n$ over $A. $
  We give a generalization of the Grothendieck-Deligne norm map from
$\Hilb_A^n$ to Spec $\Gamma_R^n(A)^{ab} $ which specializes to the Hilbert Chow
morphism on the geometric points when $A$ is commutative and $k$ is an
algebraically closed field. Describing the Hilbert scheme as the base of a
principal bundle we shall factor this map through the moduli space
$\ran//\GL_n$ giving a nice description of this Hilbert-Chow morphism, and
consequently proving that it is projective.
