Dielectric relaxation is universal in characterizing polar liquids and
solids, insulators, and semiconductors, and the theoretical models are well
developed. However, in high magnetic fields, previously unknown aspects of
dielectric relaxation can be revealed and exploited. Here, we report low
temperature dielectric relaxation measurements in lightly doped silicon in high
dc magnetic fields B both parallel and perpendicular to the applied ac electric
field E. For B//E, we observe a temperature and magnetic field dependent
dielectric dispersion e(w)characteristic of conventional Debye relaxation where
the free carrier concentration is dependent on thermal dopant ionization,
magnetic freeze-out, and/or magnetic localization effects. However, for BperpE,
anomalous dispersion emerges in e(w) with increasing magnetic field. It is
shown that the Debye formalism can be simply extended by adding the Lorentz
force to describe the general response of a dielectric in crossed magnetic and
electric fields. Moreover, we predict and observe a new transverse dielectric
response EH perp B perp E not previously described in magneto-dielectric
measurements. The new formalism allows the determination of the mobility and
the ability to discriminate between magnetic localization/freeze out and
Lorentz force effects in the magneto-dielectric response.
