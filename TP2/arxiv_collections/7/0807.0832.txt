The continuous charge density of the r^{-4} radial astroelectron is found
analytically from the Maxwell-Lorentz equations. The electric charge is not a
basic concept, but is the nonlinear field distribution associated with the
elementary self-energy density. The Poisson equation for the unified field
carrier in non-dual electrodynamics locally relates the post-Coulomb potential
with the energy-charge density. The local Maxwell equations maintain the global
overlap of nonlocal electric energy-charges in the undivided Universe.
