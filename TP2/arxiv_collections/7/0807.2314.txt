We study a simple toy model, which although probably does not have any direct
physical applications, can serve as a nice pedagogical example for explanation
strange phenomenon of negative radiation pressure and can also give some
insight for understanding the interaction between radiation and a vortex. The
model discussed is a classical field theory of two interacting scalar fields in
1+1 d. Without coupling one of the fields is governed by the ordinary $\phi^4$
equation and the second one obeys the Klein-Gordon equation. The possibility of
existence of the {\it negative radiation pressure} with a respect to the mass
ratio of those two fields is discussed.
