Experimental data on the pion-nucleus total cross sections are analyzed in
terms of the optimal resonances predictions (OR). The OR-predictions are found
in a good agreement with the actual experimental data in the region
corresponding to the Delta(1236) resonance in elementary pi-N scattering. The
essential signatures of the optimal resonances are experimentally verified with
high accuracy.
