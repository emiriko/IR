We consider the problem of building robust fuzzy extractors, which allow two
parties holding similar random variables W, W' to agree on a secret key R in
the presence of an active adversary. Robust fuzzy extractors were defined by
Dodis et al. in Crypto 2006 to be noninteractive, i.e., only one message P,
which can be modified by an unbounded adversary, can pass from one party to the
other. This allows them to be used by a single party at different points in
time (e.g., for key recovery or biometric authentication), but also presents an
additional challenge: what if R is used, and thus possibly observed by the
adversary, before the adversary has a chance to modify P. Fuzzy extractors
secure against such a strong attack are called post-application robust.
  We construct a fuzzy extractor with post-application robustness that extracts
a shared secret key of up to (2m-n)/2 bits (depending on error-tolerance and
security parameters), where n is the bit-length and m is the entropy of W. The
previously best known result, also of Dodis et al., extracted up to (2m-n)/3
bits (depending on the same parameters).
