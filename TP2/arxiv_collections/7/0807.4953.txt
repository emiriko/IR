We report on ac transport through carbon nanotube Fabry-Perot devices. We
show that tuning the intensity of the ac gating induces an alternation of
suppression and partial revival of the conductance interference pattern. For
frequencies matching integer multiples of the level spacing of the system
$\Delta$ the conductance remains irresponsive to the external field. In
contrast, the noise in the low bias voltage limit behaves as in the static case
only when the frequency matches an even multiple of the level spacing, thereby
highlighting its phase sensitivity in a manifestation of the wagon-wheel effect
in the quantum domain.
