Systems of particles in a confining potential exhibit a spatially dependent
density which fundamentally alters the nature of phase transitions that occur.
A specific instance of this situation, which is being extensively explored
currently, concerns the properties of ultra-cold, optically trapped atoms. Of
interest is how the superfluid-insulator transition is modified by the
inhomogeneity, and, indeed, the extent to which a sharp transition survives at
all. This paper explores a classical analog of these systems, the Blume-Capel
model with a spatially varying single ion anisotropy and/or temperature
gradient. We present results both for the nature of the critical properties and
for the validity of the "local density approximation" which is often used to
model the inhomogeneous case. We compare situations when the underlying uniform
transition is first and second order.
