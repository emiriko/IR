Solvable structures, likewise solvable algebras of local symmetries, can be
used to integrate scalar ODEs by quadratures. Solvable structures, however, are
particularly suitable for the integration of ODEs with a lack of local
symmetries. In fact, under regularity assumptions, any given ODE always admits
solvable structures even though finding them in general could be a very
difficult task. In practice a noteworthy simplification may come by computing
solvable structures which are adapted to some admitted symmetry algebra. In
this paper we consider solvable structures adapted to local and nonlocal
symmetry algebras of any order (i.e., classical and higher). In particular we
introduce the notion of nonlocal solvable structure.
