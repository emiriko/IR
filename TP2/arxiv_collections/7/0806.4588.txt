In the spirit of topological entropy we introduce new complexity functions
for general dynamical systems (namely groups and semigroups acting on closed
manifolds) but with an emphasis on the dynamics induced on simplicial
complexes. For expansive systems remarkable properties are observed. Known
examples are revisited and new examples are presented.
