We consider some specific inverse problem or "bottom-up" reconstruction
strategies at the LHC for both general and constrained MSSM parameters,
starting from a plausibly limited set of sparticle identification and mass
measurements, using mainly gluino/squark cascade decays, plus eventually the
lightest Higgs boson mass. For the three naturally separated sectors of:
gaugino/Higgsino, squark/slepton, and Higgs parameters, we examine different
step-by-step algorithms based on rather simple, entirely analytical, inverted
relations between masses and basic MSSM parameters. This includes also
reasonably good approximations of some of the relevant radiative correction
calculations. We distinguish the constraints obtained for a general MSSM from
those obtained with universality assumptions in the three different sectors.
Our results are compared at different stages with the determination from more
standard "top-down" fit of models to data, and finally combined into a global
determination of all the relevant parameters. Our approach gives complementary
information to more conventional analysis, and is not restricted to the
specific LHC measurement specificities. In addition, the bottom-up
renormalization group evolution of general MSSM parameters, being an important
ingredient in this framework, is illustrated as a new publicly available option
of the MSSM spectrum calculation code "SuSpect".
