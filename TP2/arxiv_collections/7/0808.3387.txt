Dynamics near the surface of glasses is generally much faster than in the
bulk. Neglecting static perturbations of structure at the surface, we use
random first order transition theory to show the free energy barrier for
activated motion near a free surface should be half that of the bulk at the
same temperature. The increased mobility allows the surface layers to descend
much further on the energy landscape than the bulk ordinarily does. The
simplified RFOT calculation however predicts a limiting value for the
configurational entropy a vapor deposited glass may reach as a function of
deposition rate. We sketch how mode coupling effects extend the excess free
surface mobility into the bulk so that the glass transition temperature is
measurably perturbed at depths greater than the naive length scale of dynamic
cooperativity.
