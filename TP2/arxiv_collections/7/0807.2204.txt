We present a measurement of the inclusive jet cross section in p-pbar
collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV based on data collected by the CDF II detector
with an integrated luminosity of 1.13 fb^-1. The measurement was made using the
cone-based Midpoint jet clustering algorithm in the rapidity region of |y|<2.1.
The results are consistent with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD
predictions based on recent parton distribution functions (PDFs), and are
expected to provide increased precision in PDFs at high parton momentum
fraction x. The results are also compared to the recent inclusive jet cross
section measurement using the k_T jet clustering algorithm, and we find that
the ratio of the cross sections measured with the two algorithms is in
agreement with theoretical expectations over a large range of jet transverse
momentum and rapidity.
