Quantized fields in accelerated frames (Rindler spaces) with emphasis on
gauge fields are investigated. Important properties of the dynamics in Rindler
spaces are shown to follow from the scale invariance of the corresponding
Hamiltonians. Origin and consequences of this extraordinary property of
Hamiltonians in Rindler spaces are elucidated. Characteristics of the Unruh
radiation, the appearance of a photon condensate and the interaction energy of
vector and scalar static charges are discussed and implications for Yang-Mills
theories and QCD in Rindler spaces are indicated.
