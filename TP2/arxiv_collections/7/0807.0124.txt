A relationship between continued fractions and Weyl groupoids of Cartan
schemes of rank two is found. This allows to decide easily if a given Cartan
scheme of rank two admits a finite root system. We obtain obstructions and
sharp bounds for the entries of the Cartan matrices.
  Key words: Cartan matrix, continued fraction, Nichols algebra, Weyl groupoid
