We are studying the dynamics of a one-dimensional field in a non-commutative
Euclidean space. The non-commutative space we consider is the one that emerges
in the context of three dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity: it is a
deformation of the classical Euclidean space and the Planck length plays the
role of the deformation parameter. The field is interpreted as a particle which
evolves in a quantum background. When the dynamics of the particle is linear,
the resulting motion is similar to the standard motion in the classical space.
However, non-linear dynamics on the non-commutative space are different from
the corresponding non-linear dynamics on the classical space. These
discrepencies are interpreted as "quantum gravity" effects. Finally, we propose
a background independent description of the propagation of the particle in the
quantum geometry.
