In this work we present the result of the first experimental investigation of
the role of oxygen content on the properties of the HoBaCo2O5+delta layered
cobaltite. We have measured the variation of oxygen content as a function of
temperature and oxygen partial pressure by means of thermogravimetry coupled to
chemical titration analysis. On selected samples of accurately known oxygen
content we have undertaken a systematic investigation of their structural,
thermal and magnetic properties by means of x-ray diffraction, differential
scanning calorimetry and magnetometry. The overall results gained by this study
confirm the central role of oxygen content on the properties of these materials
suggesting that, for the Ho composition, even very slight variation of the
order of delta=0.01 has a dramatic influence on the magnetic and transport
properties of the samples. In addition, we have presented results showing the
strategy to check the quality of samples prepared at selected oxygen contents
by annealing procedures.
