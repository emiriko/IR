Hadronic resonances can play a pivotal role in providing experimental
evidence for partial chiral symmetry restoration in the deconfined quark-gluon
phase produced at RHIC. Their lifetimes, which are comparable to the lifetime
of the partonic plasma phase, make them an invaluable tool to study medium
modifications to the resonant state due to the chiral transition. In this paper
we show that the heavier, but still abundant, light and strange quark
resonances K*, phi, Delta and Lambda* have large probability to be produced
well within the plasma phase due to their short formation times. We demonstrate
that, under particular kinematic conditions, these resonances can be formed and
will decay inside the partonic state, but still carry sufficient momentum to
not interact strongly with the hadronic medium after the QCD phase transition.
Thus, K*, phi, Delta and Lambda* should exhibit the characteristic property
modifications which can be attributed to chiral symmetry restoration, such as
mass shifts, width broadening or branching ratio modifications.
