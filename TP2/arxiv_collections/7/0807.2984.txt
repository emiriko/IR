We perform analytical reductions of one-loop tensor integrals with 5 and 6
legs to scalar master integrals. They are based on the use of recurrence
relations connecting integrals in different space-time dimensions. The
reductions are expressed in a compact form in terms of signed minors, and have
been implemented in a mathematica package called hexagon.m. We present several
numerical examples.
