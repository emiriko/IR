Neutron diffraction experiments have been carried out on a Sn-flux grown
BaFe2As2 single crystal, the parent compound of the A-122 family of FeAs-based
high-Tc superconductors. A tetragonal to orthorhombic structural phase
transition and a three dimensional long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of the
iron moment, with a unique magnetic propagation wavevector k = (1, 0, 1), have
been found to take place at ~90 K. The magnetic moments of iron are aligned
along the long a axis in the low temperature orthorhombic phase (Fmmm with
b<a<c). Our results thus demonstrate that the magnetic structure of BaFe2As2
single crystal is the same as those in other A-122 iron pnictides compounds. We
argue that the tin incorporation in the lattice is responsible for a smaller
orthorhombic splitting and lower Neel temperature T_N observed in the
experiment.
