We transferred the frequency of an ultra-stable laser over 86 km of urban
fiber. The link is composed of two cascaded 43-km fibers connecting two
laboratories, LNE-SYRTE and LPL in Paris area. In an effort to realistically
demonstrate a link of 172 km without using spooled fiber extensions, we
implemented a recirculation loop to double the length of the urban fiber link.
The link is fed with a 1542-nm cavity stabilized fiber laser having a sub-Hz
linewidth. The fiber-induced phase noise is measured and cancelled with an all
fiber-based interferometer using commercial off the shelf pigtailed
telecommunication components. The compensated link shows an Allan deviation of
a few 10-16 at one second and a few 10-19 at 10,000 seconds.
