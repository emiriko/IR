We calculate the next-to-leading order fully unintegrated hard scattering
coefficient for unpolarized gluon-induced deep inelastic scattering using the
logical framework of parton correlation functions developed in previous work.
In our approach, exact four-momentum conservation is maintained throughout the
calculation. Hence, all non-perturbative functions, like parton distribution
functions, depend on all components of parton four-momentum. In contrast to the
usual collinear factorization approach where the hard scattering coefficient
involves generalized functions (such as Dirac $\delta$-functions), the fully
unintegrated hard scattering coefficient is an ordinary function. Gluon-induced
deep inelastic scattering provides a simple illustration of the application of
the fully unintegrated factorization formalism with a non-trivial hard
scattering coefficient, applied to a phenomenologically interesting case.
Furthermore, the gluon-induced process allows for a parameterization of the
fully unintegrated gluon distribution function.
