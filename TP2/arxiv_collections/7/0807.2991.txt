We study the repulsive Hubbard model both analytically and numerically on a
family of highly frustrated lattices which have one-electron states localized
on isolated trapping cells. We construct and count exact many-electron ground
states for a wide range of electron densities and obtain closed-form
expressions for the low-temperature thermodynamic quantities. Furthermore, we
find that saturated ferromagnetism is obtained only for sufficiently high
electron densities and large Hubbard repulsion $U$ while there is no finite
average moment in the ground states at lower densities.
