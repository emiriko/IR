Some time ago a slightly improved variant of bag model (the modified bag
model) suitable for the unified description of light and heavy hadrons was
developed. The main goal of the present work was to calculate the masses of the
ground state baryons containing bottom quarks in the framework of this model.
For completeness the predictions for other heavy hadrons are also given. The
reasonable agreement of our results with other theoretical calculations and
available experimental data suggests that our predictions could serve as a
useful complementary tool for the interpretation of heavy hadron spectra.
