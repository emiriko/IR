The robust (spin and isospin zero) $\alpha$-particle remains one of the best
projectiles to probe the nuclear isoscalar excitations. In the present work, a
microscopic folding model analysis of the \ac inelastic scattering to the 2$^+$
(4.44 MeV), 0$^+$ (7.65 MeV), 3$^-$ (9.64 MeV), 0$^+$ (10.3 MeV) and 1$^-$
(10.84 MeV) states in $^{12}$C has been performed using the 3-$\alpha$
resonating group method wave functions. The isoscalar transition strengths of
these states were carefully studied based on the coupled-channel analysis using
the microscopic folded form factors. A correlation between the weak binding
and/or short lifetime of the excited state and absorption in the exit channel
of inelastic scattering has been established.
