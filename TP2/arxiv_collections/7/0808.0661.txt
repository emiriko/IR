We discuss an asymmetric energy model (AEM) introduced by Giardina et al. in
\cite{7}. This model is expected to belong to the KPZ class. We obtain lower
bounds for the diffusion coefficient. In particular, the diffusion coefficient
is diverging in dimension one and two as it is expected in the KPZ picture.
