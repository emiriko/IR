We solve {\bf analytically} the multiple scattering (KKR) equations for the
two dimensional photonic crystals in the long wavelength limit. Different
approximations of the electric and magnetic susceptibilities are presented from
a unified pseudopotential point of view. The nature of the so called
plasmon-polariton bands are clarified. Its frequency as a function of the wire
radius is discussed.
