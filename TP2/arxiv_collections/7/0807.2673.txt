We point out one of the possible sources of the "NuTeV anomaly": the effect
of the non-adequate application of the one-loop electroweak radiative
corrections including QED hard photon emission derived by Bardin and Dokuchaeva
(1986) in the NuTeV radiative corrections data analysis of deep inelastic
neutrino and anti-neutrino deep inelastic scattering.
