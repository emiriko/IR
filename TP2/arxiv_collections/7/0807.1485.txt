The phase-ordering kinetics of the ferromagnetic two-dimensional Ising model
with uniform bond disorder is investigated by intensive Monte Carlo
simulations. Simple ageing behaviour is observed in the single-time correlator
and the two-time responses and correlators. The dynamical exponent z and the
autocorrelation exponent lambda_C only depend on the ratio eps/T, where eps
describes the width of the distribution of the disorder, whereas a more
complicated behaviour is found for the non-equilibrium exponent a of the
two-time response as well as for the autoresponse exponent lambda_R. The
scaling functions are observed to depend only on the dimensionless ratio eps/T.
If the length scales are measured in terms of the time-dependent domain size
L(t), the form of the scaling functions is in general independent of both eps
and T. Conditions limiting the validity of this `superuniversality' are
discussed.
