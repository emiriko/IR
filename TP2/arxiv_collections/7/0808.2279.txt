This paper studies conformal biharmonic immersions. We first study the
transformations of Jacobi operator and the bitension field under conformal
change of metrics. We then obtain an invariant equation for a conformal
biharmonic immersion of a surface into Euclidean 3-space. As applications, we
construct a 2-parameter family of non-minimal conformal biharmonic immersions
of cylinder into $\r^3$ and some examples of conformal biharmonic immersions of
4-dimensional Euclidean space into sphere and hyperbolic space thus provide
many simple examples of proper biharmonic maps with rich geometric meanings.
These suggest that there are abundant proper biharmonic maps in the family of
conformal immersions. We also explore the relationship between biharmonicity
and holomorphicity of conformal immersions of surfaces.
