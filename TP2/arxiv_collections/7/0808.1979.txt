We propose to combine the advantages of graphene, such as easy tunability and
long coherence times, with Josephson physics to manufacture qubits. If these
qubits are built around a 0 and $\pi$ junction they can be controlled by an
external flux. Alternatively, a d-wave Josephson junction can itself be tuned
via a gate voltage to create superpositions between macroscopically degenerate
states. We show that ferromagnets are not required for realizing $\pi$ junction
in graphene, thus considerably simplifying its physical implementation. We
demonstrate how one qubit gates, such as arbitrary phase rotations and the
exchange gate, can be implemented.
