We consider type II and heterotic string compactifications on an isolated
singularity in the noncompact Gepner model approach. The conifold-type ADE
noncompact Calabi-Yau threefolds, as well as the ALE twofolds, are modeled by a
tensor product of the SL(2,R)/U(1) Kazama-Suzuki model and an N=2 minimal
model. Based on the string partition functions on these internal Calabi-Yaus
previously obtained by Eguchi and Sugawara, we construct new modular invariant,
space-time supersymmetric partition functions for both type II and heterotic
string theories, where the GSO projection is performed before the continuous
and discrete state contributions are separated. We investigate in detail the
massless spectra of the localized modes. In particular, we propose an
interesting three generation model, in which each flavor is in the 27+1
representation of E6 and localized on a four-dimensional space-time residing at
the tip of the cigar.
