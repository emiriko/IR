We derive the general form of the moduli-space effective action for the
long-range interaction of two BPS dyons in N=2 gauge theories. This action
determines the bound state structure of various BPS and non-BPS states near
marginal stability curves, and we utilise it to compute the leading correction
to the BPS-mass of zero-torsion non-BPS bound states close to marginal
stability.
