We illustrate how the midpoint and iterative cone (with progressive removal)
algorithms fail to satisfy the fundamental requirements of infrared and
collinear safety, causing divergences in the perturbative expansion. We
introduce SISCone and the anti-kt algorithms as respective replacements that do
not have those failures without any cost at the experimental level.
