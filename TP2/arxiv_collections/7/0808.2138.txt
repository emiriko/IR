Experimental measurements of the specific heat in glass-forming systems
reveal anomalies in the temperature dependence of the specific heat, including
the so called "specific heat peak" in the vicinity of the glass transition. The
aim of this paper is to provide theoretical explanations of these anomalies in
general and a quantitative theory in the case of a simple model of
glass-formation. We first present new simulation results for the specific heat
in a classical model of a binary mixture. We show that in addition to the
formerly observed specific heat peak there is a second peak at lower
temperatures which was not observable in earlier simulations. Second, we
present a general relation between the specific heat and the bulk modulus and
thus offer a smooth connection between the liquid and amorphous solid states.
The central result of this paper is a connection between the micro-melting of
clusters in the system and the appearance of specific heat peaks. We relate the
two peaks to changes in the bulk and shear moduli. We propose that the
phenomenon of glass-formation is accompanied by a fast change in the bulk and
the shear moduli, but these fast changes occur in different ranges of the
temperature. Lastly, we demonstrate how to construct a theory of the frequency
dependent complex specific heat, expected from heterogeneous clustering in the
liquid state of glass formers. A specific example is provided in the context of
our model for the dynamics of glycerol. The theoretical frequency dependent
specific heat agrees well with experimental measurements on glycerol. We
conclude the paper by stating that there is nothing universal about the
temperature dependence of the specific heat in glass formers - unfortunately
one needs to understand each case by itself.
