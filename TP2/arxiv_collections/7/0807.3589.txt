We investigate the light-matter interaction of a quantum dot with the
electromagnetic field in a lossy microcavity and calculate emission spectra for
non-zero detuning and dephasing. It is found that dephasing shifts the
intensity of the emission peaks for non-zero detuning. We investigate the
characteristics of this intensity shifting effect and offer it as an
explanation for the non-vanishing emission peaks at the cavity frequency found
in recent experimental work.
