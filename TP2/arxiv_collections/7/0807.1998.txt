This article reports on the Fourth Meeting on Lorentz and CPT Symmetry, CPT
'07, held in August 2007 in Bloomington, Indiana, USA. The focus is on recent
tests of Lorentz symmetry using atomic and optical physics. Results presented
at the meeting include improved bounds on Lorentz violation in the photon
sector, and the first bounds on several coefficients in the gravity sector.
