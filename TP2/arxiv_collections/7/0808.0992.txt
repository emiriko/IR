In this short note, we examine the relationship between the string coupling
constant, $\gstring{}$, and the grand unified gauge coupling constant,
$\alphagut{}$, in a highly successful class of models based on anisotropic
orbifold compactifications of the weakly coupled heterotic string. These models
represent a stringy embedding of SU(6) gauge-Higgs unification in a five
dimensional orbifold GUT. We find that the requirement that the theory be
perturbative provides a non-trivial constraint on these models. Interestingly,
there is a correlation between the proton decay rate (due to dimension six
operators) and the string coupling constant. Finally, we make some comments
concerning the extension of these models to the six (and higher) dimensional
case.
