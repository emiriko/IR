We summarize recent results regarding the equilibrium and non-equilibrium
behavior of cold dilute atomic gases in the limit in which the two body
scattering length a goes to infinity. In this limit the system is described by
a Galilean invariant (non-relativistic) conformal field theory. We discuss the
low energy effective lagrangian appropriate to the limit a->infinity, and
compute low energy coefficients using an epsilon-expansion. We also show how to
combine the effective lagrangian with kinetic theory in order to compute the
shear viscosity, and compare the kinetic theory predictions to experimental
results extracted from the damping of collective modes in trapped Fermi gases.
