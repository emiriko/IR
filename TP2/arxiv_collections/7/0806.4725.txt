The role of quantum coherence and the environment in the dynamics of
excitation energy transfer is not fully understood. In this work, we introduce
the concept of dynamical contributions of various physical processes to the
energy transfer efficiency. We develop two complementary approaches, based on a
Green's function method and energy transfer susceptibilities, and quantify the
importance of the Hamiltonian evolution, phonon-induced decoherence, and
spatial relaxation pathways. We investigate the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein
complex, where we find a contribution of coherent dynamics of about 10% and of
relaxation of 80%.
