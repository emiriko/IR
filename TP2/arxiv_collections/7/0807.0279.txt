We study experimentally the transmission of light through a square lattice of
nanoholes perforated in a optically-thick gold film. We observe that the
periodicity of the structure enhances the light transmission for specific
wavelengths, and we analyze this effect theoretically by employing
finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations. Furthermore, we
investigate the possibilities for manipulation of the spectral transmission in
quasi-periodic and chirped lattices consisting of square nanoholes with varying
hole size or lattice periodicity.
