The search for the top squark ($\widetilde{t}_{1}$) within the kinematic
reach of Tevatron Run II is of great contemporary interest. Such a
$\widetilde{t}_{1}$ can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe provided
$120 ~GeV/c^{2} \leq m_{\widetilde{t}_{1}} \leq m_t$. Moreover if $\Delta m
\equiv m_{\widetilde{t}_{1}}$ - $m_{\widetilde\chi_1^0}$ is small, where
$\widetilde\chi_1^0$ is the LSP, the dark matter relic density as obtained from
the WMAP data may be explained via $\widetilde{t}_{1}$- LSP coannihilation. In
this scenario the decay $\widetilde{t}_{1} \to c \widetilde\chi_1^0$ is likely
to occur with 100 % branching ratio but for small $\Delta m$ the conventional
di-jet + $\not E_T$ signal becomes unobservable. We propose a new search
strategy based on the $2j + \not E_T$ signature accompanied by an isolated
cluster of energy which arises from a decaying heavy particle with
characteristic decay length. Our preliminary simulations with PYTHIA indicate
that for $100 ~GeV/c^{2} \le m_{\widetilde{t}_{1}} \le 130 ~GeV/c^{2}$ this
signal may be observable while somewhat lager $m_{\widetilde{t}_{1}}$ may still
provide hints of new physics.
