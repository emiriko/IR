We propose a way of producing and detecting pseudospin entanglement between
electrons and holes in graphene. Electron-hole pairs are produced by a
fluctuating potential and their entanglement is demonstrated by a current
correlation measurement. The chirality of electrons in graphene facilitates a
well-controlled Bell test with (pseudo-)spin projection angles defined in real
space.
