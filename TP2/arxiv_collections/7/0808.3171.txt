The stopping power and energy loss rate of charged particles traversing a
two-dimensional Dirac plasma is investigated. The Dirac plasma considered here
models a solid state system, recently realized graphene monolayer, where the
conduction electrons obey the Dirac-like equation and exhibit a linear in
momentum dispersion relation. Theoretical work presented here is based on the
the dielectric response function and the dynamical structure function within
the Random-Phase-Approximation (RPA).
