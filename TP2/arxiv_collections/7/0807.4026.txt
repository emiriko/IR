A major step towards the understanding of intrinsic properties of
nano-objects depends on the ability to obtain assemblies of nanoparticles of a
given size with reduced size dispersion and a well defined shape. The control
of these parameters is a fundamental challenge. In this newsletter, we present
a new method to tailor in an easy way both size and shape characteristics of
nanoparticles by using laser irradiation in the nanosecond regime.
