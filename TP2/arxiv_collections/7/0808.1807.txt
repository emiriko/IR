We study the double-lepton polarization asymmetries and single and
double-lepton polarization forward backward asymmetries of the rare b \to s
\ell^+ \ell^- mode within the Standard Model and in the
Appelquist-Cheng-Dobrescu model, which is a new physics scenario with a single
universal extra dimension. In particular, we examine the sensitivity of the
observables to the radius R of the compactified extra-dimension, which is the
new parameter in this new physics model.
