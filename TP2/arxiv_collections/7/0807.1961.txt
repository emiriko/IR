The differential conductance in a suspended few layered graphene sample is
fou nd to exhibit a series of quasi-periodic sharp dips as a function of bias
at l ow temperature. We show that they can be understood within a simple model
of dyn amical Coulomb blockade where energy exchanges take place between the
charge carriers transmitted trough the sample and a dissipative electromagnetic
envir onment with a resonant phonon mode strongly coupled to the electrons.
