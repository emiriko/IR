The connection between the geometric phase and quantum phase transition has
been discussed extensively in the two-band model. By introducing the twist
operator, the geometric phase can be defined by calculating its ground-state
expectation value. In contrast to the previous numerical examinations, our
discussion presents an exact calculation for the determination of the geometric
phase. Through two representative examples, our calculation shows the intimate
connection between the geometric phase and phase transition: different
behaviors of the geometric phase can be identified in this paper, which are
directly related to the energy gap above the ground state.
