The Knop-Sahi interpolation Macdonald polynomials are inhomogeneous and
nonsymmetric generalisations of the well-known Macdonald polynomials. In this
paper we apply the interpolation Macdonald polynomials to study a new type of
basic hypergeometric series of type g_n. Our main results include a new
q-binomial theorem, new q-Gauss sum, and several transformation formulae for
g_n series.
