The newly discovered superconductor FeSe1-x (x=0.08, Tconset=13.5 K at
ambient pressure rising to 27 K at 1.48 GPa) exhibits a structural phase
transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic below 70 K at ambient pressure - the
crystal structure in the superconducting state shows remarkable similarities to
that of the REFeAsO1-xFx (RE = rare earth) superconductors
