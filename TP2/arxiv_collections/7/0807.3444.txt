A set of weakly interacting spin-1/2 Fermions, confined by a harmonic
oscillator potential, and interacting with each other via a contact potential,
is a model system which closely represents the physics of a dilute gas of
two-component Fermionic atoms confined in a magneto-optic trap. In the present
work, our aim is to present a Fortran 90 computer program which, using a basis
set expansion technique, solves the Hartree-Fock (HF) equations for spin-1/2$
Fermions confined by a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential, and
interacting with each other via pair-wise delta-function potentials.
Additionally, the program can also account for those anharmonic potentials
which can be expressed as a polynomial in the position operators $x,$ $y$, and
$z$. Both the restricted-HF (RHF), and the unrestricted-HF (UHF) equations can
be solved for a given number of Fermions, with either repulsive or attractive
interactions among them. The option of UHF solutions for such systems also
allows us to study possible magnetic properties of the physics of two-component
confined atomic Fermi gases, with imbalanced populations. Using our code we
also demonstrate that such a system exhibits shell structure, and follows
Hund's rule.
