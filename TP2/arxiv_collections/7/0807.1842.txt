A fully implicit finite difference scheme has been developed to solve the
hydrodynamic equations coupled with radiation transport. Solution of the time
dependent radiation transport equation is obtained using the discrete ordinates
method and the energy flow into the Lagrangian meshes as a result of radiation
interaction is fully accounted for. A tridiagonal matrix system is solved at
each time step to determine the hydrodynamic variables implicitly. The results
obtained from this fully implicit radiation hydrodynamics code in the planar
geometry agrees well with the scaling law for radiation driven strong shock
propagation in aluminium. For the point explosion problem the self similar
solutions are compared with results for pure hydrodynamic case in spherical
geometry and the effect of radiation energy transfer is determined. Having,
thus, benchmarked the code, convergence of the method w.r.t. time step is
studied in detail and compared with the results of commonly used semi-implicit
method. It is shown that significant error reduction is feasible in the
implicit method in comparison to the semi-implicit method, though at the cost
of slightly more CPU time.
