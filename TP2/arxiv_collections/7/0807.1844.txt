We generalize the one-to one correspondence between quasi normal modes in 3-
dimensional anti deSitter black holes and the poles of the retarded correlators
in the boundary conformal field theory to include logarithmic operators in the
latter. This analysis is carried out explicitly for the logarithmic mode in
chiral topologically massive gravity.
