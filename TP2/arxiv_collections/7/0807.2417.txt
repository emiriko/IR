We use speckle-visibility spectroscopy to measure the time-dependence of
bubble rearrangement events that are driven by coarsening in an aqueous foam.
This technique gives the time-trace for the average scattering site speed
within a prescribed volume of the sample. Results are analyzed in terms of
distributions of event times, event speeds, and event displacements. The
distribution of rest times between successive events is also measured;
comparison with diffusing-wave spectroscopy results shows that the spatial
structure of a typical event consists of a core of only a few bubbles which
undergo topology change plus a surrounding halo of bubbles which shift by an
amount that decays to one wavelength at four to five bubbles away. No
correlations are found between the durations, speeds, and rest times between
successive events.
