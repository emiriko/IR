We all know that in our family of particle physics we have three generations
but still don't know why - the so-called "family problem". On other hand, in
view of the masses and oscillations, the neutrinos now present some basic
difficulty in the Standard Model. In this note, I propose that on top of the
SU_c(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) standard model there is an SU_f (3) extension
- a simple SU_c(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) \times SU_f (3) extended standard
model. The family gauge bosons (familons) are massive through the so-called
"colored" Higgs mechanism while the remaining Higgs particles are also massive.
The three neutrinos, the electron-like, muon-like, and tao-like neutrinos, form
the basic family triplets. Hopefully all the couplings to the "visible" matter
are through the neutrinos, explaining why dark matter (25 %) is more than
visible matter (5 %) in our Universe.
