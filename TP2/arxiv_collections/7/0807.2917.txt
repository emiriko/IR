Chiral condensate and $\eta^\prime$ meson mass spectrum are studied under the
influence of an external Abelian magnetic field. We work within the D3/D7
Karch--Katz model of flavoured AdS/CFT with supersymmetry broken by the
Constable--Myers deformation of the metric. It is shown that this setting
yields a quadratic dependence of condensate on field, rather than the
non-analytic (linear in field) dependence, typical for chiral perturbation
theory in the exact chiral limit. We argue that the analytic (quadratic) result
must be put into correspondence with the leading-order in the $1/N_c$
decomposition for the condensate, whereas the existing chiral perturbation
theory result, which is linear in field strength, is $1/N_c$ suppressed.
