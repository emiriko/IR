We theoretically study the interaction of a heavy hole with nuclear spins in
a quasi-two-dimensional III-V semiconductor quantum dot and the resulting
dephasing of heavy-hole spin states. It has frequently been stated in the
literature that heavy holes have a negligible interaction with nuclear spins.
We show that this is not the case. In contrast, the interaction can be rather
strong and will be the dominant source of decoherence in some cases. We also
show that for unstrained quantum dots the form of the interaction is
Ising-like, resulting in unique and interesting decoherence properties, which
might provide a crucial advantage to using dot-confined hole spins for quantum
information processing, as compared to electron spins.
