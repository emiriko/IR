We consider the iterative resolution scheme for the Navier-Stokes equation,
and focus on the second iterate, more precisely on the map from the initial
data to the second iterate at a given time t.
  We investigate boundedness properties of this bilinear operator. This new
approach yields very interesting results: a new perspective on Koch-Tataru
solutions; a first step towards weak strong uniqueness for Koch-Tataru
solutions; and finally an instability result in $B^{-1}_{\infty,q}$, for q>2.
