The properties of a special class of correlated many-body wave functions,
named rotating vortex clusters (RVCs), that preserve the total angular momentum
of a small cloud of trapped rotating bosons are investigated. They have lower
energy and provide a superior description for the formation of vortices
compared to the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) states that break the
rotational symmetry. The GP vortex states are shown to be wave packets composed
of such RVC states. Our results suggest that, for a small number of bosons, the
physics is different from that of ideal Bose-Einstein condensates which
characterize larger assemblies
