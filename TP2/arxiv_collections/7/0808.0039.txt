The present paper proves that all limit points of sequences of renormalized
solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the limit of small, asymptotically
equivalent Mach and Knudsen numbers are governed by Leray solutions of the
Navier-Stokes equations. This convergence result holds for hard cutoff
potentials in the sense of H. Grad, and therefore completes earlier results by
the same authors [Invent. Math. 155, 81-161(2004)] for Maxwell molecules.
