Charge carriers in a graphene sheet, a single layer of graphite, exhibit much
distinctive characteristics to those in other two-dimensional electronic
systems because of their chiral nature. In this report, we focus on the
observation of weak localization in a graphene sheet exfoliated from a piece of
natural graphite and nano-patterned into a Hall-bar geometry. Much stronger
chiral-symmetry-breaking elastic intervalley scattering in our graphene sheet
restores the conventional weak localization. The resulting carrier-density and
temperature dependence of the phase coherence length reveal that the
electron-electron interaction including a direct Coulomb interaction is the
main inelastic scattering factor while electron-hole puddles enhance the
inelastic scattering near the Dirac point.
