This resource letter intends to provide physics instructors - particularly
graduate student teaching assistants - at the introductory university level
with a small but representative collection of resources to acquire a
familiarity with research in physics education for guidance in everyday
instruction. The resources are in the form of books, articles, websites,
journals, and organizations.
