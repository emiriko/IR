We review, in a self-contained and pedagogical manner, recent developments
and techniques for the evaluation of the scattering amplitudes of planar N=4
SYM theory at both weak and strong coupling. Special emphasis is placed on the
newly discovered connection between a special class of amplitudes and the
expectation values of particular cusped light-like Wilson loops.
