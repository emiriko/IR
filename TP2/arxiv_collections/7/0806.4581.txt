We present the spectrum of the lightest pentaquark states of both parities
and compare it with the present experimental evidence for these states. We have
assumed that the main role for their mass splittings is played by the
chromo-magnetic interaction. We have also kept into account the $SU(3)_F$
breaking for their contribution and for the spin orbit term. The resulting
pattern is in good agreement with experiment.
