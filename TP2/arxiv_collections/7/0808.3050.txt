In classical mechanics the local exponential instability effaces the memory
of initial conditions and leads to practical irreversibility. In striking
contrast, quantum mechanics appears to exhibit strong memory of the initial
state. We relate the latter fact to the low (at most linear) rate with which
the system's Wigner function gets during evolution more and more complicated
structure and establish existence of a critical strength of external influence
below which such a memory still survives.
