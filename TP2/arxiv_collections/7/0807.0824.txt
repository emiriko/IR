We present the tensor computer algebra package xPert for fast construction
and manipulation of the equations of metric perturbation theory, around
arbitrary backgrounds. It is based on the combination of explicit combinatorial
formulas for the n-th order perturbation of curvature tensors and their gauge
changes, and the use of highly efficient techniques of index canonicalization,
provided by the underlying tensor system xAct, for Mathematica. We give
examples of use and show the efficiency of the system with timings plots: it is
possible to handle orders n=4 or n=5 within seconds, or reach n=10 with timings
below 1 hour.
