The asymmetric magnetization reversal is studied in a single exchange-biased
microbar of 1.5 x 13 micrometer with anisotropic magnetoresistance and magnetic
force microscopy. The particle has a moment of less than 10^-9 emu and is not
accessible with standard magnetometry. The asymmetric hysteresis loop of
CoFe/CrMnPt shows a repeatable rotation process, followed by an irreversible
nucleation process that is marked by jumps in the magnetoresistance. The
induced unidirectional anisotropy enhances the rotation process in one branch
of the hysteresis loop, followed by a sped up nucleation process. Imprinted
ferromagnetic domain patterns left behind by the antiferromagnet are observed
after the nucleation process occurred but before complete saturation is
reached.
