The linear response of synchronized chaotic units with delayed couplings and
feedback to small external perturbations is investigated in the context of
communication with chaos synchronization. For iterated chaotic maps, the
distribution of distances is calculated numerically and, for some special
cases, analytically as well. Depending on model parameters, this distribution
has power law tails leading to diverging moments of distances in the region of
synchronization. The corresponding linear equations have multiplicative and
additive noise due to perturbations and chaos. The response to small harmonic
perturbations shows resonances related to coupling and feedback delay times.
For perturbation from a binary message the bit error rate is calculated. The
bit error rate is not related to the transverse Lyapunov exponents, and it can
be reduced when additional noise is added to the transmitted signal. For some
special cases, the bit error rate as a function of coupling strength has the
structure of a devil's staircase, related to an iterated function system.
Finally, the security of communication is discussed by comparing uni- and
bi-directional couplings.
