In our analysis, a quantisation scheme for local electromagnetic waves in
vacuum is introduced by the model of nonideal Bose-gas consisting of
Bose-light-particles (which are no photons) with spin one and a finite mass.
This fact destroys the Relativistic Theory of Einstein as well as displays a
wrong sound of so-called a spontaneous breakdown of symmetry because the light
boson can be moved by speed of wave in vacuum.
