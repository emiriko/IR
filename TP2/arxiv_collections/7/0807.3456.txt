To describe the full spectrum of surface fluctuations of the interface
between phase-separated colloid-polymer mixtures from low scattering vector q
(classical capillary wave theory) to high q (bulk-like fluctuations), one must
take account of the interface's bending rigidity. We find that the bending
rigidity is negative and that on approach to the critical point it vanishes
proportionally to the interfacial tension. Both features are in agreement with
Monte Carlo simulations.
