We study the basic quantum mechanics for a fully general set of Dirac
matrices in a curved spacetime by extending Pauli's method. We further extend
this study to three versions of the Dirac equation: the standard
(Dirac-Fock-Weyl or DFW) equation, and two alternative versions, both of which
are based on the recently proposed linear tensor representations of the Dirac
field (TRD). We begin with the current conservation: we show that the latter
applies to any solution of the Dirac equation, iff the field of Dirac matrices
$\gamma ^\mu $ satisfies a specific PDE. This equation is always satisfied for
DFW with its restricted choice for the $\gamma ^\mu $ matrices. It similarly
restricts the choice of the $\gamma ^\mu $ matrices for TRD. However, this
restriction can be achieved. The frame dependence of a general Hamiltonian
operator is studied. We show that in any given reference frame with minor
restrictions on the spacetime metric, the axioms of quantum mechanics impose a
unique form for the Hilbert space scalar product. Finally, the condition for
the general Dirac Hamiltonian operator to be Hermitian is derived in a general
curved spacetime. For DFW, the validity of this hermiticity condition depends
on the choice of the $\gamma ^\mu $ matrices.
