We present updated predictions for the total cross section of top-quark pair
production at Tevatron and LHC. For the LHC we also provide results at sqrt(s)
= 10 TeV, in view of the anticipated run in 2008 and quote numbers for the
production of new heavy-quark pairs with mass in the range 0.5 - 2 TeV. Our
two-loop results incorporate all logarithmically enhanced terms near threshold
including Coulomb corrections as well as the exact dependence on the
renormalization and factorization scale through next-to-next-to-leading order
in QCD.
