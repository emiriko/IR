We derive fidelity benchmarks for the quantum storage and teleportation of
squeezed states of continuous variable systems, for input ensembles where the
degree of squeezing $s$ is fixed, no information about its orientation in phase
space is given, and the distribution of phase space displacements is a
Gaussian. In the limit where the latter becomes flat, we prove analytically
that the maximal classical achievable fidelity (which is 1/2 without squeezing,
for $s=1$) is given by $\sqrt{s}/(1+s)$, vanishing when the degree of squeezing
diverges. For mixed states, as well as for general distributions of
displacements, we reduce the determination of the benchmarks to the solution of
a finite-dimensional semidefinite program, which yields accurate, certifiable
bounds thanks to a rigorous analysis of the truncation error. This approach may
be easily adapted to more general ensembles of input states.
