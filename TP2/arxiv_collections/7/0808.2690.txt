Let $M$ be a close complex manifold and $TM$ its holomorphic tangent bundle.
We prove that if the global holomorphic sections of tangent bundle generate
each fibre, then $M$ is a complex homogeneous manifold.
  Our proof depends on the complex version of Chow-Rashevskii theorem in
Carnot-Caratheodory spaces.
