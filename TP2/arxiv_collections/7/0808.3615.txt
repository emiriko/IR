We study the action of Hecke operators on the set of hypergeometric
functions. We show that the spectrum of these operators is the set of powers
n^a and that polylogarithms play a dominant role in the study of the
corresponding eigenfunctions. As a corollary, we obtain a characterization of
completely multiplicative hypergeometric coefficients.
