We study the dependence of the intrinsic conductance of a nanocontact on its
shape by using the recursion-transfer-matrix method. Hour-glass, torus, and
spherical shapes are defined through analytic potentials, the latter two
serving as rough models for ring-like and spherical molecules, respectively.
The sensitivity of the conductance to geometric details is analyzed and
discussed. Strong resonance effects are found for a spherical contact weakly
coupled to electron reservoirs.
