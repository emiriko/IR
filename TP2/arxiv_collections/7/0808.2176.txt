We extract K-matrix poles from our fits to elastic pion-nucleon scattering
and eta-nucleon production data in order to test a recently proposed method for
the determination of resonance properties, based on the trace of the K-matrix.
We have considered issues associated with the separation of background and
resonance contributions, the correspondence between K-matrix and T-matrix
poles, and the complicated behavior of eigenphases.
