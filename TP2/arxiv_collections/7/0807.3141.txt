By using the Redfield form of the master equation, we investigate the
decoherence times of a double quantum dot charge qubit (DQDCQ) in three
different cases, namely when it is coupled to (I) the piezoelectric coupling
phonon bath (PCPB), (II) the deformation coupling phonon bath (DCPB), and (III)
the Ohmic bath. It is found that our results for case (I) and (II) are in the
same magnitude with those obtained via the exact path integral methods, while
for case (III), the decoherence time is in well agreement with the experimental
value.
