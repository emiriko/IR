Colour and coarseness of skin are visually different. When image processing
is involved in the skin analysis, it is important to quantitatively evaluate
such differences using texture features. In this paper, we discuss a texture
analysis and measurements based on a statistical approach to the pattern
recognition. Grain size and anisotropy are evaluated with proper diagrams. The
possibility to determine the presence of pattern defects is also discussed.
