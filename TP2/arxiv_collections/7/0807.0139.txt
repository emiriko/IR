A scheme for controlling light speed from slower-than-c to faster-than-c in
an atomic system is presented in this paper. The scheme is based on far
detuning Raman effect. Two far detuning coupling fields with small frequency
difference will produce two absorptive peaks for the probe field in a $\Lambda$
structure, and an optical pump between the two ground states can change the
absorptive peaks into enhanced peaks, which makes the normal dispersion between
the two peaks change into anomalous dispersion, so the probe field can change
from slow light to superluminal propagation.
