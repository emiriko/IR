We present a preliminary experimental study of the dependence on optical
depth of slow and stored light pulses in Rb vapor. In particular, we
characterize the efficiency of slow and stored light as a function of Rb
density; pulse duration, delay and storage time; and control field intensity.
Experimental results are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical
calculations based on a simplified three-level model at moderate densities.
