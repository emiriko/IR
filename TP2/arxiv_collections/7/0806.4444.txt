For a cell moving in hydrodynamic flow above a wall, translational and
rotational degrees of freedom are coupled by the Stokes equation. In addition,
there is a close coupling of convection and diffusion due to the
position-dependent mobility. These couplings render calculation of the mean
encounter time between cell surface receptors and ligands on the substrate very
difficult. Here we show for a two-dimensional model system how analytical
progress can be achieved by treating motion in the vertical direction by an
effective reaction term in the mean first passage time equation for the
rotational degree of freedom. The strength of this reaction term can either be
estimated from equilibrium considerations or used as a fit parameter. Our
analytical results are confirmed by computer simulations and allow to assess
the relative roles of convection and diffusion for different scaling regimes of
interest.
