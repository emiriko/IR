The purpose of this paper is to study Seshadri constants on the self-product
$E\times E$ of an elliptic curve $E$. We provide explicit formulas for
computing the Seshadri constants of all ample line bundles on the surfaces
considered. As an application, we obtain a good picture of the behaviour of the
Seshadri function on the nef cone.
