Evidence of curvature effects on the interaction and binding of silver
clusters on folded graphitic surfaces has been shown from both experiment and
theory. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations within the local density
and generalized gradient approximations have been performed for the structural
relaxation of both Ag and Ag$_2$ on curved surfaces, showing a cross-over from
quantum to classical behaviour. Using Lennard-Jones potential to model the
interaction between a single cluster and the graphene surface, evidence is
found for the curvature effect on the binding of silver nano-particles to
folding graphitic surfaces. The theoretical results are compared to SEM and AFM
images of samples obtained from pre-formed silver cluster deposition on
carboneous substrates exhibiting anisotropic pleat structures.
