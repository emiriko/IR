We study heat transport in quantum spin systems analytically and numerically.
First, we demonstrate that heat current through a two-level quantum spin system
can be modulated from zero to a finite value by tuning a magnetic field.
Second, we show that a spin system, consisting of two dissimilar parts - one is
gapped and the other is gapless, exhibits current rectification and negative
differential thermal resistance. Possible experimental realizations by using
molecular junctions or magnetic materials are discussed.
