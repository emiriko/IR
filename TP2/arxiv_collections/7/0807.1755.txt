The propagation of field disturbances is examined in the context of the
effective Yang-Mills Lagrangian, which is intended to be applied to QCD
systems. It is shown that birefringence phenomena can occur in such systems
provided some restrictive conditions, as causality, are fulfilled. Possible
applications to phenomenology are addressed.
