The creation and propagation of sound waves in two-component Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC) are investigated and a new method of wave generation in
binary BEC mixtures is proposed. The method is based on a fast change of the
inter-species interaction constant and is illustrated for two experimental
settings: a drop-like condensate immersed into a second large repulsive
condensate, and a binary mixture of two homogeneous repulsive BEC's. A
mathematical model based on the linearized coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations
is developed and explicit formulae for the space and time dependence of sound
waves are provided. Comparison of the analytical and numerical results shows
excellent agreement, confirming the validity of the proposed approach.
