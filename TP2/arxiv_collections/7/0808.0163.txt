We prove that every graph has a spectral sparsifier with a number of edges
linear in its number of vertices. As linear-sized spectral sparsifiers of
complete graphs are expanders, our sparsifiers of arbitrary graphs can be
viewed as generalizations of expander graphs.
  In particular, we prove that for every $d>1$ and every undirected, weighted
graph $G=(V,E,w)$ on $n$ vertices, there exists a weighted graph
$H=(V,F,\tilde{w})$ with at most $\ceil{d(n-1)}$ edges such that for every $x
\in \R^{V}$, \[ x^{T}L_{G}x \leq x^{T}L_{H}x \leq
(\frac{d+1+2\sqrt{d}}{d+1-2\sqrt{d}})\cdot x^{T}L_{G}x \] where $L_{G}$ and
$L_{H}$ are the Laplacian matrices of $G$ and $H$, respectively. Thus, $H$
approximates $G$ spectrally at least as well as a Ramanujan expander with
$dn/2$ edges approximates the complete graph. We give an elementary
deterministic polynomial time algorithm for constructing $H$.
