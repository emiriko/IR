The formation of quasi-2D nonlinear spin-wave eigenmodes in longitudinally
magnetized stripes of a ferrimagnetic film, so-called guided spin-wave bullets,
was experimentally observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light
scattering spectroscopy and confirmed by numerical simulation. They represent
stable spin-wave packets propagating along a waveguide structure, for which
both transversal instability and interaction with the side edges of the
waveguide are important. The experiments and the numerical simulation of the
evolution of the spin-wave excitations show that the shape of the formed
packets and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement
conditions. The discovery of these modes demonstrates the existence of
quasi-stable nonlinear solutions in the transition regime between
one-dimensional and two-dimensional wave packet propagation.
