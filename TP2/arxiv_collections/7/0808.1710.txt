Statistical arbitrage strategies, such as pairs trading and its
generalizations, rely on the construction of mean-reverting spreads enjoying a
certain degree of predictability. Gaussian linear state-space processes have
recently been proposed as a model for such spreads under the assumption that
the observed process is a noisy realization of some hidden states. Real-time
estimation of the unobserved spread process can reveal temporary market
inefficiencies which can then be exploited to generate excess returns. Building
on previous work, we embrace the state-space framework for modeling spread
processes and extend this methodology along three different directions. First,
we introduce time-dependency in the model parameters, which allows for quick
adaptation to changes in the data generating process. Second, we provide an
on-line estimation algorithm that can be constantly run in real-time. Being
computationally fast, the algorithm is particularly suitable for building
aggressive trading strategies based on high-frequency data and may be used as a
monitoring device for mean-reversion. Finally, our framework naturally provides
informative uncertainty measures of all the estimated parameters. Experimental
results based on Monte Carlo simulations and historical equity data are
discussed, including a co-integration relationship involving two
exchange-traded funds.
