We consider the four-site Higgsless model, which predicts the existence of
four charged and two neutral extra gauge bosons, $W_{1,2}^\pm$ and $Z_{1,2}$.
In contrast to other Higgsless models, characterized by fermiophobic extra
gauge bosons, here sizeable fermion-boson couplings are allowed by the
electroweak precision data. We thus analyse the prospects of detecting the new
predicted particles in the mostly favored Drell-Yan channel at the LHC.
