We have measured the resistivity of PrFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_y$ samples over a wide
range of temperature in order to elucidate the role of electron-phonon
interaction on normal- and superconducting-state properties. The linear T
dependence of $\rho$ above 170 K followed by a saturationlike behavior at
higher temperature is a clear signature of strong electron-phonon coupling.
  From the analysis of T dependence of $\rho$, we have estimated several
normal-state parameters useful for understanding the origin of
superconductivity in this system. Our results suggest that Fe-based
oxypnictides are phonon mediated BCS superconductors like Chevrel phases and
A15 compounds.
