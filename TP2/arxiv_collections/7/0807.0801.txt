We revisit the formulation of the principle of minimal flavor violation (MFV)
in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model, both at moderate
and large tan(beta), and with or without new CP-violating phases. We introduce
a counting rule which keeps track of the highly hierarchical structure of the
Yukawa matrices. In this manner, we are able to control systematically which
terms can be discarded in the soft SUSY breaking part of the Lagrangian. We
argue that for the implementation of this counting rule, it is convenient to
introduce a new basis of matrices in which both the squark (and slepton) mass
terms as well as the trilinear couplings can be expanded. We derive the RGE for
the MFV parameters and show that the beta functions also respect the counting
rule. For moderate tan(beta), we provide explicit analytic solutions of these
RGE and illustrate their behaviour by analyzing the neighbourhood (also
switching on new phases) of the SPS-1a benchmark point. We then show that even
in the case of large tan(beta), the RGE remain valid and that the analytic
solutions obtained for moderate tan(beta) still allow us to understand the most
important features of the running of the parameters, as illustrated with the
help of the SPS-4 benchmark point.
