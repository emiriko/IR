In this note we study spin chain operators in the N=6 Chern-Simons-matter
theory recently proposed by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena to be dual
to type IIA string theory in AdS4xCP3. We study the two-loop dilatation
operator in the gauge theory, and compare to the Penrose limit on the string
theory side.
