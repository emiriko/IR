The theory of scattering of atom pairs in a periodic potential is presented
for the case of different atoms. When the scattering dynamics is restricted to
the lowest Bloch band of the periodic potential, a separation in relative and
average discrete coordinates applies and makes the problem analytically
tractable, and we present a number of new results and features compared to the
case of identical atoms.
