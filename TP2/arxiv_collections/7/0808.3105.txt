We explore the consequences of a set of axioms which extend Scarsini's axioms
for bivariate measures of concordance to the multivariate case and exhibit the
following results: (1) A method of extending measures of concordance from the
bivariate case to arbitrarily high dimensions. (2) A formula expressing the
measure of concordance of the random vectors $(\pm X_1,...,\pm X_n)$ in terms
of the measures of concordance of the "marginal" random vectors
$(X_{i_1},...,X_{i_k})$. (3) A method of expressing the measure of concordance
of an odd-dimensional copula in terms of the measures of concordance of its
even-dimensional marginals. (4) A family of relations which exist between the
measures of concordance of the marginals of a given copula.
