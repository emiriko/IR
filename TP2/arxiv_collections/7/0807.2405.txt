We study the effect of soft gluon emission in the hadroproduction of
squark-antisquark and gluino-gluino pairs at the next-to-leading logarithmic
(NLL) accuracy within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric model. The
one-loop soft anomalous dimension matrices controlling the colour evolution of
the underlying hard-scattering processes are calculated. We present the
resummed total cross sections and show numerical results for proton-proton
collisions at 14 TeV. The size of the NLL contribution to the cross section and
the reduction of the scale dependence of the theoretical predictions due to
including soft gluon effects are discussed.
