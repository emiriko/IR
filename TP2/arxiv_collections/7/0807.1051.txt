In this paper, we use the 'Quasi Normal Modes' (QNM) approach for discussing
the transmission properties of double-side opened optical cavities: in
particular, this approach is specified for one dimensional (1D) 'Photonic Band
Gap' (PBG) structures. Moreover, we conjecture that the density of the modes
(DOM) is a dynamical variable which has the flexibility of varying with respect
to the boundary conditions as well as the initial conditions; in fact, the e.m.
field generated by two monochromatic counter-propagating pump waves leads to
interference effects inside a quarter-wave (QW) symmetric 1D-PBG structure.
Finally, here, for the first time, a large number of theoretical assumptions on
QNM metrics for an open cavity, never discussed in literature, are proved, and
a simple and direct method to calculate the QNM norm for a 1D-PBG structure is
reported.
