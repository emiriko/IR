Using a self-similar approach a general nonsteady theory is elaborated for
the case of the diffusion growth of a gas bubble in a supersaturated solution
of gas in liquid. Due to the fact that the solution and the bubble in it are
physically isolated, the self-similar approach accounts for the balance of the
number of gas molecules in the solution and in the bubble that expells
incompressible liquid solvent while growing. The rate of growth of the bubble
radius in its dependence from gas solubility and solution supersaturation is
obtained. There is a nonsteady effect of rapid increase of the rate of bubble
growth simultaneous with the growth of the product of gas solubility and
solution supersaturation. This product is supplied with a limitation from
above, which also stipulates isothermal conditions of bubble growth. The
smallness of gas solubility is not presupposed.
