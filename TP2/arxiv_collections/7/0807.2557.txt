A connection between Maxwell's equations, Newton's laws, and the special
theory of relativity is established with a derivation that begins with Newton's
verbal enunciation of his first two laws. Derived equations are required to be
covariant, and a simplicity criterion requires that the four-vector force on a
charged particle be linearly related to the four-vector velocity. The
connecting tensor has derivable symmetry properties and contains the electric
and magnetic field vectors. The Lorentz force law emerges, and Maxwell's
equations for free space emerge with the assumption that the tensor and its
dual must both satisfy first order partial differential equations. The
inhomogeneous extension yields a charge density and a current density as being
the source of the field, and yields the law of conservation of charge. Newton's
third law is reinterpreted as a reciprocity statement, which requires that the
charge in the source term can be taken as the same physical entity as that of
the test particle and that both can be assigned the same units. Requiring
covariance under either spatial inversions or time reversals precludes magnetic
charge being a source of electromagnetic fields that exert forces on electric
charges.
