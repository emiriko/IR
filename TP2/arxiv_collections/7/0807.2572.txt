The simplest one-dimensional model for the studying of non-trivial
geometrical effects is a ring shaped device which is formed by joining two
arms. We explore the possibility to model such a system as a two level system
(TLS). Of particular interest is the analysis of quantum stirring, where it is
not evident that the topology is properly reflected within the framework of the
TLS modeling. On the technical side we provide a practical "neighboring level"
approximation for the analysis of such quantum devices, which remains valid
even if the TLS modeling does not apply.
