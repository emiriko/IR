We demonstrate, by solving numerically the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation, the physical character of electron localization in a disordered
two-dimensional lattice. We show, in agreement with the prediction of P. W.
Anderson, that the disorder prevents electron diffusion. The electron becomes
spatially localized in a specific area of the system. Our numerical analysis
confirms that the electron localization is a quantum effect caused by the wave
character of electron propagation and has no analogy in classical mechanics.
