Optimization is fundamental in many areas of science, from computer science
and information theory to engineering and statistical physics, as well as to
biology or social sciences. It typically involves a large number of variables
and a cost function depending on these variables. Optimization problems in the
NP-complete class are particularly difficult, it is believed that the number of
operations required to minimize the cost function is in the most difficult
cases exponential in the system size. However, even in an NP-complete problem
the practically arising instances might, in fact, be easy to solve. The
principal question we address in this thesis is: How to recognize if an
NP-complete constraint satisfaction problem is typically hard and what are the
main reasons for this? We adopt approaches from the statistical physics of
disordered systems, in particular the cavity method developed originally to
describe glassy systems. We describe new properties of the space of solutions
in two of the most studied constraint satisfaction problems - random
satisfiability and random graph coloring. We suggest a relation between the
existence of the so-called frozen variables and the algorithmic hardness of a
problem. Based on these insights, we introduce a new class of problems which we
named "locked" constraint satisfaction, where the statistical description is
easily solvable, but from the algorithmic point of view they are even more
challenging than the canonical satisfiability.
