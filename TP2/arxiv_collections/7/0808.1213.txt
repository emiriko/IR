We study self-duality in the context of the 3+1-split formalism of gravity
with non-zero cosmological constant. Lorentzian self-dual configurations are
conformally flat spacetimes and have boundary data determined by classical
solutions of the three-dimensional gravitational Chern-Simons. For Euclidean
self-dual configurations, the relationship between their boundary initial
positions and initial velocity is also determined by the three-dimensional
gravitational Chern-Simons. Our results imply that bulk self-dual
configurations are holographically described by the gravitational Chern-Simons
theory which can either viewed as a boundary generating functional or as a
boundary effective action.
