The spectacular metal-to-insulator transition of V2O3 can be progressively
suppressed in thin film samples. Evidence for phase separation was observed
using microbridges as a mesoscopic probe of transport properties where the same
film possesses domains that exhibit a metal-to-insulator transition with clear
first order features or remain metallic down to low temperatures. A simple
model consisting of two parallel resistors can be used to quantify a phase
coexistence scenario explaining the measured macroscopic transport properties.
The interaction between film and substrate is the most plausible candidate to
explain this extended phase coexistence as shown by a correlation between the
transport properties and the structural data.
