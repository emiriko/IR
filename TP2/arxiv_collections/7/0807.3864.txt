We are interested in the modeling of wave propagation in poroelastic media.
We consider the biphasic Biot's model in an infinite bilayered medium, with a
plane interface. We adopt the Cagniard-De Hoop's technique. This report is
devoted to the calculation of analytical solutions in two dimensions. The
solutions we present here have been used to validate numerical codes.
