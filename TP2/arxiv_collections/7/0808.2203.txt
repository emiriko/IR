We study the energy-landscape network of Lennard-Jones clusters as a model of
a glass forming system. We find the stable basins and the first order saddles
connecting them, and identify them with the network nodes and links,
respectively. We analyze the network properties and model the system's
evolution. Using the model, we explore the system's response to varying cooling
rates, and reproduce many of the glass transition properties. We also find that
the static network structure gives rise to a critical temperature where a
percolation transition breaks down the space of configurations into
disconnected components. Finally, we discuss the possibility of studying the
system mathematically with a trap-model generalized to networks.
