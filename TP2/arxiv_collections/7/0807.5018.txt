We investigate the most general conditions under which a finite ferromagnetic
long-range inter- acting spin chain achieves unitary fidelity and the shortest
transfer time in transmitting an unknown input qubit. A deeper insight into
system dynamics, allows us to identify an ideal system involving sender and
receiver only. However, this two-spin ideal chain is unpractical due to the
rapid decrease of the coupling strength with the distance. Therefore, we
propose an optimization scheme for ap- proaching the ideal behaviour, while
keeping the interaction strength still reasonably high. The procedure is
scalable with the size of the system and straightforward to implement.
