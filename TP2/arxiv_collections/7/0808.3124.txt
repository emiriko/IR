We show that, by using resummation techniques based on the extension of the
methods of Yennie, Frautschi and Suura to Feynman's formulation of Einstein's
theory, we get quantum field theoretic predictions for the UV fixed-point
values of the dimensionless gravitational and cosmological constants.
Connections to the phenomenological asymptotic safety analysis of Planck scale
cosmology by Bonanno and Reuter are discussed.
