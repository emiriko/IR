This paper provides a unified method for analyzing chaos synchronization of
the generalized Lorenz systems. The considered synchronization scheme consists
of identical master and slave generalized Lorenz systems coupled by linear
state error variables. A sufficient synchronization criterion for a general
linear state error feedback controller is rigorously proven by means of
linearization and Lyapunov's direct methods. When a simple linear controller is
used in the scheme, some easily implemented algebraic synchronization
conditions are derived based on the upper and lower bounds of the master
chaotic system. These criteria are further optimized to improve their
sharpness. The optimized criteria are then applied to four typical generalized
Lorenz systems, i.e. the classical Lorenz system, the Chen system, the Lv
system and a unified chaotic system, obtaining precise corresponding
synchronization conditions. The advantages of the new criteria are revealed by
analytically and numerically comparing their sharpness with that of the known
criteria existing in the literature.
