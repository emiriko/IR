We present a general scheme for implementing bi-directional quantum state
transfer in a quantum swapping channel. Unlike many other schemes for quantum
computation and communication, our method does not require qubit couplings to
be switched on and off. The only control variable is the bias acting on
individual qubits. We show how to derive the parameters of the system (fixed
and variable) such that perfect state transfer can be achieved. Since these
parameters vary linearly with the pulse width, our scheme allows flexibility in
the time scales under which qubits evolve. Unlike quantum spin networks, our
scheme allows the transmission of several quantum states at a time, requiring
only a two qubit separation between quantum states. By pulsing the biases of
several qubits at the same time, we show that only eight bias control lines are
required to achieve state transfer along a channel of arbitrary length.
Furthermore, when the information to be transferred is purely classical in
nature, only three bias control lines are required, greatly simplifying the
circuit complexity.
