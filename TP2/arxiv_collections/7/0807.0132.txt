We study the gravitational corrections to the Maxwell, Dirac and Klein-Gorden
theories in the large extra dimension model in which the gravitons propagate in
the (4+n)-dimensional bulk, while the gauge and matter fields are confined to
the four-dimensional world. The corrections to the two-point Green's functions
of the gauge and matter fields from the exchanges of virtual Kaluza-Klein
gravitons are calculated in the gauge independent background field method. In
the framework of effective field theory, we show that the modified one-loop
renormalizable Lagrangian due to quantum gravitational effects contains a TeV
scale Lee-Wick partner of every gauge and matter field as extra degrees of
freedom in the theory. Thus the large extra dimension model of gravity provides
a natural mechanism to the emergence of these exotic particles which were
recently used to construct an extension of the Standard Model.
