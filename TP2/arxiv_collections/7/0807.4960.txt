A review of the discovery potential of LHC for new phenomena beyond the
Standard Model (BSM) other than Supersymmetry in the early phase of running is
presented. Topics covered include searches for extra dimensions in different
scenarios (ADD, Randall-Sundrum, black holes ...), resonance hunting in
di-lepton, di-photon and di-jet final states, searches for contact
interactions, heavy stable charged particles, technicolor, etc. The strategies
of the ATLAS and CMS experiments to understand the detectors and prepare them
for "search" mode and the prospects for discoveries using early data are
described.
