Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) quantum error-correcting codes are based on
pairs of classical codes which are mutually dual containing. Explicit
constructions of such codes for large blocklengths and with good error
correcting properties are not easy to find. In this paper we propose a
construction of CSS codes which combines a classical code with a two-universal
hash function. We show, using the results of Renner and Koenig, that the
communication rates of such codes approach the hashing bound on tensor powers
of Pauli channels in the limit of large block-length. While the bit-flip errors
can be decoded as efficiently as the classical code used, the problem of
efficiently decoding the phase-flip errors remains open.
