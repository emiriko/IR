While single boson entanglement is known to be equivalent to standard
non-identical particle entanglement, the use of fermionic entanglement is
constrained by a parity superselection rule. Nevertheless we show that within
the framework of second quantization, where local modes play the role of
qubits, the analogy with ordinary entanglement holds: two entangled spinless
fermion modes can be used to teleport a single local fermion mode and to
perform standard dense coding. Entanglement concentration and dilution are
possible for fermions. We clarify the meaning of our results by discussing the
connection with quantum reference frames and conversion between spinless
fermion entanglement and spinless boson entanglement.
