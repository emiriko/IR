In this paper we study the metastable behavior of one of the simplest
disordered spin system, the random field Curie-Weiss model. We will show how
the potential theoretic approach can be used to prove sharp estimates on
capacities and metastable exit times also in the case when the distribution of
the random field is continuous. Previous work was restricted to the case when
the random field takes only finitely many values, which allowed the reduction
to a finite dimensional problem using lumping techniques. Here we produce the
first genuine sharp estimates in a context where entropy is important.
