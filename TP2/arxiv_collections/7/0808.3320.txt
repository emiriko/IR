We have carried out a scientometric analysis of the literature dealing with
graphene, a material which has been identified as a new carbon allotrope. The
investigation is based on the CAplus database of Chemical Abstracts Service,
the INSPEC database of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
and the Web of Science (WoS) of Thomson Reuters. The time evolution of the
publications shows a dramatic increase since 2004 when graphene has been
isolated for the first time. The graphene literature has been analyzed with
respect to the most productive authors, research organizations, countries of
authors, and the leading journals. Furthermore, the time evolution of the major
graphene based research topics and the top 10 most productive research
organizations with respect to their specific topics have been analyzed and are
shown as heat maps. In addition, the graphene research landscape has been
established using the analysis tool STN AnaVist. Finally, a brief citation
analysis has been performed. The time evolution of the impact reveals that,
rather similar to the output evolution, the impact increase of the graphene
papers within the starting period is possibly going to outrun the impact
increase of the fullerenes and nanotubes papers.
