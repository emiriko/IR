Neutron measurements of the equilibration of the staggered magnetization in
DyAs(0.35)V(0.65)O4 are compared with Monte Carlo simulations of spin dynamics
in a planar random-anisotropy magnet. The simulation results are in agreement
with striking observed relaxation phenomena: when cooled rapidly to a low
temperature no magnetic ordering is observed, but when cooled in small steps an
ordered magnetic moment appears which is found to equilibrate exponentially
with time at temperatures through and below the transition temperature. In
contrast to the freezing of spins in other random systems, the time scale of
the relaxation in this system does not increase significantly even at the
lowest temperatures.
