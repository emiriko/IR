Based on the analysis of the measurement data of angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and optics, we show that the charge transfer gap is
significantly smaller than the optical one and is reduced by doping in electron
doped cuprate superconductors. This leads to a strong charge fluctuation
between the Zhang-Rice singlet and the upper Hubbard bands. The basic model for
describing this system is a hybridized two-band $t$-$J$ model. In the symmetric
limit where the corresponding intra- and inter-band hopping integrals are equal
to each other, this two-band model is equivalent to the Hubbard model with an
antiferromagnetic exchange interaction (i.e. the $t$-$U$-$J$ model). The
mean-field result of the $t$-$U$-$J$ model gives a good account for the doping
evolution of the Fermi surface and the staggered magnetization.
