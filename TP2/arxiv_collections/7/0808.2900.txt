It is shown that the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin orbit couplings enhance the
conclusive power in the experiments on the excitonic condensed state by at
least three low temperature effects. First, spin orbit coupling facilitates the
photoluminescense measurements via enhancing the bright contribution in the
otherwise dominantly dark exciton condensed state. The second is the presence
of a power law temperature dependence of the thermodynamic observables in low
temperatures and the weakening of the second order transition at the critical
temperature. The third is the appearance of the nondiagonal elements in the
static spin susceptibility.
