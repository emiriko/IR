Extensive Monte Carlo results are presented for a lattice model of a
bottle-brush polymer under good solvent or Theta solvent conditions. Varying
the side chain length, backbone length, and the grafting density for a rigid
straight backbone, both radial density profiles of monomers and side chain ends
are obtained, as well as structure factors describing the scattering from a
single side chain and from the total bottle-brush polymer. To describe the
structure in the interior of a very long bottle-brush, a periodic boundary
condition in the direction along the backbone is used, and to describe effects
due to the finiteness of the backbone length, a second set of simulations with
free ends of the backbone is performed. In the latter case, the inhomogeneity
of the structure in the direction along the backbone is carefully investigated.
We use these results to test various phenomenological models that have been
proposed to interpret experimental scattering data for bottle-brush
macromolecules. These models aim to extract information on the radial density
profile of a bottle-brush from the total scattering via suitable convolution
approximations. Possibilities to improve such models, guided by our simulation
results, are discussed.
