The electrical resistivity \rho(T) and heat capacity C(T) on single crystals
of SrNi2As2 and EuNi2As2 are reported. While there is no evidence for a
structural transition in either compound, SrNi2As2 is found to be a bulk
superconductor at T_c=0.62 K with a Sommerfeld coefficient of \gamma= 8.7
mJ/mol K^2 and a small upper critical field H_{c2} \sim 200 Oe. No
superconductivity was found in EuNi2As2 above 0.4 K, but anomalies in \rho and
C reveal that magnetic order associated with the Eu^{2+} magnetic moments
occurs at T_m = 14 K.
