We present new measurements of differential cross sections for
Z/gamma*(->mumu)+jet+X production in a 1 fb-1 data sample collected with the D0
detector in proton anti-proton collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. Results include
the first measurements differential in the Z/gamma* transverse momentum and
rapidity, as well as new measurements differential in the leading jet
transverse momentum and rapidity. Next-to-leading order perturbative QCD
predictions are compared to the measurements, and reasonable agreement is
observed, except in the region of low Z/gamma* transverse momentum. Predictions
from two event generators based on matrix elements and parton showers, and one
pure parton shower event generator are also compared to the measurements. These
show significant overall normalization differences to the data and have varied
success in describing the shape of the distributions.
