The parameter space of dynamical systems arising in applications is often
found to be high-dimensional and difficult to explore. We construct a fast
algorithm to numerically analyze "quantitative features" of dynamical systems
depending on parameters. Using a classical problem from mathematical ecology as
an example, we demonstrate how to apply the algorithm to investigate the
amplitude of a limit cycle depending on seven parameters. We stress the
practical value of the algorithm but we also provide a rigorous error analysis
to justify the overall strategy. Our approach turns out to be particularly
useful in the case of comparing experimental data to a model defined by
differential equations and to investigate whether the equations can approximate
the modeled system.
