For classical canonical transformations, one can, using the Wigner
transformation, pass from their representation in Hilbert space to a kernel in
phase space. In this paper it will be discussed how the time-dependence of the
uncertainties of the corresponding time-dependent quantum problems can be
incorporated into this formalism.
