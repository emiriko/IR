The effects of DNA on the fluorescence of silver phycocyanin complexes were
investigated. It was shown, that the fluorescence intensity of phycocyanin
decreases, when silver ions are added but the following DNA addition gives rise
to fluorescence buildup. Fluorescence spectroscopy provides insight of silver
phycocyanin interactions. Fluorescence measurements demostrate phycocyanin
quenching of silver emission intensities. SternVolmer quenching constant was
obtained from the linear quenching plot. Blue shifts in the fluorescence
spectra were observed during silver binding to phycocyanin.
