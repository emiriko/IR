In this talk I discuss novel explanations for the azimuthal correlations
observed in heavy-ion collisions. I review some ideas about correlations and
the evolution of heavy-ion collisions. Some aspects of the correlations
observed in heavy-ion collisions may be indicitive of the suppression of
super-horizon fluctuations.
