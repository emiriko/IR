We introduce an approach to describe quantum-coherent evolution of a system
of cold atoms in an optical lattice triggered by a change in superlattice
potential. Using a time-dependent mean field description, we map the problem to
a strong coupling limit of previously studied time-dependent BCS model. We
compare the mean field dynamics to a simulation using light-cone methods and
find reasonable agreement for numerically accessible times. The mean field
model is integrable, and gives rise to a rich behavior, in particular to beats
and recurrences in the order parameter, as well as singularities in the
momentum distribution, directly measureable in cold atom experiment.
