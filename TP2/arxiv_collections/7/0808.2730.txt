The historical developments of conformal transformations and symmetries are
sketched: Their origin from stereographic projections of the globe, their
blossoming in two dimensions within the field of analytic complex functions,
the generic role of transformations by reciprocal radii in dimensions higher
than two and their linearization in terms of polyspherical coordinates by
Darboux, Weyl's attempt to extend General Relativity, the slow rise of finite
dimensional conformal transformations in classical field theories and the
problem of their interpretation, then since about 1970 the rapid spread of
their acceptance for asymptotic and structural problems in quantum field
theories and beyond, up to the current AdS/CFT conjecture. The occasion for the
present article: hundred years ago Bateman and Cunningham discovered the form
invariance of Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism with respect to
conformal space-time transformations.
