The problem of an apparent inconsistency between the fission rates derived on
the basis of Bohr-Wheeler's transition-state method and Kramers' dynamical
model of nuclear fission, first pointed out by Strutinsky in 1973, is
revisited. The study is based on studying the features of individual
trajectories on the fission path.
