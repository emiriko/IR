The extinction time of an isolated population can be exponentially reduced by
a periodic modulation of its environment. We investigate this effect using, as
an example, a stochastic branching-annihilation process with a time-dependent
branching rate. The population extinction is treated in eikonal approximation,
where it is described as an instanton trajectory of a proper reaction
Hamiltonian. The modulation of the environment perturbs this trajectory and
synchronizes it with the modulation phase. We calculate the corresponding
change in the action along the instanton using perturbation techniques
supported by numerical calculations. The techniques include a first-order
theory with respect to the modulation amplitude, a second-order theory in the
spirit of the Kapitsa pendulum effect, and adiabatic theory valid for low
modulation frequencies.
