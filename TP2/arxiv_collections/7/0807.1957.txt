Over the last decade, there has been a respectable level of scientific
interest regarding the concept of a warp drive. This is a hypothetical
propulsion device that could theoretically circumvent the traditional
limitations of special relativity which restricts spacecraft to sub-light
velocities. Any breakthrough in this field would revolutionize space
exploration and open the doorway to interstellar travel. This article discusses
a novel approach to generating the warp bubble necessary for such propulsion;
the mathematical details of this theory are discussed in an article published
in the Journal of the British Interpanetary Society. The theory is based on
some of the exciting predictions coming out of string theory and it is the aim
of this article to introduce the warp drive idea from a non-mathematical
perspective that should be accessible to a wide range of readers.
