There are a number of experiments and observations that appear to argue for
the existence of particles, including the photoelectric and Compton effects,
exposure of only one film grain by a spread-out photon wave function, and
particle-like trajectories in bubble chambers. It can be shown, however, that
all the particle-like phenomena can be explained by using properties of the
wave functions/state vectors alone. Thus there is no evidence for particles.
Wave-particle duality arises because the wave functions alone have both
wave-like and particle-like properties. Further the results of the Bell-Aspect
experiment and other experiments on entangled systems, which seem to imply
peculiar properties for particles if they exist, are easily and naturally
understood if reality consists of the state vectors alone. The linear
equation-Hilbert space structure for the state vectors, by itself, can explain
every mystery in quantum mechanics except the origin of the probability law.
