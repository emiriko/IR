We address an imbalanced two-component atomic Fermi gas restricted by a
one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice and an external harmonic potential, within
the mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We show that
characteristic features of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state
are visible in the RF-spectra and in the momentum resolved photoemission
spectra of the gas. Specially, Andreev states or mid-gap states can be clearly
resolved, which gives a direct experimentally observable signature of the
oscillating order parameter.
