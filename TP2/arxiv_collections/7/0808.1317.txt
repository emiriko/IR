The $\nu/\bar{\nu}-^{12}$C cross sections are evaluated in the projected
quasiparticle random phase approximation (PQRPA). The cross section for $\nu_e$
as a function of the incident neutrino energy is compared with recent
theoretical calculations of more sophisticated models. The $\bar{\nu}-^{12}$C
cross section is calculated for the first time with the PQRPA. The distribution
of cross sections averaged with the Michel spectrum as well as with other
estimated fluxes for future experiments is compared for both $\nu_e$ and
$\bar{\nu}_e$. Some astrophysical implications are addressed.
