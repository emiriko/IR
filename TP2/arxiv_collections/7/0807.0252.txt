The existence of the third cumulant $S_{3}$ of voltage fluctuations has
demonstrated the non-Gaussian aspect of shot noise in electronic transport.
Until now, measurements have been performed at low frequency, \textit{i.e.} in
the classical regime $\hbar \omega < eV, k_BT$ where voltage fluctuations arise
from charge transfer process. We report here the first measurement of $S_3$ at
high frequency, in the quantum regime $\hbar \omega > eV, k_BT$. In this
regime, experiment cannot be seen as a charge counting statistics problem
anymore. It raises central questions of the statistics of quantum noise: 1) the
electromagnetic environment of the sample has been proven to strongly influence
the measurement, through the possible modulation of the noise of the sample.
What happens to this mechanism in the quantum regime? 2) For $\hbar \omega >
eV$, the noise is due to zero point fluctuations and keeps its equilibrium
value: $S_2= G \hbar \omega$ with $G$ the conductance of the sample. Therefore,
$S_2$ is independent of the bias voltage and no photon is emitted by the
conductor. Is it possible, as suggested by some theories, that $S_3 \neq 0$ in
this regime? With regard to these questions, we give theoretical and
experimental answers to the environmental effects showing that they involve
dynamics of the quantum noise. Using these results, we investigate the question
of the third cumulant of quantum noise in the a tunnel junction.
