A possible approach to description of the non equilibrium system has been
proposed. Based on the Fokker-Plank equation in term of energy for non
equilibrium distribution function of macroscopical system was obtained the
stationary solution which can be interpreted as the equilibrium distribution
function for new energetic state. The proposed approach takes into account the
possible motion between different states of system, induced by dissipation of
energy and influence of environment which dependence on energy of the system. A
non-linear model, which describe possible stationary state of system with
different processes in it, has been described.
