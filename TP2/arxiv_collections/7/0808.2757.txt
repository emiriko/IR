The goal of the present paper is the investigation of the evolution of
anisotropic regular structures and turbulence at large Reynolds number in the
multi-dimensional Burgers equation. We show that we have local isotropization
of the velocity and potential fields at small scale inside cellular zones. For
periodic waves, we have simple decay inside of a frozen structure. The global
structure at large times is determined by the initial correlations, and for
short range correlated field, we have isotropization of turbulence. The other
limit we consider is the final behavior of the field, when the processes of
nonlinear and harmonic interactions are frozen, and the evolution of the field
is determined only by the linear dissipation.
