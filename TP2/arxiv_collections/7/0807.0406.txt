This Thesis reviews Vasiliev's approach to Higher-Spin Gauge Theory and
contains some original results concerning new exact solutions of the Vasiliev
equations and the representation theory of the higher-spin algebra. The review
part covers the various formulations of the free theory as well as Vasiliev's
full nonlinear equations, in particular focusing on their algebraic structure
and on their properties in various space-time signatures. Then, the original
results are presented. First, the 4D Vasiliev equations are formulated in
space-times with signatures (4-p,p) and non-vanishing cosmological constant,
and some new exact solutions are found, depending on continuous and discrete
parameters: (a) an SO(4-p,p)-invariant family of solutions; (b) non-maximally
symmetric solutions with vanishing Weyl tensors and higher-spin gauge fields,
that differ from the maximally symmetric background solutions in the auxiliary
field sector; and (c) solutions of the chiral models with an infinite tower of
Weyl tensors proportional to totally symmetric products of two principal
spinors. These are apparently the first exact 4D solutions with non-vanishing
massless higher-spin fields. Finally, a generalized harmonic expansion of the
Vasiliev's master zero-form is performed as a map from the associative algebra
A of operators on the singleton phase space to representations of the
background isometry algebra that include one-particle states along with
linearized runaway solutions. Such Harish-Chandra modules are unitarizable in a
Tr_A-norm rather than in the standard Killing norm. We also take the first
steps towards a regularization scheme for handling strongly coupled
higher-derivative interactions within this operator formalism.
