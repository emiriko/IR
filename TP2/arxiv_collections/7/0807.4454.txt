We report on an updated Paris nucleon-antinucleon optical potential. The
long- and intermediate-range real parts are obtained by G-parity transformation
of the Paris nucleon-nucleon potential based on a theoretical
dispersion-relation treatment of the correlated and uncorrelated two-pion
exchange. The short-range imaginary potential parametrization results from the
calculation of the nucleon-antinucleon annihilation box diagram into two mesons
with a nucleon-antinucleon intermediate state in the crossed channel. The
parametrized real and imaginary short range parts are determined by fitting not
only the existing experimental data included in the 1999 version of the Paris
nucleon-antinucleon potential, but also the recent antiprotonic-hydrogen data
and antineutron-proton total cross sections. The description of these new
observables is improved. Only this readjusted potential generates an isospin
zero 1S0, 52 MeV broad quasibound state at 4.8 MeV below the threshold. Recent
BES data on J/psi decays could support the existence of such a state.
