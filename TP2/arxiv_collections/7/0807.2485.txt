The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) has recently
reached the end of its fifth science run (S5), having collected more than a
year worth of data. Analysis of the data is still ongoing but a positive
detection of gravitational waves, while possible, is not realistically expected
for most likely sources. This is particularly true for what concerns
gravitational waves from known pulsars. In fact, even under the most optimistic
(and not very realistic) assumption that all the pulsar's observed spin-down is
due to gravitational waves, the gravitational wave strain at earth from all the
known isolated pulsars (with the only notable exception of the Crab pulsar)
would not be strong enough to be detectable by existing detectors. By August
2006, LIGO had produced enough data for a coherent integration capable to
extract signal from noise that was weaker than the one expected from the Crab
pulsar's spin-down limit. No signal was detected, but beating the spin-down
limit is a considerable achievement for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration
(LSC). It is customary to translate the upper limit on strain from a pulsar
into a more astrophysically significant upper limit on ellipticity. Once the
spin-down limit has been beaten, it is possible to release the constraint that
all the spin-down is due to gravitational wave emission. A more complete model
with diverse braking mechanisms can be used to set limits on several
astrophysical parameters of the pulsar. This paper shows possible values of
such parameters for the Crab pulsar given the current limit on gravitational
waves from this neutron star.
