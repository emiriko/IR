To the foundation of a principally new short-term forecasting method there
has been laid down a theory of surrounding us world's creation and of physical
vacuum as a result of interaction of byuons - discrete objects. The definition
of the byuon contains the cosmological vector-potential A_g - a novel
fundamental vector constant. This theory predicts a new anisotropic interaction
of nature objects with the physical vacuum. A peculiar "tap" to gain new energy
(giving rise to an earthquake) are elementary particles because their masses
are proportional to the modulus of some summary potential A_sum that contains
potentials of all known fields. The value of A_sum cannot be larger than the
modulus of A_g. In accordance with the experimental results a new force
associated with A_sum ejects substance from the area of the weakened A_sum
along a conical formation with the opening of 100 +- 10 and the axis directed
along the vector A_sum. This vector has the following coordinates in the second
equatorial coordinate system: right ascension alpha = 293 +- 10, declination
delta = 36 +- 10. Nearly 100% probability of an earthquake (earthquakes of 6
points strong and more by the Richter scale) arises when in the process of the
earth rotation the zenith vector of a seismically dangerous region and/or the
vectorial potential of Earth's magnetic fields are in a certain way oriented
relative to the vector A_g. In the work, basic models and standard mechanisms
of earthquakes are briefly considered, results of processing of information on
the earthquakes in the context of global spatial anisotropy caused by the
existence of the vector A_g, are presented, and an analysis of them is given.
