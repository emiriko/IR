We study the energy spectrum and electronic properties of two-dimensional
electron gas in a periodic magnetic field of zero average with a symmetry of
triangular lattice. We demonstrate how the structure of electron energy bands
can be changed with the variation of the field strength, so that we can start
from nearly free electron gas and then transform it continuously to a system of
essentially localized chiral electron states. We find that the electrons near
some minima of the effective potential are responsible for occurrence of
dissipationless persistent currents creating a lattice of current contours. The
topological properties of the electron energy bands are also varied with the
intensity of periodic field. We calculated the topological Chern numbers of
several lower energy bands as a function of the field. The corresponding Hall
conductivity is nonzero and, when the Fermi level lies in the gap, it is
quantized.
