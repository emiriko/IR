Effects of vacuum polarization by hadronic and heavy-fermion insertions were
the last unknown two-loop QED corrections to high-energy Bhabha scattering and
have been first announced in \cite{Actis:2007fs}. Here we describe the
corrections in detail and explore their numerical influence. The hadronic
contributions to the virtual O(alpha^2) QED corrections to the
Bhabha-scattering cross-section are evaluated using dispersion relations and
computing the convolution of hadronic data with perturbatively calculated
kernel functions. The technique of dispersion integrals is also employed to
derive the virtual O(alpha^2) corrections generated by muon-, tau- and
top-quark loops in the small electron-mass limit for arbitrary values of the
internal-fermion masses. At a meson factory with 1 GeV center-of-mass energy
the complete effect of hadronic and heavy-fermion corrections amounts to less
than 0.5 per mille and reaches, at 10 GeV, up to about 2 per mille. At the Z
resonance it amounts to 2.3 per mille at 3 degrees; overall, hadronic
corrections are less than 4 per mille. For ILC energies (500 GeV or above), the
combined effect of hadrons and heavy-fermions becomes 6 per mille at 3 degrees;
hadrons contribute less than 20 per mille in the whole angular region.
