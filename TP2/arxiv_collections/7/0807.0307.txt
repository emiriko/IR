We study molecular para-hydrogen (p-${\rm H_{2}}$) and ortho-deuterium
(o-${\rm D_{2}}$) in two dimensions and in the limit of zero temperature by
means of the diffusion Monte Carlo method. We report energetic and structural
properties of both systems like the total and kinetic energy per particle,
radial pair distribution function, and Lindemann's ratio in the low pressure
regime. By comparing the total energy per particle as a function of the density
in liquid and solid p-${\rm H_{2}}$, we show that molecular para-hydrogen, and
also ortho-deuterium, remain solid at zero temperature. Interestingly, we
assess the quality of three different symmetrized trial wave functions, based
on the Nosanow-Jastrow model, in the p-${\rm H_{2}}$ solid film at the
variational level. In particular, we analyze a new type of symmetrized trial
wave function which has been used very recently to describe solid $^{4}$He and
found that also characterizes hydrogen satisfactorily. With this wave function,
we show that the one-body density matrix $\varrho_{1} (r)$ of solid p-${\rm
H_{2}}$ possesses off-diagonal long range order, with a condensate fraction
that increases sizably in the negative pressure regime.
