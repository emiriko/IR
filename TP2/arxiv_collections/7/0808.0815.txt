Recently, explicit real time dynamics has been studied in various systems.
These quantum mechanical dynamics could provide new recipes in information
processing. We study quantum dynamics under time dependent external fields, and
explore how to control the quantum state, and also how to bring the state into
a target state. Here, we investigate a pure quantum mechanical dynamics,
dynamics in quantum Monte Carlo simulation and also in quantum master equation.
For the control magnetic states, operators which do not commute with
magnetization are important. We study case of the transverse Ising model, in
which we compare natures of thermal and quantum fluctuations. We also study the
cases of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, where we find a peculiar energy
level structure. Moreover we study the case of itinerant magnetic state, where
we study the change from the Mott insulator to the Nagaoka ferromagnetic state.
Effects of dissipation are also discussed.
