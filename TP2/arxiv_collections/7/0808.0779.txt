In quantum theory, symmetry has to be defined necessarily in terms of the
family of unit rays, the state space. The theorem of Wigner asserts that a
symmetry so defined at the level of rays can always be lifted into a linear
unitary or an antilinear antiunitary operator acting on the underlying Hilbert
space. We present a proof of this theorem which is both elementary and
economical. Central to our proof is the recognition that a given Wigner
symmetry can, by post-multiplication by a unitary symmetry, be taken into
either the identity or complex conjugation. Our analysis involves a judicious
interplay between the effect a given Wigner symmetry has on certain
two-dimensional subspaces and the effect it has on the entire Hilbert space.
