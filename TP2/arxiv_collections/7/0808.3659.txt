Electrons in quasicrystals generically possess critical wave functions that
are neither exponentially-localized nor extended, but rather decay
algebraically in space. Nevertheless, motivated by recent calculations on the
square and cubic Fibonacci quasicrystals, we investigate whether it is possible
to obtain extended wave functions expressed as linear combinations of
degenerate, or nearly-degenerate, critical eigenfunctions. We find that not
only is this possible, but that the wave functions that emerge are Bloch-like,
exhibiting the quasiperiodic long-range order of the underlying quasicrystal.
We discuss the significance of this result for the study of electronic
properties of real quasicrystals.
