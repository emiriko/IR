Without any further adjusting of parameters, a relativistic constituent quark
model, successful in the description of the data for the nucleon elastic form
factors and of the dominant contribution for the nucleon to Delta
electromagnetic transition, is used here to predict the dominant
electromagnetic form factors of the Delta baryon. The model is based on a
simple Delta wave function corresponding to a quark-diquark system in an
S-state. The results for E0 and M1 are consistent both with experimental
results and lattice calculations. The remaining form factors E2 and M3 vanish,
given the symmetric structure taken for the Delta.
