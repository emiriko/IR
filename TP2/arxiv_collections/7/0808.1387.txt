We are concerned with Hardy and BMO spaces of operator-valued functions
analytic in the unit disk of $\mathbb{C}.$ In the case of the Hardy space, we
involve the atomic decomposition since the usual argument in the scalar setting
is not suitable. Several properties (the Garsia-norm equivalent theorem,
Carleson measure, and so on) of BMOA spaces are extended to the operator-valued
setting. Then, the operator-valued $\mathrm{H}^1$-BMOA duality theorem is
proved. Finally, by the $\mathrm{H}^1$-BMOA duality we present the Lusin area
integral and Littlewood-Paley $g$-function characterizations of the
operator-valued analytic Hardy space.
