We measure rate asymmetries for the rare decays B->K(*)l+l-, where l+l- is
either e+e- or mu+mu-, using a sample of 384 million BBbar events collected
with the Babar detector at the PEP-II e+e- collider. We find no evidence for
direct CP or lepton-flavor asymmetries. For dilepton masses below the J/psi
resonance, we find evidence for unexpectedly large isospin asymmetries in both
B->Kl+l- and B->K*l+l-, which differ respectively by 3.2 sigma and 2.7 sigma,
including systematic uncertainties, from the Standard Model expectations.
