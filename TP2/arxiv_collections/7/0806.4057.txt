For any positive integer r, let pi_{2r}(x) denote the number of prime pairs
(p, p+2r) with p not exceeding (large) x. According to the prime-pair
conjecture of Hardy and Littlewood, pi_{2r}(x) should be asymptotic to
2C_{2r}li_2(x) with an explicit positive constant C_{2r}. A heuristic argument
indicates that the remainder e_{2r}(x) in this approximation cannot be of lower
order than x^beta, where beta is the supremum of the real parts of zeta's
zeros. The argument also suggests an approximation for pi_{2r}(x) similar to
one of Riemann for pi(x).
