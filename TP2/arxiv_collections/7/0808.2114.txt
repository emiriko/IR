In this article, we study the final-state rescattering effects in the decays
$B^0\to \chi_{c0}K^{*0}$ and $B^+ \to \chi_{c0}K^{*+}$, and observe the
corrections are zero in the SU(3) limit, which is warranted by the heavy quark
symmetry. It is difficult to accommodate the experimental data without
fine-tuning.
