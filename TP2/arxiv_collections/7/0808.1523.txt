We attempt to reconcile large trilinear R-parity violating interactions in a
supersymmetric (SUSY) theory with the observed pattern of neutrino masses and
mixing. We show that, with a restricted number of such interaction terms with
the $\lambda'$-type couplings in the range (0.1-1.0), it is possible to forbid
one-loop contributions to the neutrino mass matrix. This is illustrated with
the help of a `working example' where an econnomic choice of SUSY parameters is
made, with three non-vanishing and `large' R-parity violating terms in the
superpotential. The two-loop contributions in such a case can not only generate
the masses in the requisite order but can also lead us to specific allowed
regions of the parameter space.
