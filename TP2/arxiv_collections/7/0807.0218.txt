At small x, the gluon distribution dominates the nuclear wave function. The
increase needs to be tamed in avoid violating unitarity constraints. The most
efficient way to study this in colliders is through e+A collisions as the
nucleus is an efficient amplifier of the physics of high gluon densities. To
this end, there are proposals to build an e+A machine in the USA which would
operate over a large range of energies and masses. These studies would also
allow an in-depth comparison to A+A collisions where recent results have given
tantalising hints of a new state of matter produced with partonic degrees of
freedom. As gluon interactions are the dominant source of hard probes, they
themselves must be understood before the results are explained quantitatively.
