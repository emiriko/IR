The electronic states of the FeAs plane in iron-based superconductors are
investigated on the basis of the two-dimensional 16-band d-p model, where the
tight-binding parameters are determined so as to fit the band structure
obtained by the density functional calculation for LaFeAsO. The model includes
the Coulomb interaction on a Fe site: the intra- and inter-orbital direct terms
U and U', the exchange coupling J and the pair-transfer J'. Within the random
phase approximation (RPA), we discuss the pairing symmetry of possible
superconducting states including s-wave and d-wave pairing on the U'-J plane.
