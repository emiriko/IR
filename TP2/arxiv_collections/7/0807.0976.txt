We discuss the recent derivation of the one-loop squared virtual QCD
corrections to the W boson pair production in the quark-anti-quark-annihilation
channel in the limit where all kinematical invariants are large compared to the
mass of the W boson. In particular, we elaborate on the combined use of the
helicity matrix formalism with the Mellin-Barnes representations technique.
