We report on the observation of the circular (helicity-dependent) and linear
photogalvanic effects in Si-MOSFETs with inversion channels. The developed
microscopic theory demonstrates that the circular photogalvanic effect in Si
structures it is of pure orbital nature originating from the quantum
interference of different pathways contributing to the light absorption.
