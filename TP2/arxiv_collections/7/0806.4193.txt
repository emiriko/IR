We calculate current, spin current and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) for a
quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads in the presence of a square wave of
bias voltage. Our results are obtained via time-dependent nonequilibrium Green
function. Both parallel and antiparallel lead magnetization alignments are
considered. The main findings include a wave of spin accumulation and spin
current that can change sign as the time evolves, spikes in the TMR signal and
a TMR sign change due to an ultrafast switch from forward to reverse current in
the emitter lead.
