I report on a numerical program, which can be used to calculate any infrared
safe three-jet observable in electron-positron annihilation to
next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant alpha_s. The
results are compared to a recent calculation by another group. Numerical
differences in three colour factors are discussed and explained.
