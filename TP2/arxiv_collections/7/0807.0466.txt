It is commonly believed that in confining vector-like gauge theories the
center and chiral symmetry realizations are parametrically entangled, and if
phase transitions occur, they must take place around the strong scale
$\Lambda^{-1}$ of the gauge theory. We demonstrate that (non-thermal)
vector-like theories formulated on ${\mathbb R}^{3} \times S^1$ where $S^1$ is
a spatial circle exhibit new dynamical scales and new phenomena. There are
chiral phase transitions taking place at $\Lambda^{-1}/N_c$ in the absence of
any change in center symmetry. $\Lambda^{-1}/N_c$, invisible in (planar)
perturbation theory, is also the scale where abelian versus non-abelian
confinement regimes meet. Large $N_c$ volume independence (a working
Eguchi-Kawai reduction) provides new insights and independently confirms the
existence of these scales. We show that certain phases and scales are outside
the reach of holographic (supergravity) modeling of QCD.
