The fluctuation in electric current in nonequilibrium steady states is
investigated by molecular dynamics simulation of macroscopically uniform
conductors. At low frequencies, appropriate decomposition of the spectral
intensity of current into thermal and excess fluctuations provides a simple
picture of excess fluctuations behaving as shot noise. This indicates that the
fluctuation-dissipation relation may be violated in a universal manner by the
appearance of shot noise for a wide range of systems with particle or momentum
transport.
