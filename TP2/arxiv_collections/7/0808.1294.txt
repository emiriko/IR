We review the formulation of Landau hydrodynamics and find that the rapidity
distribution of produced particles in the center-of-mass system should be more
appropriately modified as dN/dy \exp[\sqrt{y_b^2-y^2}], where
y_b=\ln[\sqrt{s_{NN}}/m_p] is the beam nucleon rapidity, instead of Landau's
original distribution, dN/dy(Landau) \exp[\sqrt{L^2-y^2}], where
L=\ln[\sqrt{s_{NN}}/2m_p]. The modified distribution agrees better with
experimental dN/dy data than the original Landau distribution and can be
represented well by the Gaussian distribution, dN/dy(Gaussian) \exp[-y^2/2L].
Past successes of the Gaussian distribution in explaining experimental rapidity
data can be understood, not because it is an approximation of the original
Landau distribution, but because it is in fact a close representation of the
modified distribution. Predictions for pp and AA collisions at LHC energies in
Landau hydrodynamics are presented.
