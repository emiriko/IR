We show that a scaling law exists for the near resonant dynamics of cold
kicked atoms in the presence of a randomly fluctuating pulse amplitude.
Analysis of a quasi-classical phase-space representation of the quantum system
with noise allows a new scaling law to be deduced. The scaling law and
associated stability are confirmed by comparison with quantum simulations and
experimental data.
