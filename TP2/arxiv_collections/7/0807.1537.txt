The influence of nano-metal films on the Goos-Haenchen shift (GHS) is
investigated. The films deposited at the total reflecting surface of a perspex
prism/air have a sheet resistance varying between Z = 25 and 3 000 Ohm. A
resonance-like enhancement of the shift and of the absorption is found for TE
polarized waves, when the sheet resistance approaches the value of the vacuum
impedance. For TM waves the influence of the metal films on the GHS is
comparatively weak. The experiments are carried out with microwaves. Keywords:
