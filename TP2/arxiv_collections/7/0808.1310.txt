Graphene bilayers can condense into a state with spontaneous interlayer phase
coherence that supports dissipationless counterflow supercurrents. Here we
address the influence of disorder on the graphene bilayer mean-field and
Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperatures and report on a simple criteria for
the survival of pair condensation.
