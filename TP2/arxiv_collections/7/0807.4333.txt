We discuss the influence of different initial conditions for the stress
tensor and the effect of bulk viscosity on the expansion and cooling of the
fireball created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In particular, we
explore the evolution of longitudinal and transverse components of the pressure
and the extent of dissipative entropy production in the one-dimensional,
boost-invariant hydrodynamic model. We find that a bulk viscosity consistent
with recent estimates from lattice QCD further slows the equilibration of the
system, however it does not significantly increase the entropy produced.
