This letter details a simple scheme to entangle two neutrons by successive
scattering from a macroscopic sample. In zero magnetic field the entanglement
falls as the sample size increases. However, by applying a field and tuning the
momentum of the neutrons, one can achieve a substantial degree of entanglement
irrespective of the size of the sample.
