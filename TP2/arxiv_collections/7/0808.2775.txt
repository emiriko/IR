This paper studies a simple class of zero-sum games played by two competing
quantum players: each player sends a mixed quantum state to a referee, who
performs a joint measurement on the two states to determine the players'
payoffs. We prove that an equilibrium point of any such game can be
approximated by means of an efficient parallel algorithm, which implies that
one-turn quantum refereed games, wherein the referee is specified by a quantum
circuit, can be simulated in polynomial space.
