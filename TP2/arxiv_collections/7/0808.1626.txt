In this article, a special static spherically symmetric perfect fluid
solution of Einstein's equations is provided. Though pressure and density both
diverge at the origin, their ratio remains constant. The solution presented
here fails to give positive pressure but nevertheless, it satisfies all energy
conditions. In this new spacetime geometry, the metric becomes singular at some
finite value of radial coordinate although, by using isotropic coordinates,
this singularity could be avoided, as has been shown here. Some characteristics
of this solution are also discussed.
