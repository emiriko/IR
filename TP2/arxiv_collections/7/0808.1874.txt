Condensed Fermi systems with an odd number of particles can be described by
means of polarizing external fields having a time-odd character. We illustrate
how this works for Fermi gases and atomic nuclei treated by density functional
theory or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory. We discuss the method based on
introducing two chemical potentials for different superfluid components,
whereby one may change the particle-number parity of the underlying
quasiparticle vacuum. Formally, this method is a variant of non-collective
cranking, and the procedure is equivalent to the so-called blocking. We present
and exemplify relations between the two-chemical-potential method and the
cranking approximation for Fermi gases and nuclei.
