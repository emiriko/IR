The Comment by Holas et al. [A. Holas, M. Cinal, and N. H. March, Phys. Rev.
A 78, 016501 (2008)] on our recent paper [J. Schirmer and A. Dreuw, Phys. Rev.
A 75, 022513 (2007)]. is an appropriate and valuable contribution. As a small
addendum we briefly comment on the relationship between the radical Kohn-Sham
(rKS) form of density-functional theory and previous one-electron (particle)
potential (OPP) developments.
