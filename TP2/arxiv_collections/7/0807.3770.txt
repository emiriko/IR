Based on the microscopic mechanisms of (1) charge-excitation-induced negative
effective U in s^1 or d^9 electronic configurations, and (2)
exchange-correlation-induced negative effective U in d^4 or d^6 electronic
configurations, we propose a general rule and materials design of negative
effective U system in itinerant (ionic and metallic) system for the realization
of high-T_c superconductors. We design a T_c-enhancing layer (or clusters) of
charge-excitation-induced negative effective $U$ connecting the superconducting
layers for the realistic systems.
