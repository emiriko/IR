We evaluate the LHC discovery potential for the fourth family Standard Model
neutrinos in the process $pp\to Z/h\to\nu_{4}{\bar{\nu}_{4}}\to W\mu W\mu$. We
show that, depending on their masses, the simultaneous discovery of both the
Higgs boson and the heavy neutrinos is probable at early stages of LHC
operation. Results are presented for both Majorana and Dirac type fourth family
neutrinos.
