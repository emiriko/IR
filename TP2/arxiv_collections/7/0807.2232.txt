We describe parametric down conversion process in a two-level atomic gas,
where the atoms are in a superposition state of relevant energy levels. This
superposition results in splitting of the phase matching condition into three
different conditions. Another, more important, peculiarity of the system under
discussion is the nonsaturability of amplification coefficients with increasing
pump wave intensity, under "sideband" generation conditions.
