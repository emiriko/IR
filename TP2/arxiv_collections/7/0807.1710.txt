Jin et al reported that axisymmetric simulations of NS-like objects with
polytropic EOS undergo critical gravitational collapse. As the critical
collapse observed via fine-tuning of the adiabatic index $\Gamma$, they
conjecture that critical phenomena may occur in realistic astrophysical
scenarios. To clarify the implications this numerical observation has on
realistic astrophysical scenarios, here, we perform dynamical analysis on the
structure of the critical collapse observed in the former work. We report the
time scales and oscillation frequencies exhibited by the critical solution and
compare these results with values obtained from analytic perturbative mode
analysis of equilibrium TOV configurations. We also establish the universality
of the critical solution with respect to a 1-parameter family of initial data
as well as the phase space manifold of the critical collapse.
