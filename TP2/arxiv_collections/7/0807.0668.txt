Entanglement is widely believed to lie at the heart of the advantages offered
by a quantum computer. This belief is supported by the discovery that a
noiseless (pure) state quantum computer must generate a large amount of
entanglement in order to offer any speed up over a classical computer. However,
deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit (DQC1), which employs
noisy (mixed) states, is an efficient model that generates at most a marginal
amount of entanglement. Although this model cannot implement any arbitrary
algorithm it can efficiently solve a range of problems of significant
importance to the scientific community. Here we experimentally implement a
first-order case of a key DQC1 algorithm and explicitly characterise the
non-classical correlations generated. Our results show that while there is no
entanglement the algorithm does give rise to other non-classical correlations,
which we quantify using the quantum discord - a stronger measure of
non-classical correlations that includes entanglement as a subset. Our results
suggest that discord could replace entanglement as a necessary resource for a
quantum computational speed-up. Furthermore, DQC1 is far less resource
intensive than universal quantum computing and our implementation in a scalable
architecture highlights the model as a practical short-term goal.
