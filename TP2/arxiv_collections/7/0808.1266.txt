We report a search for the standard model Higgs boson in the missing energy
and acoplanar b-jet topology, using an integrated luminosity of 0.93 inverse
femtobarn recorded by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The
analysis includes signal contributions from pp->ZH->nu nu b b, as well as from
WH production in which the charged lepton from the W boson decay is undetected.
Neural networks are used to separate signal from background. In the absence of
a signal, we set limits on the cross section of pp->VH times the branching
ratio of H->bb at the 95% C.L. of 2.6 - 2.3 pb, for Higgs boson masses in the
range 105 - 135 GeV, where V=W,Z. The corresponding expected limits range from
2.8 pb - 2.0 pb.
