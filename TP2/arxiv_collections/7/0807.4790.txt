Suppose G is a semi-direct product of the form Z/p^n \rtimes Z/m where p is
prime and m is relatively prime to p. Suppose K is a local field of
characteristic p > 0. The main result states necessary and sufficient
conditions on the ramification filtrations that occur for wildly ramified
G-Galois extensions of K. In addition, we prove that there exists a parameter
space for G-Galois extensions of K with given ramification filtration whose
dimension depends only on the ramification filtration. We provide explicit
equations for wild cyclic extensions of K of degree p^3.
