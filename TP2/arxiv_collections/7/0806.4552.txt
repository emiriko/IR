We discuss the possibility of existence of entanglement in biological
systems. Our arguments centre on the fact that biological systems are
thermodynamic open driven systems far from equilibrium. In such systems error
correction can occur which may maintain entanglement despite high levels of
de-coherence. We also discuss the possibility of cooling (classical or quantum)
at molecular level.
