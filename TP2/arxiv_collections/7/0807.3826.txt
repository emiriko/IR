We discuss the effect of infrared soft gluons on the asymptotic behaviour of
the total cross-section. We use a singular but integrable expression for the
strong coupling constant in the infrared limit and relate its behaviour to the
satisfaction of the Froissart bound, giving a specific phenomenological
example.
