The solvation force for the 2D Ising strip is calculated via exact
diagonalization of the transfer matrix in two cases: the symmetric case
corresponds to identical surface fields, and the antisymmetric case to exactly
opposite surface fields. In the symmetric case the solvation force is always
negative (attractive) while in the antisymmetric case the solvation force is
positive (repulsive) at high temperatures and negative at low temperatures. It
changes sign close to the critical wetting temperature characterizing the
semi--infinite system. The properties of the solvation force are discussed and
the scaling function describing its dependence on temperature, surface field,
and strip's width is proposed.
