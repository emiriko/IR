We summarise the perspectives on heavy-quarkonium production at the LHC, both
for proton-proton and heavy-ion runs, as emanating from the round table held at
the HLPW 2008 Conference. The main topics are: present experimental and
theoretical knowledge, experimental capabilities, open questions, recent
theoretical advances and potentialities linked to some new observables.
