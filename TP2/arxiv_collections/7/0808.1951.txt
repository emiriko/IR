The first-principles full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method
based on density functional theory is used to investigate electronic structure
and magnetic properties of hypothetical binary compounds of I$^{A}$ subgroup
elements with nitrogen (LiN, NaN, KN and RbN) in assumed three types of
cristalline structure (rock salt, wurtzite and zinc-blende). We find that, due
to the spin polarized \textit{p} orbitas of N, all four compounds are
half-metallic ferromagnets with wide energy bandgaps (up to 2.0 eV). The
calculated total magnetic moment in all investigated compounds for all three
types of crystal structure is exactly 2.00 $\mu_{\text{B}}$ per formula unit.
The predicted half-metallicity is robust with respect to lattice-constant
contraction. In all the cases ferromagnetic phase is energetically favored with
respect to the paramagnetic one. The mechanism leading to half-metallic
ferromagnetism and synthesis possibilities are discussed.
