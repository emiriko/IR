The logarithmic-normal (lognormal) distribution is one of the most frequently
observed distributions in nature and describes a large number of physical,
biological and even sociological phenomena. The origin of this distribution is
therefore of broad interest but a general derivation from basic principles is
still lacking. Using random nucleation and growth to describe crystallization
processes we derive the time development of grain size distributions. Our
derivation provides, for the first time, an analytical expression of the size
distribution in the form of a lognormal type distribution. We apply our results
to the grain size distribution of solid phase crystallized Si-films.
