Wigner symmetry in Nuclear Physics provides a unique example of a
non-perturbative long distance symmetry, a symmetry strongly broken at short
distances. We analyse the consequences of such a concept within the framework
of One Boson Exchange Potentials in NN scattering and keeping the leading Nc
contributions. Phenomenologically successful relations between singlet 1S0 and
triplet 3S1 scattering phase shifts are provided in the entire elastic region.
We establish symmetry breaking relations among non-central phase shifts which
are successfully fulfilled by even-L partial waves and strongly violated by
odd-L partial waves, in full agreement with large Nc requirements.
