The Dirac spectrum of QCD with dynamical fermions at nonzero chemical
potential is characterized by three regions, a region with a constant
eigenvalue density, a region where the eigenvalue density shows oscillations
that grow exponentially with the volume and the remainder of the complex plane
where the eigenvalue density is zero. In this paper we derive the phase diagram
of the Dirac spectrum from a chiral Lagrangian. We show that the constant
eigenvalue density corresponds to a pion condensed phase while the strongly
oscillating region is given by a kaon condensed phase. The normal phase with
nonzero chiral condensate but vanishing Bose condensates coincides with the
region of the complex plane where there are no eigenvalues.
