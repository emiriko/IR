An analytic model a la Middleton of the impulsive noise component in the data
of interferometric gravitational wave detectors is proposed, based on an atomic
representation of glitches. A fully analytic characterization of the coherent
network data analysis algorithm proposed by Rakhmanov and Klimenko is obtained,
for the simplest relevant case of triggered detection of unmodeled
gravitational wave bursts, using the above noise model. The detector's
performance is evaluated under a suitable central-limit hypothesis, and the
effects of both the noisiness of the pseudo-templates, and the presence of the
impulsive noise component are highlighted.
