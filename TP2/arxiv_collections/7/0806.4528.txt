We study the the transport properties of multiterminal ballistic graphene
samples, concentrating on the conductance matrix, fluctuations and
cross-correlations. Far away from Dirac point, the current is carried mostly by
propagating modes and the results can be explained with the conventional
semiclassical picture familiar from ray optics, where electrons propagate along
a single direction before scattering or reaching the terminals. However, close
to the Dirac point the transport is due to evanescent modes which do not have
to follow a rectilinear path. As we show in this Letter, this property of the
evanescent modes influences the conductance matrix. However, at best it can be
observed by measuring the cross correlations in an exchange Hanbury Brown-Twiss
experiment.
