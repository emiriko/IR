We study possible crossing of the phantom divide line in a DGP-inspired
$F(R,\phi)$ braneworld scenario where scalar field and curvature quintessence
are treated in a unified framework. With some specific form of $F(R,\phi)$ and
by adopting a suitable ansatz, we show that there are appropriate regions of
the parameters space which account for late-time acceleration and admit
crossing of the phantom divide line.
