Based on quantum electrodynamics, we reexamine the two-photon decay of
one-electron atoms. Special attention is paid to the calculation of the
(two-photon) total decay rates which can be viewed as the imaginary part of the
two-loop self-energy. We argue that our approach can easily be applied to the
cases with a virtual state having an intermediate energy between the initial
and the final state of the decay process leading, thus, to the resonance peaks
in the two-photon energy distribution. In order to illustrate our approach, we
obtain fully relativistic results, resolved into electric and magnetic
multipole components, for the two-photon decay rates of the 3S_{1/2} ->
1S_{1/2} transition in neutral hydrogen as well as in various hydrogen-like
ions.
