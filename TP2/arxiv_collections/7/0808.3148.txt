We develop a theory of photo-induced drift of chiral molecules or small
particles in classical buffer gases. In the absence of a magnetic field there
exists a flux of chiral molecules, provided the electromagnetic field is
circularly polarized. It has opposite signs for different chiral isomers. In
the presence of a magnetic field the flux can be also induced by a linearly
polarized (or unpolarized) electromagnetic field. The magnitude of the flux is
not proportional to either linear or orbital momentum of the electromagnetic
field.
