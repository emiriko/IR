We present an experimental comparison and a theoretical analysis of the
signal-to-noise ratios in fluorescence and extinction spectroscopy of a single
emitter. We show that extinction measurements can be advantageous if the
emitter is weakly excited. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of this method
for the detection and spectroscopy of weakly emitting systems such as rare
earth ions.
