We provide a simple description of the most general collective Gaussian
attack in continuous-variable quantum cryptography. In the scenario of such
general attacks, we analyze the asymptotic secret-key rates which are
achievable with coherent states, joint measurements of the quadratures and
one-way classical communication.
