We demonstrate that the phase transition from columnar-hexagonal liquid
crystal to hexagonal-crystalline solid falls into an unusual universality
class, which in three-dimensional allows for both discontinuous transitions as
well as continuous transitions, characterized by a single set of exponents. We
show by a renormalization group calculation (to first order in $\epsilon =
4-d$) that the critical exponents of the continuous transition are precisely
those of the XY model, which gives rise to a continuous evolution of elastic
moduli. Although the fixed points of the present model are found to be
identical to the XY model, the elastic compliance to deformations in the plane
of hexagonal order, $\mu$, is nonetheless shown to critically influence the
crystallization transition, with the continuous transition being driven to
first order by fluctuations as the in plane response grows weaker, $\mu \to 0$.
