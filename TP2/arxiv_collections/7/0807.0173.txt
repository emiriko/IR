A new, preliminary global analysis of the experimental data on azimuthal
asymmetries in SIDIS from HERMES and COMPASS collaborations, and in e+e- -->
h_1 h_2 X processes from the BELLE collaboration, is performed. The new data
allow for a more precise determination of the Collins fragmentation function
and of the transversity distribution function for $u$ and $d$ quarks, in
comparison with the results of our previous analysis. Estimates for the single
spin asymmetry A_UT^{\sin(\phi_h + \phi_S)} at JLab and COMPASS, operating on a
transversely polarized proton target, are presented.
