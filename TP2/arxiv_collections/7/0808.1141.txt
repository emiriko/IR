Given an inclusion $B \subset F$ of (graded) local nets, we analyse the
structure of the corresponding inclusion of scaling limit nets $B_0 \subset
F_0$, giving conditions, fulfilled in free field theory, under which the
unicity of the scaling limit of $F$ implies that of the scaling limit of $B$.
As a byproduct, we compute explicitly the (unique) scaling limit of the
fixpoint nets of scalar free field theories. In the particular case of an
inclusion $A \subset B$ of local nets with the same canonical field net $F$, we
find sufficient conditions which entail the equality of the canonical field
nets of $A_0$ and $B_0$.
