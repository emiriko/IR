We gain further insight into the use of the Schwarzian derivative to obtain
new results for a family of functional differential equations including the
famous Wright's equation and the Mackey-Glass type delay differential
equations. We present some dichotomy results, which allow us to get easily
computable bounds of the global attractor. We also discuss related conjectures,
and formulate new open problems.
