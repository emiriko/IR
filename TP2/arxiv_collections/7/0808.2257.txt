A dynamical coupled-channels formalism is used to investigate the
$\eta-$meson production mechanism on the proton induced by pions, in the total
center-of-mass energy region from threshold up to 2 GeV. We show how and why
studying exclusively total cross section data might turn out to be misleading
in pinning down the reaction mechanism.
