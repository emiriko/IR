The entanglement in one-dimensional random XY spin systems where the
impurities of exchange couplings and the external magnetic fields are
considered as random variables is investigated by solving the different
spin-spin correlation functions and the average magnetization per spin. The
entanglement dynamics near particular locations of the system is also studied
when the exchange couplings (or the external magnetic fields) satisfy three
different distributions(the Gaussian distribution, double-Gaussian
distribution, and bimodal distribution). We find that the entanglement can be
controlled by varying the strength of external magnetic field and the different
distributions of impurities. Moreover, the entanglement of some
nearest-neighboring qubits can be increased for certain parameter values of the
three different distributions.
