Thin films based on Layer-by-Layer (LbL) self assembled technique are useful
for immobilization of DNA onto solid support. This communication reports the
immobilization of DNA onto a solid support by electrostatic interaction with a
polycation Poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). UV-Vis absorption and steady
state fluorescence spectroscopic studies exhibit the characteristics of DNA
organized in LbL films. The most significant observation is that single strand
DNA are immobilized on the PAH backbone of LbL films when the films are
fabricated above the melting temperature of DNA. DNA immobilized in this way on
LbL films remains as such when the temperature is restored at room temperature
and the organization remains unaffected even after several days. UV-Vis
absorption spectroscopic studies confirm this finding.
