Hawking radiation from Unruh's and Canonical acoustic black hole is
considered from viewpoint of anomaly cancellation method developed by Robinson
and Wilczek. Thus, the physics near the horizon can be described using an
infinite collection of massless two-dimensional scalar fields in the background
of a dilaton and the gravitational anomaly is canceled by the flux of a 1 + 1
dimensional blackbody at the Hawking temperature of the space-time.
Consequently, by this method, we can get the Hawking's temperature for
Canonical and Unruh's acoustic black hole.
