We discuss various superfluid properties of a two-component Fermi system in
the presence of a tight one-dimensional periodic potential in a
three-dimensional system. We use a zero temperature mean field theory and
derive analytical expressions for the Josephson current, the sound velocity and
the center of mass oscillations in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation crossover
region.
