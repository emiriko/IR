Focusing on the numerical aspects and accuracy we study a class of bulk
viscosity driven expansion scenarios using the relativistic Navier-Stokes and
truncated Israel-Stewart form of the equations of relativistic dissipative
fluids in 1+1 dimensions. The numerical calculations of conservation and
transport equations are performed using the numerical framework of flux
corrected transport. We show that the results of the Israel-Stewart causal
fluid dynamics are numerically much more stable and smoother than the results
of the standard relativistic Navier-Stokes equations.
