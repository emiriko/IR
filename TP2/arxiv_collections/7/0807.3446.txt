The analysis of $W$ production and the search for anomalous single top
production is performed with the H1 detector at HERA with an integrated
luminosity of 0.5 fb$^{-1}$, consisting of the complete high energy data from
the HERA programme. Production cross section measurements of single $W$
production, as well as $W$ polarisation fractions in events containing isolated
leptons and missing transverse momentum are also presented. In the context of a
search for single top production an upper limit on the top production cross
section $\sigma_{ep\to etX} < 0.16$ pb is established at the 95% confidence
level, corresponding to an upper bound on the anomalous magnetic coupling
$\kappa_{tu\gamma} < 0.14$.
