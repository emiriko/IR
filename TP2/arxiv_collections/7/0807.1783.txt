Inspired by the geometry and shape of the classical radio-frequency radiator,
the Hertzian dipole, here we analyze the design of a plasmonic optical dimer
nanoantenna. We show how it may be possible to operate a pair of closely spaced
spherical nanoparticles as an efficient optical nanoradiator, and how its
tuning and matching properties may be tailored with great degree of freedom by
designing suitable nanoloads placed at the dimer's gap. In this sense, we
successfully apply nanocircuit concepts to model the loading nanoparticles.
High levels of optical radiation efficiency are achieved, even considering the
realistic absorption of optical metals, thanks to this specific geometry and
design.
