A combination of recent numerical and theoretical advances are applied to
analyze the scaling behaviour of the site-diluted Ising model in two
dimensions, paying special attention to the implications for multiplicative
logarithmic corrections. The analysis focuses primarily on the odd sector of
the model (i.e., that associated with magnetic exponents), and in particular on
its Lee-Yang zeros, which are determined to high accuracy. Scaling relations
are used to connect to the even (thermal) sector, and a first analysis of the
density of zeros yields information on the specific heat and its corrections.
The analysis is fully supportive of the strong scaling hypothesis and of the
scaling relations for logarithmic corrections.
