In this paper \emph{analytic equivalence} of geometric transition is defined
in such a way that equivalence classes of geometric transitions turn out to be
the \emph{arrows} of the \cy web. Then it seems natural and useful, both from
the mathematical and physical point of view, look for privileged arrows'
representatives, called \emph{canonical models}, laying the foundations of an
\emph{analytic} classification of geometric transitions. At this purpose a
numerical invariant, called \emph{bi--degree}, summarizing the topological,
geometric and physical changing properties of a geometric transition, is
defined for a large class of geometric transitions.
