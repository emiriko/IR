Pomeron is modeled as a system of two interacting by the Cornell potential
massive gluons. In bound state region, a relativistic wave equation for the
potential is analized. Two exact asymptotic solutions of the equation are used
to derive an interpolating mass formula for gluonium states and the Pomeron
trajectory in the whole region. The trajectory obtained is linear at large
timelike $t$ and flattens off at -1 in the scattering region at large $-t$.
Parameters of the trajectory are found from the fit of recent HERA data for
$\alpha_P(t)$.
