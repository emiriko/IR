Locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi Type I cosmological models are
examined in the presence of dynamically anisotropic dark energy and perfect
fluid. We assume that the dark energy (DE) is minimally interacting, has
dynamical energy density, anisotropic equation of state parameter (EoS). The
conservation of the energy-momentum tensor of the DE is assumed to consist of
two separately additive conserved parts. A special law is assumed for the
deviation from isotropic EoS, which is consistent with the assumption on the
conservation of the energy-momentum tensor of the DE. Exact solutions of
Einstein's field equations are obtained by assuming a special law of variation
for the mean Hubble parameter, which yields a constant value of the
deceleration parameter. Geometrical and kinematic properties of the models and
the behaviour of the anisotropy of the dark energy has been carried out. The
models give dynamically anisotropic expansion history for the universe that
allows to fine tune the isotropization of the Bianchi metric, hence the CMB
anisotropy.
