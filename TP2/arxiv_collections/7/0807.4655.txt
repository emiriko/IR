We give a new proof that any candy-passing game on a graph G with at least
4|E(G)|-|V(G)| candies stabilizes. (This result was first proven in
arXiv:0807.4450.) Unlike the prior literature on candy-passing games, we use
methods from the general theory of chip-firing games which allow us to obtain a
polynomial bound on the number of rounds before stabilization.
