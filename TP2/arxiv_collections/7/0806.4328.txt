CaFe$_2$As$_2$ has been synthesized and found to form in the tetragonal,
ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure with lattice parameters $a = 3.912(68) \AA$ and $c =
11.667(45) \AA$. Upon cooling through 170 K, CaFe$_2$As$_2$ undergoes a first
order, structural phase transition to a low temperature, orthorhombic phase
with a $2 - 3$ K range of hysteresis and coexistence. This transition is
clearly evident in microscopic, thermodynamic and transport measurements.
CaFe$_2$As$_2$ is the third member of the AFe$_2$As$_2$ (A = Ba, Sr, Ca) family
to exhibit such a dramatic phase transition and is a promising candidate for
studies of doping induced superconductivity.
