Quantum protocols will be more efficient with high-dimensional entangled
states. Photons carrying orbital angular momenta can be used to create a
high-dimensional entangled state. In this paper we experimentally demonstrate
the entanglement of the orbital angular momentum between the Stokes and
anti-Stokes photons generated in a hot atomic ensemble using spontaneous
four-wave-mixing. This experiment also suggests the existence of the
entanglement concerned with spatial degrees of freedom between the hot atomic
ensemble and the Stokes photon.
