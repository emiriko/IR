For a finite triangulation of the plane with faces properly coloured white
and black, let A be the abelian group constructed by labelling the vertices
with commuting indeterminates and adding relations which say that the labels
around each white triangle add to the identity. We show that A has free rank
exactly two. Let A* be the torsion subgroup of A, and B* the corresponding
group for the black triangles. We show that A* and B* have the same order, and
conjecture that they are isomorphic.
  For each spherical latin trade W, we show there is a unique disjoint mate B
such that (W,B) is a connected and separated bitrade. The bitrade (W,B) is
associated with a two-colourable planar triangulation and we show that W can be
embedded in A*, thereby proving a conjecture due to Cavenagh and Drapal. The
proof involves constructing a (0,1) presentation matrix whose permanent and
determinant agree up to sign. The Smith Normal Form of this matrix determines
A*, so there is an efficient algorithm to construct the embedding. Contrasting
with the spherical case, for each genus g>0 we construct a latin trade which is
not embeddable in any group and another that is embeddable in a cyclic group.
  We construct a sequence of spherical latin trades which cannot be embedded in
any family of abelian groups whose torsion ranks are bounded. Also, we show
that any trade that can be embedded in a finitely generated abelian group can
be embedded in a finite abelian group. As a corollary, no trade can be embedded
in a free abelian group.
