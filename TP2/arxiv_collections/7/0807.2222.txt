We analyze aspects of the holographic principle relevant to the quantum
gravity partition functions in Euclidean sector of AdS$_3$. The sum of the
known contributions to the partitions functions can be presented exactly,
including corrections, in the form where the Patterson-Selberg zeta function
involves.
