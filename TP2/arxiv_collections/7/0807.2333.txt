This paper investigates the possible use of the Hyperspherical Adiabatic
basis in the description of scattering states of a three-body system. In
particular, we analyze a 1+2 collision process below the three-body breakup.
The convergence patterns for the observables of interest are analyzed by
comparison to a unitary equivalent Hyperspherical Harmonic expansion.
Furthermore, we compare and discuss two different possible choices for
describing the asymptotic configurations of the system, related to the use of
Jacobi or hyperspherical coordinates. In order to illustrate the difficulties
and advantages of the approach two simple numerical applications are shown in
the case of neutron-deuteron scattering at low energies using s-wave
interactions. We found that the optimization driven by the Hyperspherical
Adiabatic basis is not as efficient for scattering states as in bound state
applications.
