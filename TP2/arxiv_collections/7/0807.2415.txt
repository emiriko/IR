We present a control method based on two steps: prediction and prevention.
For prediction we use the anticipated synchronization scheme, considering
unidirectional coupling between excitable systems in a master-slave
configuration. The master is the perturbed system to be controlled, meanwhile
the slave is an auxiliary system which is used to predict the master's
behavior. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that an efficient
control may be achieved.
