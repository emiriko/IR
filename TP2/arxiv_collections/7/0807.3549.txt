We show that the recent multiple teleportation protocol (MTP) presented in
Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 110503 (2008)] is not restricted to the
Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) scheme. Rather, we show that MTP is quite general
and can be implemented using whatever teleportation scheme at hand. We also
present two new MTP's which are more efficient than the original proposal,
requiring just half the number of teleportations of the original scheme to
achieve at least the same probability of success. One of the protocols,
however, employs less entanglement than all the previous ones yielding,
surprisingly, the greatest probability of success.
