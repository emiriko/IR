Within the framework of quantum memory channels we introduce the notion of
repeatability of quantum channels. In particular, a quantum channel is called
repeatable if there exist a memory device implementing the same channel on each
individual input. We show that random unitary channels can be implemented in a
repeatable fashion, whereas the nonunital channels cannot.
