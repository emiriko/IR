The resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations as usually defined in the
quasineutral approximation refer to a system of 14 scalar equations in 14
scalar variables, hence are determined to be complete and soluble. These
equations are a combination of Navier-Stokes and a subset of Maxwell's.
However, one of the vector equations is actually an identity when viewed from
the potential formulation of electrodynamics, hence does not determine any
degrees of freedom. Only by reinstating Gauss's law does the system of
equations become closed, allowing for the determination of both the current and
mass flow velocity from the equations of motion. Results of a typical analysis
of the proposed electromagnetic hydrodynamic model including the magnetization
force are presented.
