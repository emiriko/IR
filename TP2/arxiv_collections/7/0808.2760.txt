The cytoskeleton is essential for the maintenance of cell morphology in
eukaryotes. In fission yeast for example, polarized growth sites are organized
by actin whereas microtubules (MT) acting upstream control where growth occurs
(La Carbona et al, 2006). Growth is limited to the cell poles when MTs undergo
catastrophes there and not elsewhere on the cortex (Brunner and Nurse, 2000).
Here we report that the modulation of MT dynamics by forces as observed in
vitro (Dogterom and Yurke, 1997; Janson et al, 2003) can quantitatively explain
the localization of MT catastro-phes in S. pombe. However, we found that it is
necessary to add length-dependent catastrophe rates to make the model fully
consistent with other measured traits of MTs. This result demonstrates the
possibility that MTs together with associated proteins such as kinesins having
a depolymerization activity can reliably mark the tips of the cell.
