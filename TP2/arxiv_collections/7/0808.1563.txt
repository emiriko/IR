Power spectral density measurements of any sampled signal are typically
restricted by both acquisition rate and frequency response limitations of
instruments, which can be particularly prohibitive for video-based
measurements. We have developed a new method called Intensity Modulation
Spectral Analysis (IMSA) that circumvents these limitations, dramatically
extending the effective detection bandwidth. We demonstrate this by
video-tracking an optically-trapped microsphere while oscillating an LED
illumination source. This approach allows us to quantify fluctuations of the
microsphere at frequencies over 10 times higher than the Nyquist frequency,
mimicking a significantly higher frame rate.
