In this paper, we formulate and solve a guaranteed cost control problem for a
class of uncertain linear stochastic quantum systems. For these quantum
systems, a connection with an associated classical (non-quantum) system is
first established. Using this connection, the desired guaranteed cost results
are established. The theory presented is illustrated using an example from
quantum optics.
