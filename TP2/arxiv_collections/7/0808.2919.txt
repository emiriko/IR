I examine some properties of the overlap operator in the Schroedinger
functional formulated by Luescher at perturbative level. By investigating
spectra of the free operator and one-loop coefficient of the Schroedinger
functional coupling, I confirm the universality at tree and one-loop level.
Furthermore, I address cutoff effects of the step scaling function and it turns
out that the lattice artifacts for the overlap operator are comparable with
those of the clover actions.
