In this paper we propose a dynamical interpretation of the sociological
distinction between large and small groups of interacting individuals. In the
former case individual behaviors are largely dominated by the group effect,
while in the latter mutual relationships do matter. Numerical and analytical
tools are combined to substantiate our claims.
