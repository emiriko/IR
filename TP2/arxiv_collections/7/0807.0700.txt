We describe the structural relations between nested harmonic sums emerging in
the description of physical single scale quantities up to the 3--loop level in
renormalizable gauge field theories. These are weight {\sf w=6} harmonic sums.
We identify universal basic functions which allow to describe a large class of
physical quantities and derive their complex analysis. For the 3--loop QCD
Wilson coefficients 35 basic functions are required, whereas a subset of 15
describes the 3--loop anomalous dimensions.
