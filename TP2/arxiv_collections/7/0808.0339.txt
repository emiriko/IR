In this paper, a 3D discrete model is presented to model the movements of the
trunk during breathing. In this model, objects are represented by physical
particles on their contours. A simple notion of force generated by a linear
actuator allows the model to create forces on each particle by way of a
geometrical attractor. Tissue elasticity and contractility are modeled by local
shape memory and muscular fibers attractors. A specific dynamic MRI study was
used to build a simple trunk model comprised of by three compartments: lungs,
diaphragm and abdomen. This model was registered on the real geometry.
Simulation results were compared qualitatively as well as quantitatively to the
experimental data, in terms of volume and geometry. A good correlation was
obtained between the model and the real data. Thanks to this model, pathology
such as hemidiaphragm paralysis can also be simulated.
