We studied a doping series of (110)-oriented AlAs quantum wells (QWs) and
observed transport evidence of single anisotropic-mass valley occupancy for the
electrons in a 150 \AA wide QW. Our calculations of strain and quantum
confinement for these samples predict single anisotropic-mass valley occupancy
for well widths $W$ greater than 53 \AA. Below this, double-valley occupation
is predicted such that the longitudinal mass axes are collinear. We observed
mobility anisotropy in the electronic transport along the crystallographic
directions in the ratio of 2.8, attributed to the mass anisotropy as well as
anisotropic scattering of the electrons in the X-valley of AlAs.
