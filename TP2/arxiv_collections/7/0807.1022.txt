The coupling of phonons with collective modes and single-particle gap
excitations associated with one (1d) and two-directional (2d)
electronically-driven charge-density wave (CDW) ordering in metallic RTe_3 is
investigated as a function of rare-earth ion chemical pressure (R=Tb, Dy, Ho)
using femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. From the T-dependence of the CDW gap
\Delta_{CDW} and the amplitude mode (AM) we find that while the transition to a
1d-CDW ordered state at T_{c1} initially proceeds in an exemplary mean-field
(MF) -like fashion, below T_{c1}, \Delta_{CDW} is depressed and departs from
the MF behavior. The effect is apparently triggered by resonant mode-mixing of
the amplitude mode (AM) with a totally symmetric phonon at 1.75 THz. At low
temperatures, when the state evolves into a 2d-CDW ordered state at T_{c2} in
the DyTe_3 and HoTe_3, additional much weaker mode mixing is evident but no
soft mode is observed.
