We will discuss how stability and speed of normal zone propagation in
YBCO-coated conductors is affected by interfacial resistance between the
superconducting film and the stabilizer. Our numerical simulation has shown
that the increased interfacial resistance substantially increases speed of
normal zone propagation and decreases the stability margins. Optimization of
the value of the resistance may lead to a better compromise between stability
and quench protection requirements than what is found in currently manufactured
coated conductors.
