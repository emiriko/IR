Although electrons and photons are intrinsically different, importing useful
concepts in optics to electronics performing similar functions has been
actively pursued over the last two decades. In particular, collimation of an
electron beam is a long-standing goal. We show that ballistic propagation of an
electron beam with virtual no spatial spreading or diffraction, without a
waveguide or external magnetic field, can be achieved in graphene under an
appropriate class of experimentally feasible one-dimensional external periodic
potentials. The novel chiral quasi-one-dimensional metallic state that the
charge carriers are in originates from a collapse of the intrinsic helical
nature of the charge carriers in graphene owing to the superlattice potential.
Beyond providing a new way to constructing chiral one-dimensional states in two
dimensions, our findings should be useful in graphene-based electronic devices
(e.g., for information processing) utilizing some of the highly developed
concepts in optics.
