A scheme for fast, compact, and controllable acceleration of heavy particles
in vacuum has been recently proposed [F. Peano et al., New J. Phys. 10 033028
(2008)], wherein two counterpropagating laser beams with variable frequencies
drive a beat-wave structure with variable phase velocity, leading to particle
trapping and acceleration. The technique allows for fine control over the
energy distribution and the total charge of the accelerated beam, to be
obtained via tuning of the frequency variation. Here, the theoretical bases of
the acceleration scheme are described, and the possibility of applications to
ultrafast muon acceleration and to the prompt extraction of cold-muon beams is
discussed.
