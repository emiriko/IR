We give an explicit description of L-packets and quadratic base change for
depth-zero representations of ramified unitary groups in two and three
variables. We show that this base change lifting is compatible with a certain
lifting of families of representations of finite groups. We conjecture that
such a compatibility is valid in much greater generality.
