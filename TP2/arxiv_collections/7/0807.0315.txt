The Schwarzschild metric has a divergent energy density at the horizon, which
motivates a new approach to black holes. If matter is spread uniformly
throughout the interior of a supermassive black hole, with mass $M\sim M_\star=
2.34 10^8M_\odot$, it may arise from a Bose-Einstein condensate of densely
packed H-atoms. Within the Relativistic Theory of Gravitation with a positive
cosmological constant, a bosonic quantum field is coupled to the curvature
scalar. In the Bose-Einstein condensed groundstate an exact, selfconsistent
solution for the metric is presented. It is regular with a specific shape at
the origin. The redshift at the horizon is finite but large, $z\sim
10^{14}$$M_\star/M$. The binding energy remains as an additional parameter to
characterize the BH; alternatively, the mass observed at infinity can be any
fraction of the rest mass of its constituents.
