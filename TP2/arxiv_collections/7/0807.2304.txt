The Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solved exactly for some well known
potentials. Solutions are obtained reducing the Schr\"{o}dinger equation into a
second order differential equation by using an appropriate coordinate
transformation. The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is used in the calculations to get
energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions.
