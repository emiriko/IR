Rotating-wave approximation and its validity in multi-state quantum systems
are studied through analytic approach. Their applicability is also verified
from the viewpoint of generic states by the use of direct numerical
integrations of the Schroedinger equation. First, we introduce an extension of
the rotating-wave approximation for multi-state systems. Under an assumption
that a smooth transition is induced by the optimal field, we obtain three types
of analytic control fields and demonstrate their validity and deficiency for
generic systems represented by random matrices. Through the comparison, we
conclude that the analytic field based on our coarse-grained approach
outperforms the other ones for generic quantum systems with a large number of
states. Finally, the further extension of the analytic field is introduced for
realistic chaotic systems and its validity is shown in banded random matrix
systems.
