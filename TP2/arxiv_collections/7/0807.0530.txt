The characteristic properties of two-phase Ar avalanche detectors, including
those obtained with CsI photocathode, are further studied. Such detectors are
relevant in the field of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark matter
search experiments. The detectors investigated comprised a 1 cm thick liquid Ar
layer followed by a triple-GEM multiplier. In these detectors, typical gains
reaching 10000 were obtained with good reproducibility and a stable operation
for at least one day was demonstrated. Amplitude and pulse-shape
characteristics are presented under irradiation with X-rays, gamma-rays and
neutrons from different radioactive sources. The detection of both primary
scintillation and ionization signals at higher gains, at a deposited energy of
60 keV, has been demonstrated.
