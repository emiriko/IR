The quantum phase transition of the system of N radiators in case of
two-photon exchange interaction with cavity electromagnetic field is
considered. It is shown that for this system the atom-field exchange integral
increases with the increase of temperature. This effect generates peculiarities
in phase transition picture. The process of nonlinear exchange between the
quasi-spins leads to the increase of critical temperature as compared to
traditional second order phase transition of quasi-spin system.
