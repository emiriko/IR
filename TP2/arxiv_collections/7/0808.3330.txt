We construct an associative algebra with a decomposition into the direct sum
of the underlying vector spaces of another associative algebra and its dual
space such that both of them are subalgebras and the natural symmetric bilinear
form is invariant or the natural antisymmetric bilinear form is a Connes
cocycle. The former is called a double construction of Frobenius algebra and
the latter is called a double construction of Connes cocycle which is
interpreted in terms of dendriform algebras. Both of them are equivalent to a
kind of bialgebras, namely, antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and
dendriform D-bialgebras respectively. In the coboundary cases, our study leads
to what we call associative Yang-Baxter equation in an associative algebra and
$D$-equation in a dendriform algebra respectively, which are analogues of the
classical Yang-Baxter equation in a Lie algebra. We show that an antisymmetric
solution of associative Yang-Baxter equation corresponds to the antisymmetric
part of a certain operator called ${\mathcal O}$-operator which gives a double
construction of Frobenius algebra, whereas a symmetric solution of $D$-equation
corresponds to the symmetric part of an ${\mathcal O}$-operator which gives a
double construction of Connes cocycle. By comparing antisymmetric infinitesimal
bialgebras and dendriform D-bialgebras, we observe that there is a clear
analogy between them. Due to the correspondences between certain symmetries and
antisymmetries appearing in the analogy, we regard it as a kind of duality.
