Given a minimal surface equipped with a generically finite map to an Abelian
variety, we give an optimal bound on the canonical degree of a rational or an
elliptic curve. As a corollary, we obtain the finiteness of rational and
elliptic curves on any surface of general type with two linearly independent
regular one forms.
