The protein dynamical transition is investigated as a function of protein
structure using terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). Measurements
performed for native state and denatured hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) show
that protein structure is not necessary for the dynamical transition. We find
the temperature dependence follows activated behavior and there is no evidence
of a fragile to strong transition. Measurements of short chain poly alanine
show a dynamical transition down to penta-alanine, however no transition is
observed for di-alanine or tri-alanine. These measurements demonstrate that the
temperature dependence arises strictly from the interaction of the side chains
with the solvent. The lack of a transition for shorter chain polypeptides may
indicate the temperature dependence arises from a net ordering of the adjacent
water which scales with the length of the polypeptide chain.
