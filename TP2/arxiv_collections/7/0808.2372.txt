Theory of dilution effect in orbital ordered system is presented. The $e_g$
orbital model without spin degree of freedom and the spin-orbital coupled model
in a three-dimensional simple-cubic lattice are analyzed by the Monte-Carlo
simulation and the cluster expansion method. In the $e_g$ orbital model without
spin degree of freedom, reduction of the orbital ordering temperature due to
dilution is steeper than that in the dilute magnet. This is attributed to a
modification of the orbital wave-function around vacant sites. In the
spin-orbital coupled model, it is found that magnetic structure is changed from
the A-type antiferromagnetic order into the ferromagnetic one. Orbital
dependent exchange interaction and a sign change of this interaction around
vacant sites bring about this novel phenomena. Present results explain the
recent experiments in transition-metal compounds with orbital dilution.
