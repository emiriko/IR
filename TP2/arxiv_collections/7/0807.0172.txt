We study the effect of b to s sbar s scalar/pseudoscalar operators,
originating from penguin diagrams of neutral Higgs bosons in the MSSM, in B to
K eta(') and B to phi K^* decays. These operators can be Fierz-transformed into
tensor operators, and the resultant tensor operators could affect the
transverse polarization amplitudes in B to phi K^* decays. We find that only
when the weak annihilations in B to phi K^* into account, the polarization
puzzle can be resolved, so that new physics effects are strongly suppressed and
no more relevant to the enhancement of the transverse modes in B to phi K^*
decays.
