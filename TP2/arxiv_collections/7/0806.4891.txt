Despite the progress achieved by kinetic theory, the search of possible exact
kinetic equations remains elusive to date. This concerns, specifically, the
issue of the validity of the conjecture proposed by Grad (Grad, 1972) and
developed in a seminal work by Lanford (Lanford, 1974) that kinetic equations -
such as the Boltzmann equation for a gas of classical hard spheres - might
result exact in an appropriate asymptotic limit, usually denoted as
Boltzmann-Grad limit. The Lanford conjecture has actually had a profound
influence on the scientific community, giving rise to a whole line of original
research in kinetic theory and mathematical physics. Nevertheless, certain
aspects of the theory remain to be addressed and clarified. The purpose of this
paper is to investigate the possible existence of the strong Boltzmann-Grad
limit for the BBGKY hierarchy. Contrary to previous approaches in which the
w*-convergence was considered for the definition of the Boltzmann-Grad limit
functions, based on their construction in terms of time-series expansions
obtained from the BBGKY hierarchy, here we look for the possible existence of
strong limit functions in the sense of local convergence in phase space. The
result is based on the adoption of the Klimontovich approach to statistical
mechanics, permitting the explicit representation of the $s$-body reduced
distribution functions in terms of the Klimontovich probability density.
