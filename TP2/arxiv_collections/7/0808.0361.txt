Straight line trajectories are commonly used in semi-classical calculations
of the first-order Coulomb excitation cross section at intermediate energies,
and simple corrections are often made for the distortion of the trajectories
that is caused by the Coulomb field. These approximations are tested by
comparing to numerical calculations that use exact Coulomb trajectories. In
this paper a model is devised for including relativistic effects in the
calculations. It converges at high energies towards the relativistic
straight-line trajectory approximation and approaches the non-relativistic
Coulomb trajectory calculation at low energies. The model is tested against a
number of measurements and analyses that have been performed at beam energies
between 30 and 70 MeV/nucleon, primarily of quadrupole excitations. Remarkably
good agreement is achieved with the previous analyses, and good agreement is
also achieved in the few cases, where the B(E$\lambda$) value is known from
other methods. The magnitudes of the relativistic and Coulomb distortion
effects are discussed.
