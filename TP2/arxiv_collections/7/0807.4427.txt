Using far field optical lithography, a single quantum dot is positioned
within a pillar microcavity with a 50 nm accuracy. The lithography is performed
in-situ at 10 K while measuring the quantum dot emission. Deterministic
spectral and spatial matching of the cavity-dot system is achieved in a single
step process and evidenced by the observation of strong Purcell effect.
Deterministic coupling of two quantum dots to the same optical mode is
achieved, a milestone for quantum computing.
