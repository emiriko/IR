The laser cooling of atoms is a result of the combined effect of doppler
shift, light shift and polarization gradient. These are basically undesirable
phenomena. However, they combine gainfully in realizing laser cooling and
trapping of the atoms. In this paper we discuss the laser cooling of atoms in
the presence of the squeezed light with the decay of atomic dipole moment into
noisy quadrature. We show that the higher decay rate of the atomic dipole
moment into the noisy quadrature, which is also an undesirable effect, may
contribute in realizing larger cooling force vis-a-vis normal laser light.
