We propose a simple and effective way to reduce the losses in left-handed
metamaterials by manipulating the values of the effective parameters R, L, and
C. We investigate the role of losses of the short-wire pairs and the fishnet
structures. Increasing the effective inductance to capacitance ratio, L/C,
reduces the losses and the figure of merit can increase substantially,
especially at THz frequencies and in the optical regime.
