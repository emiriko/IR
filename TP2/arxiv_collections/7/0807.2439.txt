The model of a universe with a preferred frame, which nevertheless shares the
main properties with traditional special and general relativity theories, is
considered. We adopt Mach's interpretation of inertia and show that the energy
balance equation, which includes the Machian energy of gravitational
interactions with the universe, can imitate standard relativistic formulas.
