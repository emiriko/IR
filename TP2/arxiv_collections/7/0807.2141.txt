We measure the mass of the top quark using top quark pair candidate events in
the lepton+jets channel from data corresponding to 1 fb-1 of integrated
luminosity collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. We
use a likelihood technique that reduces the jet energy scale uncertainty by
combining an in-situ jet energy calibration with the independent constraint on
the jet energy scale (JES) from the calibration derived using photon+jets and
dijet samples. We find the mass of the top quark to be
171.5+-1.8(stat.+JES)+-1.1(syst.) GeV.
