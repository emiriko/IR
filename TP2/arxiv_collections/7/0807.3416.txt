We demonstrate how to model the toppling activity in avalanching systems by
stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The theory is developed as a
generalization of the classical mean field approach to sandpile dynamics by
formulating it as a generalization of Itoh's SDE. This equation contains a
fractional Gaussian noise term representing the branching of an avalanche into
small active clusters, and a drift term reflecting the tendency for small
avalanches to grow and large avalanches to be constricted by the finite system
size. If one defines avalanching to take place when the toppling activity
exceeds a certain threshold the stochastic model allows us to compute the
avalanche exponents in the continum limit as functions of the Hurst exponent of
the noise. The results are found to agree well with numerical simulations in
the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld and Zhang sandpile models. The stochastic model also
provides a method for computing the probability density functions of the
fluctuations in the toppling activity itself. We show that the sandpiles do not
belong to the class of phenomena giving rise to universal non-Gaussian
probability density functions for the global activity. Moreover, we demonstrate
essential differences between the fluctuations of total kinetic energy in a
two-dimensional turbulence simulation and the toppling activity in sandpiles.
