Plasma wakefield acceleration, either laser driven or electron-bunch driven,
has been demonstrated to hold great potential. However, it is not obvious how
to scale these approaches to bring particles up to the TeV regime. In this
paper, we discuss the possibility of proton-bunch driven plasma wakefield
acceleration, and show that high energy electron beams could potentially be
produced in a single accelerating stage.
