We describe a technique to fabricate closely spaced electron-hole bilayers in
GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures. Our technique incorporates a novel method for
making shallow contacts to a low density ($<10^{11}cm^{-2}$) 2-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) that do not require annealing. Four terminal measurements
on both layers (25nm apart) are possible. Measurements show a hole mobility
$\mu_{h}>10^{5}{\rm cm}^{2}{\rm V}^{-1}{\rm s}^{-1}$ and an electron mobility
$\mu_{e}>10^{6}{\rm cm}^{2}{\rm V}^{-1}{\rm s}^{-1}$ at 1.5K. Preliminary drag
measurements made down to T=300mK indicate an enhancement of coulomb
interaction over the values obtained from a static Random Phase Approximation
(RPA) calculation.
