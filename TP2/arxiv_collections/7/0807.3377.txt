In this article, we study the geodesic problem in a generalized metric space,
in which the distance function satisfies a relaxed triangle inequality
$d(x,y)\leq \sigma (d(x,z)+d(z,y))$ for some constant $\sigma \geq 1$, rather
than the usual triangle inequality. Such a space is called a quasimetric space.
We show that many well-known results in metric spaces (e.g. Ascoli-Arzel\`{a}
theorem) still hold in quasimetric spaces. Moreover, we explore conditions
under which a quasimetric will induce an intrinsic metric. As an example, we
introduce a family of quasimetrics on the space of atomic probability measures.
The associated intrinsic metrics induced by these quasimetrics coincide with
the $d_{\alpha}$ metric studied early in the study of branching structures
arisen in ramified optimal transportation. An optimal transport path between
two atomic probability measures typically has a "tree shaped" branching
structure. Here, we show that these optimal transport paths turn out to be
geodesics in these intrinsic metric spaces.
