The reasonableness of the use of perturbative QCD notions in the region close
to the scale of hadronization, i.e., below $\lesssim 1 \GeV$ is under study.
First, the interplay between higher orders of pQCD expansion and higher twist
contributions in the analysis of recent Jefferson Lab (JLab) data on the
Generalized Bjorken Sum Rule function $\Gamma_1^{p-n} (Q^2)$ at $0.1<Q^2< 3
{\rm GeV}^2$ is studied. It is shown that the inclusion of the higher-order
pQCD corrections could be absorbed, with good numerical accuracy, by change of
the normalization of the higher-twist terms. Second, to avoid the issue of
unphysical singularity (Landau pole at $Q=\Lambda\sim 400 \MeV $), we deal with
the ghost-free Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT) that recently proved to be an
intriguing candidate for a quantitative description of light quarkonia spectra
within the Bethe-Salpeter approach. The values of the twist coefficients
$\mu_{2k} $ extracted from the mentioned data by using the APT approach provide
a better convergence of the higher-twist series than with the common pQCD. As
the main result, a good quantitative description of the JLab data down to
$Q\simeq$ 350 MeV is achieved.
