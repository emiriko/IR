A short summary of constraints on the parameter space of supersymmetric
models is given. Experimental limits from high energy colliders, electroweak
precision data, flavor and Higgs physics, and cosmology are considered. The
main focus is on the MSSM with conserved R- and CP-parity and minimal flavor
violation, but more general scenarios and extended models will also be
discussed briefly.
