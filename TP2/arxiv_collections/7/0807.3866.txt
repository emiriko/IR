The controlled fabrication of well-ordered atomic-scale metallic contacts is
of great interest: it is expected that the experimentally observed high
percentage of point contacts with a conductance at non-integer multiples of the
conductance quantum G_0 = 2e^2/h in simple metals is correlated to defects
resulting from the fabrication process. Here we demonstrate a combined
electrochemical deposition and annealing method which allows the controlled
fabrication of point contacts with pre-selectable integer quantum conductance.
The resulting conductance measurements on silver point contacts are compared
with tight-binding-like conductance calculations of modeled idealized junction
geometries between two silver crystals with a predefined number of contact
atoms.
