We consider chiral loop corrections to the scalar form factor in B_q to D_q l
nu decays. First we consider chiral corrections to the 1/m_Q suppressed
operators and then we propose the procedure for the extraction of the relevant
form factor using lattice QCD results. In the case of B_s to D_s l nu decay we
find that effects of kinematics and chiral corrections tend to cancel for the
scalar form factor contributions. In particular the 1/m_Q suppression of chiral
corrections is compensated by the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking corrections
which can be as large as 30%. The calculated corrections are relevant for the
precise determination of possible new physics effects in B_q to D_q l nu
decays.
