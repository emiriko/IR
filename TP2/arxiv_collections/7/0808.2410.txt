Gluinos and neutralinos, supersymmetric partners of gluons and neutral
electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons, are Majorana particles in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model [MSSM]. Decays of such self-conjugate particles
generate charge symmetric ensembles of final states. Moreover, production
channels of supersymmetric particles at colliders are characteristically
affected by the Majorana nature of particles exchanged in the production
processes. The sensitivity to the Majorana character of the particles can be
quantified by comparing the predictions with Dirac exchange mechanisms. A
consistent framework for introducing gluino and neutralino Dirac fields can be
designed by extending the N=1 supersymmetry of the MSSM to N=2 in the gauge
sector. We examine to which extent like-sign dilepton production in the
processes q q -> ~q ~q and e- e- -> ~e- ~e- is affected by the exchange of
either Majorana or Dirac gluinos and neutralinos, respectively, at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) and in the prospective e- e- mode of a lepton linear
collider.
