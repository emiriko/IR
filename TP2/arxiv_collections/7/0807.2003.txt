We use the hyperbolic subdiffusion equation with fractional time derivatives
(the generalized Cattaneo equation) to study the transport process of
electrolytes in media where subdiffusion occurs. In this model the flux is
delayed in a non-zero time with respect to the concentration gradient. In
particular, we obtain the formula of electrochemical subdiffusive impedance of
a spatially limited sample in the limit of large and of small pulsation of the
electric field. The boundary condition at the external wall of the sample are
taken in the general form as a linear combination of subdiffusive flux and
concentration of the transported particles. We also discuss the influence of
the equation parameters (the subdiffusion parameter and the delay time) on the
Nyquist impedance plots.
