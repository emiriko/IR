We use hydrodynamic equations to study the formation of Faraday waves in a
superfluid Fermi gas at zero temperature confined in a strongly elongated
cigar-shaped trap. First, we treat the role of the radial density profile in
the limit of an infinite cylindrical geometry and analytically evaluate the
wavelength of the Faraday pattern. The effect of the axial confinement is fully
taken into account in the numerical solution of hydrodynamic equations and
shows that the infinite cylinder geometry provides a very good description of
the phenomena.
