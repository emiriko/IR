We introduce a new type of convergence in probability theory, which we call
``mod-Gaussian convergence''. It is directly inspired by theorems and
conjectures, in random matrix theory and number theory, concerning moments of
values of characteristic polynomials or zeta functions. We study this type of
convergence in detail in the framework of infinitely divisible distributions,
and exhibit some unconditional occurrences in number theory, in particular for
families of $L$-functions over function fields in the Katz-Sarnak framework. A
similar phenomenon of ``mod-Poisson convergence'' turns out to also appear in
the classical Erd\H{o}s-K\'ac Theorem.
