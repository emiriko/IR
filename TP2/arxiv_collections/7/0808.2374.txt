We investigate the gluonic pole matrix element contributing to the first
$p_T$ moment of the distribution and fragmentation functions in a spectator
model. By performing a spectral analysis, we find that for a large class of
spectator models, the contribution of gluonic pole matrix elements is non-zero
for the distribution correlators, whereas in fragmentation correlators they
vanish. This outcome is important in the study of universality for
fragmentation functions.
