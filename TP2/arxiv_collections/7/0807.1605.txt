We present an universal treatment for a substantial nuclear suppression
representing a common feature of all known reactions on nuclear targets
(forward production of high-pT hadrons, production of direct photons, the
Drell-Yan process, heavy flavor production, etc.). Such a suppression at large
Feynman xF, corresponding to region of minimal light-cone momentum fraction
variable x2 in nuclei, is tempting to interpret as a manifestation of coherence
or the Color Glass Condensate. We demonstrate, however, that it is actually a
simple consequence of energy conservation and takes place even at low energies,
where no effects of coherence are possible. We analyze this common suppression
mechanism for several processes performing model predictions in the light-cone
dipole approach. Our calculations agree with data.
