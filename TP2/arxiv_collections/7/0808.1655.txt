The Internet is known to have had a powerful impact on on-line retailer
strategies in markets characterised by long-tail distribution of sales. Such
retailers can exploit the long tail of the market, since they are effectively
without physical limit on the number of choices on offer. Here we examine two
extensions of this phenomenon. First, we introduce turnover into the long-tail
distribution of sales. Although over any given period such as a week or a
month, the distribution is right-skewed and often power law distributed, over
time there is considerable turnover in the rankings of sales of individual
products. Second, we establish some initial results on the implications for
shelf-space strategy of physical retailers in such markets.
