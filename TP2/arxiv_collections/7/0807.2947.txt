We study the properties of $K$ and $\bar K$ mesons in nuclear matter at
finite temperature from a chiral unitary approach in coupled channels which
incorporates the $s$- and p-waves of the kaon-nucleon interaction. The
in-medium solution accounts for Pauli blocking effects, mean-field binding on
all the baryons involved, and $\pi$ and kaon self-energies. We calculate $K$
and $\bar K$ (off-shell) spectral functions and single particle properties. The
$\bar K$ effective mass gets lowered by about -50 MeV in cold nuclear matter at
saturation density and by half this reduction at T=100 MeV. The p-wave
contribution to the ${\bar K}$ optical potential, due to $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$
and $\Sigma^*$ excitations, becomes significant for momenta larger than 200
MeV/c and reduces the attraction felt by the $\bar K$ in the nuclear medium.The
$\bar K$ spectral function spreads over a wide range of energies, reflecting
the melting of the $\Lambda (1405)$ resonance and the contribution of $YN^{-1}$
components at finite temperature. In the $KN$ sector, we find that the
low-density theorem is a good approximation for the $K$ self-energy close to
saturation density due to the absence of resonance-hole excitations. The $K$
potential shows a moderate repulsive behavior, whereas the quasi-particle peak
is considerably broadened with increasing density and temperature. We discuss
the implications for the decay of the $\phi$ meson at SIS/GSI energies as well
as in the future FAIR/GSI project.
