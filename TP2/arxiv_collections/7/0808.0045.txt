We compute logarithmic corrections to entropy for black holes with hyperbolic
horizon. For this purpose, we introduce the topological black hole and MTZ
black holes in four dimensions, while in five dimensions, the topological black
holes and Gauss-Bonnet black hole with negative coupling are considered. As
they stand, logarithmic corrections are problematic because small black holes
with positive heat capacity have negative energies. However, introducing the
background state of extremal black hole, the logarithmic corrections are
performed for black hole with hyperbolic horizon.
