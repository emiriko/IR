Let G be a finite abelian group with |G|>1. Let a_1,...,a_k be k distinct
elements of G and let b_1,...,b_k be (not necessarily distinct) elements of G,
where k is a positive integer smaller than the least prime divisor of |G|. We
show that there is a permutation $\pi$ on {1,...,k} such that
a_1b_{\pi(1)},...,a_kb_{\pi(k)} are distinct, provided that any other prime
divisor of |G| (if there is any) is greater than k!. This in particular
confirms the Dasgupta-Karolyi-Serra-Szegedy conjecture for abelian p-groups. We
also pose a new conjecture involving determinants and characters, and show that
its validity implies Snevily's conjecture for abelian groups of odd order. Our
methods involve exterior algebras and characters.
