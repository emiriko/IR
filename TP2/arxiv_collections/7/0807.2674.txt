The decays of the X(3872) to P-wave quarkonia are calculated under the
assumption that it is a shallow bound state of neutral charmed mesons. The
X(3872) is described using an effective theory of nonrelativistic D mesons and
pions (X-EFT). We calculate X(3872) decays by first matching heavy hadron
chiral perturbation theory (HHchiPT) amplitudes for D^0 bar{D}^{*0} -> chi_{cJ}
+ (pi^0,pi+pi) onto local operators in X-EFT, and then using these operators to
calculate the X(3872) decays. This procedure reproduces the factorization
theorems for X(3872) decays to conventional quarkonia previously derived using
the operator product expansion. For single pion decays, we find nontrivial
dependence on the pion energy from HHchiPT diagrams with virtual D mesons. This
nontrivial energy dependence can potentially modify heavy quark symmetry
predictions for the relative sizes of decay rates. At leading order, decays to
final states with two pions are dominated by the final state chi_{c1} + pi^0 +
pi^0, with a branching fraction just below that for the decay to chi_{c1} +
pi^0. Decays to all other final states with two pions are highly suppressed.
