Impurity resonances observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the
superconducting state have been used to deduce properties of the underlying
pure state. Here we study a longstanding puzzle associated with these
measurements, the apparent extinction of these resonances for Ni and Zn
impurities in large-gap regions of the inhomogeneous BSCCO superconductor. We
calculate the effect of order parameter and hopping suppression near the
impurity site, and find that these two effects are sufficient to explain the
missing resonances in the case of Ni. There are several possible scenarios for
the extinction of the Zn resonances, which we discuss in turn; in addition, we
propose measurements which could distinguish among them.
