We have developed a real space spin-parallel theory of superconductivity
based on the minimum principle in energy. This theory has successfully provided
coherent explanations to a number of complicated problems in conventional and
non-conventional superconductors. In this paper, we report the study the
optimal doping problem in the new oxypnictide high-temperature superconductors
using aforementioned theory. In FeAs family, it is shown that there are three
optimum (or quasi-optimum) doped phases at doping levels x1=1/3, 1/6 and 1/8,
where the vortex lattice forms square or triangular stable configurations.
While in Fe2As2 family, the optimal dopings occur at x2=2/5 and 1/2 with square
and triangular superconducting vortex line lattices, respectively.
