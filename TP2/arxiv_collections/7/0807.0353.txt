Two particle azimuthal correlations are studied in 4.2A GeV C+Ta collisions
observed with the 2-m propane bubble chamber exposed at JINR Dubna
Synchrophasotron. The correlations are analyzed both for protons and negative
pions, and their dependence on the collision centrality, rapidity and rapidity
difference is investigated. It is found that protons show a weak back-to-back
correlations, while a side-by-side correlations are observed for negative
pions. Restricting both protons to the target or projectile fragmentation
region, the side-by-side correlations are observed for protons also. Using the
two particle correlation function, the flow analysis is performed and intensity
of directed flow is determined without event-by event estimation of the
reaction plane.
