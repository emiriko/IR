We search for pair production of doubly charged Higgs particles followed by
decays into electron-tau and muon-tau pairs using data (350 inverse picobarns)
collected from proton-antiproton collisions at 1.96 TeV by the CDF II
experiment. We search separately for cases where three or four final-state
leptons are detected, and combine results for exclusive decays to left-handed
electron-tau (muon-tau) pairs. We set a lower mass limit of 114 (112) GeV/cc at
the 95% confidence level for left-handed doubly charged Higgs.
