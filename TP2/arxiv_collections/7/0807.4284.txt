We present a continuous model capable of demonstrating some salient features
of aeolian sand ripples: the realistic asymmetric ripple shape, coarsening of
ripple field at the nonlinear stage of ripple growth, saturation of ripple
growth for homogeneous sand, typical size segregation of sand and formation of
armoring layers of coarse particles on ripple crests and windward slopes if
sand is inhomogeneous.
