Using first-principles plane wave calculations we predict that electronic and
magnetic properties of graphene nanoribbons can be affected by defect-induced
itinerant states. The band gaps of armchair nanoribbons can be modified by
hydrogen saturated holes. Defects due to periodically repeating vacancy or
divacancies induce metallization, as well as magnetization in non-magnetic
semiconducting nanoribbons due to the spin-polarization of local defect states.
Antiferromagnetic ground state of semiconducting zigzag ribbons can change to
ferrimagnetic state upon creation of vacancy defects, which reconstruct and
interact with edge states. Even more remarkable is that all these effects of
vacancy defects are found to depend on their geometry and position relative to
edges. It is shown that these effects can, in fact, be realized without really
creating defects.
