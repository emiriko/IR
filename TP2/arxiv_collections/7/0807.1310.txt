In order to make plausible the idea that light exerts a pressure on matter,
some introductory physics texts consider the force exerted by an
electromagnetic wave on an electron. The argument as presented is both
mathematically incorrect and has several serious conceptual difficulties
without obvious resolution at the classical, yet alone introductory, level. We
discuss these difficulties and propose an alternate demonstration.
