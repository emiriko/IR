We report on a novel mechanism for laser cooling of fluorescent solids based
on infrared-to-visible upconversion often found in rare-earth-doped low-phonon
materials. This type of optical cooling presents some advantages with regards
to conventional anti-Stokes cooling. Among them, it allows to obtain cooling in
a broader range of frequencies around the barycenter of the infrared emitting
band.
