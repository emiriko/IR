In Constructive Type Theory, recursive and corecursive definitions are
subject to syntactic restrictions which guarantee termination for recursive
functions and productivity for corecursive functions. However, many terminating
and productive functions do not pass the syntactic tests. Bove proposed in her
thesis an elegant reformulation of the method of accessibility predicates that
widens the range of terminative recursive functions formalisable in
Constructive Type Theory. In this paper, we pursue the same goal for productive
corecursive functions. Notably, our method of formalisation of coinductive
definitions of productive functions in Coq requires not only the use of ad-hoc
predicates, but also a systematic algorithm that separates the inductive and
coinductive parts of functions.
