Motivation: Time course data obtained from biological samples subject to
specific treatments can be very useful for revealing complex and novel
biological phenomena. Although an increasing number of time course microarray
datasets becomes available, most of them contain few biological replicates and
time points. So far there are few computational methods that can effectively
reveal differentially expressed genes and their patterns in such data.
  Results: We have proposed a new two-step nonparametric statistical procedure,
LRSA, to reveal differentially expressed genes and their expression trends in
temporal microarray data. We have also employed external controls as a
surrogate to estimate false discovery rates and thus to guide the discovery of
differentially expressed genes. Our results showed that LRSA reveals
substantially more differentially expressed genes and have much lower than two
other methods, STEM and ANOVA, in both real data and the simulated data. Our
computational results are confirmed using real-time PCRs.
