The mass spectrum of Delta resonances is compared to predictions based on
three quark-model variants, to predictions assuming that chiral symmetry is
restored in high-mass baryon resonances, and to predictions derived from
AdS/QCD. The latter approach yields a nearly perfect agreement when the
confinement property of QCD is modeled by a soft wall in AdS.
