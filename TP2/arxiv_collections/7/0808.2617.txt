We consider a coupled system of Hamiltonian partial differential equations
introduced by Popowicz, which has the appearance of a two-field coupling
between the Camassa-Holm and Degasperis-Procesi equations. The latter equations
are both known to be integrable, and admit peaked soliton (peakon) solutions
with discontinuous derivatives at the peaks. A combination of a reciprocal
transformation with Painlev\'e analysis provides strong evidence that the
Popowicz system is non-integrable. Nevertheless, we are able to construct exact
travelling wave solutions in terms of an elliptic integral, together with a
degenerate travelling wave corresponding to a single peakon. We also describe
the dynamics of N-peakon solutions, which is given in terms of an Hamiltonian
system on a phase space of dimension 3N.
