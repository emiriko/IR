In the framework of Standard Model for the arbitrary values of Higgs and
fermions fields hypercharges, taking into account parity invariance of
electromagnetic interaction, expressions for the fermions charges, testifying
the electric charge quantization are obtained. From the chiral anomalies
cancellation condition within one family of leptons and quarks, numerical
values of fermions charges, coinciding with standard values of charges have
been obtained.
