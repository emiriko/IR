We have fabricated resonant terahertz metamaterials on free standing
polyimide substrates. The low-loss polyimide substrates can be as thin as 5.5
micron yielding robust large-area metamaterials which are easily wrapped into
cylinders with a radius of a few millimeters. Our results provide a path
forward for creating multi-layer non-planar metamaterials at terahertz
frequencies.
