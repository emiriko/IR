Systems with global symmetry group O(2) experience topological transition in
the 2-dimensional space. But there is controversy about such a transition for
systems with global symmetry group O(3). In this paper, we study the
Lebwohl-Lasher model for the two-dimensional liquid crystal, using three
different methods independent of the proper values of possible critical
exponents. Namely, we analyze the at-equilibrium order parameter distribution
function with: 1) the hyperscaling relation; 2) the first scaling collapse for
the probability distribution function;and 3) the Binder's cumulant. We give
strong evidences for definite lack of a line of critical points at low
temperatures in the Lebwohl-Lasher model, contrary to conclusions of a number
of previous numerical studies.
