In 1948 Tellegen suggested that an assembly of the lined up electric-magnetic
dipole twins can construct a new type of an electromagnetic material. Till now,
however, the problem of creation of the Tellegen medium is a subject of strong
discussions. An elementary symmetry analysis makes questionable an idea of a
simple combination of two (electric and magnetic) dipoles to realize local
materials with the Tellegen particles as structural elements. In this paper we
show that in his search of sources with local junctions of the electrical and
magnetic properties one cannot rely on the induced parameters of small
electromagnetic scatterers. No near-field electromagnetic structures and
classical motion equations for point charges give a physical basis to realize
sources with the local junction of the electrical and magnetic properties. We
advance a hypothesis that local magnetoelectric (ME) particles should be the
physical objects with eigenmode oscillation spectra and non-classical symmetry
breaking effects. Our studies convincingly prove this assumption. We show that
a quasi-2D ferrite disk with magnetic-dipolar-mode oscillations is
characterized by unique symmetry features with topological phases resulting in
appearance of the ME properties. The entire ferrite disk can be characterized
as a combined system with eigen electric and magnetic moments. The fields near
such a particle are distinguished by special symmetry properties.
