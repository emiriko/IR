We point out mistakes made in the one-loop calculation of some diagrams for
the process $\pi \gamma^* \to \gamma$ in the preprint arXiv:0807.0296, and
present correct results. Especially, we have difficulty to understand their
argument that a highly off-shell gluon generates a light-cone (infrared)
singularity. It is shown by means of the Ward identity that the gauge-dependent
light-cone singularity found in arXiv:0807.0296 does not exist. It is then
shown that a hard kernel derived in the $k_T$ factorization of exclusive
processes is gauge invariant and free of the light-cone singularity.
