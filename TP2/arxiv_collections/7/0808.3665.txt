In this work it is shown that every integral varifold in an open subset of
Euclidian space of locally bounded first variation can be covered by a
countable collection of submanifolds of class C^2. Moreover, the mean curvature
of each member of the collection agrees with the mean curvature of the varifold
almost everywhere with respect to the varifold.
