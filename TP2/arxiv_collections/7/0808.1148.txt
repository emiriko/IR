Semiconducting carbon nanotubes under high electric field stress (~10 V/um)
display a striking, exponential current increase due to avalanche generation of
free electrons and holes. Unlike in other materials, the avalanche process in
such 1D quantum wires involves access to the third sub-band, is insensitive to
temperature, but strongly dependent on diameter ~exp(-1/d^2). Comparison with a
theoretical model yields a novel approach to obtain the inelastic optical
phonon emission length, L_OP,ems ~ 15d nm. The combined results underscore the
importance of multi-band transport in 1D molecular wires.
