We derive the discrete anomaly conditions for the binary tetrahedral group T'
as well as the binary dihedral groups Q_2n. The ambiguities of embedding these
finite groups into SU(2) and SU(3) lead to various possible definitions of the
discrete indices which enter the anomaly equations. We scrutinize the different
choices and show that it is sufficient to consider one particular assignment
for the discrete indices. Thus it is straightforward to determine whether or
not a given model of flavor is discrete anomaly free.
