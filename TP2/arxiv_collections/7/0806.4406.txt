High brightness electron accelerators, such as energy recovery linacs (ERL),
often have complex particle distributions that can create difficulties in beam
transport as well as matching to devices such as wigglers used to generate
radiation from the beam. Optical transition radiation (OTR), OTR interferometry
(OTRI) and optical diffraction-transition radiation interferometry (ODTRI) have
proven to be effective tools for diagnosing both the spatial and angular
distributions of charged particle beams. OTRI and ODTRI have been used to
measure rms divergences and optical transverse phase space mapping has been
demonstrated using OTRI. In this work we present the results of diagnostic
experiments using OTR and ODR conducted at the Jefferson Laboratory 115 MeV ERL
which show the presence of two separate components within the spatial and
angular distributions of the beam. By assuming a correlation between the
spatial and angular features we estimate an rms emittance value for each of the
two components.
