We describe the concept and experimental demonstration of primary thermometry
based on a four probe measurement of a single tunnel junction embedded within
four arrays of junctions. We show that in this configuration random sample
specific and environment-related errors can be avoided. This method relates
temperature directly to Boltzmann constant, which will form the basis of the
definition of temperature and realization of official temperature scales in the
future.
