We investigate stresses and particle motion during the start up of flow in a
colloidal dispersion close to arrest into a glassy state. A combination of
molecular dynamics simulation, mode coupling theory and confocal microscopy
experiment is used to investigate the origins of the widely observed stress
overshoot and (previously not reported) super-diffusive motion in the transient
dynamics. A link between the macro-rheological stress versus strain curves and
the microscopic particle motion is established. Negative correlations in the
transient auto-correlation function of the potential stresses are found
responsible for both phenomena, and arise even for homogeneous flows and almost
Gaussian particle displacements.
