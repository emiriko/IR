A frame-like action for arbitrary mixed-symmetry bosonic massless fields in
Minkowski space is constructed. The action is given in a simple form and
consists of two terms for a field of any spin. The fields and gauge parameters
are certain tensor-valued differential forms. The formulation is based on the
unfolded form of equations for mixed-symmetry fields.
