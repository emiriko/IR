A simple circuit for the presentation of the signals from Multi-gap Resistive
Plate Chambers (MRPCs) to standard existing digitization electronics is
described. The circuit is based on "off-the-shelf" discrete components. An
optimization of the values of specific components is required to match the
aspects of the MRPCs for the given application. This simple circuit is an
attractive option for the initial signal processing for MRPC prototyping and
bench- or beam-testing efforts, as well as for final implementations of
small-area Time-of-Flight systems with existing data acquisition systems.
