In this work, we present detailed measurements of the Casimir-Lifshitz force
between two gold surfaces (a sphere and a plate) immersed in ethanol and study
the effect of residual electrostatic forces, which are dominated by static
fields within the apparatus and can be reduced with proper shielding.
Electrostatic forces are further reduced by Debye screening through the
addition of salt ions to the liquid. Additionally, the salt leads to a
reduction of the Casimir-Lifshitz force by screening the zero-frequency
contribution to the force; however, the effect is small between gold surfaces
at the measured separations and within experimental error. An improved
calibration procedure is described and compared to previous methods. Finally,
the experimental results are compared to Lifshitz's theory and found to be
consistent for the materials used in the experiment.
