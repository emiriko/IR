Biologists have long observed periodic-like oxygen consumption oscillations
in yeast populations under certain conditions and several unsatisfactory
explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed. These "autonomous
oscillations" have often appeared with periods that are nearly integer divisors
of the calculated doubling time of the culture.
  We hypothesize that these oscillations could be caused by a weak form of cell
cycle synchronization that we call clustering. We develop some novel ordinary
differential equation models of the cell cycle. For these models, and for
random and stochastic perturbations, we give both rigorous proofs and
simulations showing that both positive and negative growth rate feedback within
the cell cycle are possible agents that can cause clustering of populations
within the cell cycle. It occurs for a variety of models and for a broad
selection of parameter values. These results suggest that the clustering
phenomenon is robust and is likely to be observed in nature. Since there are
necessarily an integer number of clusters, clustering would lead to
periodic-like behavior with periods that are nearly integer divisors of the
period of the cell cycle.
