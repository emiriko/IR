The solutions for the helical edge states for an effective continuum model
for the quantum spin Hall effect in HgTe/CdTe quantum wells are presented. For
a sample of a large size, the solution gives the linear dispersion for the edge
states. However, in a finite strip geometry, the edge states at two sides will
couple with each other, which leads to a finite energy gap in the spectra. The
gap decays in an exponential law of the width of sample. The magnetic field
dependence of the edge states illustrates the difference of the edge states
from those of a conventional quantum Hall strip of two-dimensional electron
gas.
