We describe SuperIso v3.0 which is a public program for evaluation of flavor
physics observables in the Standard Model (SM), general two-Higgs-doublet model
(2HDM), minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and next to minimal
supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). SuperIso v3.0, in addition to the
branching ratio of B -> X_s gamma and the isospin asymmetry of B -> K* gamma,
incorporates other flavor observables such as the branching ratio of B_s -> mu+
mu-, the branching ratio of B -> tau nu_tau, the branching ratio of B -> D tau
nu_tau, the branching ratio of K -> mu nu_mu and the branching ratios of D_s ->
tau nu_tau and D_s -> mu nu_mu. The calculation of the branching ratio of B ->
X_s gamma is also improved, as it includes NNLO Standard Model contributions.
The program also computes the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2). Nine sample
models are included in the package, namely SM, 2HDM, and mSUGRA, NUHM, AMSB and
GMSB for the MSSM, and CNMSSM, NGMSB and NNUHM for the NMSSM. SuperIso uses a
SUSY Les Houches Accord file (SLHA1 or SLHA2) as input, which can be either
generated automatically by the program via a call to external spectrum
calculators, or provided by the user. The calculation of the observables is
detailed in the Appendices, where a suggestion for the allowed intervals for
each observable is also provided.
