Physical systems have some degree of disorder present in them. We discuss how
to treat natural, thermal entanglement in any random macroscopic system from
which a thermodynamic witness bounded by a constant can be found. We propose
that functional many-body perturbation theory be applied to allow either a
quenched or an annealed average over the disorder to be taken. We find when
considering the example of an XX Heisenberg spin chain with a random coupling
strength, that the region of natural entanglement detected by both witnesses
can be enhanced by the disorder.
