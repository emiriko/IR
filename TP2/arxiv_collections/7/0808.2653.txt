We investigate the electronic and other properties of the hypothetical
compound LiFeSb in relation to superconducting LiFeAs and FeSe using density
functional calculations. The results show that LiFeSb in the LiFeAs structure
would be dynamically stable in the sense of having no unstable phonon modes,
and would have very similar electronic and magnetic properties to the layered
Fe based superconductors. Importantly, a very similar structure for the Fermi
surface and a spin density wave related to but stronger than that in the
corresponding As compound is found. These results are indicative of possible
superconductivity analogous to the Fe-As based compounds if the spin density
wave can be suppressed by doping or other means. Prospects for synthesizing
this material in pure form or in solid solution with FeTe are discussed.
