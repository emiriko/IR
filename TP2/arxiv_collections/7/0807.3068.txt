The cytoplasm of a living cell is crowded with several macromolecules of
different shapes and sizes. Molecular diffusion in such a medium becomes
anomalous due to the presence of macromolecules and diffusivity is expected to
decrease with increase in macromolecular crowding. Moreover, many cellular
processes are dependent on molecular diffusion in the cell cytosol. The
enzymatic reaction rate has been shown to be affected by the presence of such
macromolecules. A simple numerical model is proposed here based on percolation
and diffusion in disordered systems to study the effect of macromolecular
crowding on the enzymatic reaction rates. The model explains qualitatively some
of the experimental observations.
