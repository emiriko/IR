By solving the Bogoliubov -- de Gennes equations at zero temperature, we
study the effects of a one-dimensional optical lattice on the behavior of a
superfluid Fermi gas at unitarity. We show that, due to the lattice, at low
densities the gas becomes highly compressible and the effective mass is large,
with a consequent significant reduction of the sound velocity. We discuss the
role played by the lattice in the formation of molecules and the emergence of
two-dimensional effects in the equation of state. Predictions for the density
profiles and for the frequency of the collective oscillations in the presence
of harmonic trapping are also given.
