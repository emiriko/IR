Kaon condensation may play an important role in the structure of hadronic
matter at densities greater than that of nuclear matter, as exist in the
interior of neutron stars. We present the results of the first lattice QCD
investigation of kaon condensation obtained by studying systems containing up
to twelve negatively charged kaons. Surprisingly, the properties of the
condensate that we calculate are remarkably well reproduced by leading order
chiral perturbation theory. In our analysis, we also determine the three-kaon
interaction from the multi-kaon systems and update our results for pion
condensates.
