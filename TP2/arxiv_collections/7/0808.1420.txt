We report an NMR investigation of the superconductivity in BaFe(2)As(2)
induced by Co doping (Tc=22K). We demonstrate that Co atoms form an alloy with
Fe atoms and donate carriers without creating localized moments. Our finding
strongly suggests that the underlying physics of iron-pnictide superconductors
is quite different from the widely accepted physical picture of high Tc
cuprates as doped Mott insulators. We also show a crossover of electronic
properties into a low temperature pseudo-gap phase with a pseudo-gap Delta
560K, where chi(spin) constant and resisitivty T. The NMR Knight shift below Tc
decreases for both along the c-axis and ab-plane, and is consistent with the
singlet pairing scenario.
