We study, using dissipative particle dynamics simulations, the effect of
active lipid flip-flop on model fluid bilayer membranes. We consider both cases
of symmetric as well as asymmetric flip-flops. Symmetric flip-flop leads to a
steady state of the membrane with an effective temperature higher than that of
the equilibrium membrane and an effective surface tension lower than that of
the equilibrium membrane. Asymmetric flip-flop leads to transient
conformational changes of the membrane in the form of bud or blister formation,
depending on the flip rate.
