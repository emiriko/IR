We discuss recent developments in the understanding of gauge-invariant
transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton-distribution functions (PDF). We
compute the leading-order $\overline{\text{MS}\vphantom{^1}}$-scheme anomalous
dimension of such a quantity in the light-cone gauge and show that it receives
a contribution that can be associated with a cusp obstruction at transverse
light-cone infinity. This anomalous dimension is intimately related to
expectation values composed of fields and eikonal factors along a cusped
contour and is absent in covariant gauges. The implications of these findings
are addressed and a modified definition of TMD PDFs is proposed.
