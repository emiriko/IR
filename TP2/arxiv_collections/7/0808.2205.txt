We have measured the dynamic alignment properties of single-walled carbon
nanotube (SWNT) suspensions in pulsed high magnetic fields through linear
dichroism spectroscopy. Millisecond-duration pulsed high magnetic fields up to
56 T as well as microsecond-duration pulsed ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 166
T were used. Due to their anisotropic magnetic properties, SWNTs align in an
applied magnetic field, and because of their anisotropic optical properties,
aligned SWNTs show linear dichroism. The characteristics of their overall
alignment depend on several factors, including the viscosity and temperature of
the suspending solvent, the degree of anisotropy of nanotube magnetic
susceptibilities, the nanotube length distribution, the degree of nanotube
bundling, and the strength and duration of the applied magnetic field. In order
to explain our data, we have developed a theoretical model based on the
Smoluchowski equation for rigid rods that accurately reproduces the salient
features of the experimental data.
