We show, from first-principles calculations, that the hole-doped side of
FeAs-based compounds is different from its electron-doped counterparts. The
electron side is characterized as Fermi surface nesting, and SDW-to-NM quantum
critical point (QCP) is realized by doping. For the hole-doped side, on the
other hand, orbital-selective partial orbital ordering develops together with
checkboard antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering without lattice distortion. A unique
SDW-to-AF QCP is achieved, and $J_2$=$J_1/2$ criteria (in the approximate
$J_1&J_2$ model) is satisfied. The observed superconductivity is located in the
vicinity of QCP for both sides.
