Using plaquette and Symanzik improved gauge action and stout link clover
fermions we determine the improvement coefficient $c_{SW}$ in one-loop lattice
perturbation theory from the off-shell quark-quark-gluon three-point function.
In addition, we compute the coefficients needed for the most general form of
quark field improvement and present the one-loop result for the critical
hopping parameter $\kappa_c$. We discuss mean field improvement for $c_{SW}$
and $\kappa_c$ and the choice of the mean field coupling for the actions we
have considered.
