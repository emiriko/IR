We study the difficulties associated with the evaluation of the total Bondi
momentum at finite distances around the central source of a general
(asymptotically flat) spacetime. Since the total momentum is only rigorously
defined at future null infinity, both finite distance and gauge effects must be
taken into account for a correct computation of this quantity.
  Our discussion is applicable in general contexts but is particularly relevant
in numerically constructed spacetimes for both extracting important physical
information and assessing the accuracy of additional quantities.
