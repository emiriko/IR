We compute in order alpha_s the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) short-distance
coefficients that match quark-antiquark operators of all orders in the
heavy-quark velocity v to the electromagnetic current. We employ a new method
to compute the one-loop NRQCD contribution to the matching condition. The new
method uses full-QCD expressions as a starting point to obtain the NRQCD
contribution, thus greatly streamlining the calculation. Our results show that,
under a mild constraint on the NRQCD operator matrix elements, the NRQCD
velocity expansion for the quark-antiquark-operator contributions to the
electromagnetic current converges. The velocity expansion converges rapidly for
approximate J/psi operator matrix elements.
