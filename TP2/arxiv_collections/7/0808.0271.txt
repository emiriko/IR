We review the most recent measurements of the top quark mass using data
collected by the CDF experiment at the Tevatron 1.96 TeV ppbar collider. The
mass measurements are performed in all main decay modes of the produced ttbar
pairs using integrated luminosities up to 2fb-1. In most channels the total
uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects, most of which are currently
being revised. The precise measurement of the top quark mass is one of the
Tevatron's main and long lasting legacies. Besides serving as a benchmark
measurement at the LHC collider, it will serve as a consistency check of the
Standard Model in case a a neutral CP even Higgs boson is found, either at the
Tevatron or at the LHC.
