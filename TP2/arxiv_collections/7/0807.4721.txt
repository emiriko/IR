High precision electroweak tests, such as deviations from the Standard Model
expectations of the Lepton Flavor Universality breaking in K->lnu (with l= e or
mu), represent a powerful tool to test the Standard Model and, hence, to
constrain or obtain indirect hints of New Physics beyond it. We explore such a
possibility within Supersymmetric theories. Interestingly enough, a process
that in itself does not need lepton flavor violation to occur, i.e. the
violation of mu-e non-universality in K_l2, proves to be quite effective in
constraining not only relevant regions of SUSY models where lepton flavor is
conserved, but even those where specific lepton flavor violating contributions
arise. Indeed, a comparison with analogous bounds coming from tau lepton flavor
violating decays shows the relevance of the measurement of R_K to probe Lepton
Flavor Violation in SUSY. We outline the role and the interplay of the direct
New Physics searches at the LHC with the indirect searches performed by LFU
tests.
