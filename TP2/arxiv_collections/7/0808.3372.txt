We investigate hadronic unquenching effects in light quarks and mesons. To
this end we take into account the back-coupling of the pion onto the quark
propagator within the non-perturbative continuum framework of Schwinger-Dyson
equations (SDE) and Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSE). We improve on a previous
approach by explicitly solving both the coupled system of DSEs and BSEs in the
complex plane and the normalisation problem for Bethe-Salpeter kernels
depending on the total momentum of the meson. As a result of our study we find
considerable unquenching effects in the spectrum of light pseudoscalar, vector
and axial-vector mesons.
