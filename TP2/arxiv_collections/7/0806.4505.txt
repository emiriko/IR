Molecular dynamics simulations of ultrathin water film confined between
atomically flat rigid diamond plates are described. Films with thickness of one
and two molecular diameters are concerned and TIP4P model is used for water
molecules. Dynamical and equilibrium characteristics of the system for
different values of the external load and shear force are investigated. An
increase of the external load causes the transition of the film to a solidlike
state. This is manifested in the decreasing of the diffusion constant and in
the ordering of the liquid molecules into quasidiscrete layers. For two-layer
film under high loads molecules also become ordered parallel to the surfaces.
Time dependencies of the friction force and the changes of its average value
with the load are obtained. In general, the behaviour of the studied model is
consistent with the experimental results obtained for simple liquids with
spherical molecules.
