We present a statistical readout method for quantum interferences based on
time series analysis of consecutive single electron transfers through a double
quantum dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. Waiting time distributions
qualitatively indicate the presence of interferences and provide information on
orbital-detuning and coherent interdot-electron transfer. Interdot transfer
induced oscillations are Aharonov-Bohm phase sensitive, while those due to
level detuning are phase-independent. The signature of the quantum interference
in the waiting time distribution is more apparent for weakly coupled electron
transfer detectors.
