In this talk, I shall first discuss the standard model Higgs mechanism and
then highlight some of its deficiencies making a case for the need to go beyond
the standard model (BSM). The BSM tour will be guided by symmetry arguments. I
shall pick up four specific BSM scenarios, namely, supersymmetry, Little Higgs,
Gauge-Higgs unification, and the Higgsless approach. The discussion will be
confined mainly on their electroweak symmetry breaking aspects.
