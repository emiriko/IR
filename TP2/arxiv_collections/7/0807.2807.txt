Complexity in many-particle systems occurs through processes of qualitative
differentiation. These are described by concepts such as emerging states with
specific symmetries that are linked to order parameters. In quantum Hall phases
of electrons in semiconductor double layers with large inter-layer electron
correlation there is an emergent many body exciton phase with an order
parameter that measures the condensate fraction of excitons across the
tunneling gap. As the inter-layer coupling is reduced by application of an
in-plane magnetic field, this excitonic insulating state is brought in
competition with a Fermi-metal phase of composite fermions (loosely, electrons
with two magnetic flux quanta attached) stabilized by intra-layer electron
correlation. Here we show that the quantum phase transformation between
metallic and excitonic insulating states in the coupled bilayers becomes
discontinuous (first-order) by impacts of different terms of the
electron-electron interactions that prevail on weak residual disorder. The
evidence is based on precise determinations of the excitonic order parameter by
inelastic light scattering measurements close to the phase boundary. While
there is marked softening of low-lying excitations, our experiments underpin
the roles of competing orders linked to quasi-particle correlations in removing
the divergence of quantum fluctuations.
