We present the preliminary result of a search for the decay B+- --> a1+-K*0.
The data, collected with the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, represent 465 million BB pairs produced in e+e- annihilation at the
Y(4s) energy. The result for the branching fraction is: B(B+ --> a1+ K*0) *
B(a1+ --> pi+pi-pi+) = (0.7 +0.5/-0.4 +/-0.7) x 10-6, corresponding to an upper
limit at 90% confidence level of 1.6 x 10-6. The first error quoted is
statistical, the second systematic.
