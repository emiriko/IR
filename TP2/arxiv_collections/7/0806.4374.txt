We show that Mach-like azimuthal correlations of associated hadrons in the
wake of heavy quark jets modeled in the AdS/CFT string drag picture originate
only from the near-quark ``Head'' region. The contributions from the far zones
lead only to a yield peaked in the opposite direction with respect to the
trigger jet.
