The superfluid properties of the attractive Hubbard model in a Zeeman
magnetic field, and in the weak coupling regime have been investigated. The
temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the order parameter have been
analyzed. Furthermore, the temperature vs. magnetic field and temperature vs.
spin polarization phase diagrams for the 2D and 3D lattices have been obtained.
For some parameters a reentrant transition has been found.
