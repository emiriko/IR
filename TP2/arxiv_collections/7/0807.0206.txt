We consider the frame-like formulation of reducible sets of totally symmetric
bosonic and fermionic higher-spin fields in flat and AdS backgrounds of any
dimension, that correspond to so-called higher-spin triplets resulting from the
string-inspired BRST approach. The explicit relationship of the fields of
higher-spin triplets to the higher-spin vielbeins and connections is found. The
gauge invariant actions are constructed including, in particular, the reducible
(i.e. triplet) higher-spin fermion case in AdS_D space.
