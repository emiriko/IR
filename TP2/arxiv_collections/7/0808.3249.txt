We prove the differentiability of Lipschitz maps X-->V, where X is a complete
metric measure space satisfying a doubling condition and a Poincar\'e
inequality, and V is a Banach space with the Radon Nikodym Property (RNP). The
proof depends on a new characterization of the differentiable structure on such
metric measure spaces, in terms of directional derivatives in the direction of
tangent vectors to suitable rectifiable curves.
