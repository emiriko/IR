The dynamic response of InAsP quantum dots grown on InP(001) substrates by
low-pressure Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy emitting around 1.55 $\mu$m, is
investigated by means of time-resolved microphotoluminescence as a function of
temperature. Exciton lifetime steadily increases from 1 ns at low temperature
to reach 4 ns at 300K while the integrated photoluminescence intensity
decreases only by a factor of 2/3. These characteristics give evidence that
such InAsP/InP quantum dots provide a strong carrier confinement even at room
temperature and that their dynamic response is not affected by thermally
activated non-radiative recombination up to room temperature.
