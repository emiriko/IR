Random matrices arise in many mathematical contexts, and it is natural to ask
about the properties that such matrices satisfy. If we choose a matrix with
integer entries at random, for example, what is the probability that it will
have a particular integer as an eigenvalue, or an integer eigenvalue at all? If
we choose a matrix with real entries at random, what is the probability that it
will have a real eigenvalue in a particular interval? The purpose of this paper
is to resolve these questions, once they are made suitably precise, in the
setting of 2x2 matrices.
