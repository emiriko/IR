We study the competition between interactions and disorder in two dimensions.
Whereas a noninteracting system is always Anderson localized by disorder in two
dimensions, a pure system can develop a Mott gap for sufficiently strong
interactions. Within a simple model, with short-ranged repulsive interactions,
we show that, even in the limit of strong interaction, the Mott gap is
completely washed out by disorder for an infinite system for dimensions $D\le
2$. The probability of a nonzero gap falls onto a universal curve, leading to a
glassy state for which we provide a scaling function for the frequency
dependent susceptibility.
