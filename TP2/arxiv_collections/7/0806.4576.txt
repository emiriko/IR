We analyse an epidemiological model of competing strains of pathogens and
hence differences in transmission for first versus secondary infection due to
interaction of the strains with previously aquired immunities, as has been
described for dengue fever (in dengue known as antibody dependent enhancement,
ADE). Such models show a rich variety of dynamics through bifurcations up to
deterministic chaos. Including temporary cross-immunity even enlarges the
parameter range of such chaotic attractors, and also gives rise to various
coexisting attractors, which are difficult to identify by standard numerical
bifurcation programs using continuation methods. A combination of techniques,
including classical bifurcation plots and Lyapunov exponent spectra has to be
applied in comparison to get further insight into such dynamical structures.
Here we present for the first time multi-parameter studies in a range of
biologically plausible values for dengue. The multi-strain interaction with the
immune system is expected to also have implications for the epidemiology of
other diseases.
