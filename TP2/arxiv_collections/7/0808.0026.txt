We present majority and minority radiofrequency (RF) spectra of strongly
interacting imbalanced Fermi gases of Li-6. We observed a smooth evolution in
the nature of pairing correlations from pairing in the superfluid region to
polaron binding in the highly polarized normal region. The imbalance induces
quasiparticles in the superfluid region even at very low temperature. This
leads to a local bimodal spectral response, which allows us to determine the
superfluid gap \Delta and the Hartree energy U.
