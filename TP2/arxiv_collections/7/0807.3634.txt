We present a new kind of fluorescent oxide nanoparticles with properties well
suited to active-tip based near-field optics. These particles with an average
diameter in the range 5-10 nm are produced by Low Energy Cluster Beam
Deposition (LECBD) from a YAG:Ce3+ target. They are studied by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), classical
photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence and near-field scanning optical
microscopy (NSOM). Particles of extreme photo-stability as small as 10 nm in
size are observed. These emitters are validated as building blocks of active
NSOM tips by coating a standard optical tip with a 10 nm thick layer of
YAG:Ce3+ particles directly in the LECBD reactor and by subsequently performing
NSOM imaging of test surfaces.
