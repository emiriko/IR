We study Bragg spectroscopy of a strongly interacting Bose-Einstein
condensate using time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. We include
approximatively the effect of the momentum dependent scattering amplitude which
is shown to be the dominant factor in determining the spectrum for large
momentum Bragg scattering. The condensation of the Bragg scattered atoms is
shown to significantly alter the observed excitation spectrum by creating a
novel pairing channel of mobile pairs.
