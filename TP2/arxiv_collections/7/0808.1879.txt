The PHENIX Experiment on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with its
use of beams of polarized protons, provides a unique environment of hard
scattering between gluons and quarks complementary to that provided by deep
inelastic scattering (DIS). Polarized proton proton collisions can directly
probe the polarized gluon and anti-quark distributions as the collisions couple
the color charges of the participants. We will give a brief overview of the
PHENIX Spin Program and we will report recent results of the many probes
accessible to the PHENIX experiment.
