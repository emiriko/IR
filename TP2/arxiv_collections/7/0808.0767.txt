We formulate the 2-body problem of electrodynamics using functional
differential equations, and explain the peculiar features of these equations
which indicate a paradigm shift in physics. We examine the possible empirical
existence of advanced interactions using various absorber theories of
radiation. Functional differential equations were connected to quantum
mechanics in a subsequent paper in this series and in later publications.
