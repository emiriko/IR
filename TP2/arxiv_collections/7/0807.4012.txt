Numbers of accelerator and reactor neutrino oscillation experiments aiming to
search finite value of $\theta_{13}$ are starting within a few years. T2K
experiment is a next generation long baseline neutrino experiment starts on
2009, in Japan. A main goal of the T2K experiment is to discover a finite
$\theta_{13}$ by observing $\nu_e$ appearance. Determining $\theta_{13}$ leads
a next search of CP violation in the lepton sector. Status of T2K experiment
and prospects for CP measurement are reported in the report.
