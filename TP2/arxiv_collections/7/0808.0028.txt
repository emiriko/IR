It is proposed that the Higgs vacuum possesses a small-scale structure that
can explain the large discrepancy between the predicted electroweak vacuum
energy density and the observed cosmological constant. An effective Lagrangian
description is employed to obtain modifications to the Standard Model
predictions that can be tested at collider experiments.
