The fiber bundle model describes a collection of elastic fibers under load.
the fibers fail successively and for each failure, the load distribution among
the surviving fibers change. Even though very simple, the model captures the
essentials of failure processes in a large number of materials and settings. We
present here a review of fiber bundle model with different load redistribution
mechanism from the point of view of statistics and statistical physics rather
than materials science, with a focus on concepts such as criticality,
universality and fluctuations. We discuss the fiber bundle model as a tool for
understanding phenomena such as creep, and fatigue, how it is used to describe
the behavior of fiber reinforced composites as well as modelling e.g. network
failure, traffic jams and earthquake dynamics.
