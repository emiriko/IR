We consider the modes of the electric field of a cavity where there is an
embedded polarized dielectric film. The model consists in the Maxwell equations
coupled to a Duffing oscillator for the film which we assume infinitely thin.
We derive the normal modes of the system and show that they are orthogonal with
a special scalar product which we introduce. These modes are well suited to
describe the system even for a film of finite thickness. By acting on the film
we demonstrate switching from one cavity mode to another. Since the system is
linear, little energy is needed for this conversion. Moreover the amplitude
equations describe very well this complex system under different perturbations
(damping, forcing and nonlinearity) with very few modes. These results are very
general and can be applied to different situations like for an atom in a cavity
or a Josephson junction in a capacitor and this could be very useful for many
nano-physics applications.
