The shape of a weightless spinning liquid droplet is governed by the balance
between the surface tension and centrifugal forces. The axisymmetric shape for
slow rotation becomes unstable to a non-axisymmetric distortion above a
critical angular velocity, beyond which the droplet progresses through a series
of 2-lobed shapes. Theory predicts the existence of a family of 3- and 4-lobed
equilibrium shapes at higher angular velocity. We investigate the formation of
a triangular-shaped magnetically levitated water droplet, driven to rotate by
the Lorentz force on an ionic current within the droplet. We also study
equatorial traveling waves which give the droplet 3, 4 and 5-fold symmetry.
