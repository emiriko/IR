The recoil effects of spontaneous photon emissions during optical pumping of
a trapped three-level atom are exactly calculated. Without resort to the
Lamb-Dicke approximation, and considering arbitrary detuning and saturation of
the pump laser, the density of recoil shifts in phase space is derived. It is
shown that this density is not of Gaussian shape, and that it becomes isotropic
in phase space only for a branching ratio corresponding to fluorescence
scattering but unfavorable for optical pumping. The dependence of its
anisotropy on the laser saturation is discussed in the resonant case, and the
mapping of moments of the atom's center-of-mass motion due to the pumping is
presented. Moreover, it is shown how optimum parameters for protecting the
center-of-mass quantum state from pump-induced disturbance depend on the
specific property to be protected.
