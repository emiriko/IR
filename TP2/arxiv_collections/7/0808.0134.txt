We hereby propose a model of opinion dynamics where individuals update their
beliefs because of interactions in acquaintances' group. The model exhibit a
non trivial behavior that we discuss as a function of the main involved
parameters. Results are reported on the average number of opinion clusters and
the time needed to form such clusters.
