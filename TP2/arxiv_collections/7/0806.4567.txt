We study the fluctuations of work done and dissipated heat of a Brownian
particle in a symmetric double well system. The system is driven by two
periodic input signals that rock the potential simultaneously. Confinement in
one preferred well can be achieved by modulating the relative phase between the
drives. We show that in the presence of pumping the stochastic resonance signal
is enhanced when analyzed in terms of the average work done on the system per
cycle. This is in contrast to the case when pumping is achieved by applying an
external static bias, which degrades resonance. We analyze the nature of work
and heat fluctuations and show that the steady state fluctuation theorem holds
in this system.
