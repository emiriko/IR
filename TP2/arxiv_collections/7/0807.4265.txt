We calculate the branching ratios and CP violating asymmetries of the four $B
\to K \etap$ decays in the perturbative QCD (pQCD) factorization approach.
Besides the full leading order contributions, the partial next-to-leading order
(NLO) contributions from the QCD vertex corrections, the quark loops, and the
chromo-magnetic penguins are also taken into account. The NLO pQCD predictions
for the CP-averaged branching ratios are $Br(B^+ \to K^+ \eta) \approx 3.2
\times 10^{-6}$, $Br(B^\pm \to K^\pm \etar) \approx 51.0 \times 10^{-6}$,
$Br(B^0 \to K^0 \eta) \approx 2.1 \times 10^{-6}$, and $Br(B^0 \to K^0 \etar)
\approx 50.3 \times 10^{-6}$. The NLO contributions can provide a 70%
enhancement to the LO $Br(B \to K \etar)$, but a 30% reduction to the LO $Br(B
\to K \eta)$, which play the key role in understanding the observed pattern of
branching ratios. The NLO pQCD predictions for the CP-violating asymmetries,
such as $\acp^{dir} (K^0_S \etar) \sim 2.3% $ and $\acp^{mix}(K^0_S \etar)\sim
63%$, agree very well with currently available data. This means that the
deviation $\Delta S=\acp^{mix}(K^0_S \etar) - \sin{2\beta}$ in pQCD approach is
also very small.
