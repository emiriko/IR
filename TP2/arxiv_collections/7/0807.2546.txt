We apply and test the recently proposed "extended scaling" scheme in an
analysis of the magnetic susceptibility of Ising systems above the upper
critical dimension. The data are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations using both
the conventional Wolff cluster algorithm and the Prokof'ev-Svistunov worm
algorithm. As already observed for other models, extended scaling is shown to
extend the high-temperature critical scaling regime over a range of
temperatures much wider than that achieved conventionally. It allows for an
accurate determination of leading and sub-leading scaling indices, critical
temperatures and amplitudes of the confluent corrections.
