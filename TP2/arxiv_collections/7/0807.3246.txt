We consider gravity coupled to a massive field whose Compton's wavelength is
far larger than the Planck's length. In the low energy effective action for
gravity, thus, it is the perturbation in the Compton's wavelength that breaks
first as the sub-sub-leading quantum perturbation grows stronger. When this
break occurs, we can not trust the perturbative information about the form of
the low energy effective action. We translate this break into the lowest limit
on the mass of a classical black hole. In D=4, using the electron's mass, this
requires the black hole to be heavier than 10^{14} kg.
