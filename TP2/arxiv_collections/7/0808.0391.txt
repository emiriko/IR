Simulation of Lattice QCD is a challenging computational problem. Currently,
technological trends in computation show multiple divergent models of
computation. We are witnessing homogeneous multi-core architectures, the use of
accelerator on-chip or off-chip, in addition to the traditional architectural
models.
  On the verge of this technological abundance, assessing the performance
trade-offs of computing nodes based on these technologies is of crucial
importance to many scientific computing applications.
  In this study, we focus on assessing the efficiency and the performance
expected for the Lattice QCD problem on representative architectures and we
project the expected improvement on these architectures and their impact on
performance for Lattice QCD. We additionally try to pinpoint the limiting
factors for performance on these architectures.
