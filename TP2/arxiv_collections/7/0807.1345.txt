We search for the uniform Hartree-Fock ground state of the two-dimensional
electron gas formed in semiconductor heterostructures including the Rashba
spin-orbit interaction. We identify two competing quantum phases: a
ferromagnetic one with partial spin polarization in the perpendicular direction
and a paramagnetic one with in-plane spin. We present a phase diagram in terms
of the relative strengths of the Rashba to the Coulomb interaction and the
electron density. We compare our theoretical description with existing
experimental results obtained in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures.
