Statistical multispecies models of multiarea marine ecosystems use a variety
of data sources to estimate parameters using composite or weighted likelihood
functions with associated weighting issues and questions on how to obtain
variance estimates. Regardless of the method used to obtain point estimates, a
method is needed for variance estimation. A bootstrap technique is introduced
for the evaluation of uncertainty in such models, taking into account inherent
spatial and temporal correlations in the data sets thus avoiding many
model--specification issues, which are commonly transferred as assumptions from
a likelihood estimation procedure into Hessian--based variance estimation
procedures. The technique is demonstrated on a real data set and used to look
for estimation bias and the effects of different aggregation levels in
population dynamics models.
