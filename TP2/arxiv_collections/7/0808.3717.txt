Development organizations and International Non-Governmental Organizations
have been emphasizing the high potential of Free and Open Source Software for
the Less Developed Countries. Cost reduction, less vendor dependency and
increased potential for local capacity development have been their main
arguments. In spite of its advantages, Free and Open Source Software is not
widely adopted at the African continent. In this book the authors will explore
the grounds on with these expectations are based. Where do they come from and
is there evidence to support these expectations? Over the past years several
projects have been initiated and some good results have been achieved, but at
the same time many challenges were encountered. What lessons can be drawn from
these experiences and do these experiences contain enough evidence to support
the high expectations? Several projects and their achievements will be
considered. In the final part of the book the future of Free and Open Source
Software for Development will be explored. Special attention is given to the
African continent since here challenges are highest. What is the role of Free
and open Source Software for Development and how do we need to position and
explore the potential? What are the threats? The book aims at professionals
that are engaged in the design and implementation of ICT for Development
(ICT4D) projects and want to improve their understanding of the role Free and
Open Source Software can play.
