A recent attempt to extend the geometric Langlands duality to affine
Kac-Moody groups, has led Braverman and Finkelberg [arXiv:0711.2083] to
conjecture a mathematical relation between the intersection cohomology of the
moduli space of G-bundles on certain singular complex surfaces, and the
integrable representations of the Langlands dual of an associated affine
G-algebra, where G is any simply-connected semisimple group. For the A-type
groups, where the conjecture has been mathematically verified to a large
extent, we show that the relation has a natural physical interpretation in
terms of six-dimensional compactifications of M-theory with coincident
five-branes wrapping certain hyperkahler four-manifolds; in particular, it can
be understood as an expected invariance in the resulting spacetime BPS spectrum
under string dualities. By replacing the singular complex surface with a smooth
multi-Taub-NUT manifold, we find agreement with a closely related result
demonstrated earlier via purely field-theoretic considerations by Witten. By
adding OM five-planes to the original analysis, we argue that an analogous
relation involving the non-simply-connected D-type groups, ought to hold as
well. This is the first example of a string-theoretic interpretation of such a
two-dimensional extension to complex surfaces of the geometric Langlands
duality for the A-D groups.
