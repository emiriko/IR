We present measurements of net charge fluctuations in $Au + Au$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 19.6, 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV, $Cu + Cu$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 62.4, 200 GeV, and $p + p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = $ 200
GeV using the dynamical net charge fluctuations measure $\nu_{+-{\rm,dyn}}$. We
observe that the dynamical fluctuations are non-zero at all energies and
exhibit a modest dependence on beam energy. A weak system size dependence is
also observed. We examine the collision centrality dependence of the net charge
fluctuations and find that dynamical net charge fluctuations violate $1/N_{ch}$
scaling, but display approximate $1/N_{part}$ scaling. We also study the
azimuthal and rapidity dependence of the net charge correlation strength and
observe strong dependence on the azimuthal angular range and pseudorapidity
widths integrated to measure the correlation.
