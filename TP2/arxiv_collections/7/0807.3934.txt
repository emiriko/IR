A construction of a robust family of compact inertial manifolds is presented.
The result aims to complete an analysis of certain types of attracting sets for
a class of dissipative infinite dimensional dynamical systems. Application to a
hyperbolically relaxed Chaffee-Infante reaction diffusion equation is also
discussed.
