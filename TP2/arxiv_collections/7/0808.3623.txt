We propose a general method to evaluate the material parameters for arbitrary
shape transformation media. By solving the original coordinates in the
transformed region via Laplace's equations, we can obtain the deformation field
numerically, in turn the material properties of the devices to be designed such
as cloaks, rotators or concentrators with arbitrary shape. Devices which have
non-fixed outer boundaries, such as beam guider, can also be designed by the
proposed method. Examples with full wave simulation are given for illustration.
In the end, wave velocity and energy change in the transformation media are
discussed with help of the deformation view.
