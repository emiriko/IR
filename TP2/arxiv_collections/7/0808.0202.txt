A power law degree distribution is established for a graph evolution model
based on the graph class of k-trees. This k-tree-based graph process can be
viewed as an idealized model that captures some characteristics of the
preferential attachment and copying mechanisms that existing evolving graph
processes fail to model due to technical obstacles. The result also serves as a
further cautionary note reinforcing the point of view that a power law degree
distribution should not be regarded as the only important characteristic of a
complex network, as has been previously argued.
