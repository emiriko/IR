The inert doublet model is an extension of the Standard Model of Elementary
Particles that is defined by the only addition of a second Higgs doublet
without couplings to quarks or leptons. This minimal framework has been studied
for many reasons. In particular, it has been suggested that the new degrees of
freedom contained in this doublet can account for the Dark Matter of the
Universe.
