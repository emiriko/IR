Molecular recognition, which is essential in processing information in
biological systems, takes place in a crowded noisy biochemical environment and
requires the recognition of a specific target within a background of various
similar competing molecules. We consider molecular recognition as a
transmission of information via a noisy channel and use this analogy to gain
insights on the optimal, or fittest, molecular recognizer. We focus on the
optimal structural properties of the molecules such as flexibility and
conformation. We show that conformational changes upon binding, which often
occur during molecular recognition, may optimize the detection performance of
the recognizer. We thus suggest a generic design principle termed
'conformational proofreading' in which deformation enhances detection. We
evaluate the optimal flexibility of the molecular recognizer, which is
analogous to the stochasticity in a decision unit. In some scenarios, a
flexible recognizer, i.e., a stochastic decision unit, performs better than a
rigid, deterministic one. As a biological example, we discuss conformational
changes during homologous recombination, the process of genetic exchange
between two DNA strands.
