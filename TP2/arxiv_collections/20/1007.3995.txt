IRAS04325+2402 (herafter IRAS04325) is a complex protostellar system hosting
two young stellar objects (AB and C in the following) at a separation of
1250AU. Here we present new deep Gemini imaging and spectroscopy for the system
covering the wavelength regime from 1-12mu as well as Sub-Millimeter Array
interferometry at 870mu, in combination with Spitzer and literature data.
Object AB is a low-mass star with a disk/envelope system and an outflow cavity,
which is prominently seen in infrared images. Object C, previously suspected to
be a brown dwarf, is likely a very low mass star, with an effective temperature
of ~3400K. It features an edge-on disk and an elongated envelope, and shows
strong indications for accretion and ejection activity. Both objects are likely
to drive parsec-scale molecular outflows. The two objects are embedded in an
isolated, dense molecular cloud core. High extinction, lack of X-ray emission,
and relatively high bolometric luminosity argue for a very young age below
1Myr. The disk/outflow systems of AB and C are misaligned by ~60deg against
each other and by 80 and 40deg against the orbital plane of the binary. The
system might be a good case for primordial misalignment, as opposed to
misalignment caused by dynamical interactions, because the outflow direction is
constant and the realignment timescale is likely larger than the system age.
This favours turbulent fragmentation, rather than rotational fragmentation, as
the formation scenario. We show that the spectral energy distributions and
images for the two objects can be reproduced with radiative transfer models for
disk/envelope systems. Our analysis provides reassurance in the established
paradigm for the structure and early evolution of YSOs, but stresses the
importance of developing 3D models with sophisticated dust chemistry
(abridged).
