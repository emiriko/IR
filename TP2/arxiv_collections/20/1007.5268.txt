Motivated by the observation in copper-oxide high-temperature
superconductors, we investigate the appearance of kinks in the electronic
dispersion due to coupling to phonons for a system with strong electronic
repulsion. We study a Hubbard model supplemented by an electron-phonon coupling
of Holstein type within Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) utilizing Numerical
Renormalization Group as impurity solver. Paramagnetic DMFT solutions in the
presence of large repulsion show a kink only for large values of the
electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ or large doping and, contrary to the
conventional electron-phonon theory, the position of such a kink can be shifted
to energies larger than the renormalized phonon frequency $\omega_0^r$. When
including antiferromagnetic correlations we find a stronger effect of the
electron-phonon interaction on the electronic dispersion due to a cooperative
effect and a visible kink at $\omega_0^r$, even for smaller $\lambda$. Our
results provide a scenario of a kink position increasing with doping, which
could be related to recent photoemission experiments on Bi-based cuprates.
