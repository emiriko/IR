We present a numerical study of the Blume-Capel model with quenched disorder
in 3D. The phase diagram is characterized by spin-glass/paramagnet phase
transitions of both first and second order in the thermodynamic sense.
Numerical simulations are performed using the Exchange-Monte Carlo algorithm,
providing clear evidence for inverse freezing. The main features at criticality
and in the phase coexistence region are investigated. The whole inverse
freezing transition appears to be first order. The second order transition
appears to be in the same universality class of the Edwards-Anderson model. The
nature of the spin-glass phase is analyzed by means of the finite size scaling
behavior of the overlap distribution functions and the four-spins real-space
correlation functions. Evidence for a replica symmetry breaking-like
organization of states is provided.
