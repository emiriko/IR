Under some mild assumptions, we study the state complexity of the trim
minimal automaton accepting the greedy representations of the multiples of m >=
2 for a wide class of linear numeration systems. As an example, the number of
states of the trim minimal automaton accepting the greedy representations of
the multiples of m in the Fibonacci system is exactly 2m^2.
