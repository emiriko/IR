We develop a model characterizing all possible knots and links arising from
recombination starting with a twist knot substrate, extending previous work of
Buck and Flapan. We show that all knot or link products fall into three
well-understood families of knots and links, and prove that given a positive
integer $n$, the number of product knots and links with minimal crossing number
equal to $n$ grows proportionally to $n^5$. In the (common) case of twist knot
substrates whose products have minimal crossing number one more than the
substrate, we prove that the types of products are tightly prescribed. Finally,
we give two simple examples to illustrate how this model can help determine
previously uncharacterized experimental data.
