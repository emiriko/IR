Two methods of refractometry in reflected light from optical surface of
samples are considered and studied experimentally. Methods are grounded on
results of Fresnel theory of concerning light reflectivity at near normal
incidence and Brewster angle. Sources of errors for both methods were
considered and possibility of measuring of the refractive index with
application of laser radiation with accuracy to within 4th sign was shown.
Advantages of described methods concerning requirements to preparation of
samples to refractive index measurement of solid, thin-film and absorbing
materials are scored.
