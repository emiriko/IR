Inspired by the work of Alday, Gaiotto and Tachikawa (AGT), we saw the
revival of Poincar{\'{e}}'s uniformization problem and Fuchsian equations
obtained thereof.
  Three distinguished aspects are possessed by Fuchsian equations. First, they
are available via imposing a classical Liouville limit on level-two null-vector
conditions. Second, they fall into some A_1-type integrable systems. Third, the
stress-tensor present there (in terms of the Q-form) manifests itself as a kind
of one-dimensional "curve".
  Thereby, a contact with the recently proposed Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit was
soon made on the one hand, whilst the seemingly mysterious derivation of
Seiberg-Witten prepotentials from integrable models become resolved on the
other hand. Moreover, AGT conjecture can just be regarded as a quantum version
of the previous Poincar{\'{e}}'s approach.
  Equipped with these observations, we examined relations between spheric and
toric (classical) conformal blocks via Calogero-Moser/Heun duality. Besides, as
Sutherland model is also obtainable from Calogero-Moser by pinching tori at one
point, we tried to understand its eigenstates from the viewpoint of toric
diagrams with possibly many surface operators (toric branes) inserted. A
picture called "bubbling pants" then emerged and reproduced well-known results
of the non-critical self-dual c=1 string theory under a "blown-down" limit.
