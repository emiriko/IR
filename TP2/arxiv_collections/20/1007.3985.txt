To explain the accelerating universe driven by dark energy, a so-called
"entropy-corrected new agegraphic dark energy" (ECNADE), was recently proposed
with the help of quantum corrections to the entropy-area relation in the
framework of loop quantum cosmology. Using this definition, we study its
thermodynamical features including entropy and energy conservation. We discuss
the thermodynamical interpretation of the interaction between ECNADE and dark
matter in a non-flat universe bounded by the apparent horizon. We obtain a
relation between the interaction term of the dark components and thermal
fluctuation.
