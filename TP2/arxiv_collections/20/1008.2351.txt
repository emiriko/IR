Let $V$ be a grading-restricted vertex algebra and $W$ a $V$-module. We show
that for any $m\in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$, the first cohomology $H^{1}_{m}(V, W)$ of
$V$ with coefficients in $W$ introduced by the author is linearly isomorphic to
the space of derivations from $V$ to $W$. In particular, $H^{1}_{m}(V, W)$ for
$m\in \mathbb{N}$ are equal (and can be denoted using the same notation
$H^{1}(V, W)$). We also show that the second cohomology $H^{2}_{\frac{1}{2}}(V,
W)$ of $V$ with coefficients in $W$ introduced by the author corresponds
bijectively to the set of equivalence classes of square-zero extensions of $V$
by $W$. In the case that $W=V$, we show that the second cohomology
$H^{2}_{\frac{1}{2}}(V, V)$ corresponds bijectively to the set of equivalence
classes of first order deformations of $V$.
