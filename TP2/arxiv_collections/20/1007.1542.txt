We have measured inclusive data on $K^+$-meson production in $pp$ collisions
at COSY J\"ulich close to the hyperon production threshold and determined the
hyperon-nucleon invariant mass spectra. The spectra were decomposed into three
parts: $\Lambda p$, $\Sigma^0p$ and $\Sigma^+n$. The cross section for the
$\Sigma^+n$ channel was found to be much smaller than a previous measurement in
that excess energy region. The data together with previous results at higher
energies are compatible with a phase space dependence.
