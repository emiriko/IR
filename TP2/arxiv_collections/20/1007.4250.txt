Employing higher order perturbation theory, we find a new class of charged
rotating black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with general
dilaton coupling constant. Starting from the Myers-Perry solutions, we use the
electric charge as the perturbative parameter, and focus on extremal black
holes with equal-magnitude angular momenta in odd dimensions. We perform the
perturbations up to 4th order for black holes in 5 dimensions and up to 3rd
order in higher odd dimensions. We calculate the physical properties of these
black holes and study their dependence on the charge and the dilaton coupling
constant.
