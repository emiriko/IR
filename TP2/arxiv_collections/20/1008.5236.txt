A cassette of uncured composite materials with an epoxy resin matrix was
exposed in the stratosphere (40 km altitude) over 3 days. Temperature
variations of -76...+32.50C and pressure up to 2.1 Torr were recorded during
flight. An analysis of the chemical structure of the composites showed, that
the polymer matrix exposed in the stratosphere becomes crosslinked, while the
ground control materials react by way of polycondensation reaction of epoxy
groups. The space irradiations are considered to be responsible for
crosslinking of the uncured polymers exposed in the stratosphere. The
composites were cured on Earth after landing. Analysis of the cured composites
showed, that the polymer matrix remains active under stratospheric conditions.
The results can be used for predicting curing processes of polymer composite in
a free space environment during an orbital space flight.
