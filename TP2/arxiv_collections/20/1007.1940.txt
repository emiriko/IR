We investigate the behavior of vortices of multi-component superconductivity,
realized in $\rm{MgB_2}$ and Fe-based superconductors, within the framework of
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory in terms of numerical calculations of the
time-dependent GL equations and the variational method. It is revealed that
close to the critical point of the composite system the inter-component
coupling makes the system behave as a single component superconductivity in
most cases. However, when the bare mean-field critical points of the two
components coincide with each other, and furthermore the inter-band coupling
disappears at the same temperature, interesting phenomena occur as follows.
Vortices interact attractively at large separation and repulsively at short
distance in certain parameter space. Because of the non-monotonic interaction
profile, phase separations between vortex clusters of triangular order and the
Meissner state take place, which indicates a first-order phase transition
associated with the penetration of the magnetic field into a superconductor
sample. Phase diagrams of vortex states are then constructed with the
associated magnetization curve. It is found that all these behavior
interpolates the features of the type I and II superconductors.
