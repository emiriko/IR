The interplay between magnetism and superconductivity has been a central
issue in unconventional superconductors. While the dynamic magnetism could be
the source of electron pairing, the static magnetism is generally believed to
compete with superconductivity. In this sense, the observation of Q phase, the
coupled spin-density wave order and superconductivity, in the heavy-fermion
superconductor CeCoIn5 is very puzzling. Whether this Q phase origins from the
novel Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state is under hot debate. Here we report
the resistivity and thermal conductivity study of a newly discovered
heavy-fermion superconductor Ce2PdIn8 down to 50 mK. We find an unusual
field-induced quantum critical point at the upper critical field Hc2 and
unconventional nodal superconductivity in Ce2PdIn8. The jump of thermal
conductivity k(H)/T near Hc2 suggests a first-order-like phase transition at
low temperatures. These results mimic the features of the Q phase in CeCoIn5,
implying that Ce2PdIn8 is another promising compound to investigate the exotic
Q phase and FFLO state. The comparison between CeCoIn5 and Ce2PdIn8 may help to
clarify the origin of the Q phase.
