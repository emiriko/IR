We present trigonometric parallaxes of 64 stellar systems with proper motions
between 0\farcs5 yr$^{-1}$ and 1\farcs0 yr$^{-1}$ from the ongoing RECONS
(Research Consortium On Nearby Stars) parallax program at CTIO (the Cerro
Tololo Interamerican Observatory). All of the systems are south of DEC $= +30$,
and 58 had no previous trigonometric parallaxes. In addition to parallaxes for
the systems, we present proper motions, Johnson-Kron-Cousins $VRI$ photometry,
variability measurements, and spectral types. Nine of the systems are multiple;
we present results for their components, three of which are new astrometric
detections. Of the 64 systems, 56 are within 25 parsecs of the Sun and 52 of
those are in the southern hemisphere, comprising 5.7\% of the total number of
known southern 25 parsec systems.
