Possibility of observing associated production of charged Higgs and W boson
in the framework of MSSM at LHC is studied. Both leptonic and hadronic decays
of W boson are studied while the charged Higgs boson is considered to decay to
a $\tau$ lepton and a neutrino. Therefore two search categories are defined
based on the leptonic and hadronic final states, i.e. $\ell \tau+E^{miss}_{T}$
and $jj \tau+E^{miss}_{T}$ where $\ell=e$ or $\mu$ and $j$ is a light jet from
$W$ decay. The discovery chance of the two categories is evaluated at an
integrated luminosity of 300 \invfb at LHC. It is shown that both leptonic and
hadronic final states have the chance of discovery at high \tanb. Finally
$5\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ contours are provided for both search categories.
