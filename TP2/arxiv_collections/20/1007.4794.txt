This article reports the first optical frequency measurement of the
$1\mathrm{S}-3\mathrm{S}$ transition in hydrogen. The excitation of this
transition occurs at a wavelength of 205 nm which is obtained with two
frequency doubling stages of a titanium sapphire laser at 820 nm. Its frequency
is measured with an optical frequency comb. The second-order Doppler effect is
evaluated from the observation of the motional Stark effect due to a transverse
magnetic field perpendicular to the atomic beam. The measured value of the
$1\mathrm{S}_{1/2}(F=1)-3\mathrm{S}_{1/2}(F=1)$ frequency splitting is $2 922
742 936.729 (13) \mathrm{MHz}$ with a relative uncertainty of
$4.5\times10^{-12}$. After the measurement of the $1\mathrm{S}-2\mathrm{S}$
frequency, this result is the most precise of the optical frequencies in
hydrogen.
