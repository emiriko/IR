The 3+1 formalism of Thorne, Price and Macdonald has been used to derive the
linear two-fluid equations describing transverse and longitudinal waves
propagating in the two-fluid ideal collisionless plasmas surrounding a
Schwarzschild black hole. The plasma is assumed to be falling in radial
direction toward the event horizon. The relativistic two-fluid equations have
been reformulate, in analogy with the special relativistic formulation as
explained in an earlier paper, to take account of relativistic effects due to
the event horizon. Here a WKB approximation is used to derive the local
dispersion relation for these waves and solved numerically for the wave number
k.
