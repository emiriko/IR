A benchmark CP-violating supersymmetric scenario (known as 'CPX-scenario' in
the literature) is studied in the context of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
It is shown that the LHC, with low to moderate accumulated luminosity, will be
able to probe the existing `hole' in the $m_{h_1}$-$\tan\beta$ plane, which
cannot be ruled out by the LEP data. We explore the parameter space with
cascade decay of third generation squarks and gluino with CP-violating decay
branching fractions. We propose a multi-channel analysis to probe this
parameter space some of which are background free at an integrated luminosity
of 5-10 fb$^{-1}$. Specially, multi-lepton final states ($3\l,\, 4\l$ and like
sign di-lepton) are almost background free and have $5\sigma$ reach for the
corresponding signals with very early data of LHC for both 14 TeV and 7 TeV
center of mass energy.
