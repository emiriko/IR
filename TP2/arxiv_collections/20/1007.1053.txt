We discuss the matching of the quark model to the effective mass operator of
the 1/Nc expansion using the permutation group S_N. As an illustration of the
general procedure we perform the matching of the Isgur-Karl model for the
spectrum of the negative parity L=1 excited baryons. Assuming the most general
two-body quark Hamiltonian, we derive two correlations among the masses and
mixing angles of these states which should hold in any quark model. These
correlations constrain the mixing angles and can be used to test for the
presence of three-body quark forces.
