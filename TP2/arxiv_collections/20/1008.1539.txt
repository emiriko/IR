By employing a mapping to classical anharmonic oscillators, we explore a
class of solutions to the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) in 1+1
dimensions and, by extension, asymptotically in general dimensions. We discuss
a possible way for creating approximate rogue wave like solutions to the NLSE
by truncating exact solutions at their nodes and stitching them with other
solutions to the NLSE. The resulting waves are similar to compactons with the
notable difference that they are not localized but rather extend over all of
space. We discuss rogue waves in a \phi^4 field theory in the context of a
discretized Lagrangian and rogue wave behavior is shown to evolve into a steady
state. Due to time-reversal invariance of this theory, the steady state found
could alternatively evolve into a rogue wave giving rise to a large wave which
seems to appear from nothing.
