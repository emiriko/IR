Masses of 56,57Fe, 53Co^m, 53,56Co, 55,56,57Ni, 57,58Cu, and 59,60Zn have
been determined with the JYFLTRAP Penning trap mass spectrometer at IGISOL with
a precision of dm/m \le 3 x 10^{-8}. The QEC values for 53Co, 55Ni, 56Ni, 57Cu,
58Cu, and 59Zn have been measured directly with a typical precision of better
than 0.7 keV and Coulomb displacement energies have been determined. The Q
values for proton captures on 55Co, 56Ni, 58Cu, and 59Cu have been measured
directly. The precision of the proton-capture Q value for 56Ni(p,gamma)57Cu,
Q(p,gamma) = 689.69(51) keV, crucial for astrophysical rp-process calculations,
has been improved by a factor of 37. The excitation energy of the proton
emitting spin-gap isomer 53Co^m has been measured precisely, Ex = 3174.3(10)
keV, and a Coulomb energy difference of 133.9(10) keV for the 19/2- state has
been obtained. Except for 53Co, the mass values have been adjusted within a
network of 17 frequency ratio measurements between 13 nuclides which allowed
also a determination of the reference masses 55Co, 58Ni, and 59Cu.
