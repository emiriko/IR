Nonlinear systems can be probed by driving them with two or more pure tones
while measuring the intermodulation products of the drive tones in the
response. We describe a digital lock-in analyzer which is designed explicitly
for this purpose. The analyzer is implemented on a field-programmable gate
array, providing speed in analysis, real-time feedback and stability in
operation. The use of the analyzer is demonstrated for Intermodulation Atomic
Force Microscopy. A generalization of the intermodulation spectral technique to
arbitrary drive waveforms is discussed.
