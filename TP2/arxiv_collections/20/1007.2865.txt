A comprehensive decay scheme of $^{93}$Nb below 2 MeV has been constructed
from information obtained with the $^{93}$Nb(n,n$^\prime$$\gamma$) and
$^{94}$Zr(p,2n$\gamma$$\gamma$)$^{93}$Nb reactions. Branching ratios,
lifetimes, transition multipolarities and spin assignments have been
determined. From $M1$ and $E2$ strengths, fermionic-bosonic excitations of
isoscalar and isovector character have been identified from the weak coupling
$\pi1g_{9/2}$$\otimes$$^{92}_{40}$Zr and
$\pi2p_{1/2}^{-1}$$\otimes$$^{94}_{42}$Mo configurations. A microscopic
interpretation of such excitations is attained from shell-model calculations
using low-momentum effective interactions.
