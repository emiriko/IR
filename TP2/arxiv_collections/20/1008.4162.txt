We present an algorithm that prepares thermal Gibbs states of one dimensional
quantum systems on a quantum computer without any memory overhead, and in a
time significantly shorter than other known alternatives. Specifically, the
time complexity is dominated by the quantity $N^{\|h\|/ T}$, where $N$ is the
size of the system, $\|h\|$ is a bound on the operator norm of the local terms
of the Hamiltonian (coupling energy), and $T$ is the temperature. Given other
results on the complexity of thermalization, this overall scaling is likely
optimal. For higher dimensions, our algorithm lowers the known scaling of the
time complexity with the dimension of the system by one.
