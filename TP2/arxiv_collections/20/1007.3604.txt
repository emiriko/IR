We study the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular set function subject
to linear packing constraints. An instance of this problem consists of a matrix
$A \in [0,1]^{m \times n}$, a vector $b \in [1,\infty)^m$, and a monotone
submodular set function $f: 2^{[n]} \rightarrow \bbR_+$. The objective is to
find a set $S$ that maximizes $f(S)$ subject to $A x_{S} \leq b$, where $x_S$
stands for the characteristic vector of the set $S$. A well-studied special
case of this problem is when $f$ is linear. This special case captures the
class of packing integer programs.
  Our main contribution is an efficient combinatorial algorithm that achieves
an approximation ratio of $\Omega(1 / m^{1/W})$, where $W = \min\{b_i / A_{ij}
: A_{ij} > 0\}$ is the width of the packing constraints. This result matches
the best known performance guarantee for the linear case. One immediate
corollary of this result is that the algorithm under consideration achieves
constant factor approximation when the number of constraints is constant or
when the width of the constraints is sufficiently large. This motivates us to
study the large width setting, trying to determine its exact approximability.
We develop an algorithm that has an approximation ratio of $(1 - \epsilon)(1 -
1/e)$ when $W = \Omega(\ln m / \epsilon^2)$. This result essentially matches
the theoretical lower bound of $1 - 1/e$. We also study the special setting in
which the matrix $A$ is binary and $k$-column sparse. A $k$-column sparse
matrix has at most $k$ non-zero entries in each of its column. We design a fast
combinatorial algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of $\Omega(1 /
(Wk^{1/W}))$, that is, its performance guarantee only depends on the sparsity
and width parameters.
