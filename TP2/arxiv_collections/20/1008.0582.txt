We present the discovery of nonradial pulsations in five hot subdwarf B (sdB)
stars based on 27 days of nearly continuous time-series photometry using the
Kepler spacecraft. We find that every sdB star cooler than $\approx 27\,500\,$K
that Kepler has observed (seven so far) is a long-period pulsator of the
V1093~Her (PG~1716) class or a hybrid star with both short and long periods.
The apparently non-binary long-period and hybrid pulsators are described here.
  The V1093~Her periods range from one to 4.5~h and are associated with
$g-$mode pulsations. Three stars also exhibit short periods indicative of
$p-$modes with periods of 2 to 5~m and in addition, these stars exhibit
periodicities between both classes from 15 to 45~m. We detect the coolest and
longest-period V1093~Her-type pulsator to date, KIC010670103 ($T_eff\approx
20\,900\,$K, $P_max\approx 4.5$~h) as well as a suspected hybrid pulsator,
KIC002697388 which is extremely cool ($T_{\rm eff}\approx 23\,900\,$K) and for
the first time hybrid pulsators which have larger $g-$mode amplitudes than
$p-$mode ones. All of these pulsators are quite rich with many frequencies and
we are able to apply asymptotic relationships to associate periodicities with
modes for KIC010670103. Kepler data are particularly well-suited for these
studies as they are long-duration, extremely high duty cycle observations with
well-behaved noise properties.
