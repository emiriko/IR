Neutrino oscillations in the presence of Lorentz violation can present novel
observable signals in both long- and short-baseline experiments. In this talk
we describe the theory and its different regimes depending on properties of the
experiments. CPT violation, its systematic search and possible connections to
latest results are also presented.
