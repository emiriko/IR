Here we numerically study a model of excitable media, namely, a network with
occasionally quiet nodes and connection weights that vary with activity on a
short-time scale. Even in the absence of stimuli, this exhibits unstable
dynamics, nonequilibrium phases -including one in which the global activity
wanders irregularly among attractors- and 1/f noise while the system falls into
the most irregular behavior. A net result is resilience which results in an
efficient search in the model attractors space that can explain the origin of
certain phenomenology in neural, genetic and ill-condensed matter systems. By
extensive computer simulation we also address a relation previously conjectured
between observed power-law distributions and the occurrence of a "critical
state" during functionality of (e.g.) cortical networks, and describe the
precise nature of such criticality in the model.
