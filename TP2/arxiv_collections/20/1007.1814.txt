Measurements of Quantum Systems disturb their states. To quantify this
non-classical characteristic, Zurek and Ollivier introduced the quantum
discord, a quantum correlation which can be nonzero even when entanglement in
the system is zero. Discord has aroused great interest as a resource that is
more robust against the effects of decoherence and offers exponential speed up
of certain computational algorithms. Here, we study general two-level bipartite
systems and give general results on the relationship between discord,
entanglement, and linear entropy, and identify the states for which discord
takes a maximal value for a given entropy or entanglement, thus placing strong
bounds on entanglement-discord and entropy-discord relations. We find out that
although discord and entanglement are identical for pure states, they differ
when generalized to mixed states as a result of the difference in the method of
generalization.
