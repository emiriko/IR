We investigate radio-mode AGN activity among post-starburst galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey to determine whether AGN feedback may be responsible
for the cessation of star formation. Based on radio morphology and
radio-loudness from the FIRST and NVSS data, we separate objects with radio
activity due to an AGN from ongoing residual star formation. Of 513 SDSS
galaxies with strong A-star spectra, 12 objects have 21-cm flux density above 1
mJy. These galaxies do not show optical AGN emission lines. Considering that
the lifetime of radio emission is much shorter than the typical time-scale of
the spectroscopic features of post-starburst galaxies, we conclude that the
radio-emitting AGN activity in these objects was triggered after the end of the
recent starburst, and thus cannot be an important feedback process to explain
the post-starburst phase. The radio luminosities show a positive correlation
with total galaxy stellar mass, but not with the mass of recently formed stars.
Thus the mechanical power of AGN feedback derived from the radio luminosity is
related to old stellar populations dominating the stellar mass, which in turn
are related to the masses of central supermassive black holes.
