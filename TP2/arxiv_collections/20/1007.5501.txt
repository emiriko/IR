We give a bijection between binary quartic forms and quartic rings with a
monogenic cubic resolvent ring, relating the rings associated to binary quartic
forms with Bhargava's cubic resolvent rings. This gives a parametrization of
quartic rings with monogenic cubic resolvents. We also give a geometric
interpretation of this parametrization.
