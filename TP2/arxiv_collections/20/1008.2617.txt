This is the second of two papers devoted to the perturbative computation of
the ghost and gluon propagators in SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory. Such a
computation should enable a comparison with results from lattice simulations in
order to reveal the genuinely non-perturbative content of the latter. The gluon
propagator is computed by means of Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory:
results range from two up to four loops, depending on the different lattice
sizes. The non-logarithmic constants for one, two and three loops are
extrapolated to the lattice spacing $a \to 0$ continuum and infinite volume $V
\to \infty$ limits.
