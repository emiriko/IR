We present the highest redshift detections of resolved Lyman alpha emission,
using Hubble Space Telescope/ACS F658N narrowband-imaging data taken in
parallel with the Wide Field Camera 3 Early Release Science program in the
GOODS CDF-S. We detect Lyman alpha emission from three spectroscopically
confirmed z = 4.4 Lyman alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs), more than doubling the
sample of LAEs with resolved Lyman alpha emission. Comparing the light
distribution between the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum and narrowband
images, we investigate the escape of Lyman alpha photons at high redshift.
While our data do not support a positional offset between the Lyman alpha and
rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum emission, the half-light radii in two out
of the three galaxies are significantly larger in Lyman alpha than in the
rest-frame UV continuum. This result is confirmed when comparing object sizes
in a stack of all objects in both bands. Additionally, the narrowband flux
detected with HST is significantly less than observed in similar filters from
the ground. These results together imply that the Lyman alpha emission is not
strictly confined to its indigenous star-forming regions. Rather, the Lyman
alpha emission is more extended, with the missing HST flux likely existing in a
diffuse outer halo. This suggests that the radiative transfer of Lyman alpha
photons in high-redshift LAEs is complicated, with the interstellar-medium
geometry and/or outflows playing a significant role in galaxies at these
redshifts.
