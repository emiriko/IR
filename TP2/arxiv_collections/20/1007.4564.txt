We present the first high spectral resolution observations of Orion KL in the
frequency ranges 1573.4 - 1702.8 GHz (band 6b) and 1788.4 - 1906.8 GHz (band
7b) obtained using the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory.
We characterize the main emission lines found in the spectrum, which primarily
arise from a range of components associated with Orion KL including the hot
core, but also see widespread emission from components associated with
molecular outflows traced by H2O, SO2, and OH. We find that the density of
observed emission lines is significantly diminished in these bands compared to
lower frequency Herschel/HIFI bands.
