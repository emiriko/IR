We uncover a new kind of entropic long range order in finite dimensional spin
glasses. We study the link-diluted version of the Edwards-Anderson spin glass
model with bimodal couplings (J=+/-1) on a 3D lattice. By using exact reduction
algorithms, we prove that there exists a region of the phase diagram (at zero
temperature and link density low enough), where spins are long range
correlated, even if the ground states energy stiffness is null. In other words,
in this region twisting the boundary conditions cost no energy, but spins are
long range correlated by means of pure entropic effects.
