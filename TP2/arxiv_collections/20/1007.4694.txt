The study of total ozone columns above Kiev and variations of ozone
concentrations in the troposphere at different altitudes above Kiev was carried
out using ground-based Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometric
observations that are taken on a routine basis at the Main Astronomical
Observatory of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (MAO NASU). This
study was performed within the framework of the international ESA-NIVR-KNMI
OMI-AO project no.2907 entitled OMI validation by ground-based remote sensing:
ozone columns and atmospheric profiles during the time frame 2005-2008. The
infrared FTIR spectral observations of direct solar radiation in the wavelength
range of 2-12 micron as transmitted through the Earth's atmosphere were
performed during the months of April-October of each year. The aim of the
project was the validation of total ozone columns and vertical ozone profiles
as obtained by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)) onboard of the NASA
EOS-Aura scientific satellite platform. The modeling of the ozone spectral band
shape near 9.6 microns was performing with the MODTRAN code and a molecular
band model based on the HITRAN-2004 molecular database. The a-priori
information for the spectral modeling consisted of water vapor and temperature
profiles from the NASA EOS-Aqua-AIRS satellite instrument, stratospheric ozone
profiles from the NASA EOS-Aura-MLS satellite instrument, TEMIS-KNMI
climatological ozone profiles and surface ozone concentration measurements
performed at the specific times of infrared spectra observations. The
troposphere ozone variability was analyzed for two typical episodes: the spring
episode of enhanced total ozone columns and the summer episode of enhanced
surface ozone concentrations.
