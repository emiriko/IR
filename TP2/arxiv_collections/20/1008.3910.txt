We propose a compact atom interferometry scheme for measuring weak,
time-dependent accelerations. Our proposal uses an ensemble of dilute trapped
bosons with two internal states that couple to a synthetic gauge field with
opposite charges. The trapped gauge field couples spin to momentum to allow
time dependent accelerations to be continuously imparted on the internal
states. We generalize this system to reduce noise and estimate the sensitivity
of such a system to be S~10^-7 m / s^2 / Hz^1/2.
