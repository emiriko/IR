Polarized neutron inelastic scattering has been used to measure spin
excitations in ferromagnetic La$_{0.82}$Sr$_{0.18}$CoO$_{3}$. The magnon
spectrum of these spin excitations is well defined at low energies but becomes
heavily damped at higher energies, and can be modeled using a quadratic
dispersion. We determined a spin wave stiffness constant of $D=94\pm
3$\,meV\,\AA$^{2}$. Assuming a nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model we find
reasonable agreement between the exchange determined from D and the bulk Curie
temperature. Several possible mechanisms to account for the observed spin-wave
damping are discussed.
