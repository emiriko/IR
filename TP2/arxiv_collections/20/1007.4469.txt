We give a quantum deformation of the chiral super Minkowski space in four
dimensions as the big cell inside a quantum super Grassmannian. The
quantization is performed in such way that the actions of the Poincar\'e and
conformal quantum supergroups on the quantum Minkowski and quantum conformal
superspaces are presented.
