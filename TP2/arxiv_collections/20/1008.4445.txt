We propose a gauged $U(1)_{H}$ horizontal symmetry around TeV scale that is a
subgroup of a $SU(3)_{H}$ horizontal gauge symmetry broken at ${\cal
O}(10^{14}) \GeV$. The breaking generates right-handed Majorana neutrino masses
through a $SU(3)_H$ sextet scalar. A particular Majorana right-handed neutrino
mass matrix explicitly determines the remnant $U(1)_{H}$ at low energy which
only couples to $b-s$ and $\mu-\tau$ in the gauge eigenstate. The dangerous
$K-\bar{K}$, $D-\bar{D}$ mixing and $B_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ are kept to
be safe because the relevant couplings are suppressed through high powers of
small mixing angles in the fermion rotation matrix. Our analysis which applies
to the general case shows that the Tevatron di-muon anomaly can be explained
through the $B_{s}$ and $B_{d}$ mixing while keeping all the other experimental
constraints within 90 \% C. L. For the $B$ meson decay, the $B_{s}\to
\mu^{\pm}\tau^{\mp}$ is the leading leptonic decay channel which is several
orders of magnitude below current experimental bound.
