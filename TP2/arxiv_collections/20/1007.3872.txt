We analyze the CoRoT and V-passband ground-based light curves of the
interacting close binary AU Mon, assuming that there is a geometrically and
optically thick accretion disk around the hotter and more massive star, as
inferred from photometric and spectroscopic characteristics of the binary. Our
model fits the observations very well and provides estimates for the orbital
elements and physical parameters of the components and of the accretion disk.
