X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) along with differential thermal analysis (DTA)
carried out on the as-quenched samples in the 3BaO-3TiO2-B2O3 system confirmed
their amorphous and glassy nature, respectively. The dielectric constants in
the 1 kHz-1 MHz frequency range were measured as a function of temperature
(323-748 K). The dielectric constant and loss were found to be frequency
independent in the 323-473 K temperature range. The dielectric behavior was
consistent with the universal dielectric response (UDR). The temperature
coefficient of dielectric constant was estimated using Havinga's formula and
found to be 16 ppm.K-1. The electrical relaxation was rationalized using the
electric modulus formalism. The dielectric constant and loss were 17 \pm 0.5
and 0.005 \pm 0.001, respectively at 323 K in the 1 kHz-1 MHz frequency range
which may be of considerable interest to capacitor industry.
