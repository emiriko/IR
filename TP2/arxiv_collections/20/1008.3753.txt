Some magnetic aspects of QCD are discussed at finite density and temperature.
Possibility of spontaneous magnetization is studied within Landau Fermi-liquid
theory, and the important roles of the screening effects for gluon propagation
are elucidated. Static screening for the longitudinal gluons improves the
infrared singularities, while the transverse gluons receive only dynamic
screening. The latter property gives rise to a novel non-Fermi-liquid behaviour
for the magnetic susceptibility. Appearance of a density-wave state is also
discussed in relation to chiral transition, where pseudoscalar condensate as
well as scalar one takes a spatially non-uniform form in a chirally invariant
way. Accordingly magnetization of quark matter oscillates like spin density
wave. A hadron-quark continuity is suggested in this aspect, remembering pion
condensation in hadronic phase.
