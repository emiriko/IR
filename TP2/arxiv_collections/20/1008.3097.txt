We give a survey of various rigidity results involving scalar curvature. Many
of these results are inspired by the positive mass theorem in general
relativity. In particular, we discuss the recent solution of Min-Oo's
Conjecture for the hemisphere (cf. [13]). We also analyze the case of equality
in Bray's volume comparison theorem.
