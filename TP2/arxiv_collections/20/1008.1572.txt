Khabibullin's conjecture deals with two linear integral inequalities for some
non-negative continuous function $q(t)$. The integral in the first of these two
inequalities converts $q(t)$ into another function of one variable $g(t)$. This
integral yields the direct conversion formula. An inverse conversion formula
means a formula expressing $q(t)$ back through $g(t)$. Such an inverse
conversion formula is derived.
