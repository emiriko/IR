We present diffraction data on a single-layered manganite
La(0.42)Sr(1.58)MnO4 with hole doping (x>0.5). Overdoped La(0.42)Sr(1.58)MnO4
exhibits a complex ordering of charges, orbitals and spins. Single crystal
neutron diffraction experiments reveal three incommensurate and one
commensurate order parameters to be tightly coupled. The position and the shape
of the distinct superstructure scattering points to a stripe arrangement in
which ferromagnetic zigzag chains are disrupted by additional Mn4+ stripes.
