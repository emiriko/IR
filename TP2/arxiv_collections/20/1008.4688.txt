We consider a model of chiral phase transitions in nuclei, suggested by T.D.
Lee et al., and argue that such transitions may be seen in cumulative effect
investigations. Finite-range effects arising from the smallness of the system
are briefly discussed. Some general proposals for future NICA and CBM
experiments are given.
