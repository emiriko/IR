The dynamic response of InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) to strain
is studied experimentally by periodically modulating the QDs with a surface
acoustic wave and measuring the QD fluorescence with photoluminescence and
resonant spectroscopy. When the acoustic frequency is larger than the QD
linewidth, we resolve phonon sidebands in the QD fluorescence spectrum. Using a
resonant pump laser, we have demonstrated optical frequency conversion via the
dynamically modulated QD, which is the physical mechanism underlying laser
sideband cooling a nanomechanical resonator by means of an embedded QD.
