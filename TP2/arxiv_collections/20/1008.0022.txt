The collective dynamics of a network of coupled excitable systems in response
to an external stimulus depends on the topology of the connections in the
network. Here we develop a general theoretical approach to study the effects of
network topology on dynamic range, which quantifies the range of stimulus
intensities resulting in distinguishable network responses. We find that the
largest eigenvalue of the weighted network adjacency matrix governs the network
dynamic range. Specifically, a largest eigenvalue equal to one corresponds to a
critical regime with maximum dynamic range. We gain deeper insight on the
effects of network topology using a nonlinear analysis in terms of additional
spectral properties of the adjacency matrix. We find that homogeneous networks
can reach a higher dynamic range than those with heterogeneous topology. Our
analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, generalizes previous studies in
terms of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix.
