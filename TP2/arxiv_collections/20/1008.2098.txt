We investigate the quantum kinetic approach to pair production from vacuum by
time-dependent electric field. Equivalence between this approach and the more
familiar S-matrix approach is explicitly established for both scalar and
fermion cases. For the particular case of a constant electric field exact
solution for kinetic equations is provided and the accuracy of low-density
approximation is estimated.
