I show that observations of quantum nonlocality can be interpreted as purely
local phenomena, provided one assumes that the cosmos is a multiverse.
Conversely, the observation of quantum nonlocality can be interpreted as
observation evidence for a multiverse cosmology, just as observation of the
setting of the Sun can be interpreted as evidence for the Earth's rotation.
