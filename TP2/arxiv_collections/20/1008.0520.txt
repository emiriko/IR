We prove that $D\geq 5$ dimensional stationary, non-static near horizon
geometries with (D-3) rotational symmetries subject to the vacuum Einstein
equations including a cosmological constant cannot have toroidal horizon
topology. In D=4 dimensions the same result is obtained under the assumption of
a non-negative cosmological constant.
