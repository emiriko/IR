VERSA provides a general-purpose framework for defining and recognizing
events in live or recorded surveillance video streams. The approach for event
recognition in VERSA is using a declarative logic language to define the
spatial and temporal relationships that characterize a given event or activity.
Doing so requires the definition of certain fundamental spatial and temporal
relationships and a high-level syntax for specifying frame templates and query
parameters. Although the handling of uncertainty in the current VERSA
implementation is simplistic, the language and architecture is amenable to
extending using Fuzzy Logic or similar approaches. VERSA's high-level
architecture is designed to work in XML-based, services- oriented environments.
VERSA can be thought of as subscribing to the XML annotations streamed by a
lower-level video analytics service that provides basic entity detection,
labeling, and tracking. One or many VERSA Event Monitors could thus analyze
video streams and provide alerts when certain events are detected.
