We present experimental results on the crosstalk between two AC-operated
dispersive bifurcation detectors, implemented in a circuit for high-fidelity
readout of two strongly coupled flux qubits. Both phase-dependent and
phase-independent contributions to the crosstalk are analyzed. For proper
tuning of the phase the measured crosstalk is 0.1 % and the correlation between
the measurement outcomes is less than 0.05 %. These results show that
bifurcative readout provides a reliable and generic approach for multi-partite
correlation experiments.
