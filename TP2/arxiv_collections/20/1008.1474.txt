Spin noise spectroscopy (SNS) is the perfect tool to investigate electron
spin dynamics in semiconductors at thermal equilibrium. We simulate SNS
measurements and show that ultrafast digitizers with low bit depth enable
sensitive, high bandwidth SNS in the presence of strong optical background shot
noise. The simulations reveal that optimized input load at the digitizer is
crucial for efficient spin noise detection while the bit depth influences the
sensitivity rather weakly.
