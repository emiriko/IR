We study in detail the properties of gravitationally-bounded multi-state
configurations, made of spin-zero bosons, in the Newtonian regime. We show that
the properties of such configurations, in particular their stability, depend
upon how the particles are distributed in the different states they are
composed of. Numerical techniques are used to distinguish between stable and
unstable solutions, and to determine the final configurations they evolve
towards to. Multi-state equilibrium configurations can be used as models of
galactic halos made of scalar field dark matter, whose rotation curves appear
more realistic than in the case of single-state configurations.
