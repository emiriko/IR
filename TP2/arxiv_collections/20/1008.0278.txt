We develop a simple 1D model for the scattering of an incoming particle
hitting the surface of mica crystal, the transmission of energy through the
crystal by a localized mode, and the ejection of atom(s) at the incident or
distant face. This is the first attempt to model the experiment described in
Russell and Eilbeck in 2007 (EPL, v. 78, 10004). Although very basic, the model
shows many interesting features, for example a complicated energy dependent
transition between breather modes and a kink mode, and multiple ejections at
both incoming and distant surfaces. In addition, the effect of a heavier
surface layer is modelled, which can lead to internal reflections of breathers
or kinks at the crystal surface.
