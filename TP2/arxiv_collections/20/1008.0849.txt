We study theoretically a strongly type-II s-wave superconducting state of
two-dimensional Dirac fermions in proximity to a ferromagnet having in-plane
magnetization. It is shown that a magnetic domain wall can host a chain of
equally spaced vortices in the superconducting order parameter, each of which
binds a Majorana fermion state. The overlap integral of neighboring Majorana
states is sensitive to the position of the chemical potential of the Dirac
fermions. This leads to a characteristic V-shaped dependence of thermal
conductivity of Majorana fermions on the chemical potential.
