We discuss an implementation of Quantum Zeno Dynamics in a Cavity Quantum
Electrodynamics experiment. By performing repeated unitary operations on atoms
coupled to the field, we restrict the field evolution in chosen subspaces of
the total Hilbert space. This procedure leads to promising methods for
tailoring non-classical states. We propose to realize `tweezers' picking a
coherent field at a point in phase space and moving it towards an arbitrary
final position without affecting other non-overlapping coherent components.
These effects could be observed with a state-of-the-art apparatus.
