The Dirac delta function and the Feynman propagator of the harmonic
oscillator are found by a simple calculation using Fock Bargmann space and the
generating function of the harmonic oscillator. With help of the Schwinger
generating function of Wigner's D-matrix elements we derive the generating
function of spherical harmonics, the quadratic transformations and the
generating functions of: the characters of SU (2), Legendre and Gegenbauer
polynomials. We also deduce the van der Wearden invariant of 3-j symbols of SU
(2). Using the Fock Bargmann space and its complex conjugate we find the
integral representations of 3j symbols, function of the series, and from the
properties of we deduce a set of generalized hypergeometric functions of SU (2)
and from Euler's identity we find Regge symmetry. We find also the integral
representation of the 6j symbols. We find the generating function and a new
expression of the 3j symbols for SU (3) multiplicity free. Our formula of SU
(3) is a product of a constant, 3j symbols of SU (2) by . The calculations in
this work require only the Gauss integral, well known to undergraduates.
