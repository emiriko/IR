In this paper we extend the hydrodynamic results of [1] and study,
analytically, the propagation of Bogoliubov phonons on top of Bose-Einstein
condensates with step-like discontinuities by taking into account dispersion
effects. We focus on the Hawking signal in the density-density correlations in
the formation of acoustic black hole-like configurations.
