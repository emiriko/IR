Improving software process to achieve high quality in a software development
organization is the key factor to success. Bangladeshi software firms have not
experienced much in this particular area in comparison to other countries. The
ISO 9001 and CMM standard has become a basic part of software development. The
main objectives of our study are: 1) To understand the software development
process uses by the software developer firms in Bangladesh 2) To identify the
development practices based on established quality standard and 3) To establish
a standardized and coherent process for the development of software for a
specific project. It is revealed from this research that software industries of
Bangladesh are lacking in target set for software process and improvement,
involvement of quality control activities, and standardize business expertise
practice. This paper investigates the Bangladeshi software industry in the
light of the above challenges.
