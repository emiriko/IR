We re-formulate the 3+1 GRMHD equations for the Schwarzschild black hole in a
Veselago medium. Linear perturbation in rotating (non-magnetized and
magnetized) plasma is introduced and their Fourier analysis is considered. We
discuss wave properties with the help of wave vector, refractive index and
change in refractive index in the form of graphs. It is concluded that some
waves move away from the event horizon in this unusual medium. We conclude that
for the rotating non-magnetized plasma, our results confirm the presence of
Veselago medium while the rotating magnetized plasma does not provide any
evidence for this medium.
