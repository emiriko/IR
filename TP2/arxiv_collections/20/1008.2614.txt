We investigate numerically whether the chiral symmetry is the sole factor
dominating the criticality of the quantum Hall transitions in disordered
graphene. When the disorder respects the chiral symmetry, the
plateau-to-plateau transition at the $n=0$ Landau level is shown to become
anomalous (i.e., step-function-like). Surprisingly, however, the anomaly is
robust against the inclusion of the uniform next-nearest neighbor hopping,
which degrades the chiral symmetry of the lattice models. We have also shown
that the ac (optical) Hall conductivity exhibits a robust plateau structure
when the disorder respects the chiral symmetry.
