In a recent paper [Phys.Rev.B 81, 224518 (2010)], C. Kurter et al, analyzed
the effect of strong self-heating in large-area
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) mesa structures. They conclude
that $dI/dV$ conductance peaks in their mesas occur when mesas are heated to
the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$. Further on they extrapolate
this statement for all mesas, including much smaller and much better thermally
anchored mesas used in Intrinsic Tunnelling Spectroscopy (ITS). Here I show
that their conclusion does not hold neither for previously reported data, nor
even for their own mesas; the very remote extrapolation to ITS is invalid. I
also point out a number of inconsistencies and misleading references.
