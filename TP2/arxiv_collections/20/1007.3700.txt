The logics of knowledge are modal logics that have been shown to be effective
in representing and reasoning about knowledge in multi-agent domains.
Relatively few computational frameworks for dealing with computation of models
and useful transformations in logics of knowledge (e.g., to support multi-agent
planning with knowledge actions and degrees of visibility) have been proposed.
This paper explores the use of logic programming (LP) to encode interesting
forms of logics of knowledge and compute Kripke models. The LP modeling is
expanded with useful operators on Kripke structures, to support multi-agent
planning in the presence of both world-altering and knowledge actions. This
results in the first ever implementation of a planner for this type of complex
multi-agent domains.
