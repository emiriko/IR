The aim of the paper is to discuss the main characteristics of a complete
theoretical and numerical model for turbulent polydispersed two-phase flows,
pointing out some specific issues. The theoretical details of the model have
already been presented [Minier and Peirano, Physics Reports, Vol. 352/1-3, 2001
]. Consequently, the present work is mainly focused on complementary aspects,
that are often overlooked and that require particular attention. In particular,
the following points are analysed : the necessity to add an extra term in the
equation for the velocity of the fluid seen in the case of twoway coupling, the
theoretical and numerical evaluations of particle averages and the fulfilment
of the particle mass-continuity constraint. The theoretical model is developed
within the PDF formalism. The important-physical choice of the state vector
variables is first discussed and the model is then expressed as a stochastic
differential equation (SDE) written in continuous time (Langevin equations) for
the velocity of the fluid seen. The interests and limitations of Langevin
equations, compared to the single-phase case, are reviewed. From the numerical
point of view, the model corresponds to an hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian approach
where the fluid and particle phases are simulated by different methods.
Important aspects of the Monte Carlo particle/mesh numerical method are
emphasised. Finally, the complete model is validated and its performance is
assessed by simulating a bluff-body case with an important recirculation zone
and in which two-way coupling is noticeable.
