This work discusses gravothermal catastrophe in astrophysical systems and
provides an analytic collapse solution which exhibits many of the catastrophe
properties. The system collapses into a trapped surface with outgoing energy
radiated to a future boundary, and provides an example of catastrophic
collapse.
