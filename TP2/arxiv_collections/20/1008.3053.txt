The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory project is proposed to study
high energy gamma ray astronomy ( 40 GeV-1 PeV ) and cosmic ray physics ( 20
TeV-1 EeV ). The wide field of view Cherenkov telescope array, as a component
of the LHAASO project, will be used to study energy spectrum and compositions
of cosmic ray by measuring the total Cherenkov light generated by air showers
and shower maximum depth. Two prototype telescopes have been in operation since
2008. The pointing accuracy of each telescope is crucial to the direction
reconstruction of the primary particles. On the other hand the primary energy
reconstruction relies on the shape of the Cherenkov image on the camera and the
unrecorded photons due to the imperfect connections between photomultiplier
tubes. UV bright stars are used as point-like objects to calibrate the pointing
and to study the optical properties of the camera, the spot size and the
fractions of unrecorded photons in the insensitive areas of the camera.
