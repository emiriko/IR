We provide an exact estimate on the maximal subword complexity for
quasiperiodic infinite words. To this end we give a representation of the set
of finite and of infinite words having a certain quasiperiod q via a finite
language derived from q. It is shown that this language is a suffix code having
a bounded delay of decipherability. Our estimate of the subword complexity now
follows from this result, previously known results on the subword complexity
and elementary results on formal power series.
