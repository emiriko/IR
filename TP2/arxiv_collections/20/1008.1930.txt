We review exact approaches and recent results related to the relaxation
dynamics and description after relaxation of various one-dimensional lattice
systems of hard-core bosons after a sudden quench. We first analyze the
integrable case, where the combination of analytical insights and computational
techniques enable one to study large system sizes. Thermalization does not
occur in this regime. However, after relaxation, observables can be described
by a generalization of the Gibbs ensemble. We then utilize full exact
diagonalization to study what happens as integrability is broken. We show that
thermalization does occur in finite nonintegrable systems provided they are
sufficiently far away from the integrable point. We argue that the onset of
thermalization can be understood in terms of the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis.
