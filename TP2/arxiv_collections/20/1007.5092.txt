Dependency analysis is a technique to identify and determine data
dependencies between service protocols. Protocols evolving concurrently in the
service composition need to impose an order in their execution if there exist
data dependencies. In this work, we describe a model to formalise context-aware
service protocols. We also present a composition language to handle dynamically
the concurrent execution of protocols. This language addresses data dependency
issues among several protocols concurrently executed on the same user device,
using mechanisms based on data semantic matching. Our approach aims at
assisting the user in establishing priorities between these dependencies,
avoiding the occurrence of deadlock situations. Nevertheless, this process is
error-prone, since it requires human intervention. Therefore, we also propose
verification techniques to automatically detect possible inconsistencies
specified by the user while building the data dependency set. Our approach is
supported by a prototype tool we have implemented.
