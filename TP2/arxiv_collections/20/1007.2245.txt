The random hopping models exhibit many fascinating features, such as
diverging localization length and density of states as energy approaches the
bandcenter, due to its particle-hole symmetry. Nevertheless, such models are
yet to be realized experimentally because the particle-hole symmetry is easily
destroyed by diagonal disorder. Here we propose that a pure random hopping
model can be effectively realized in ultracold atoms by modulating a disordered
onsite potential in particular frequency ranges. This idea is motivated by the
recent development of the phenomena called "dynamical localization" or
"coherent destruction of tunneling". Investigating the application of this idea
in one dimension, we find that if the oscillation frequency of the disorder
potential is gradually increased from zero to infinity, one can tune a
non-interacting system from an Anderson insulator to a random hopping model
with diverging localization length at the band center, and eventually to a
uniform-hopping tight-binding model.
