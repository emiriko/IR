In this addendum we generalize some results of our article "Generically split
projective homogeneous varieties", Duke Math. J. 152 (2010), no. 1, 155-173.
More precisely, we remove all restrictions on the characteristic of the base
field and complete our classification by the last missing case, namely
$\PGO_{2n}^+$.
