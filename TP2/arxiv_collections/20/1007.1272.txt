Primary users (PU) separation concerns with the issues of distinguishing and
characterizing primary users in cognitive radio (CR) networks. We argue the
need for PU separation in the context of collaborative spectrum sensing and
monitor selection. In this paper, we model the observations of monitors as
boolean OR mixtures of underlying binary latency sources for PUs, and devise a
novel binary inference algorithm for PU separation. Simulation results show
that without prior knowledge regarding PUs' activities, the algorithm achieves
high inference accuracy. An interesting implication of the proposed algorithm
is the ability to effectively represent n independent binary sources via
(correlated) binary vectors of logarithmic length.
