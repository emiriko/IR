In scale invariant hydrostatic barotropes, the radial evolutionary equation
linearly relates the local gravitational and internal energies. From this
first-order equation, directly follow all the properties of polytropes and the
important mass-radius relation. Quadrature then leads to the regular Lane-Emden
functions and their Picard and Pade approximations, which are useful wherever
stars are approximately or exactly polytropic. We illustrate this particularly
for the n=3 regular polytrope and obtain analytic approximations to the
solution of the Lane-Emden equation, valid over the bulk of relativistic
degenerate stars (massive white dwarfs) and chemically homogeneous stars in
radiative equilibrium (ZAMS stars).
