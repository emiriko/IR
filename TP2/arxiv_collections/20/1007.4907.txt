In the usual holographic approach to QCD, the meson spectrum is generated due
to a non-trivial 5-dimensional background. We propose an alternative
5-dimensional scenario in which the spectrum emerges due to coupling to a
scalar field whose condensation is supposed to be dual to the formation of
gluon condensate and mimics the scale anomaly in QCD. The spectrum of model has
finite number of discrete states plus continuum and reveals a Regge-like
behavior in the strong coupling regime.
