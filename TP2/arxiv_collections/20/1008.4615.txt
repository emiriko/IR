We characterise those classes of permutations having the property that for
every tableau shape either every permutation of that shape or no permutation of
that shape belongs to the class. The characterisation is in terms of the
dominance order for partitions (and their conjugates) and shows that for any
such class there is a constant k such that no permutation in the class can
contain both an increasing and a decreasing sequence of length k.
