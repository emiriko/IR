In the present paper we extend the method to detect Pomeranchuk instabilities
in lattice systems developed in previous works to study more general
situations. The main result presented here is the extension of the method to
include finite temperature effects, which allows to compute critical
temperatures as a function of interaction strengths and density of carriers.
Furthermore, it can be applied to multiband problems which would be relevant to
study systems with spin/color degrees of freedom. Altogether, the present
extended version provides a potentially powerful technique to investigate
microscopic realistic models relevant to e.g. the Fermi liquid to nematic
transition extensively studied in connection with different materials such as
cuprates, ruthenates, etc.
