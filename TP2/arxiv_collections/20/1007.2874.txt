We present a method of cross-calibrating the polarization angle of a
polarimeter using BICEP Galactic observations. \bicep\ was a ground based
experiment using an array of 49 pairs of polarization sensitive bolometers
observing from the geographic South Pole at 100 and 150 GHz. The BICEP
polarimeter is calibrated to +/-0.01 in cross-polarization and less than +/-0.7
degrees in absolute polarization orientation. BICEP observed the temperature
and polarization of the Galactic plane (R.A= 100 degrees ~ 270 degrees and Dec.
= -67 degrees ~ -48 degrees). We show that the statistical error in the 100 GHz
BICEP Galaxy map can constrain the polarization angle offset of WMAP Wband to
0.6 degrees +\- 1.4 degrees. The expected 1 sigma errors on the polarization
angle cross-calibration for Planck or EPIC are 1.3 degrees and 0.3 degrees at
100 and 150 GHz, respectively. We also discuss the expected improvement of the
BICEP Galactic field observations with forthcoming BICEP2 and Keck
observations.
