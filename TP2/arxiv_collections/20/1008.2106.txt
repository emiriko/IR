We demonstrate a scheme to utilize the stacked fishnet metamaterial for
all-angle negative refraction and subwavelength imaging within a wide frequency
range starting from zero frequency. The theoretical predictions are verified by
the finite-difference-in-time-domain (FDTD) numerical simulations. The
phenomena come from the negative evanescent coupling between the adjacent slab
waveguides through the breathing air holes perforated on metal layers.
