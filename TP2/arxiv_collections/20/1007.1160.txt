Recently the PAMELA experiment has released its updated anti-proton flux and
anti-proton to proton flux ratio data up to energies of ~200GeV. With no clear
excess of cosmic ray anti-protons at high energies, one can extend constraints
on the production of anti-protons from dark matter. In this letter, we consider
both the cases of dark matter annihilating and decaying into standard model
particles that produce significant numbers of anti-protons. We provide two sets
of constraints on the annihilation cross-sections/decay lifetimes. In the one
set of constraints we ignore any source of anti-protons other than dark matter,
which give the highest allowed cross-sections/inverse lifetimes. In the other
set we include also anti-protons produced in collisions of cosmic rays with
interstellar medium nuclei, getting tighter but more realistic constraints on
the annihilation cross-sections/decay lifetimes.
