We propose a novel high-speed stream cipher encryption scheme based on the
true random key generated by a chaotic semiconductor laser. A 5-Gbits/s
non-return-to-zero plaintext is successfully encrypted and decrypted using this
cryptography. The scheme can be applied in the areas of real-time high-speed
physical encryption.
