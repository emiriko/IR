It is shown that the derivation of the Hawking radiation from a rotating
black hole on the basis of the tunneling mechanism is greatly simplified by
using the technique of the dimensional reduction near the horizon. This
technique is illustrated for the original derivation by Parikh and Wilczek, but
it is readily applied to a variant of the method such as suggested by Banerjee
and Majhi.
