The peculiar properties of quantum mechanics allow two remote parties to
communicate a private, secret key, which is protected from eavesdropping by the
laws of physics. So-called quantum key distribution (QKD) implementations
always rely on detectors to measure the relevant quantum property of single
photons. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the detectors in two
commercially available QKD systems can be fully remote-controlled using
specially tailored bright illumination. This makes it possible to tracelessly
acquire the full secret key; we propose an eavesdropping apparatus built of
off-the-shelf components. The loophole is likely to be present in most QKD
systems using avalanche photodiodes to detect single photons. We believe that
our findings are crucial for strengthening the security of practical QKD, by
identifying and patching technological deficiencies.
