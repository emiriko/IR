We investigate a sample of eleven Galactic X-ray sources recently discovered
with INTEGRAL or RXTE with the goal of identifying their optical and/or
near-infrared (NIR) counterpart. For this purpose new Chandra positions of nine
objects are presented together with follow-up observations of all the targets
in the optical and NIR. For the four sources IGR J16194-2810, IGRJ 16479-4514,
IGR J16500-3307 and IGR J19308+530, the Chandra position confirms an existing
association with an optical/NIR object, while for two sources (XTE J1716-389
and 18490-0000) it rules out previously proposed counterparts indicating new
ones. In the case of IGR J17597-220, a counterpart is selected out of the
several possibilities proposed in the literature and we present the first
association with an optical/NIR source for J16293-4603 and XTE J1743-363.
Moreover, optical/NIR observations are reported for XTE J1710-281 and IGR
J17254-3257: we investigate the counterpart to the X-ray sources based on their
XMM-Newton positions. We discuss the nature of each system considering its
optical/NIR and X-ray properties.
