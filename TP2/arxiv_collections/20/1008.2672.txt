In this letter we describe our novel photon regeneration experiment for the
axionlike particle search using a x-ray beam with a photon energy of 50.2 keV
and 90.7 keV, two superconducting magnets of 3 T, and a Ge detector with a high
quantum efficiency. A counting rate of regenerated photons compatible with zero
has been measured. The corresponding limits on the pseudoscalar axionlike
particle-two photon coupling constant is obtained as a function of the particle
mass. Our setup widens the energy window of purely terrestrial experiments
devoted to the axionlike particle search by coupling to two photons. It also
opens a new domain of experimental investigation of photon propagation in
magnetic fields.
