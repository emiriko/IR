In this Letter we analyze the (im)possibility of the exact cloning of
orthogonal three-qubit CAT states under local operation and classical
communication(LOCC) with the help of a restricted entangled state. We also
classify the three-qubit CAT states that can(not) be cloned under LOCC
restrictions and extend the results to the n-qubit case.
