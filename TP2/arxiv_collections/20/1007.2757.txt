The experimental prospects for precise measurements of the leptonic decays
B_u -> tau nu / mu nu, B_s -> mu+ mu-, D -> mu nu and D_s -> mu nu / tau nu are
very promising. Double ratios involving four of these decays can be defined in
which the dependence on the values of the decay constants is essentially
eliminated, thus enabling complementary measurements of the CKM matrix element
V_ub with a small theoretical error. We quantify the experimental error in a
possible future measurement of |V_ub| using this approach, and show that it is
competitive with the anticipated precision from the conventional approaches.
Moreover, it is shown that such double ratios can be more effective than the
individual leptonic decays as a probe of the parameter space of supersymmetric
models. We emphasize that the double ratios have the advantage of using |V_ub|
as an input parameter (for which there is experimental information), while the
individual decays have an uncertainty from the decay constants (e.g. f_B_s),
and hence a reliance on theoretical techniques such as lattice QCD.
