We present a unification theory of angular magnetoresistance oscillations,
experimentally observed in quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors, by solving
the Boltzmann kinetic equation in the extended Brillouin zone. We find that, at
commensurate directions of a magnetic field, resistivity exhibits strong
minima. In two limiting cases, our general solution reduces to the results,
previously obtained for the Lebed Magic Angles and Lee-Naughton-Lebed
oscillations. We demonstrate that our theoretical results are in good
qualitative and quantitative agreement with the existing measurements of
resistivity in (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ conductor.
