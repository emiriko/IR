We present the results of a search for white light flares on the ~23,000 cool
dwarfs in the Kepler Quarter 1 long cadence data. We have identified 373
flaring stars, some of which flare multiple times during the observation
period. We calculate relative flare energies, flare rates and durations, and
compare these with the quiescent photometric variability of our sample. We find
that M dwarfs tend to flare more frequently but for shorter durations than K
dwarfs, and that they emit more energy relative to their quiescent luminosity
in a given flare than K dwarfs. Stars that are more photometrically variable in
quiescence tend to emit relatively more energy during flares, but variability
is only weakly correlated with flare frequency. We estimate distances for our
sample of flare stars and find that the flaring fraction agrees well with other
observations of flare statistics for stars within 300 pc above the Galactic
Plane. These observations provide a more rounded view of stellar flares by
sampling stars that have not been pre-selected by their activity, and are
informative for understanding the influence of these flares on planetary
habitability.
