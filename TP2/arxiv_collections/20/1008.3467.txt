In this contribution I summarize some recent successes, and focus on
remaining challenges, in understanding the formation and evolution of planetary
systems in the context of the Blue Dots initiative. Because our understanding
is incomplete, we cannot yet articulate a "design reference mission"
engineering matrix suitable for an exploration mission where success is defined
as obtaining a spectrum of a potentially habitable world around a nearby star.
However, as progress accelerates, we can identify observational programs that
would address fundamental scientific questions through hypothesis testing such
that the null result is interesting.
