We study in detail the effect of the finite current quark mass on chiral
symmetry breaking, in the framework of truncated Coulomb gauge QCD with a
linear confining quark-antiquark potential. In the chiral limit of massless
current quarks, the breaking of chiral symmetry is spontaneous. But for a
finite current quark mass, some dynamical symmetry breaking continues to add to
the explicit breaking caused by the quark mass. Moreover, using as order
parameter the mass gap, i. e. the quark mass at vanishing moment or the quark
condensate, a finite quark mass transforms the chiral symmetry breaking from a
phase transition into a crossover. For the study of the QCD phase diagram it
thus is relevant to determine how the current quark mass affects chiral
symmetry breaking. Since the current quark masses of the six standard flavours
u, d, s, c, b, t span over five orders of magnitude from 1.5 MeV to 171 GeV, we
develop an accurate numerical method to study the running quark mass gap and
the quark vacuum energy density from very small to very large current quark
masses.
