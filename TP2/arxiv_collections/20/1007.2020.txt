The cross sections for the glueball candidates production in quasi-real
photon-photon collisions and on central diffraction processes, i.e. double
Pomeron exchange, in heavy ion interactions at RHIC and LHC are computed. The
rates for these distinct production channels are compared and they may be a
fruitful approach to the investigation of glueballs.
