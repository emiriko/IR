We consider the minimal supersymmetric extension of the 3-3-1 model. We study
the mass spectra of this model in the fermionic and gauge bosons sectors
without the antisextet. We also present some phenomenological consequences of
this model at colliders such as Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and International
Linear Collider(ILC).
