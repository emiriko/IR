We examine a well motivated non-universal supergravity model where the Higgs
boson masses are not unified with the other scalars at the grand unified scale
at the LHC. The dark matter content can easily be satisfied in this model by
having a larger Higgsino component in the lightest neutralino. Typical final
states in such a scenario at the LHC involve W bosons. We develop a bi-event
subtraction technique to remove a huge combinatorial background to identify W
-> jj decays. This is also a key technique to reconstruct supersymmetric
particle masses in order to determine the model parameters. With the model
parameters, we find that the dark matter content of the universe can be
determined in agreement with existing experimental results.
