This proceeding reports a study of the impacts of the SB2009 beam parameters
on the Higgs recoil mass and Higgs-Strahlung cross-section measurements based
on a dedicated fast simulation algorithm of the ILD detector. The study shows
worse results from SB2009 beam parameters than the previous RDR beam
parameters, because of the smaller luminosity. However, Travel Focus (TF)
technology can recover the degradation to certain level.
