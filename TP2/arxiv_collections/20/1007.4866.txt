We review some basic issues of the life-prescribed development of the Earth's
system and the Earth's atmosphere and discourse the unity of Earth's type of
life in physical and transcendental divisions. In physical division, we
exemplify and substantiate the origin of atmospheric phenomena in the metabolic
pathways acquired by the Earth's life forms. We are especially concerned with
emergence of pro-life superficial environments under elaboration of the energy
transformations. Analysis of the coupling phenomena of elaborated ozone-oxygen
transformation and Arctic bromine explosion is provided. Sensing is a
foundation of life and the Earth's life. We offer our explanation of human-like
perception, reasoning and creativity. We suggest a number of propositions about
association of transcendental and physical divisions and the purpose of
existence. The study relates to the tradition of natural philosophy which it
follows. The paper is suitable for the popular reading.
