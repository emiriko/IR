This work focuses on the mathematical modeling of wave dynamics in a
stratified medium. Non-local absorbing boundary conditions are considered based
on the two following assumptions: (i) a linear theory can be applied at large
distances from perturbation sources; and (ii) there are no other sources of
wave disturbance outside the mixing zone in the stratified medium. The boundary
conditions considered in this paper allowed us to describe the diverging
internal gravity waves generated by the mixing region in a stratified medium.
