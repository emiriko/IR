The Scorpius-Centaurus association is the most-nearby group of massive and
young stars. As nuclear-fusion products are ejected by massive stars and
supernovae into the surrounding interstellar medium, the search for
characteristic gamma-rays from radioactivity is one way to probe the history of
activity of such nearby massive stars on a My time scale through their
nucleosynthesis. 26Al decays within ~1 My, 1809 keV gamma-rays from its decay
can be measured with current gamma-ray telescopes, such as INTEGRAL's gamma-ray
spectrometer SPI. Following earlier 26Al gamma-ray mapping with NASA's Compton
observatory, we test spatial emission skymaps of 26Al for a component which
could be attributed to ejecta from massive stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus
group of stars. Such a model fit of spatial distributions for large-scale and
local components is able to discriminate 26Al emission associated with
Scorpius-Centaurus, in spite of the strong underlying nucleosynthesis signal
from the Galaxy at large. We find an 26Al signal above 5 sigma significance,
which we associate with the Sco-Cen group. The observed flux of 6 *10^{-5}ph
cm^{-2} s^{-1} corresponds to 1.1 *10^{-4} M_sol of 26Al. This traces the
nucleosynthesis ejecta of several massive stars within the past several million
years. We confirm through direct detection of radioactive 26Al the recent
ejection of massive-star nucleosynthesis products from the Sco-Cen association.
Its youngest subgroup in Upper Scorpius appears to dominate 26Al contributions
from this association. Our 26Al signal can be interpreted as a measure of the
age and richness of this youngest subgroup. We also estimate a kinematic
imprint of these nearby massive-star ejecta from the bulk motion of 26Al and
compare this to other indications of Scorpius-Centaurus massive-star activity .
