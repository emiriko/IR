We consider a multiferroic chain with a linear magnetoelectric coupling
induced by the electrostatic screening at the ferroelectric/ferromagnet
interface. We study theoretically the dynamic ferroelectric and magnetic
response to external magnetic and electric fields by utilizing an approach
based on coupled Landau- Khalatnikov and finite-temperature
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations. Additionally, we compare with Monte Carlo
calculations. It is demonstrated that for material parameters corresponding to
BaTiO3/Fe the polarization and the magnetization are controllable by external
magnetic and electric fields respectively.
