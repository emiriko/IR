Scenarios where gravitinos with GeV masses make up dark matter are known to
be in tension with high reheating temperatures, as required by e.g. thermal
leptogenesis. This tension comes from the longevity of the NLSPs, which can
destroy the successful predictions of the standard primordial nucleosynthesis.
However, a small violation of matter parity can open new decay channels for the
NLSP, avoiding the BBN problems, while being compatible with experimental
cosmic-ray constraints. In this paper, we propose a model where matter parity,
which we assume to be embedded in the U(1)_{B-L} gauge symmetry, is broken
dynamically in a hidden sector at low scales. This can naturally explain the
smallness of the matter parity breaking in the visible sector. We discuss the
dynamics of the corresponding pseudo Nambu--Goldstone modes of B-L breaking in
the hidden sector, and we comment on typical cosmic-ray and collider signatures
in our model.
