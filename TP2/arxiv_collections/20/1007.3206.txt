We consider the first LHC data for pp collisions in the framework of Regge
theory. The integral cross sections and inclusive densities of secondaries are
determined by the Pomeron exchange, and we present the corresponding
predictions for them. The first measurements of inclusive densities in
midrapidity region are in agreement with these predictions. The possible
contribution of Odderon (Reggeon with alpha(Odd)(0) ~ 1 and negative signature)
exchange to the differences in the inclusive spectra of particle and
antiparticle in the central region could be significant at LHC energies. The
first data of ALICE Collaboration are consistent with a very small Odderon
contribution. Probably, further LHC data will definitely settle the question of
the Odderon existence.
