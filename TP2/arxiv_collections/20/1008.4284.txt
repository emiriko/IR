We present a measurement of the ttbar production cross section multiplied by
the branching ratio to tau lepton decaying semihadronically plus jets, at a
center of mass energy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV using 1 fb^(-1) of integrated luminosity
collected with the D0 detector. Assuming a top quark mass of 170 GeV, we
measure sigma_ttb * BR=0.60^{+0.23}_{-0.22} (stat) ^{+0.15}_{-0.14} (syst) +/-
0.04\;(lumi) pb. In addition, we extract the ttbar production cross section
using the ttbar->tau+jets topology, with the result sigma_ttbar =
6.9_{-1.2}^{+1.2} (stat)_{-0.7}^{+0.8} (syst) \pm 0.4 (lumi) pb. These findings
are in good agreement with standard model predictions and measurements
performed using other top quark decay channels.
