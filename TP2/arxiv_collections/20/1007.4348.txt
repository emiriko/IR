In this article a non-perturbative time-dependent technique is used to treat
the initial value problem, in Quantum Mechanics context, for a non-equilibrium
self-interacting fermionic system in the presence of an external magnetic
field. Particularly, in mean-field regime, we study the dynamical symmetry
breaking phenomenon, identifying the physical processes associated.
