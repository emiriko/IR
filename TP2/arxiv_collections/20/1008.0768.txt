We have investigated the fluctuations and the higher order susceptibilities
of quark number, isospin number, electric charge and strangeness at vanishing
chemical potential for 2+1 flavor Polyakov loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
model. The calculations are performed for the bound effective potential in the
quark sector requiring up to eight quark interaction terms. These have been
contrasted to the lattice results which currently have somewhat heavier quarks
in the light flavor sector. The results show sufficient qualitative agreement.
For comparison we also present the results obtained with the conventional
effective potential containing upto six quark interaction terms.
