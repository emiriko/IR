In the class of the submodels SCLF (space-charge limited flow) of the family
of "gap-plus-PPF" models, let us exposes some qualitative remarks on the
possible turbulent dynamics showed by the zone (II) (see Fig. 1 of the text) of
the acceleration zone of the "direct inner gap". Furthermore, we will discuss
some consequent physical implications (as, for instance, self-focussing
phenomena, Petviashvili's diamagnetism, and so on) concerning structure and
physical phenomenology of the remaining subzones (above the subzone (II)) of
the given acceleration zone, in connection with possible models for the
external solid crust of the radio-pulsar.
