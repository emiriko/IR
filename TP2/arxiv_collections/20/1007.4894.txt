In this short communication we consider the possibility that stars less
evolved than the polluters are the source of the dilution needed to explain the
observed composition of second-generation globular cluster (GC) stars and the
Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelations. If these stars can lose 0.5-1% of their mass
during the relevant epochs, there is enough diluting material to produce the
observed anticorrelations. In this case, the original mass of proto-GCs was
several tens times higher than the current mass of GCs. While not strictly
impossible, this is a stringent hypothesis that needs more support. Should this
scenario be found true, then the link between the primordial (first-generation)
population in GC and the field population would be very strong.
