Edge excitations of a fractional quantum Hall system can be derived as
surface excitations of an incompressible quantum droplet using one dimensional
chiral bosonization. Here we show that an analogous approach can be developed
to characterize surface states of three-dimensional time reversal invariant
topological insulators. The key ingredient of our theory is the Luther's
multidimensional bosonization construction.
