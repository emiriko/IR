A double-trace deformation is the simplest perturbation of a conformal field
theory that has a gravity dual. In this paper we review the existing results
for the case in which the deformation is composed from a scalar operator, and
extend them to the case of a spinor operator. In particular we check the
validity of the c-conjecture along the RG flow induced by the deformation,
using both Cardy's c-function and the recent proposal by Myers and Sinha of a
c-function from entanglement entropy.
