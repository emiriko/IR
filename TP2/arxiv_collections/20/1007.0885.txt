In a minimalistic view, the use of noncommutative coordinates can be seen
just as a way to better express non-local interactions of a special kind:
1-particle solutions (wavefunctions) of the equation of motion in the presence
of an external field may look simpler as functions of noncommutative
coordinates. It turns out that also the wave-mechanical description of a system
of n such bosons/fermions and its second quantization is simplified if we
translate them in terms of their deformed counterparts. The latter are obtained
by a general twist-induced *-deformation procedure which deforms in a
coordinated way not just the spacetime algebra, but the larger algebra
generated by any number n of copies of the spacetime coordinates and by the
particle creation and annihilation operators. On the deformed algebra the
action of the original spacetime transformations looks twisted. In a
non-conservative view, we thus obtain a twisted covariant framework for QFT on
the corresponding noncommutative spacetime consistent with quantum mechanical
axioms and Bose-Fermi statistics. One distinguishing feature is that the field
commutation relations remain of the type "field (anti)commutator=a
distribution". We illustrate the results by choosing as examples interacting
non-relativistic and free relativistic QFT on Moyal space(time)s.
