Digital networks, mobile devices, and the possibility of mining the
ever-increasing amount of digital traces that we leave behind in our daily
activities are changing the way we can approach the study of human and social
interactions. Large-scale datasets, however, are mostly available for
collective and statistical behaviors, at coarse granularities, while
high-resolution data on person-to-person interactions are generally limited to
relatively small groups of individuals. Here we present a scalable experimental
framework for gathering real-time data resolving face-to-face social
interactions with tunable spatial and temporal granularities. We use active
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual proximity in a
distributed fashion by exchanging low-power radio packets. We analyze the
dynamics of person-to-person interaction networks obtained in three
high-resolution experiments carried out at different orders of magnitude in
community size. The data sets exhibit common statistical properties and lack of
a characteristic time scale from 20 seconds to several hours. The association
between the number of connections and their duration shows an interesting
super-linear behavior, which indicates the possibility of defining
super-connectors both in the number and intensity of connections. Taking
advantage of scalability and resolution, this experimental framework allows the
monitoring of social interactions, uncovering similarities in the way
individuals interact in different contexts, and identifying patterns of
super-connector behavior in the community. These results could impact our
understanding of all phenomena driven by face-to-face interactions, such as the
spreading of transmissible infectious diseases and information.
