Disordered geometrical boundaries such as rough surfaces induce important
modifications to the mode spectrum of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum. In
analogy to Anderson localization of waves induced by a random potential, here
we show that the Casimir-Polder interaction between a cold atomic sample and a
rough surface also produces localization phenomena. These effects, that
represent a macroscopic manifestation of disorder in quantum vacuum, should be
observable with Bose-Einstein condensates expanding in proximity of rough
surfaces.
