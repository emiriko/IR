We present the explicit formulae relating Hopf maps with Wigner's little
groups. They, particularly, explain simple action of group on a fiber for the
first and second Hopf fibrations, and present most simplified form for the
third one. Corresponding invariant Lagrangians are presented, and their
possible reductions are discussed.
