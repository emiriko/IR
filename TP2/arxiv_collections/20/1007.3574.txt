Observations of He-like and H-like Ar (Ar XVII and Ar XVIII) lines at 3.949
Angstroms and 3.733 Angstroms respectively with the RESIK X-ray spectrometer on
the CORONAS-F spacecraft, together with temperatures and emission measures from
the two channels of GOES, have been analyzed to obtain the abundance of Ar in
flare plasmas in the solar corona. The line fluxes per unit emission measure
show a temperature dependence like that predicted from theory, and lead to
spectroscopically determined values for the absolute Ar abundance, A(Ar) = 6.44
pm 0.07 (Ar XVII) and 6.49 pm 0.16 (Ar XVIII) which are in agreement to within
uncertainties. The weighted mean is 6.45 pm 0.06, which is between two recent
compilations of the solar Ar abundance and suggest that the photospheric and
coronal abundances of Ar are very similar.
