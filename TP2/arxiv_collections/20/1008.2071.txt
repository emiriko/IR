This book deals with the theory of generalized algebraic transformations,
which is elaborated with the aim to provide a relatively simple theoretical
tool that enables an exact treatment of diverse more complex
lattice-statistical models. In addition to a brief historical account on the
developments of this exact mapping method, the versatility of generalized
algebraic transformations will be convincingly evidenced when providing exact
results for two different families of exactly solvable models. The family of
exactly solved Ising models brings a deeper insight into various aspects
closely associated especially with phase transitions and critical phenomena.
The second class of exactly solved Ising-Heisenberg models sheds light on
striking quantum manifestations of spontaneously long-range ordered systems,
which are closely connected with a mutual interplay between quantum and
cooperative phenomena.
