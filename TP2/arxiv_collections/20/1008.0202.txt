Using the most general form of the interpolating currents, the coupling
constants $g_{\Sigma_b\Sigma_b\pi}$ and $g_{\Sigma_c\Sigma_c\pi}$ are
calculated within the light cone QCD sum rules approach. It is found that
$g_{{\Sigma_{c}\Sigma_{c}\pi}}=-8.0\pm1.7$ and
$g_{{\Sigma_{b}\Sigma_{b}\pi}}=-11.0\pm2.1$.
