We propose a new technique for determining the spin of new massive particles
that might be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider. The method relies on
pair-production of the new particles in a kinematic regime where the vector
boson fusion production mechanism is enhanced. For this regime, we show that
the distribution of the leading jets as a function of their relative azimuthal
angle can be used to distinguish spin-0 from spin-1/2 particles. We illustrate
this effect by considering the particular cases of (i) strongly-interacting,
stable particles and (ii) supersymmetric particles carrying color charge. We
argue that this method should be applicable in a wide range of new physics
scenarios.
