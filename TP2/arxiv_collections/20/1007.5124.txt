Let M be an imaginary quadratic field, f a Hecke eigenform on GL2(Q) and \pi
the unitary base-change to M of the automorphic representation associated to f.
Take a unitary arithmetic Hecke character \chi of M inducing the inverse of the
central character of f. The celebrated formula of Waldspurger relates the
square of an integral L(f) of f and \chi over the idele class group of M to the
central critical value L(1/2,{\pi}\otimes{\chi}). In this paper, we present a
construction of a new p-adic L-function that interpolates L(f) over arithmetic
characters for a cusp form f in the spirit of the landmark result of Katz where
he did that for Eisenstein series.
