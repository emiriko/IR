We present a multi-frequency Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) study in the range
of 4 GHz to 420 GHz of the quasi-one-dimensional, non-dimerized, quarter-filled
Mott insulators, delta-(EDT-TTF-CONMe_2)_2X (X=AsF_6, Br). In the high
temperature orthorhombic phase above T~190 K, the magnitude and the temperature
dependence of the high temperature spin susceptibility are described by a S =
1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain with J_AsF6=298 K and J_Br=474 K
coupling constants for X=AsF_6 and Br respectively. We estimate from the
temperature dependence of the line width an exchange anisotropy, J'/J of ~2 *
10^{-3}. The frequency dependence of the line width and the g-shift have an
unusual quadratic dependence in all crystallographic orientations that we
attribute to an antisymmetric exchange (Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya) interaction.
