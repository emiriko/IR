Gradual disruption of the actin cytoskeleton induces a series of structural
shape changes in cells leading to a transformation of cylindrical cell
extensions into a periodic chain of "pearls". Quantitative measurements of the
pearling instability give a square-root behavior for the wavelength as a
function of drug concentration. We present a theory that explains these
observations in terms of the interplay between rigidity of the submembranous
actin shell and tension that is induced by boundary conditions set by adhesion
points. The theory allows estimation of the rigidity and thickness of this
supporting shell. The same theoretical considerations explain the shape of
nonadherent edges in the general case of untreated cells.
