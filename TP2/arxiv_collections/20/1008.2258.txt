A general quantum dispersion equation for electron-positron(hole)-ion quantum
plasmas is derived and studied for some interesting cases. In an
electron-positron degenerate Fermi gas, with or without the Madelung term, a
new type of zero sound waves are found. Whereas in an electron-hole plasmas a
new longitudinal quantum waves are revealed, which have no analogies in quantum
electron-ion plasmas. The excitation of these quantum waves by a low-density
monoenergetic straight electron beam is examined. Furthermore, the KdV equation
for novel quantum waves is derived and the contribution of the Madelung term in
the formation of the KdV solitons is discussed.
