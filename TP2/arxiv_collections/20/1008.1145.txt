A spatially correlated broadcast setting with M antennas at the base station
and M users (each with a single antenna) is considered. We assume that the
users have perfect channel information about their links and the base station
has only statistical information about each user's link. The base station
employs a linear beamforming strategy with one spatial eigen-mode allocated to
each user. The goal of this work is to understand the structure of the
beamforming vectors that maximize the ergodic sum-rate achieved by treating
interference as noise. In the M = 2 case, we first fix the beamforming vectors
and compute the ergodic sum-rate in closed-form as a function of the channel
statistics. We then show that the optimal beamforming vectors are the dominant
generalized eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of the two links. It is
difficult to obtain intuition on the structure of the optimal beamforming
vectors for M > 2 due to the complicated nature of the sum-rate expression.
Nevertheless, in the case of asymptotic M, we show that the optimal beamforming
vectors have to satisfy a set of fixed-point equations.
