Males are often the "sicker" sex with male biased parasitism found in a
taxonomically diverse range of species. There is considerable interest in the
processes that could underlie the evolution of sex-biased parasitism. Mating
system differences along with differences in lifespan may play a key role. We
examine whether these factors are likely to lead to male-biased parasitism
through natural selection taking into account the critical role that ecological
feedbacks play in the evolution of defence. We use a host-parasite model with
two-sexes and the techniques of adaptive dynamics to investigate how mating
system and sexual differences in competitive ability and longevity can select
for a bias in the rates of parasitism. Male-biased parasitism is selected for
when males have a shorter average lifespan or when males are subject to greater
competition for resources. Male-biased parasitism evolves as a consequence of
sexual differences in life history that produce a greater proportion of
susceptible females than males and therefore reduce the cost of avoiding
parasitism in males. Different mating systems such as monogamy, polygamy or
polyandry did not produce a bias in parasitism through these ecological
feedbacks but may accentuate an existing bias.
