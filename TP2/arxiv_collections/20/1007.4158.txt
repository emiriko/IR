In this paper we prove the preconstructibility of the complex of tempered
holomorphic solutions of holonomic D-modules on complex analytic manifolds.
This implies the finiteness of such complex on any relatively compact open
subanalytic subset of a complex analytic manifold. Such a result is an
essential step for proving a conjecture of M. Kashiwara and P. Schapira (2003)
on the constructibility of such complex.
