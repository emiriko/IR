Surface oxidation of the bottom ferromagnetic (FM) electrode, one of the
major detrimental factors to the performance of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction
(MTJ), is difficult to avoid during the fabrication process of the MTJ's tunnel
barrier. Since Co rich alloys are commonly used for the FM electrodes in MTJs,
over-oxidation of the tunnel barrier results in the formation of a CoO
antiferromagnetic (AF) interface layer which couples with the bottom FM
electrode to form a typical AF/FM exchange bias (EB) system. In this work,
surface oxidation of the CoFe and CoFeB bottom electrodes was detected via
magnetometry measurements of exchange-bias characterizations including the EB
field, training effect, uncompensated spin density, and coercivity. Variations
of these parameters were found to be related to the surface oxidation of the
bottom electrode, among them the change of coercivity is most sensitive.
Annealed samples show evidence for an oxygen migration back to the MgO tunnel
barrier by annealing.
