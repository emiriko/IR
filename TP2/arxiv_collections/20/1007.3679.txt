We numerically investigate the spin glass energy interface problem in three
dimensions. We analyze the energy cost of changing the overlap from -1 to +1 at
one boundary of two coupled systems (in the other boundary the overlap is kept
fixed to +1). We implement a parallel tempering algorithm that simulate finite
temperature systems and work with both cubic lattices and parallelepiped with
fixed aspect ratio. We find results consistent with a lower critical dimension
$D_c=2.5$. The results show a good agreement with the mean field theory
predictions.
