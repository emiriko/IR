The Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope for Polarimetry
(BLAST-Pol) is a suborbital mapping experiment designed to study the role
played by magnetic fields in the star formation process. BLAST-Pol is the
reconstructed BLAST telescope, with the addition of linear polarization
capability. Using a 1.8 m Cassegrain telescope, BLAST-Pol images the sky onto a
focal plane that consists of 280 bolometric detectors in three arrays,
observing simultaneously at 250, 350, and 500 um. The diffraction-limited
optical system provides a resolution of 30'' at 250 um. The polarimeter
consists of photolithographic polarizing grids mounted in front of each
bolometer/detector array. A rotating 4 K achromatic half-wave plate provides
additional polarization modulation. With its unprecedented mapping speed and
resolution, BLAST-Pol will produce three-color polarization maps for a large
number of molecular clouds. The instrument provides a much needed bridge in
spatial coverage between larger-scale, coarse resolution surveys and narrow
field of view, and high resolution observations of substructure within
molecular cloud cores. The first science flight will be from McMurdo Station,
Antarctica in December 2010.
