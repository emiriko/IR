We propose a quantitative approach for calibrating and validating key
features of traffic instabilities based on speed time series obtained from
aggregated data of a series of neighboring stationary detectors. We apply the
proposed criteria to historic traffic databases of several freeways in Germany
containing about 400 occurrences of congestions thereby providing a reference
for model calibration and quality assessment with respect to the spatiotemporal
dynamics. First tests with microscopic and macroscopic models indicate that the
criteria are both robust and discriminative, i.e., clearly distinguishes
between models of higher and lower predictive power.
