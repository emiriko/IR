The polar interface between LaAlO$_{3}$ and SrTiO$_{3}$ has shown promise as
a field effect transistor, with reduced (nanoscale) feature sizes and
potentially added functionality over conventional semiconductor systems.
However, the mobility of the interfacial two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is
lower than desirable. Therefore to progress, the highly debated origin of the
2DEG must be understood. Here we present a case for surface redox reactions as
the origin of the 2DEG, in particular surface O vacancies, using a model
supported by first principles calculations that describes the redox formation.
In agreement with recent spectroscopic and transport measurements, we predict a
stabilization of such redox processes (and hence Ti 3$d$ occupation) with film
thickness beyond a critical value, which can be smaller than the critical
thickness for 2D electronic conduction, since the surface defects generate
trapping potentials that will affect the interface electron mobility. Several
other recent experimental results, such as lack of core level broadening and
shifts, find natural explanation. Pristine systems will likely require changed
growth conditions or modified materials with a higher vacancy free energy.
