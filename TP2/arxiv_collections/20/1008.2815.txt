After a long quiescence of three decades, the transient X-ray pulsar 4U
1901+03 became highly active in 2003 February. From the analysis of a large
number of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer/ Proportional Counter Array (RXTE/PCA)
observations of this source, we report here the detection of X-ray flares, a
broadening of the pulse frequency peak and Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs).
The X-ray flares showed spectral changes, had a duration of 100 s - 300 s, and
were more frequent and stronger during the peak of the outburst. In most of the
observations during the outburst we also detected a broadening of the pulse
frequency peak. We have also found intensity dependent changes in the pulse
profile at very short timescales. This reveals a coupling between the periodic
and the low frequency aperiodic variabilities. In addition, near the end of the
outburst we have detected a strong QPO feature centered at ~ 0.135 Hz. The QPO
feature is broad with a quality factor of 3.3 and with an rms value of
18.5+/-3.1%. Using the QPO frequency and the X-ray luminosity during the QPO
detection period we estimated the magnetic field strength of the neutron star
as 0.31*10^12 G which is consistent with the value inferred earlier under the
assumption of spin equilibrium.
