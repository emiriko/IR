Single centered supersymmetric black holes in four dimensions have
spherically symmetric horizon and hence carry zero angular momentum. This leads
to a specific sign of the helicity trace index associated with these black
holes. Since the latter are given by the Fourier expansion coefficients of
appropriate meromorphic modular forms of Sp(2,Z) or its subgroup, we are led to
a specific prediction for the signs of a subset of these Fourier coefficients
which represent contributions from single centered black holes only. We
explicitly test these predictions for the modular forms which compute the index
of quarter BPS black holes in heterotic string theory on T^6, as well as in Z_N
CHL models for N=2,3,5,7.
