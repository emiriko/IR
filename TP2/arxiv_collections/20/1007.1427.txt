There are a great many proteins that localize to and collectively generate
curvature in biological fluid membranes. We study changes in the topology of
fluid membranes due to the presence of highly anisotropic, curvature-inducing
proteins. Generically, we find a surprisingly rich phase diagram with phases of
both positive and negative Gaussian curvature. As a concrete example modeled on
experiments, we find that a lamellar phase in a negative Gaussian curvature
regime exhibits a propensity to form screw dislocations of definite burgers
scalar but of both chirality. The induced curvature depends strongly on the
membrane rigidity, suggesting membrane composition can be a factor regulating
membrane sculpting to to curvature-inducing proteins.
