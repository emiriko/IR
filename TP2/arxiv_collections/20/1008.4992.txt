We investigate a symmetry broken dimer constrained to move in a particular
direction when in contact with a heat-bath at a constant temperature. The dimer
is not driven by any external force. The system gains kinetic energy from the
heat-bath. The symmetry broken system can use this energy in directed
transport. At the hard core collision limit between the particles of the dimer,
we show by exact analytic calculations and complementary numerical results that
the dimer undergoes steady directed transport. Our observation, being
consistent with the {\it second law of thermodynamics}, {\it detailed balance}
etc leads to new physical understanding to which much attention has not been
paid.
