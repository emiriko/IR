This paper formalizes the optimal base problem, presents an algorithm to
solve it, and describes its application to the encoding of Pseudo-Boolean
constraints to SAT. We demonstrate the impact of integrating our algorithm
within the Pseudo-Boolean constraint solver MINISAT+. Experimentation indicates
that our algorithm scales to bases involving numbers up to 1,000,000, improving
on the restriction in MINISAT+ to prime numbers up to 17. We show that, while
for many examples primes up to 17 do suffice, encoding with respect to optimal
bases reduces the CNF sizes and improves the subsequent SAT solving time for
many examples.
