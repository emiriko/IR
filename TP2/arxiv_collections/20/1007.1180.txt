Pairing plays a crucial role in nuclear spectra and attempts to describe it
has a long history in nuclear physics. The limiting case in which all single
particle states are degenerate, but with different s-wave pairing strengths was
only recently solved. In this strong coupling limit the nuclear pairing
Hamiltonian also exhibits a supersymmetry. Another solution away from those
limits, namely two non-degenerate single particle states with different pairing
strengths, was also given. In this contribution these developments are
summarized and difficulties with possible generalizations to more single
particle states and d-wave pairing are discussed.
