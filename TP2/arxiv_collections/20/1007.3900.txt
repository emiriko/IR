Let E be an unbounded open (or closed) domain in Euclidean space of dimension
greater or equal to two. We present conservativeness criteria for (possibly
reflected) diffusions with state space E that are associated to fairly general
perturbed divergence form operators. Our main tool is a recently extended
forward and backward martingale decomposition, which reduces to the well-known
Lyons-Zheng decomposition in the symmetric case.
