We demonstrate low loss ridge waveguides and the first ring resonators for
the mid-infrared, for wavelengths ranging from 5.4 to 5.6 {\mu}m. Structures
were fabricated using electron-beam lithography on the silicon-on-sapphire
material system. Waveguide losses of 4.0 +/- 0.7 dB/cm are achieved, as well as
Q-values of 3.0 k.
