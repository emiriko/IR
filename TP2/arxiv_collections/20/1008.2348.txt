In this paper two common collocation approaches based on radial basis
functions have been considered; one be computed through the integration process
(IRBF) and one be computed through the differentiation process (DRBF). We
investigated the two approaches on natural convection heat transfer equations
embedded in porous medium which are of great importance in the design of
canisters for nuclear wastes disposal. Numerical results show that the IRBF be
performed much better than the common DRBF, and show good accuracy and high
rate of convergence of IRBF process.
