Results based on 106 M $\psi'$ events and about 226 M $J/\psi$ events
acquired with the BESIII detector at BEPCII are reported, including a
confirmation of the BESII $p\bar{p}$ threshold enhancement in $J/\psi \to
\gamma p\bar{p}$, branching ratios for $\chi_{cJ} \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ and $\eta
\eta$, and first measurements of the branching ratios for $\psi' \to \pi^0 h_c$
and $h_c \to \gamma \eta_c$, as well as measurements of the mass and width of
the $h_c$. Also reported are first observations of the two photon process
$\psi' \to \gamma \gamma J/\psi$ and $f_0(980) - a_0(980)$ mixing.
