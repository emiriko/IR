We present a wide-field IFS survey on the nearby face-on Sbc galaxy NGC 628,
comprising 11094 individual spectra, covering a nearly circular field-of-view
of ~6 arcmin in diameter, with a sampling of ~2.7 arcsec per spectrum in the
optical wavelength range (3700--7000 AA). This galaxy is part of the PPAK IFS
Nearby Galaxies Survey, (PINGS, Rosales-Ortega et al. 2009). To our knowledge,
this is the widest spectroscopic survey ever made in a single nearby galaxy. A
detailed flux calibration was applied, granting a spectrophotometric accuracy
of $\sim$\,0.2 mag.
  The age of the stellar populations shows a negative gradient from the inner
(older) to the outer (younger) regions. We found an inversion of this gradient
in the central ~1 kpc region, where a somewhat younger stellar population is
present within a ring at this radius. This structure is associated with a
circumnuclear star-forming region at ~ 500 pc, also found in similar spiral
galaxies. From the study of the integrated and spatially resolved ionized gas
we found a moderate SFR of ~ 2.4 Msun yr$^{-1}$. The oxygen abundance shows a a
clear gradient of higher metallicity values from the inner part to the outer
part of the galaxy, with a mean value of 12~+~log(O/H) ~ 8.7. At some specific
regions of the galaxy, the spatially resolved distribution of the physical
properties show some level of structure, suggesting real point-to-point
variations within an individual \hh region. Our results are consistent with an
inside-out growth scheme, with stronger star formation at the outer regions,
and with evolved stellar populations in the inner ones.
