In 1994, Josh Benaloh proposed a probabilistic homomorphic encryption scheme,
enhancing the poor expansion factor provided by Goldwasser and Micali's scheme.
Since then, numerous papers have taken advantage of Benaloh's homomorphic
encryption function, including voting schemes, computing multi-party trust
privately, non-interactive verifiable secret sharing, online poker... In this
paper we show that the original description of the scheme is incorrect,
possibly resulting in ambiguous decryption of ciphertexts. We give a corrected
description of the scheme and provide a complete proof of correctness. We also
compute the probability of failure of the original scheme. Finally we analyze
several applications using Benaloh's encryption scheme. We show in each case
the impact of a bad choice in the key generation phase of Benaloh's scheme. For
instance in the application of e-voting protocol, it can inverse the result of
an election, which is a non negligible consequence.
