Charged hadron differential distributions from muon-induced deep inelastic
scattering, DIS, on a $^6$LiD target are presented as function of the DIS
variables $x_{Bj}$, $Q^2$, $W^2$ and the hadron variables $p_T$ and $z$. They
can be used as benchmark to verify the reliability of theoretical model. The
$p_T^2$ distributions are fitted with a Gaussian function at different
kinematic intervals. With a Gaussian ansatz for the transverse momentum
dependent parton distributions, TMDs, the intrinsic transverse momentum of the
partons is extracted.
