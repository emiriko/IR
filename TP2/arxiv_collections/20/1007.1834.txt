We present an extension of our GPGCD method, an iterative method for
calculating approximate greatest common divisor (GCD) of univariate
polynomials, to polynomials with the complex coefficients. For a given pair of
polynomials and a degree, our algorithm finds a pair of polynomials which has a
GCD of the given degree and whose coefficients are perturbed from those in the
original inputs, making the perturbations as small as possible, along with the
GCD. In our GPGCD method, the problem of approximate GCD is transfered to a
constrained minimization problem, then solved with a so-called modified Newton
method, which is a generalization of the gradient-projection method, by
searching the solution iteratively. While our original method is designed for
polynomials with the real coefficients, we extend it to accept polynomials with
the complex coefficients in this paper.
