We study high energy photodisintegration of the deuteron into two
$\Delta$-isobars at large center of mass angles within the QCD hard
rescattering model (HRM). According to the HRM, the process develops in three
main steps: the photon knocks the quark from one of the nucleons in the
deuteron; the struck quark rescatters off a quark from the other nucleon
sharing the high energy of the photon; then the energetic quarks recombine into
two outgoing baryons which have large transverse momenta. Within the HRM, the
cross section is expressed through the amplitude of $pn\rightarrow
\Delta\Delta$ scattering which we evaluated based on the quark-interchange
model of hard hadronic scattering. Calculations show that the angular
distribution and the strength of the photodisintegration is mainly determined
by the properties of the
  $pn\rightarrow \Delta\Delta$ scattering. We predict that the cross section of
the deuteron breakup to $ \Delta^{++}\Delta^{-}$ is 4-5 times larger than that
of the breakup to the $ \Delta^{+}\Delta^{0}$ channel. Also, the angular
distributions for these two channels are markedly different. These can be
compared with the predictions based on the assumption that two hard
$\Delta$-isobars are the result of the disintegration of the preexisting
$\Delta\Delta$ components of the deuteron wave function. In this case, one
expects the angular distributions and cross sections of the breakup in both $
\Delta^{++}\Delta^{-}$ and $ \Delta^{+}\Delta^{0}$ channels to be similar.
