SR-POEM, our principle of equivalence measurement on a sounding rocket, will
compare the free fall rate of two substances yielding an uncertainty of E-16 in
the estimate of \eta. During the past two years, the design concept has matured
and we have been working on the required technology, including a laser gauge
that is self aligning and able to reach 0.1 pm per root hertz for periods up to
40 s. We describe the status and plans for this project.
