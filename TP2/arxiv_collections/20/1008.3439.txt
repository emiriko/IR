We argue that the entanglement entropy offers us a useful coarse-grained
entropy in time-dependent AdS/CFT. We show that the total von-Neumann entropy
remains vanishing even when a black hole is created in a gravity dual, being
consistent with the fact that its corresponding CFT is described by a
time-dependent pure state. We analytically calculate the time evolution of
entanglement entropy for a free Dirac fermion on a circle following a quantum
quench. This is interpreted as a toy holographic dual of black hole creations
and annihilations. It is manifestly free from the black hole information
problem.
