The Raman $2D$-band -important for the analysis of graphene- shows a
splitting for uniaxial strain. The splitting depends on the strength and
direction of the applied strain and on the polarization of the incident and
outgoing light. We expand the double-resonance Raman model in order to explain
the strain direction dependence and the polarization dependence of the
splitting. The analysis of this splitting gives new insight into the origin of
the $2D$-band. Our prediction of the strain direction and polarization
dependence agrees well with recent experiments.
