We introduce a Generalized Loop Move (GLM) update for Monte Carlo simulations
of frustrated Ising models on two-dimensional lattices with bond-sharing
plaquettes. The GLM updates are designed to enhance Monte Carlo sampling
efficiency when the system's low-energy states consist of an extensive number
of degenerate or near-degenerate spin configurations, separated by large energy
barriers to single spin flips. Through implementation on several frustrated
Ising models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the GLM updates in cases
where both degenerate and near-degenerate sets of configurations are favored at
low temperatures. The GLM update's potential to be straightforwardly extended
to different lattices and spin interactions allow it to be readily adopted on
many other frustrated Ising models of physical relevance.
