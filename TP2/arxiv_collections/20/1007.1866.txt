Using the correlated signal and idler photon pairs generated in a dispersion
shifted fiber by a pulsed pump, we measure the quantum efficiency of a
InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiode-based single photon detector. Since the
collection efficiency of photon pairs is a key parameter to correctly deduce
the quantum efficiency, we carefully characterize the collection efficiency by
studying correlation dependence of photon pairs upon the spectra of pump,
signal and idler photons. This study allows us to obtain quantum efficiency of
the single photon detector by using photon pairs with various kinds of
bandwidths.
