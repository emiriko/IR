In the eta-carbide-type correlated-electron metal Fe3Mo3N, ferromagnetism is
abruptly induced from a nonmagnetic non-Fermi-liquid ground state either when a
magnetic field (~14 T) applied to it or when it is doped with a slight amount
of impurity (~5% Co). We observed a peak in the paramagnetic neutron scattering
intensity at finite wave vectors, revealing the presence of the
antiferromagnetic (AF) correlation hidden in the magnetic measurements. It
causes a new type of geometrical frustration in the stellla quadrangula lattice
of the Fe sublattice. We propose that the frustrated AF correlation suppresses
the F correlation to its marginal point and is therfore responsible for the
origin of the ferromagnetic (F) quantum critical behavior in pure Fe3Mo3N.
