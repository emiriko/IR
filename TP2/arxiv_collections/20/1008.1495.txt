A sterile neutrino with mass in the eV range, mixing with the electron
antineutrino, is allowed and possibly even preferred by cosmology and
oscillation experiments. If such eV-mass neutrinos exist they provide a much
better target for direct detection in beta decay experiments than the active
neutrinos which are expected to have sub-eV masses. Their relatively high mass
would allow for an easy separation from the primary decay signal in experiments
such as KATRIN.
