Magnesium is the most abundant intracellular divalent cation. We present an
innovative experimental approach to localizing intracellular magnesium that
combines elemental and morphological information from individual cells with
high-resolution spatial information. Integration of information from scanning
fluorescence X-ray microscopy with information from atomic force microscopy was
used to generate a magnesium concentration map and to determine the X-ray
linear absorption coefficient map within a whole dehydrated mammary epithelial
cell.
