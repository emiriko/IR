We study, using simulated experiments inspired by thin film magnetic domain
patterns, the feasibility of phase retrieval in X-ray diffractive imaging in
the presence of intrinsic charge scattering given only photon-shot-noise
limited diffraction data. We detail a reconstruction algorithm to recover the
sample's magnetization distribution under such conditions, and compare its
performance with that of Fourier transform holography. Concerning the design of
future experiments, we also chart out the reconstruction limits of diffractive
imaging when photon- shot-noise and the intensity of charge scattering noise
are independently varied. This work is directly relevant to the time-resolved
imaging of magnetic dynamics using coherent and ultrafast radiation from X-ray
free electron lasers and also to broader classes of diffractive imaging
experiments which suffer noisy data, missing data or both.
