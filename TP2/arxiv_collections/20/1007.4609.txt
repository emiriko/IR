The magneto-optical properties of the ferromagnetic semiconductor
Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As are studied within the dynamical mean-field approximation
(DMFA). A material-specific multiband $sp^{3}$ tight-binding Hamiltonian is
employed for the dispersion of the GaAs host. The calculated density of states
shows an impurity band and a distorted valence band for large and moderate
values of magnetic coupling, respectively. Upon using the more realistic band
structure, the ferromagnetic transition temperature is significantly closer to
the experimental results than the previous predictions of $k\cdot p$ models.
The optical conductivity shows a Drude-like peak at low frequencies which is
suppressed by increasing of the magnetic coupling.
