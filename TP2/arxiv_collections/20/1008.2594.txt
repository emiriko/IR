We show theoretically that the sudden application of an appropriate ac field
to correlated lattice fermions flips the band structure and effectively
switches the interaction from repulsive to attractive. The nonadiabatically
driven system is characterized by a negative temperature with a population
inversion. We numerically demonstrate the converted interaction in an ac-driven
Hubbard model with the nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory solved by the
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method. Based on this, we propose an
efficient ramp-up protocol for ac fields that can suppress heating, which leads
to an effectively attractive Hubbard model with a temperature below the
superconducting transition temperature of the equilibrium system.
