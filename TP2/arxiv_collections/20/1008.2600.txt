By coupling counter--rotating coupled nonlinear oscillators, we observe a
``mixed'' synchronization between the different dynamical variables of the same
system. The phenomenon of amplitude death is also observed. Results for coupled
systems with co--rotating coupled oscillators are also presented for a detailed
comparison. Results for Landau-Stuart and Rossler oscillators are presented.
