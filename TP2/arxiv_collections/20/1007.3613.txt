A thorough investigation of single crystalline magnetite using broadband
dielectric spectroscopy and other methods provides evidence for relaxor-like
polar order in Fe3O4. We find long-range ferroelectric order to be im-peded by
the continuous freezing of polar degrees of freedom and the formation of a
tunneling-dominated glasslike state at low temperatures. This also explains the
lack of clear evidence for a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure below the
Verwey transition. Within the framework of recent models assuming an intimate
relation of charge and polar order, the charge order, too, can be speculated to
be of short-range type only and to be dominated by tunneling at low
temperatures.
