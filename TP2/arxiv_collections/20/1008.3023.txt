Basic SiC bipolar transistors have been studied in the past for their
applications where high power or high temperature operation is required.
However since the current gain in SiC bipolar transistors is very low and
therefore, a large base drive is required in high current applications.
Therefore, it is important to enhance the current gain of SiC bipolar
transistors. Using two dimensional mixed mode device and circuit simulation,
for the first time, we report a new Darlington transistor formed using two
polytypes 3C-SiC and 4H-SiC having a very high current gain as a result of the
heterojunction formation between the emitter and the base of transistor. The
reasons for the improved performance are analyzed.
