Physical phenomena driven by topological properties, such as the quantum Hall
effect, have the appealing feature to be robust with respect to external
perturbations. Lately, a new class of materials has emerged manifesting their
topological properties at room temperature and without the need of external
magnetic fields. These topological insulators are band insulators with large
spin-orbit interactions and exhibit the quantum spin-Hall (QSH) effect. Here we
investigate the transition between QSH and normal insulating phases under
topological deformations of a two-dimensional lattice. We demonstrate that the
QSH phase present in the honeycomb lattice looses its robustness as the
occupancy of extra lattice sites is allowed. Furthermore, we propose a method
for verifying our predictions with fermionic cold atoms in optical lattices. In
this context, the spin-orbit interaction is engineered via an appropriate
synthetic gauge field.
