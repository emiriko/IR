The DBI galileons are a generalization of the galileon terms, which extend
the internal galilean symmetry to an internal relativistic symmetry, and can
also be thought of as generalizations of DBI which yield second order field
equations. We show that, when considered as local modifications to gravity,
such as in the Solar system, there exists a region of parameter space in which
spherically symmetric static solutions exist and are stable. However, these
solutions always exhibit superluminality, casting doubt on the existence of a
standard Lorentz invariant UV completion.
