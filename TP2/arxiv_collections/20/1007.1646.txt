We report on band structure calculations and a microscopic model of the
low-dimensional magnet beta-Cu2V2O7. Magnetic properties of this compound can
be described by a spin-1/2 anisotropic honeycomb lattice model with the
averaged coupling \bar J1=60-66 K. The low symmetry of the crystal structure
leads to two inequivalent couplings J1 and J1', but this weak spatial
anisotropy does not affect the essential physics of the honeycomb spin lattice.
The structural realization of the honeycomb lattice is highly non-trivial: the
leading interactions J1 and J1' run via double bridges of VO4 tetrahedra
between spatially separated Cu atoms, while the interactions between structural
nearest neighbors are negligible. The non-negligible inter-plane coupling
Jperp~15 K gives rise to the long-range magnetic ordering at TN~26 K. Our model
simulations improve the fit of the magnetic susceptibility data, compared to
the previously assumed spin-chain models. Additionally, the simulated ordering
temperature of 27 K is in remarkable agreement with the experiment. Our study
evaluates beta-Cu2V2O7 as the best available experimental realization of the
spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. We also provide an
instructive comparison of different band structure codes and computational
approaches to the evaluation of exchange couplings in magnetic insulators.
