Formulae are derived for the positions of end-points in the invariant mass
and transverse mass distributions obtained from the products of heavy states
decaying to pairs of semi-invisibly decaying lighter states. Formulae are
derived both for the special case where the two decay chains are identical and
the more general case where they are different. The formulae are tested with a
simple case study of heavy SUSY higgs particles decaying to gauginos at the
LHC.
