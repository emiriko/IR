We propose a plasmon-based reconfigurable antenna to controllably distribute
emission from single quantum emitters in spatially separated channels. Our
calculations show that crossed particle arrays can split the stream of photons
from a single emitter into multiple narrow beams. We predict that beams can be
switched on and off by switching host refractive index. The design method is
based on engineering the dispersion relations of plasmon chains and is
generally applicable to traveling wave antennas. Controllable photon delivery
has potential applications in classical and quantum communication.
