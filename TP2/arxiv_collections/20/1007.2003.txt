A structure prediction method is presented based on the Minima Hopping
method. Optimized moves on the configurational enthalpy surface are performed
to escape local minima using variable cell shape molecular dynamics by aligning
the initial atomic and cell velocities to low curvature directions of the
current minimum. The method is applied to both silicon crystals and binary
Lennard-Jones mixtures and the results are compared to previous investigations.
It is shown that a high success rate is achieved and a reliable prediction of
unknown ground state structures is possible.
