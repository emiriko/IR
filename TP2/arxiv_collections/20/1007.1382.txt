We investigate the reaction pn -> dpipi in the framework of Chiral
Perturbation Theory. For the first time a complete calculation of the leading
order contributions is presented. We identify various diagrams that are of
equal importance as compared to those recognized in earlier works. The diagrams
at leading order behave as expected by the power counting. Also for the first
time the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the initial, intermediate and final
state is included consistently and found to be very important. This study
provides a theoretical basis for a controlled evaluation of the non-resonant
contributions in two-pion production reactions in nucleon-nucleon collisions.
