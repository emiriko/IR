The determination of the Ba abundance in globular cluster (GC) stars is a
very powerful test to address several issues in the framework of multiple
population scenarios. We measured the Ba content for a sample of more than 1200
stars in 15 Galactic GCs, using high-resolution FLAMES/Giraffe spectra. We
found no variation in [Ba/Fe] ratios for different stellar populations within
each cluster; this means that low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars do not
significantly contribute to the intra-cluster pollution. Very interestingly, we
obtained that the fraction of Ba-stars in first generation (FG) stars is close
to the values derived for field stars ($\sim$2\%); on the other hand, second
generation (SG) stars present a significant lower fraction. An independent and
successful test, based on radial velocity variations among giant stars in
NGC~6121, confirms our finding: the binary fraction among FG stars is about
$\sim$12\% to be compared with $\sim$1\% of SG stars. This is an evidence that
SG stars formed in a denser environment, where infant mortality of binary
systems was particularly efficient.
