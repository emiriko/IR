We prove a result on the singularities of ball quotients $\Gamma\backslash\CC
H^n$. More precisely, we show that a ball quotient has canonical singularities
under certain restrictions on the dimension $n$ and the underlying lattice. We
also extend this result to the toroidal compactification $(\Gamma\backslash\CC
H^n)^*$.
