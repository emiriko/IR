The topological susceptibility of the SU(3) random vortex world-surface
ensemble, an effective model of infrared Yang-Mills dynamics, is investigated.
The model is implemented by composing vortex world-surfaces of elementary
squares on a hypercubic lattice, supplemented by an appropriate specification
of vortex color structure on the world-surfaces. Topological charge is
generated in this picture by writhe and self-intersection of the vortex
world-surfaces. Systematic uncertainties in the evaluation of the topological
charge, engendered by the hypercubic construction, are discussed. Results for
the topological susceptibility are reported as a function of temperature and
compared to corresponding measurements in SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory. In
the confined phase, the topological susceptibility of the random vortex
world-surface ensemble appears quantitatively consistent with Yang-Mills
theory. As the temperature is raised into the deconfined regime, the
topological susceptibility falls off rapidly, but significantly less so than in
SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory. Possible causes of this deviation, ranging
from artefacts of the hypercubic description to more physical sources, such as
the adopted vortex dynamics, are discussed.
