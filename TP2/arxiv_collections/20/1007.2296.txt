Since its first discovery, most extrasolar planets were detected using radial
velocity (RV) method. However, the RV method does not provide all parameters
required to characterize a planetary system. Recently, Charbonneau et al.(2000)
and Brown et al(2001)have shown that the RV planet orbiting HD 209458 can be
observed using transit method yielding some additional information. As pointed
out by Castellano (2004), this method can be undertaken using small aperture
telescopes and inexpensive CCDs. We report here new observations of planetary
transit in HD 102195 and HD 209458 performed at the Bosscha Observatory since
March 2006. Some preliminary results will be presented
