Novel method of calculating Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium is presented.
Basic equations are carefully solved using arbitrary precision arithmetic.
Special interpolation procedure is then used to retrieve all abundances using
tabulated results for neutrons and protons, together with basic nuclear data.
Proton and neutron abundance tables, basic nuclear data and partition functions
for nuclides used in calculations are provided. Simple interpolation algorithm
using pre-calculated p and n abundances tabulated as a functions of kT, rho and
Ye is outlined. Unique properties of this method are: (1) ability to pick-up
out of NSE selected nuclei only (2) computational time scaling linearly with
number of re-calculated abundances (3) relatively small amount of stored data:
only two large tables (4) slightly faster than solving NSE equations using
traditional Newton-Raphson methods for small networks (few tens of species);
superior for huge (800-3000) networks (5) do not require initial guess; works
well on random input (6) can tailored to specific application (7) ability to
use third-party NSE solvers to obtain fully compatible tables (8) encapsulation
of the NSE code for bug-free calculations.
  Range of applications for this approach is possible: coverage test of
traditional NSE Newton-Raphson codes, generating starting values, code-to-code
verification and possible replacement of the old legacy procedures in supernova
simulations.
