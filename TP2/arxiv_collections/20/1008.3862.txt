Based on dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) we consider a
non-equilibrium system of interacting colloidal particles driven by a constant
tilting force through a periodic, symmetric "washboard" potential. We
demonstrate that, despite of pronounced spatio-temporal correlations, the
particle current can be reversed by adding suitable feedback control terms to
the DDFT equation of motion. We explore two distinct control protocols with
time delay, focussing on either the particle positions or the density profile.
Our study shows that the DDFT is an appropriate framework to implement
time-delayed feedback control strategies widely used in other fields of
nonlinear physics
