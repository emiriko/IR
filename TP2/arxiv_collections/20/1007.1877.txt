We investigate the steady state heat current in two and three dimensional
isotopically disordered harmonic lattices. Using localization theory as well as
kinetic theory we estimate the system size dependence of the current. These
estimates are compared with numerical results obtained using an exact formula
for the current given in terms of a phonon transmission function, as well as by
direct nonequilibrium simulations. We find that heat conduction by
high-frequency modes is suppressed by localization while low-frequency modes
are strongly affected by boundary conditions. Our {\color{black}heuristic}
arguments show that Fourier's law is valid in a three dimensional disordered
solid except for special boundary conditions. We also study the pinned case
relevant to localization in quantum systems and often used as a model system to
study the validity of Fourier's law. Here we provide the first numerical
verification of Fourier's law in three dimensions. In the two dimensional
pinned case we find that localization of phonon modes leads to a heat
insulator.
