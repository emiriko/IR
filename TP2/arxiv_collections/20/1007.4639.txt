We discuss the use of strong coupling expansions for Yang-Mills theory and
QCD at finite temperature and density. In particular we consider the onset of
temperature effects for the free energy and screening masses, derive the hadron
resonance gas model from first principles and compute the weakening of the
deconfinement transition with chemical potential.
