We report results from numerical simulations of star formation in the early
universe that focus on the role of subsonic turbulence, and investigate whether
it can induce fragmentation of the gas. We find that dense primordial gas is
highly susceptible to fragmentation, even for rms turbulent velocity
dispersions as low as 20% of the initial sound speed. The resulting fragments
cover over two orders of magnitude in mass, ranging from 0.1 to 40 solar
masses. However, our results suggest that the details of the fragmentation
depend on the local properties of the turbulent velocity field and hence we
expect considerable variations in the resulting stellar mass spectrum in
different halos.
