We use new kinematic data from the ultra-faint Milky Way satellite Segue 1 to
model its dark matter distribution and derive upper limits on the dark matter
annihilation cross-section. Using gamma-ray flux upper limits from the Fermi
satellite and MAGIC, we determine cross-section exclusion regions for dark
matter annihilation into a variety of different particles including charged
leptons. We show that these exclusion regions are beginning to probe the
regions of interest for a dark matter interpretation of the electron and
positron fluxes from PAMELA, Fermi, and HESS, and that future observations of
Segue 1 have strong prospects for testing such an interpretation. We
additionally discuss prospects for detecting annihilation with neutrinos using
the IceCube detector, finding that in an optimistic scenario a few neutrino
events may be detected. Finally we use the kinematic data to model the Segue 1
dark matter velocity dispersion and constrain Sommerfeld enhanced models.
