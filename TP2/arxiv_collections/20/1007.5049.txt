We motivate the concept of emergent gauge symmetry and discuss ways that this
concept can be tested. The key idea is that if a symmetry is emergent, one
should look for small violations of this symmetry because the underlying
fundamental theory does not contain the symmetry. We describe our recent work
implementing this idea in the gravity sector. We also describe the reasons why
violations of gauge symmetry may well be linked to violations of Lorentz
invariance.
