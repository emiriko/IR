It is well established that superconductivity is based on a coherent quantum
state of Cooper pairs with charge 2e, and this is equally true of the Josephson
effect. In contrast, Kadin recently presented an alternative real-space model
of the superconducting ground state, in which each electron is a localized
orbital, on the scale of the coherence length, coupled to a dynamic charge (or
spin) density wave. A supercurrent corresponds to collective motion of a dense
orthogonal array of such electrons. The present paper extends this analysis to
two weakly coupled superconductors, and shows how the Josephson effect
(including the ubiquitous factor of h/2e) may be obtained. Furthermore, much of
the standard BCS formalism on the macroscale follows from this microstructure.
However, major deviations from standard Josephson behavior are predicted for
nanoscale SQUIDs much smaller than the coherence length.
