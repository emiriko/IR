The continuum theory of dislocations, as developed predominantly by Kr\"oner
and Kosevich, views each dislocation as a source of incompatibility of strains.
We show that this concept can be employed efficiently in the Landau free energy
functional to develop a mean-field mesoscopic model of materials with
dislocations. The order parameters that represent the distortion of the parent
phase (often of cubic symmetry) are written in terms of elastic strains which
are themselves coupled by incompatibility constraints. Since the "strength" of
the incompatibility depends on the local density of dislocations, the presence
of dislocations affects the evolution of the microstructure and vice versa. An
advantage of this formulation is that long range anisotropic interactions
between dislocations appear naturally in the formulation of the free energy.
Owing to the distortion of the crystal structure around dislocations, their
presence in multiphase materials causes heterogeneous nucleation of the product
phase and thus also shifts of the transformation temperature. This novel
field-theoretical approach is very convenient as it allows to bridge the gap in
studying the behavior of materials at the length and time scales that are not
attainable by atomistic or macroscopic models.
