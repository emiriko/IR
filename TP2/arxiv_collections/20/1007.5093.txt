A collaborative object represents a data type (such as a text document)
designed to be shared by a group of dispersed users. The Operational
Transformation (OT) is a coordination approach used for supporting optimistic
replication for these objects. It allows the users to concurrently update the
shared data and exchange their updates in any order since the convergence of
all replicas, i.e. the fact that all users view the same data, is ensured in
all cases. However, designing algorithms for achieving convergence with the OT
approach is a critical and challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a
formal compositional method for specifying complex collaborative objects. The
most important feature of our method is that designing an OT algorithm for the
composed collaborative object can be done by reusing the OT algorithms of
component collaborative objects. By using our method, we can start from correct
small collaborative objects which are relatively easy to handle and
incrementally combine them to build more complex collaborative objects.
