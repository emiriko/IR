We investigate the group field theory formulation of the EPRL/FK spin foam
models. These models aim at a dynamical, i.e. non-topological formulation of 4D
quantum gravity. We introduce a saddle point method for general group field
theory amplitudes and compare it with existing results, in particular for a
second order correction to the EPRL/FK propagator.
