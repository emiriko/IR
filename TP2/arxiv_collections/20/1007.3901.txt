The Bethe-Salpeter equation in QCD connects the gauge-dependent gluon and
quark degrees of freedom with the gauge-invariant properties of mesons. We
study the rho meson mass and decay constant for various versions of the
gauge-dependent input functions discussed in the literature, which start to
differ generically below the hadronic scale, and show qualitative different
infrared behavior. We find that, once the gauge-dependent quark-gluon vertex is
permitted to vary as well, the rho mass and decay constant is reproduced
equally well for all forms investigated. A possible conclusion from this is
that these $\rho$-meson properties are only sensitive to changes in the input
at scales above a few hundred MeV.
