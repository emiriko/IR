We report a versatile method to engineer arrays of nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
color centers in dia- mond at the nanoscale. The defects were produced in
parallel by ion implantation through 80 nm diameter apertures patterned using
electron beam lithography in a PMMA layer deposited on a diamond surface. The
implantation was performed with CN- molecules which increased the NV defect
formation yield. This method could enable the realization of a solid-state
coupled-spin array and could be used for positioning an optically active NV
center on a photonic microstructure.
