Proton hexality is a discrete symmetry that avoids the problem of too fast
proton decay in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model.
Unfortunately it is inconsistent with conventional grand unification. We show
that proton hexality can be incorporated in the scheme of "Local Grand
Unification" discussed in the framework of model building in (heterotic) string
theory.
