We carry out a multi-wavelength study of individual galaxies detected by the
Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) and identified at
other wavelengths, using data spanning the radio to the ultraviolet (UV). We
develop a Monte Carlo method to account for flux boosting, source blending, and
correlations among bands, which we use to derive deboosted far-infrared (FIR)
luminosities for our sample. We estimate total star-formation rates for BLAST
counterparts with z < 0.9 by combining their FIR and UV luminosities. Star
formation is heavily obscured at L_FIR > 10^11 L_sun, z > 0.5, but the
contribution from unobscured starlight cannot be neglected at L_FIR < 10^11
L_sun, z < 0.25. We assess that about 20% of the galaxies in our sample show
indication of a type-1 active galactic nucleus (AGN), but their submillimeter
emission is mainly due to star formation in the host galaxy. We compute stellar
masses for a subset of 92 BLAST counterparts; these are relatively massive
objects, with a median mass of ~10^11 M_sun, which seem to link the 24um and
SCUBA populations, in terms of both stellar mass and star-formation activity.
The bulk of the BLAST counterparts at z<1 appear to be run-of-the-mill
star-forming galaxies, typically spiral in shape, with intermediate stellar
masses and practically constant specific star-formation rates. On the other
hand, the high-z tail of the BLAST counterparts significantly overlaps with the
SCUBA population, in terms of both star-formation rates and stellar masses,
with observed trends of specific star-formation rate that support strong
evolution and downsizing.
