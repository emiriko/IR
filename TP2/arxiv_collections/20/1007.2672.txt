In warped models that solve the hierarchy problem, there is generally no
dynamical relation between the size of the fifth dimension and the scale of
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). The establishment of such a relation,
without fine-tuning, requires that Casimir contributions to the radion
potential not exceed the energy density associated with EWSB. Here, we examine
the use of supersymmetry for controlling the Casimir energy density and making
quantum contributions calculable. We compute the effects of supersymmetry
breaking at the UV and IR boundaries of warped backgrounds, in the presence of
brane localized kinetic terms. Various limits of supersymmetry breaking are
examined. We find that when supersymmetry is broken on the UV brane, vacuum
contributions to the radion potential can be controlled (as likely necessary
for EWSB to govern the radion potential) via small soft masses as well as a
"double volume suppression." Our formalism can also provide a setup for radion
stabilization by bulk fields, when supersymmetry is broken on both the UV and
the IR branes.
