We demonstrate the accuracy of the hybrid functional HSE06 for computing band
offsets of semiconductor alloy heterostructures. The highlight of this study is
the computation of conduction band offsets with a reliability that has eluded
standard density functional theory. A high-quality special quasirandom
structure models an infinite random pseudobinary alloy for constructing
heterostructures along the (001) growth direction. Our excellent results for a
variety of heterostructures establish HSE06's relevance to band engineering of
high-performance electrical and optoelectronic devices.
