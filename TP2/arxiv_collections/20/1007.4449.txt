High Energy Jets (HEJ) is a new framework for approximating the all-order
perturbative corrections to multi-jet processes, with a focus on the hard,
wide-angle QCD emissions, which underpins the perturbative description of hard
jets. In this contribution we review the basic concepts of HEJ, and present
some new predictions for observables in dijet-production, and for W-boson
production in association with at least 3 jets.
