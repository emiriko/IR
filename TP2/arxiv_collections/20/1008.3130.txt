We present an experimental investigation of lumped-element superconducting LC
resonators designed to provide different types of coupling to a transmission
line. We have designed four resonator geometries including dipole and
quadrupole configured inductors connected in parallel with low loss SiNx
dielectric parallel-plate capacitors. The design of the resonator allows a
small change in the symmetry of the inductor or grounding of the capacitor to
allow LC resonators with: 1) inductive coupling, 2) capacitive coupling, 3)
both types of coupling, or 4) greatly reduced coupling. We measured all four
designs at a temperature of 30mK at different values of power. We compare the
extracted data from the four resonator types and find that both capacitive and
inductive coupling can be included and that when left off, only a minor change
in the circuit design is necessary. We also find a variation in the measured
loss tangent of less than a few percent, which is a test of the systematic
precision of the measurement technique.
