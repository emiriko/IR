We demonstrate sub-Poissonian number differences in four-wave mixing of
Bose-Einstein condensates of metastable helium. The collision between two
Bose-Einstein condensates produces a scattering halo populated by pairs of
atoms of opposing velocities, which we divide into several symmetric zones. We
show that the atom number difference for opposing zones has sub-Poissonian
noise fluctuations whereas that of nonopposing zones is well described by shot
noise. The atom pairs produced in a dual number state are well adapted to sub
shot-noise interferometry and studies of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type
nonlocality tests.
