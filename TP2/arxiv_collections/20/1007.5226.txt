We pose and solve the analogue of Slepian's time-frequency concentration
problem in the two-dimensional plane, for applications in the natural sciences.
We determine an orthogonal family of strictly bandlimited functions that are
optimally concentrated within a closed region of the plane, or, alternatively,
of strictly spacelimited functions that are optimally concentrated in the
Fourier domain. The Cartesian Slepian functions can be found by solving a
Fredholm integral equation whose associated eigenvalues are a measure of the
spatiospectral concentration. Both the spatial and spectral regions of
concentration can, in principle, have arbitrary geometry. However, for
practical applications of signal representation or spectral analysis such as
exist in geophysics or astronomy, in physical space irregular shapes, and in
spectral space symmetric domains will usually be preferred. When the
concentration domains are circularly symmetric in both spaces, the Slepian
functions are also eigenfunctions of a Sturm-Liouville operator, leading to
special algorithms for this case, as is well known. Much like their
one-dimensional and spherical counterparts with which we discuss them in a
common framework, a basis of functions that are simultaneously spatially and
spectrally localized on arbitrary Cartesian domains will be of great utility in
many scientific disciplines, but especially in the geosciences.
