We present results from a Partial-Wave Analysis (PWA) of diffractive
dissociation of 190 GeV/c $\pi^-$ into $\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ final states on
nuclear targets. A PWA of the data sample taken during a COMPASS pilot run in
2004 on a Pb target showed a significant spin-exotic $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$
resonance consistent with the controversial $\pi_1(1600)$, which is considered
to be a candidate for a non-$q\bar{q}$ mesonic state. In 2008 COMPASS collected
a large diffractive $\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ data sample using a hydrogen target. A
first comparison with the 2004 data shows a strong target dependence of the
production strength of states with spin projections $M = 0$ and 1.
