We investigate the possibility of the identification of TeV physics models
including WIMP dark matter at the International Linear Collider. Many TeV
physics models contain a WIMP dark matter (chi^0) and charged new particle
(chi^{pm}) which interacts with the WIMP dark matter via the vertex chi^{pm}
chi^0 W^{mp}. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we study the process, e^+e^- to
chi^+ chi^- to chi^0 chi^0 W^+ W^-, because the signal contains the fruitful
information of the model. We show that, in particular, the distribution of the
chi^{pm} production angle is the powerful probe in the TeV physics model
search.
