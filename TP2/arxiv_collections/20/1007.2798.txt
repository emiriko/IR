We report on the microscopic model of the recently synthesized
one-dimensional quantum magnet (NO)Cu(NO3)3. Applying density functional theory
band structure calculations, we obtain a leading antiferromagnetic exchange
coupling J ~ 200 K, which runs via NO3 groups forming spin chains along the b
direction. Much weaker couplings J' ~ 2 K link the chains into layers in a
non-frustrated manner. Our calculations do not support the earlier conjecture
on an anisotropic frustrated square lattice physics in (NO)Cu(NO3)3. In
contrast, the model of uniform spin chains leads to a remarkably good fit of
the experimental magnetic susceptibility data, although the low-temperature
features of the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility measured by electron spin
resonance might call for extension of the model. We outline possible
experiments to observe the suggested long-range magnetic ordering in
(NO)Cu(NO3)3 and briefly compare this compound to other spin-1/2 uniform-chain
systems.
