We compute the infrared (IR) emission from high-redshift galaxies in
cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations by coupling the output
of the simulation with the population synthesis code `GRASIL' by Silva et al.
Based on the stellar mass, metallicity and formation time of each star
particle, we estimate the full spectral energy distribution of each star
particle from ultraviolet to IR, and compute the luminosity function of
simulated galaxies in the Spitzer broadband filters for direct comparison with
the available Spitzer observations.
