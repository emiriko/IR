We present new data on electron scattering from a range of nuclei taken in
Hall C at Jefferson Lab. For heavy nuclei, we observe a rapid falloff in the
cross section for $x>1$, which is sensitive to short range contributions to the
nuclear wave-function, and in deep inelastic scattering corresponds to probing
extremely high momentum quarks. This result agrees with higher energy muon
scattering measurements, but is in sharp contrast to neutrino scattering
measurements which suggested a dramatic enhancement in the distribution of the
`super-fast' quarks probed at x>1. The falloff at x>1 is noticeably stronger in
^2H and ^3He, but nearly identical for all heavier nuclei.
