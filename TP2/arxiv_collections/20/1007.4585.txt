The event-by-event dynamical fluctuations in kaon-to-proton and
proton-to-pion ratios have been studied in dependence on center--of--mass
energies of nucleon--nucleon collisions $\sqrt{s}$. Based on changing phase
space volume which apparently is the consequence of phase transition from
hadrons to quark--gluon plasma at large $\sqrt{s}$, the single--particle
distribution function $f$ is assumed to be rather modified. Varying $f$ and
phase space volume are implemented in the grand--canonical partition function,
especially at $\sqrt{s}>17$ GeV, so that hadron resonance gas model, when
taking into account the experimental acceptance ${\cal A}$ and quark phase
space occupation factor $\gamma$, turns to be able to reproduce the dynamical
fluctuations in $(K^++K^-)/(p+\overline{p})$ and
$(p+\overline{p})/(\pi^++\pi^-)$ ratios over the entire range of $\sqrt{s}$.
