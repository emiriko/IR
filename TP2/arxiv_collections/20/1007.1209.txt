Discrete Fourier transforms~(DFTs) over finite fields have widespread
applications in error correction coding. Hence, reducing the computational
complexities of DFTs is of great significance, especially for long DFTs as
increasingly longer error control codes are chosen for digital communication
and storage systems. Since DFTs involve both multiplications and additions over
finite fields and multiplications are much more complex than additions,
recently proposed cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs) are promising due
to their low multiplicative complexity. Unfortunately, they have very high
additive complexity. Techniques such as common subexpression elimination (CSE)
can be used to reduce the additive complexity of CFFTs, but their effectiveness
for long DFTs is limited by their complexity. In this paper, we propose prime
factor cyclotomic Fourier transforms (PFCFTs), which use CFFTs as sub-DFTs via
the prime factor algorithm. When the length of DFTs is prime, our PFCFTs reduce
to CFFTs. When the length has co-prime factors, since the sub-DFTs have much
shorter lengths, this allows us to use CSE to significantly reduce their
additive complexity. In comparison to previously proposed fast Fourier
transforms, our PFCFTs achieve reduced overall complexity when the length of
DFTs is at least 255, and the improvement significantly increases as the length
grows. This approach also enables us to propose efficient DFTs with very long
length (e.g., 4095-point), first efficient DFTs of such lengths in the
literature. Finally, our PFCFTs are also advantageous for hardware
implementation due to their regular structure.
