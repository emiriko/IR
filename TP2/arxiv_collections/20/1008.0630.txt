The orthogonality of cat and displaced cat states, underlying Heisenberg
limited measurement in quantum metrology, is studied in the limit of large
number of states. The asymptotic expression for the corresponding state overlap
function, controlled by the sub-Planck structures arising from phase space
interference, is obtained exactly. The validity of large phase space support,
in which context the asymptotic limit is achieved, is discussed in detail. For
large number of coherent states, uniformly located on a circle, it identically
matches with the diffraction pattern for a circular ring with uniform angular
source strength. This is in accordance with the van Cittert-Zernike theorem,
where the overlap function, similar to the mutual coherence function matches
with a diffraction pattern.
