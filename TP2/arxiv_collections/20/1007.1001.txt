This paper examines an averaging technique applied to the transport equations
as an alternative to vanishing viscosity. Such techniques have been shown to be
valid shock-regularizations of the Burgers equation and the Euler equations,
but has yet to be applied to the similar transport equations. However, for this
system, the classical notion of weak solutions is not always sufficient thus a
more general notion of a distribution solution containing Dirac-delta functions
must be introduced. Moreover, the distribution solution to the Riemann problem
is known to be the weak-$*$ limit of the viscous perturbed transport equations
as viscosity vanishes. In comparison to the classical method of vanishing
viscosity, the Riemann problem is examined for the averaged transport equation
and it is shown that the same delta-shock distribution solution is captured as
filtering vanishes. Both mathematical and physical motivation are provided for
the averaging techniques considered including an existence and uniqueness
result of solutions within the class of smooth initial conditions.
