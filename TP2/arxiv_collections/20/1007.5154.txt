Deep, wide, near-infrared imaging surveys provide an opportunity to study the
clustering of various galaxy populations at high redshift on the largest
physical scales. We have selected $1<z<2$ extremely red objects (EROs) and
$1<z<3$ distant red galaxies (DRGs) in SA22 from the near-infrared photometric
data of the UKIDSS Deep eXtragalactic Survey (DXS) and $gri$ optical data from
CTIO covering 3.3~deg$^2$. This is the largest contiguous area studied to
sufficient depth to select these distant galaxies to date. The angular
two-point correlation functions and the real space correlation lengths of each
population are measured and show that both populations are strongly clustered
and that the clustering cannot be parameterised with a single power law. The
correlation function of EROs shows a double power law with the inflection at
$\sim$ 0.6$'$--1.2$'$ (0.6--1.2~h$^{-1}$~Mpc). The bright EROs ($K<18.8$) show
stronger clustering on small scales but similar clustering on larger scales,
whereas redder EROs show stronger clustering on all scales. Clustering
differences between EROs that are old passively evolved galaxies (OGs) and
dusty star-forming galaxies (DGs), on the basis of their $J-K$ colour, are also
investigated. The clustering of $r-K$ EROs are compared with that of $i-K$ EROs
and the differences are consistent with their expected redshift distributions.
The correlation function of DRGs is also well described by a double power law
and consistent with previous studies once the effects of the broader redshift
distribution our selection of DRGs returns are taken into account. We also
perform the same analysis on smaller sub-fields to investigate the impact of
cosmic variance on the derived clustering properties. Currently this study is
the most representative measurement of the clustering of massive galaxies at
$z>1$ on large scales.
