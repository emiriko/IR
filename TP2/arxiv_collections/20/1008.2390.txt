Quantum computers can break the RSA and El Gamal public-key cryptosystems,
since they can factor integers and extract discrete logarithms. If we believe
that quantum computers will someday become a reality, we would like to have
\emph{post-quantum} cryptosystems which can be implemented today with classical
computers, but which will remain secure even in the presence of quantum
attacks.
  In this article we show that the McEliece cryptosystem over
\emph{well-permuted, well-scrambled} linear codes resists precisely the attacks
to which the RSA and El Gamal cryptosystems are vulnerable---namely, those
based on generating and measuring coset states. This eliminates the approach of
strong Fourier sampling on which almost all known exponential speedups by
quantum algorithms are based. Specifically, we show that the natural case of
the Hidden Subgroup Problem to which the McEliece cryptosystem reduces cannot
be solved by strong Fourier sampling, or by any measurement of a coset state.
We start with recent negative results on quantum algorithms for Graph
Isomorphism, which are based on particular subgroups of size two, and extend
them to subgroups of arbitrary structure, including the automorphism groups of
linear codes. This allows us to obtain the first rigorous results on the
security of the McEliece cryptosystem in the face of quantum adversaries,
strengthening its candidacy for post-quantum cryptography.
