We present a systematical experimental investigation of an unusual transport
phenomenon observed in two dimensional electron gases in Si/SiGe
heterostructures under integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) conditions. This
phenomenon emerges under specific experimental conditions and in different
material systems. It is commonly referred to as Hall resistance overshoot,
however, lacks a consistent explanation so far. Based on our experimental
findings we are able to develop a model that accounts for all of our
observations in the framework of a screening theory for the IQHE. Within this
model the origin of the overshoot is attributed to a transport regime where
current is confined to co-existing evanescent incompressible strips of
different filling factors.
