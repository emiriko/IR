We report the discovery of several large "propeller" moons in the outer part
of Saturn's A ring, objects large enough to be followed over the 5-year
duration of the Cassini mission. These are the first objects ever discovered
that can be tracked as individual moons, but do not orbit in empty space. We
infer sizes up to 1--2 km for the unseen moonlets at the center of the
propeller-shaped structures, though many structural and photometric properties
of propeller structures remain unclear. Finally, we demonstrate that some
propellers undergo sustained non-keplerian orbit motion. (Note: This arXiv
version of the paper contains supplementary tables that were left out of the
ApJL version due to lack of space).
