We present the electroweak spectrum for the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model at the one-loop level, e.g.\ the masses of Higgs bosons,
sleptons, charginos and neutralinos. For the numerical evaluation we present a
mSUGRA variant with non-universal Higgs mass parameters squared and we compare
our results with existing ones in the literature. Moreover, we briefly discuss
the implications of our results for the calculation of the relic density.
