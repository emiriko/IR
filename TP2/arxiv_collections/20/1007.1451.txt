X-ray observations of EXO 0748-676 during thermonuclear bursts revealed a set
of narrow absorption lines that potentially originate from the stellar
photosphere. The identification of these lines with particular atomic
transitions led to the measurement of the surface gravitational redshift of the
neutron star and to constraints on its mass and radius. However, the recent
detection of 552 Hz oscillations at 15% rms amplitude revealed the spin
frequency of the neutron star and brought into question the consistency of such
a rapid spin with the narrow width of the absorption lines. Here, we calculate
the amplitudes of burst oscillations and the width of absorption lines emerging
from the surface of a rapidly rotating neutron star for a wide range of model
parameters. We show that no combination of neutron-star and geometric
parameters can simultaneously reproduce the narrowness of the absorption lines,
the high amplitude of the oscillations, and the observed flux at the time the
oscillations were detected. We, therefore, conclude that the observed
absorption lines are unlikely to originate from the surface of this neutron
star.
