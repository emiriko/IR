If the standard model of particle interactions is extended to include a
neutral SU(2)_N gauge factor, with SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y x SU(2)_N
embedded in E_6 or [SU(3)]^3, a conserved generalized R parity may appear. As a
result, we have the first example of a possible dark-matter candidate X_1 which
is a non-Abelain vector boson. Using current data, its mass is predicted to be
less than about 1 TeV. The associated Z' of this model, as well as some
signatures of the Higgs sector, should then be observable at the LHC (Large
Hadron Collider).
