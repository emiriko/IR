The finite-temperature magnetic properties of Fe$_x$Pd$_{1-x}$ and
Co$_x$Pt$_{1-x}$ alloys have been investigated. It is shown that the
temperature-dependent magnetic behaviour of alloys, composed of originally
magnetic and non-magnetic elements, cannot be described properly unless the
coupling between magnetic moments at magnetic atoms (Fe,Co) mediated through
the interactions with induced magnetic moments of non-magnetic atoms (Pd,Pt) is
included. A scheme for the calculation of the Curie temperature ($T_C$) for
this type of systems is presented which is based on the extended Heisenberg
Hamiltonian with the appropriate exchange parameters $J_{ij}$ obtained from
{\em ab-initio} electronic structure calculations. Within the present study the
KKR Green's function method has been used to calculate the $J_{ij}$ parameters.
A comparison of the obtained Curie temperatures for Fe$_x$Pd$_{1-x}$ and
Co$_x$Pt$_{1-x}$ alloys with experimental data shows rather good agreement.
