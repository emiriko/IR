Covariant-contravariant simulation and conformance simulation generalize
plain simulation and try to capture the fact that it is not always the case
that "the larger the number of behaviors, the better". We have previously
studied their logical characterizations and in this paper we present the
axiomatizations of the preorders defined by the new simulation relations and
their induced equivalences. The interest of our results lies in the fact that
the axiomatizations help us to know the new simulations better, understanding
in particular the role of the contravariant characteristics and their interplay
with the covariant ones; moreover, the axiomatizations provide us with a
powerful tool to (algebraically) prove results of the corresponding semantics.
But we also consider our results interesting from a metatheoretical point of
view: the fact that the covariant-contravariant simulation equivalence is
indeed ground axiomatizable when there is no action that exhibits both a
covariant and a contravariant behaviour, but becomes non-axiomatizable whenever
we have together actions of that kind and either covariant or contravariant
actions, offers us a new subtle example of the narrow border separating
axiomatizable and non-axiomatizable semantics. We expect that by studying these
examples we will be able to develop a general theory separating axiomatizable
and non-axiomatizable semantics.
