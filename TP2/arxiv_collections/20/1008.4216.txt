We present a current best estimate of the integrated near-infrared (NIR)
extragalactic background light (EBL) attributable to resolved galaxies in J, H,
and Ks. Our results in units of nW m-2 sr-1 are 11.7+5.6 -2.6 in J, 11.5+4.5
-1.5 in H and 10.0+2.8 -0.8 in Ks. We derive these new limits by combining our
deep wide-field NIR photometry from five widely separated fields with other
studies from the literature to create a galaxy counts sample that is highly
complete and has good counting statistics out to JHKs ~ 27-28. As part of this
effort we present new ultradeep Ks-band galaxy counts from 22 hours of
observations with the Multi Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (MOIRCS)
instrument on the Subaru Telescope. We use this MOIRCS Ks-band mosaic to
estimate the total missing flux from sources beyond our detection limits. Our
new limits to the NIR EBL are in basic agreement with, but 10 - 20% higher than
previous estimates, bringing them into better agreement with estimates of the
total NIR EBL (resolved + unresolved sources) obtained from TeV gamma-ray
opacity measurements and recent direct measurements of the total NIR EBL. We
examine field to field variations in our photometry to show that the integrated
light from galaxies is isotropic to within uncertainties, consistent with the
expected large-scale isotropy of the EBL. Our data also allow for a robust
estimate of the NIR light from Galactic stars, which we find to be 14.7 +/- 2.4
in J, 10.1 +/- 1.9 in H and 7.6 +/- 1.8 in Ks in units of nW m-2 sr-1.
