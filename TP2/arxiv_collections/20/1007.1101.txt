We consider a one dimensional ferromagnetic Ising spin system with
interactions that correspond to a $1/r^2$ long range perturbation of the usual
Kac model. We apply a coarse graining procedure, widely used for
higher-dimensional finite range Kac potentials, to describe the basic
properties of the system and the relation with the mean field theory.
