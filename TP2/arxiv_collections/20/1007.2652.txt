We present a unified formalism for describing chemical reaction rates of
trapped, ultracold molecules. This formalism reduces the scattering to its
essential features, namely, a propagation of the reactant molecules through a
gauntlet of long-range forces before they ultimately encounter one another,
followed by a probability for the reaction to occur once they do. In this way,
the electric-field dependence should be readily parametrized in terms of a pair
of fitting parameters (along with a $C_6$ coefficient) for each asymptotic
value of partial wave quantum numbers $|L,M \rangle$. From this, the electric
field dependence of the collision rates follows automatically. We present
examples for reactive species such as KRb, and non-reactive species, such as
RbCs.
