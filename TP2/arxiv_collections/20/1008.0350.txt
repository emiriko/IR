A simple, general and practically exact method, Entanglement Perturbation
Theory (EPT), is formulated to calculate the ground states of 2D macroscopic
quantum systems with translational symmetry. An emphasis will be placed on the
applicability of EPT to fermions. We will discuss some preliminary evidences
which indicate a potential of EPT.
