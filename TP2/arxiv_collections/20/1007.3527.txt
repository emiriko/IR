We present a theory of excitonic processes in gate controlled graphene
quantum dots. The dependence of the energy gap on shape, size and edge for
graphene quantum dots with up to a million atoms is predicted. Using a
combination of tight-binding, Hartree-Fock and configuration interaction
methods, we show that triangular graphene quantum dots with zigzag edges
exhibit optical transitions simultaneously in the THz, visible and UV spectral
ranges, determined by strong electron-electron and excitonic interactions. The
relationship between optical properties and finite magnetic moment and charge
density controlled by an external gate is predicted.
