We report the first unambiguous observation of a fractional quantum Hall
state in the Landau level of a two-dimensional hole sample at the filling
factor $\nu=8/3$. We identified this state by a quantized Hall resistance and
an activated temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistance and found an
energy gap of 40 mK. To our surprise the particle-hole conjugate state at
filling factor $\nu=7/3$ in our sample does not develop down to 6.9 mK. This
observation is contrary to that in electron samples in which the 7/3 state is
typically more stable than the 8/3 state. We present evidence that the
asymmetry between the 7/3 and 8/3 states in our hole sample is due to Landau
level mixing.
