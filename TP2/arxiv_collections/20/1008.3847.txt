An experiment demonstrating nonlocality at detection is proposed. A
single-photon Michelson-Morley experiment could be performed under exactly the
same conditions as well. Hence, the two experiments are "loophole free" to the
same extent. It is argued that both quantum theory and relativity share the
same experimental basis and derive from the same principles. Relativity and the
quantum are two aspects of one and the same physical description of the world.
