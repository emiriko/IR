We suggest an alternative mathematical model for the electron in dimension
1+2. We think of our (1+2)-dimensional spacetime as an elastic continuum whose
material points can experience no displacements, only rotations. This framework
is a special case of the Cosserat theory of elasticity. Rotations of material
points are described mathematically by attaching to each geometric point an
orthonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases called the coframe.
As the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we choose a coframe and a
density. We then add an extra (third) spatial dimension, extend our coframe and
density into dimension 1+3, choose a conformally invariant Lagrangian
proportional to axial torsion squared, roll up the extra dimension into a
circle so as to incorporate mass and return to our original (1+2)-dimensional
spacetime by separating out the extra coordinate. The main result of our paper
is the theorem stating that our model is equivalent to the Dirac equation in
dimension 1+2. In the process of analyzing our model we also establish an
abstract result, identifying a class of nonlinear second order partial
differential equations which reduce to pairs of linear first order equations.
