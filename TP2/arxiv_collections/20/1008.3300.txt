Experimental observations of typical kinds of synchronization transitions are
reported in unidirectionally coupled time-delay electronic circuits with a
threshold nonlinearity and two time delays, namely feedback delay $\tau_1$ and
coupling delay $\tau_2$. We have observed transitions from anticipatory to lag
via complete synchronization and their inverse counterparts with excitatory and
inhibitory couplings, respectively, as a function of the coupling delay
$\tau_2$. The anticipating and lag times depend on the difference between the
feedback and the coupling delays. A single stability condition for all the
different types of synchronization is found to be valid as the stability
condition is independent of both the delays. Further, the existence of
different kinds of synchronizations observed experimentally is corroborated by
numerical simulations, and from the changes in the Lyapunov exponents of the
coupled time-delay systems.
