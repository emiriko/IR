In this paper, we study the production of spin-one color-octet resonances
(colorons) at hadron colliders in a model independent way. We use dijets data
measured by CDF (at \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV and L=1.13$ 1/pb) and ATLAS (at
\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and L=315 1/nb) collaborations at the Tevatron and the LHC
respetively to impose limits on the coupling of colorons to fermions. We show
that CDF data still produce the more stringent limits on the coloron coupling
constant.
