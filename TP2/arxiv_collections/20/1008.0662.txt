An experimental study on the interaction of heavy, highly charged, and
energetic ions (52 MeV Ni^13+) with pure H2O, pure CO2 and mixed H2O:CO2
astrophysical ice analogs is presented. This analysis aims to simulate the
chemical and the physicochemical interactions induced by heavy cosmic rays
inside dense and cold astrophysical environments such as molecular clouds or
protostellar clouds. The measurements were performed at the heavy ion
accelerator GANIL (Grand Accelerateur National d'Ions Lourds in Caen, France).
The gas samples were deposited onto a CsI substrate at 13 K. In-situ analysis
was performed by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer at different
fluences. Radiolysis yields of the produced species were quantified. The
dissociation cross sections of pure H2O and CO2 ices are 1.1 and 1.9E-13 cm^2,
respectively. In the case of mixed H2O:CO2 (10:1) the dissociation cross
sections of both species are about 1E-13 cm^2. The measured sputtering yield of
pure CO2 ice is 2.2E4 molec/ion. After a fluence of 2-3E12 ions/cm^2 the CO2/CO
ratio becomes roughly constant (~0.1), independent of the of initial CO2/H2O
ratio. A similar behavior is observed for the H2O2/H2O ratio which stabilizes
at 0.01, independent of the initial H2O column density or relative abundance.
