The localized energy estimate for the wave equation is known to be a fairly
robust measure of dispersion. Recent analogs on the $(1+3)$-dimensional
Schwarzschild space-time have played a key role in a number of subsequent
results, including a proof of Price's law. In this article, we explore similar
localized energy estimates for wave equations on $(1+n)$-dimensional
hyperspherical Schwarzschild space-times.
