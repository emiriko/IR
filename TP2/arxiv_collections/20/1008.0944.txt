Manufacturing variation in the micro fabrication process inevitably alters
the size of the designed structure and thereafter influences the performance of
devices to some extent. A good knowledge of this effect will help the design
and optimization of the devices. In this letter, we propose an analytical model
to investigate the effect of manufacturing variation on the individual
resonator in a chain of coupled micro mechanical resonators. The model is also
used in a reverse manner to estimate the possible range of manufacturing
variation based on the designed value and the measured frequency response.
