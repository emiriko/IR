For n even, we prove Pozhidaev's conjecture on the existence of associative
enveloping algebras for simple n-Lie algebras. More generally, for n even and
any (n+1)-dimensional n-Lie algebra L, we construct a universal associative
enveloping algebra U(L) and show that the natural map from L to U(L) is
injective. We use noncommutative Grobner bases to present U(L) as a quotient of
the free associative algebra on a basis of L and to obtain a monomial basis of
U(L). In the last section, we provide computational evidence that the
construction of U(L) is much more difficult for n odd.
