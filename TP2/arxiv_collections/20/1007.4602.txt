Nowadays, science has been coming into a new paradigm, called data-intensive
science. While current studies of the new phenomenon focused on building up
infrastructure for this new paradigm, yet a few studies concern users of
scientific data, particularly their usage practices in the newly emerging
paradigm, even though the importance of understanding users' work flow and
practices has been summoned. This study endeavors to improve our understanding
of users' data usage behavior through a content analysis of publications in a
frequently cited new paradigm-related project, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
We found that (1) nearly half studies used one data source only. A few studies
exploited three or more data sources; (2) the number of objects that were
analyzed in SDSS publications is in all scales from one digit to millions; (3)
different paper types may affect the data usage patterns; (4) Users are not
only consumers of scientific data. They are producers too; (5) studies that can
use multiple large scale data sources are relative rare. Issues of data
provenance, trust, and usability may prevent researchers from doing this kind
of research.
