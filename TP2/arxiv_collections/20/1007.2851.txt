The black hole (BH)-bulge correlations have greatly influenced the last
decade of effort to understand galaxy evolution. Current knowledge of these
correlations is limited predominantly to high BH masses (M_BH> 10^8 M_sun) that
can be measured using direct stellar, gas, and maser kinematics. These objects,
however, do not represent the demographics of more typical L< L* galaxies. This
study transcends prior limitations to probe BHs that are an order of magnitude
lower in mass, using BH mass measurements derived from the dynamics of H_2O
megamasers in circumnuclear disks. The masers trace the Keplerian rotation of
circumnuclear molecular disks starting at radii of a few tenths of a pc from
the central BH. Modeling of the rotation curves, presented by Kuo et al.
(2010), yields BH masses with exquisite precision. We present stellar velocity
dispersion measurements for a sample of nine megamaser disk galaxies based on
long-slit observations using the B&C spectrograph on the Dupont telescope and
the DIS spectrograph on the 3.5m telescope at Apache Point. We also perform
bulge-to-disk decomposition of a subset of five of these galaxies with SDSS
imaging. The maser galaxies as a group fall below the M_BH-sigma* relation
defined by elliptical galaxies. We show, now with very precise BH mass
measurements, that the low-scatter power-law relation between M_BH and sigma*
seen in elliptical galaxies is not universal. The elliptical galaxy M_BH-sigma*
relation cannot be used to derive the BH mass function at low mass or the
zeropoint for active BH masses. The processes (perhaps BH self-regulation or
minor merging) that operate at higher mass have not effectively established an
M_BH-sigma* relation in this low-mass regime.
