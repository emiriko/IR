We demonstrate the distribution of polarization entangled photons of
wavelength 810 nm through standard telecom fibers. This technique allows
quantum communication protocols to be performed over established fiber
infrastructure, and makes use of the smaller and better performing setups
available around 800 nm, as compared to those which use telecom wavelengths
around 1550 nm. We examine the excitation and subsequent quenching of
higher-order spatial modes in telecom fibers up to 6 km in length, and perform
a distribution of high quality entanglement (visibility 95.6%). Finally, we
demonstrate quantum key distribution using entangled 810 nm photons over a 4.4
km long installed telecom fiber link.
